","Shark Tale is doubtlessly going to be endlessly compared to Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"". It is unfortunate that Shark Tale comes out the lesser of the two movies, but truly comparing the two is generally a fruitless exercise.<br/><br/>Opening with a detailed dive into the city of the fish Shark Tale presents a world of sight gags and moderate puns. From the star fish walk of fame through the dolphin police, through to the shots of ""the top of the reef"", the sequence is a bustling hive of activity. At this point I would make one valid comparison with Nemo - the graphics. Shark Tale fails to really seem as if anything is happening underwater. Yes, there are fish in the shot and yes everything intellectually should be under the sea, but where Nemo oozed and flowed in a very fluid vista Shark Tale shows colour and spectacle, but without that organic ocean feeling. This is not to say Shark Tale's graphic work is bad, simply that it does not feel waterborne.<br/><br/>With that aside, the cartoon images in Shark Tale are well presented, with the anthropomorphic fish taking on the facial characteristics of their voice actors. Never has (or will) a fish ever look more like Wil Smith , or acted like him. This is Wil Smith in full Fresh Prince wise-cracking mode made piscine in Oscar. Renee Zellwegger is instantly recognisable in her fish counterpart Angie, as is the vampy Angela Jolie (Lola).<br/><br/>The story itself revolves around Oscar's passage from an unhappy, dreaming, nobody to a famous, unhappy, somebody to a happy nobody. It's a generic, oft-repeated tale, albeit set in a world full of mafioso sharks, vengeful shrimp, and whales with poor personal hygiene.<br/><br/>As such, the story itself is both predictable and can be safely ignored. You can feel each step of the way long before it hits the screen. It has no surprises, and so the movie resorts to banter and set pieces to amuse.<br/><br/>It doesn't often succeed with these. Of the set pieces the shark funeral is by far the best part of the movie. It is hilarious and somehow moving at the same time. Lenny (Jack Black) and Don Lino (Robert De Niro) make an amusing scene in a restaurant debating with the food. The remainder, including Oscar's big fight scene, are generally uninvolving unless you have an interest in keeping an ear and eye out for the multitude of pop references - many of which are simply thrown in for no reason other than that somebody thought they should be there. Oscar's non sequiturs at the end of the great shark fight are particularly pointless and unfunny.<br/><br/>Some in jokes and references do work - having Ziggy Marley solemnly tell Oscar (Smith) that he's singing reggae wrong is clever. Some gags also work - the pizza ordering Octopus is a gem.<br/><br/>But despite playing heavily on racial stereotypes the movie as a whole feels rather bland - as if it was designed by marketers and a committee rather than by people who had a funny tale they wanted to tell.<br/><br/>The actors supplying the voices vary in effectiveness. Wil Smith is effectively Wil Smith, love it or hate it. Zellwegger gives a decent, if shallow, performance as the love interest, and Jolie's Lola is barely on screen long enough for her to make an impact. De Niro makes the movie as Don Lino, shark godfather, and without his presence it would be fair to say that the movie would simply be too weak to sustain interest.<br/><br/>The music is very MTV, and the end song sequence is atrocious - though kids will probably love it, parents should bring ear plugs for the time when Oscar releases ""Missy and Christina"" until you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>Shark Tale offers an amusing hour and a half for the children but a rather predictable and only occasionally amusing time for adults. It lacks the magic, sparkle, and dare I say bite, that was so desperately needed.<br/><br/>Six starfish out of a possible 10."
"Avwillfan89","10","19","24","4 April 2010"," Awfully underrated
","This animated story is set down in the ocean with the main characters as fish and mollusks. The story is about a unsatisfied tongue scrubber, Oscar, who works at the whale wash, owned by a blowfish, Mr Sykes, who has connected deals with local mob boss Don Lino. Both of them are literally in deep with the sharks. Oscar owes a huge and overdue debt to them, and his co-worker Angie, secretly in love with him, offers him the money to cover it, but he blows it all on a seahorse. Meanwhile, Don Lino is concerned about the image of his son, Lenny, who refuses to eat meat. He sends his other son, Frankie, to teach him how to hunt. They spot Oscar being tortured by Sykes's jellyfish henchmen, Ernie and Bernie and Frankie sends Lenny after him to gobble him up, but he just can't bring himself to eat a fish. Enraged, Frankie speeds after Oscar and is stopped by an anchor that lands on him and fatally wounds him. Lenny, distraught with grief and guilt, swims away. Ernie and Bernie then find Oscar beside the dead shark and assume that he killed him. Oscar now realizes he can take advantage of this and makes up a story that instantly brings him fame and fortune, and winning the heart of a beautiful but shallow lion fish, Lola. However, Don Lino, angered over the loss of his son, vows to find a way to get to him and make him pay.<br/><br/>The message basically shows that Oscar, not knowing that Angie loves him, doesn't realize that he never needed to be at the top of the reef to feel good. Anyone who has good lives, making a good living and hanging out with friends, always want more out of life, and only once they loose the good life they had before, do they realize it. I think a lot of people can relate to that. This film has the best cast ever. The fact that all these brilliant actors are together in one film is what makes it worthwhile to watch. Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Martin Scorsese, Angelina Jolie, Renée Zelweger and Jack Black. I loved this film so much that I became obsessed with all the actors who appeared in it. It introduced me to Mafia films, which of course contained some of the best in all of film history. It also has an excellent soundtrack full of brilliant music, which in my opinion, is a thing a great movie has to have.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this picture has now become terribly underrated, so much that people don't even want to hear about it anymore, let alone praise it. After Shrek, Dreamworks produced this great film, then a second Shrek (not as good as the first one, but better than the third) and Madagascar. The latter, though compared to Shark Tale, was a disappointment, it became one of the last last good movies that Dreamworks Animation released. They just seemed to have lost it now. Even the acclaimed How To Train Your Dragon, which was much better than some of the previous Dreamwork films, lacks anything exceptional. Only Kung Fu Panda and Megamind seems to capture the real essence of Shark Tale and the first Shrek. They always mention Shrek and Madagascar in their new films, but never Shark Tale, which is a real shame. When you look it like that, there's really nothing bad about it. It's a funny comedy that really lifts your spirits. Pixar often continues makes outstanding movies, but I'll always remember this one as the film that introduced me to the real masterpieces of cinema."
"hanik_1999","9","50","73","14 June 2005"," Those other reviews are bull; this movie is great!
","I have to confess my shock at seeing the 5.9/10 average rating for this movie and overall mediocre reviews. This movie is great! And I'm not a kid, either...I'm 26 years old and thoroughly enjoyed this movie at the age of 25. The soundtrack is unbelievable and fits in seamlessly with the action and comedy of the movie. You really have to hear Mary J. Blige's rendition of Cheryl Lynn's classic disco anthem, ""Got to Be Real."" Anyway, besides the fantastic soundtrack, every character in this movie matches beautifully with his or her celebrity voice. I particularly enjoyed Will Smith's and Martin Scorcese's characters; brilliantly done. Really, if you're looking for a fun, enjoyable movie that you can laugh and even dance along to, this is the movie for you. Young and old alike should enjoy this. I've seen it 3 times, and always have a good time watching it. Watch it!"
"baba44713","5","84","134","21 December 2004"," Not too bad, but not too good either.
","Round two of the Pixar/Dreamworks choose-a-theme competition scores once again for Pixar.<br/><br/>Remember when a few years ago there were two animated ant movies to choose from? I think they even came at the same time in the theaters in my country. One was AntZ, the other was A Bug's Life. The first one was rumoured to be more suited to adults, the other a kiddie movie. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie-like appearance. AntZ were just plain dull.<br/><br/>Pixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. Dreamworks builds his scripts on pop-culture references and more adult themes, and while it works sometimes (Shrek was fantastic), at other times it just falls flat.<br/><br/>Some say it's unfair to compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, them being totally different movies with the only matching characteristic being antropomorphic fish, but it seems that the comparison is inevitable. It's the ants thing all over again. Finding Nemo was simply wonderful, great movie with a perfect sense of humour and memorable characters. Sure, they were cute and cuddly, but they had a soul.<br/><br/>Shark Tale, again, tries to appeal to the adults, but this time the results are even worse. The characters are not so important as the cast is, even so much that we are being sledgehammered on the head in who's playing who. A word to the wise - I don't care how big the names doing the voicework are, I want to immerse in the movie's story. When I saw Shrek, I didn't see Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy there, I saw Shrek and Donkey. Here I see De Niro, Smith, Scorsese and so on. At one point I even caught myself wondering why the other fish keep calling Will Smith ""Oscar"".<br/><br/>As for the story, it kind of drags along. I couldn't really sympathize with the lead character - he is at the same time stupid and so full of himself that I didn't care about his motivations or the messes he got himself into. Also, somehow the story didn't map so well in the underwater world. What is the Shark mafia exactly ? Are they supposed to be predators or criminals? Basically the mafia thing is here only to serve as a playground for mob-movie references, but it serves no purpose story-wise. Also, the entire world seems very unbelievable. Flahing electrical neon signs? Fire hydrants? It actually backfires, since instead of getting a kick out of fishes living like humans, mostly you feel like you're watching an alien movie, with the aliens resembling our world's fishes in some ways.<br/><br/>All in all, I did enjoy the movie, but only in the sense that I didn't feel cheated out of my money. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop-culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring. But when I remember that after Nemo or Incredibles I was smiling even a few hours after the movie, then I see that Shark Tale ain't what it possibly could be. It's just a popcorn movie, easily forgettable. And rightfully so."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","17","23","10 May 2009"," Nice to look at, but I have seen superior animated films...
","I did like Shark Tale, but there is a lot wrong with it. I did think the animation was very nicely done, and I liked the references to Jaws and Godfather. But I do think that Finding Nemo was much better than this. Shark Tale could have been a great film, had it not been devoid of humour and heart. My first problem with the film was Will Smith. He tries to be funny, but as the film progresses, he gets tiresome, and at times you feel like you want to reach into the screen and put a hand over his mouth. There were times when the script was funny, and there were some nice ideas, but the pace of the whole film was uneven. The characters could have been developed a lot more, particularly Lenny(a nice surprise from Jack Black), and whereas there were a number of nice visual jokes, there is some very over-familiar material in the script. Kids may find the sharks a bit frightening, and adults won't find much to enjoy, with the exception of the talented voice cast, such as Angelina Jolie, whose Lola(a very beautiful fish) was one of the better characters, Rennee Zellwegger, who deserved better than she was given and Robert DeNiro, whose shark was just a caricature of the Godfather. Though it is Martin Scorsesse who gives the most entertaining vocal contribution. And I did like the music score. All in all, it is nice to look at, but there are some parts of the film that aren't as interesting as intended. I did like the film, but I was kind of confused at who it was aimed at. 6/10 Bethany Cox."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","40","61","12 February 2005"," Adults will like this movie better than kids.
","It could be just me but I thought that the humor in this movie was perfect. I laughed lot's of times throughout the movie and was very entertained by it. I however think that this movie will not be loved by young children, they simply will not be able to understand most of the jokes and the movie also lacks some 'likeable Disney type of characters' for them.<br/><br/>I never was really interested to go and watch this movie since it got lot's of bad reviews and I thought that the trailer looked horrible and very unfunny. I however decided to pick up this movie nevertheless because I was interested in how the famous voice cast would pull off, Martin Scorsese in particular. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie. the humor was spot on and I was entertained the whole time. I know lot's of people probably are going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was even better and more entertaining than any of the two Shrek movies.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a whole lot of story and is pretty average in every way. I however feel that this is one of this movies were the story really is secondary. The movie has your average love story, in which Angelina Jolie's character is really unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing, in my opinion but watching Robert De Niro's character scream and shout and giving orders to Martin Scorsese's character on the other hand was absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>Will Smith was a great main character and just as entertaining as Eddie Murphy in an animated movie.<br/><br/>I predict that the music in this movie will be absolutely hated in 20 years by now, just as much as I hate '80's music in movies now. No, I really didn't liked the songs in this movie mainly because in unlike the Shrek movies, they aren't any evergreens.<br/><br/>If you plan to buy this movie for your kids, think twice, you're probably better of watching ""Finding Nemo"" with them. If you're a adult or young adult that likes animated movies, this movie might be worth your time and money, although the humor in this movie is really a matter of taste.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Victorious_One","9","33","50","11 September 2005"," Deserves a Higher Rating
","I just can't understand why ""Shark Tale"" is so underrated. I have watched this movie about 3 times and yet, I still can't get enough of it. The fact is that the characters were very entertaining, the animation was brilliant, and the story was great and was sending messages along with it, such as accept your destiny, be happy with who you are, accept others for who they are, and you don't have to live ""on top of the reef"" to be a ""somebody."" This movie also exposes us to the pop culture. What more does this movie need to to make it a good one? I mean this movie has it all: laughs and everything. Then why is it so underrated? I really don't know. I do know though, that ""Shark Tale"" is one of the best movie I have ever watched."
"Stampsfightclub","7","4","4","27 October 2006"," Predictable but funny and engaging animation for the family
","With an all star cast including Smith (bad boys) De Niro (Taxi Driver) Zellweger (Bridget Jones) and director Scoursese (Goodfellas) this 2004 was lined up to be a smash and despite its criticism I enjoyed watching the amazing effects, cheesy jokes and acceptable plot. <br/><br/>The cast lend their voices to the spirited sea creatures. The beginning of the story is really amazing. A typical animation move, taking audiences around the scenery. With many jokes as 'play on words' e.g. Coral Cola the audience are awarded cheap laughs and wonder how the producers come up with these ideas, its conventional but I believe its a technique that all audiences appreciate. <br/><br/>Its an inconsistent plot with many engaging scenes but many questionable scenes. After the beginning you wondered is Smith's cool character Oscar was being given too much camera time. Once Zellweger's conventional boy-fish wanting fish came into the story did a sense of predictability arise. <br/><br/>However its one of those films you know is awful but you enjoy it anyway. It is engaging because you wonder how the characters are going to fare with each other. The relationship between the under sea creatures is healthy and believable but always enjoyable to observe, despite maybe some people saying its predictable, clichéd etc. <br/><br/>It's a slow moving story with typical human like ideologies put forth by director Bergerson. Money, family loyalty, betrayal, friendship and trust are all encoded so audience's can appreciate the film. <br/><br/>There are a few twists used, perhaps in the wrong way but are still interesting to observe. The ending is atrocious. Never in my life have I seen a film end so badly. I was shaking my head and couldn't believe it. The soundtrack to the film is amazing. Upbeat energetic pop and reggae music are used for a variety of uses, mainly to encourage the scene to be enjoyable. <br/><br/>There is never doubting the effects which are stunning. If you want any proof then observe De Niro's shark character which looks exactly like him. <br/><br/>a film for the whole family - not the best animation but still enjoyable for cheap laughs and funny characters"
"filmbuff-36","4","118","204","2 December 2004"," Lifeless product of Hollywood groupthink, devoid of even the slightest inspiration
","Had ""Shark Tale"" had even an iota of the wit and charm that seems to have little trouble finding its way into Pixar's creations, the movie might have been more enjoyable. At the least the filmmakers could have snuck in some funny social commentary through the veil of animation.<br/><br/>What we have instead is an urban, glib, lifeless product that is market-tested and ready for consumption. An empty ghetto-fabulous morality tale loaded with pop culture references and plenty of bling-bling but no heart.<br/><br/>Under the ocean, Oscar (voice of Will Smith) is a tongue-scrubber at a ""whale-wash"" and part-time hustler. He wishes for a better life, hoping to swim his way to the top of the fish social ladder, though his coworker Angie (voice of Renee Zellweger) thinks he should be happy with who he is, and tries to subtly drop hints that she's quite taken with him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, great white shark and local crime boss Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) is planning to turn his family business over to his two sons, Frankie and Lenny. But Lenny (voice of Jack Black) is harboring some serious issues concerning eating other fish, and the godfather is worried his weak son with reflect poorly on him.<br/><br/>Oscar has problems. In debt to his boss Sykes (voice of Martin Scorsese), he soon ends up in hot water. However, fate runs him smack into Frankie and Lenny. During the scuffle, an anchor accidentally kills Frankie and Oscar is mistakenly given credit for the kill. Now a media celebrity for being a ""shark slayer,"" Oscar rides his status all the way to the top, with Sykes managing his interests and the sharks fuming that their top spot in the food chain is quickly losing its power.<br/><br/>Situations soon escalate and Oscar and Lenny reach an agreement: if they fake a battle and Oscar emerges triumphant, he can keep his credibility as a shark slayer and Lenny can start a new life.<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" openly references ""The Godfather"" and ""Jaws"" at every opportunity, which in and of itself isn't too bad except that so little is made of the main plot itself that the whole move feels like a patchwork of other, better movies, just with a meaningless hip-hop attitude. The special effects are up to par but there's nothing really special about them. The audience needs a story and characters, not just choreographed dance sequences and goofy product placements.<br/><br/>All this might have been negligible had the movie actually been funny. This, sadly, is not the case. I only recorded one good laugh during the screening I attended, and that involved a shark voiced by Peter Falk whose flatulence had the expected effect on a henchmen. When a fart joke is the best you have to offer, then you've got serious problems.<br/><br/>The story also steals shamelessly from the 1942 Disney cartoon ""The Reluctant Dragon,"" which featured a fixed battle between a loudmouth braggart knight and a pacifist dragon to keep the locals off both their backs. That story was at least short and cute, neither of which can be said about this debacle.<br/><br/>Along with the plot, voice acting is pretty lifeless as well. Smith gets to indulge his ego, playing his own persona on screen once again, this time in fish form. De Niro and Scorsese seem to be having fun spoofing their own tough guy roles, but that's about it from them. The biggest surprise is how much of a laid-back performance Black gives. His trademark manic desperation is nowhere to be seen, playing instead a shockingly normal character. Had he cut loose, the scenes he's in might have been more enjoyable. What's stranger is his hiding of his vegetarian leanings from his dad is handled like an allegory for a gay person coming out to his parents.<br/><br/>When is Hollywood going to realize it doesn't matter how many famous actors you get to do voices for your characters; if the story sucks, then no amount of acting talent is going to save it? There are three Academy Award winners in this cast, just don't use that as a benchmark for excellence.<br/><br/>This all amounts to another animated project from DreamWorks high on energy and low on inspiration. After ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron,"" ""Road to El Dorado"" and ""Sinbad"" all tanked, it's clear that the ""Shrek"" series is the only good thing the studio has going for it right now.<br/><br/>Of course, there's no escaping comparison to that other computer animated fish movie, either, and that's when this film looks most wanting. Where Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" swam the full depths of the ocean, ""Shark Tale"" seems content to just tread water in the wading pool.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 stars. Pretty to look at, but any movie that tries to push this much ""coolness"" down your throat is just asking to be despised."
"The_Orenda","4","64","106","14 November 2004"," Something was missing.
","I can't explain why I didn't like Shark Tale too much. Visually there is a creative backdrop which is absolutely beautiful. I wonder if they just took pictures of New York, doused it underwater and worked around the scenery. Because with the exception of that imagery, Shark Tale has a very loud, very brash, in-your-face mentality that takes away from the movie. Other features like The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo invite you to the paradise of being under the sea. Shark Tale throws you in the middle of the loudest club and tells you to get down on it. I don't buy it and with the exception of some visual gags, nobody else could neither. This is also another movie where Will Smith can get back into his Fresh Prince gear and get away with it and Jack Black could play a gender confused shark and be accepted for it as well. I wanted to enjoy the scenery and the sight of an underground New York. Shark Tale offered it but instead beat us silly with all the hoopla we see everyday on the television set. What a disappointment. Enjoy the humor and expect nothing more."

The voice talent was well cast, with Will Smith as Oscar, the ambitious ""small fish in a big pond"" who finds himself an instant celebrity; Jack Black as Lenny, a peaceful vegetarian shark; Robert DeNiro as Don Lino, Lenny's father, the head of a shark mob, etc. The animation looks good, and a lot of movie references are clever.

"dee.reid","7","26","43","11 March 2005"," ""Shark Tale"" is a ""fishy"" tale, all right, but a worthwhile one
","I have to admit going into this review that I didn't at all have the slightest hopes of liking ""Shark Tale."" From the previews last fall, it reminded me a little too much of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo."" Not so, as I would later find out. ""Shark Tale"" draws much of its inspirations, as noted by critic Roger Ebert, from ""Casablanca,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""The Godfather"" - all movies that are considered to be modern American classics.<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" plays out like an amalgam of all three classic films, and has a plot that shares uncanny parallels to the current events debate about morality and homosexuality in America. The film is set in and around a coral reef that is controlled by a ""Godfather""-like mob family of great white sharks. Don Lino (Robert De Niro) is as ruthless as they come, and his two sons Frankie (Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black) both have their eyes set on controlling the family and the reef when Lino retires.<br/><br/>The sharks, who run their business out of a spruced-up version of the sunken Titanic, have a reputation for routinely shaking down clients and otherwise being pretty hard on the reef, but Lenny doesn't have that killer instinct in him - he's a vegetarian - and at dinner one night, he sets a shrimp free. This comes as a shock for Don Lino, as Lenny's behavior suddenly becomes a huge embarrassment for him.<br/><br/>On the reef, a hustling fish named Oscar (Will Smith) is aspiring to rise out of his lowly existence working at a whale wash. He's thought up a number of schemes in the past that have all failed and his closest friend is his boss's secretary Angie (Renee Zellweger), who also has a crush on him.<br/><br/>Things become complicated for all the characters when Frankie is accidentally killed by a fisherman's anchor being dropped on his head while he was trying to convince Lenny to be a killer shark by feasting on Oscar, who's indebted to Don Lino for a failed horse-betting scheme. Oscar, who bore witness to the whole incident, seizes the opportunity and using his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) as a shameless fight promoter, becomes a hero around the reef as a shark slayer, and Lenny is forced to go into hiding as a result.<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" is entertaining to say the least, with enough in-jokes and gags to certainly reel in unsuspecting viewers. Even though this is a children's film, there is a lot of thematic material that is just too serious to not go at all unnoticed.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful (though not as good as anything done by Pixar in the last 10 years) and it really gives the deep blue that admirable quality. The voice-acting is pretty impressive too, with all of the actors doing their best, including Angelina Jolie as the gold-digging Lola.<br/><br/>7/10"

","with big and well-known names such as will smith, Robert De Nero, Renee zellwegger, Angelina Jolie, Ziggy Marley, and Katie couric involved in this animated film, i felt that this movie was going to at least come close to finding nemo, a masterpiece that is and always will be the leader of the ""under-the-sea"" type animation. shark tale was somewhat disappointing and i did not notice anything hilariously funny about it. in this film, a fish (voice of will smith that wants to make a name for himself in society believing that he is a loser.. coincidentally, while trying to escape a shark, he ends up ""killing"" it (it was really just an accident). however, the other fish believe that he actually killed the shark and he receives fame and glory as the ""shark slayer."" anxious for the chance to be somebody, this fish plays along and uses it to his advantage. the most ridiculous part is the fact that these sharks are actually afraid of this puny fish. however, this is nothing compared to will smith's role at the end of this moving in mending the relationship between a father shark and his son who chose a vegetarian lifestyle instead of being like the other sharks. the only ""funny"" parts in this movie involve the shrimp who appear a few times (at least in think they are shrimp). after seeing finding nemo, this movie was definitely a disappointment."

"taco_island","Null","8","12","1 October 2004"," Dreamworks' head of marketing should've gotten co-writer credit
","(This review contains spoilers)<br/><br/>Could somebody please tell Dreamworks Animation that if they want to be<br/><br/>respected on the same level as Pixar, they need to stop being so insecure about whether their films will sell, and give their artists more breathing room? I'm not talking about PDI, the guys that produced Shrek, I'm talking about the Dreamworks Animation guys who made that Sinbad movie with Brad Pitt, then (like Disney) permanently switched to 3-D animation and are now releasing Shark Tale. <br/><br/>Many will compare Shark Tale to Finding Nemo, a rather unfair comparison since aside from both being CG-animated underwater stories involving sharks somehow, the films have very little in common, in terms of both plot and aesthetic decisions. In fact, Shark Tale has the demeanor of a Pretty Good film that's been taken away from the artists, repackaged by marketing and forced down the public's throat by too many damn movie stars.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this film feels forced, from the voice casting to the character design to the corporate ""it's hot cause we tell you it is"" music to the excessive fish puns (all of which are of the ""I get it, but I ain't laughing"" variety) to the fact that the film's title was changed in post-production from the perfectly appropriate ""Sharkslayer"" to the safer, dumbed-down ""Shark Tale"". With the exception of Lenny (Jack Black), the face of every major character, and a few of the minor ones too, is made to look exactly like its voice actor's face strapped to a fish, which is about three steps away from selling your soul and freedom to imagine entirely. Even Shrek didn't stoop so low as to put Eddie Murphy's face on a donkey. Donkey just looks like a donkey, end of story! The characters in Shark Tale, meanwhile, look like 3-D caricatures blown up to the big screen. Jack Black, usually a comic force to be reckoned with, feels wasted here, as he jettisons his usual persona for a dumb Horshack imitation. Hey, why not actually hire Ron Palillo, the guy who PLAYED Horshack? He's still alive, and could probably use the work...but oh yeah, the kids have never heard of him, and we need stars, so screw that. <br/><br/>You see, back in the days of Pinocchio and Snow White, with occasional exceptions (like Ukelele Ike as Jiminy Crickett) nobody knew or cared who did these characters' voices, because they were attracted to the characters themselves, not the actors behind them. None of the voice actors in Shark Tale do less-than-adequate jobs, but with the exception of Robert DeNiro (who's just a Really Great Actor, period) none of them really contributed anything truly endearing to their characters, that a lesser-known actor wouldn't have. I certainly can't say the same for Finding Nemo, in which the voices, if not perfect, were damn close. <br/><br/>Uh-oh, Will Smith's character just realized that even though he gained wealth and fame, he lost the thing in his life that REALLY mattered! Cue Alicia Keys! (or the biggest Alicia Keys clone we can get to record a new song for the soundtrack).<br/><br/>I admit, the film does contain a few funny moments, enough to make it worth renting (on half-price Tuesday of course) when the DVD comes out. But just when the film is starting to get good (the climactic showdown/chase scene is surprisingly well done) the movie ends by pulling the worst blow of them all: Not only is there a Christina Aguilera/Missy Elliot duet over the end credits, THEY ACTUALLY DESIGNED FISH THAT LOOKED LIKE THOSE TWO TO SING IT IN THE FILM, LIKE A LIVE PERFORMANCE! IT'S NOT A LIVE PERFORMANCE, YOU JERKS - IT'S ANIMATED, NO ONE WITH ANY BRAINS AT ALL WILL BUY IT! Think about it for a second - Christina Aguilera comes in to record her vocals for MAYBE an hour, on a song that she didn't write and isn't producing, and then some poor unseen animator is told ""Oh yeah, you have to design and animate a Christina Aguilera fish. Do it or you're fired."" The sequence causes dumb kids to buy more Christina albums under the premise that she's magical enough to turn into a fish or something, and that animator is left nameless, and pondering just why and how his life got to that sad, sad, SAD point.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Pixar, for their lead roles, have cast the likes of Dave Foley, Albert Brooks and Craig T. Nelson, three good comedic actors without a single live-action megahit to their names. While Shark Tale fills every available moment with lame corporate music (gotta sell the soundtrack, and kids won't listen to instrumental scores, right?) Finding Nemo contained only one song, and it was a slightly-redone version of the lounge classic ""Beyond the Sea."" Is it cool? Pixa doesn't worry about not being cool, be cause Pixar just IS cool.<br/><br/>Dreamworks Animation tries too hard to be cool, and thus fails miserably.<br/><br/>One and a half stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>Tony Goldmark </li></ul><br/><br/>My two cents, keep the change."

","We had high hopes of this movie (My wife our four year old girl and I) but sadly it did not grip any of us. Technically brilliant animation but the leaden script badly let the movie down. The sharks had the best lines but one ""Jaws"" gag was enough. The likes of Toy Story or even Finding Nemo have much wittier scripts and more interesting stories. Even my daughter was bored during the middle reels when nothing much was happening. Somehow the fishes having humanesque faces was slightly disturbing and a little unpleasant.

","After seeing the opening today I have to admit...Shark's Tale was one of the corniest movie I've seen in my life...CORNY to the bone. The plot was awesome, and I had laughs, but the writers really tried too hard to make this movie too funny, and they're going to lose international credibility for it...a whole lot. <br/><br/>Let me give you a Jamaican perspective. I'm not taking anything from Ziggy Marley (Ernie) & Doug E. Doug (Bernie); they both couldn't have done the 'Jellyfish Rastas Duo' roles better. But seriously now, both roles were controversially laced with cuss words taken from the Jamaican dialect (thankfully that most Americans don't understand). And so, I felt quite embarrassed listening to the context in how it was done. I'm proud of my Jamaican culture and dialect and that many people would love to learn & experience it. But the writers just can't incorporate cuss words into a kid's movie like that. <br/><br/>It might be funny to some, but it also sends a negative message to the younger audience about different cultures. I wouldn't be surprised if, people walk out on this one when this comes out in the Caribbean."
"TheNorthernMonkee","1","24","48","14 February 2005"," one of the worst mainstream animations in the last decade
","SPOILERS Ever since the original ""Toy Story"" (1995), we've had some truly wonderful animations. With films like ""Shrek"" (2001) and ""Finding Nemo"" (2004), we've had some amazing stories for the whole family which are equally funny and impressively animated. By the law of averages therefore, it is perhaps not surprising we would end up with one or two truly woeful stories. That is what we have here with ""Shark Tale"". This is a film which is short on humour, devoid of originality and a mechanism for Will Smith's ego.<br/><br/>Smith plays Oscar, a down on his luck fish who works as a tongue scraper at a Whale Wash. With dreams of making it big and moving up in the world, Oscar is a no-hoper who constantly bleeds his heart out to loyal friend Angie (Renee Zellwenger). When things take a turn for the worse however, Oscar inadvertently kills a shark and a media icon. Now with a Vegetarian shark (Jack Black) for company, Oscar must survive popularity, and the growing threat of Shark Godfather Don Lino (Robert DeNiro).<br/><br/>On paper, any film which involves a Shark spoof of all Italian mafia films, should be hilarious. Truthfully, at times it shows signs of reaching this peak, but all too often it drifts away to leave us feeling bitter disappointment.<br/><br/>DeNiro and friend Martin Scorsese appear to enjoy poking fun at a genre which they are culturally renowned, but with one or two jokes which are either stolen from elsewhere (a scene involving Smith's character at a Mafia meeting is a replica of a scene from 1999's ""Analyze This"") or based on seemingly personal stories, the story never clicks. Still, DeNiro and Scorsese are more tolerable compared with Will Smith's role.<br/><br/>As Oscar the fish, Will Smith simply plays himself. It is like watching the Freshwater Prince of Bel-Air or something equally pointless. Smith walks around making irritating comments, wearing ""bling"" and generally making a fool of himself. Will Smith has proved in the past that whether comedy or drama, he CAN act, but the man is fast loosing any support with performances like this where he plays an old character in new surroundings. Perhaps it's time his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith convinced him to actually lay this Fresh Prince character to bed and actually do more challenging work. Sadly, this probably won't happen.<br/><br/>Aside from Smith, DeNiro and Scorsese, ""Shark Tale"" also features vocal performances by Jack Black, Renee Zellwenger and Angelina Jolie. These three actors are famous for different styles of work, and they are worth mentioning for their performances in ""Shark Tale"" purely for the fact that they aren't awful. They're not particularly superb, with even Black seeming subdued, but they don't stand out as awful. They're simply mediocre.<br/><br/>Another flaw with ""Shark Tale"" is a problem faced also by ""Shrek 2"" (also 2004). Whilst the later film was at times hilarious, it did possess a lot of jokes about current television series which might not be remembered in the future. The same is true in ""Shark Tale"". At first appearance, Smith's character appears in a fantastic apartment and is showing the furniture off. Blatantly joking about a modern MTV programme called ""Cribs"" the jokes are not only unfunny, but they won't last beyond a few years, if even that.<br/><br/>All in all, there is little praise that can be given to ""Shark Tale"". A woeful story with little going for it, it fails on all levels and whilst it is harsh to say it should never have been made, it most definitely needed more rethinking. Should be avoided at all costs."

"HobbitHole","Null","7","11","18 June 2005"," Rated awful because of target audience
","Someone asked why the bad posts and ratings? Because this is an animated film that is supposed to be something to take kids to and instead is a tongue in cheek animated version of a mafia film like the ""R"" rated ""Godfather"" series. The language, sexuality, etc. is not appropriate for kids. Adults who may be a fan of this type of movie might find it a funny satire, but it is definitely not for kids and quite frankly, though not the worst in animation I've seen (that goes to ""The Last Unicorn""), message and content wise, it was one of the worst. The only reason we are even having this conversation is that some very talented actors lent their voice to it and thus caught ADULTS attention. Young kids don't even know Robert DeNiro was in Godfather or know that Peter Falk used to make movies with the Rat Pack. So it's not geared to kids, but it's marketed to them and THAT'S why people rated it low."
"Minerva_Meybridge","10","7","11","2 March 2005"," This is not, repeat, not, a kids's movie!
","I don't know what critics were thinking. The writers and animators had a field day. This is a subtle adult comedy that that works like a Woody Allen film. It is not for children. The film is loaded with subtle gags. Take, for instance, the shark character, voiced by Peter Falk. The shark's name is Don Feinstein. Don is an Italian title and this is supposedly a shark mafia, headed by Robert Diniro's character, Feinstein is a Jewish name. And, if you look closely, you notice that Don Feinstein has a ""glass"" eye like Peter Falk, which doesn't quite sink with the other (no pun intended). When old Don Feinstein passes gas bubbles. the shark behind him takes a moment to inhale them, then passes out. Virtually every scene has something, but you have to look. This is an ""insiders"" animation film. I guess Dreamworks feels they have enough money to do something like this once in a while. Remember, Dreamworks animation started out by winning Cannes awards for their shorts.<br/><br/>So, if you're not a TV and film buff, prepared to be bored by what appears to be a mediocre story line. Or if you're a teenager who think Columbo is a country in South America... Drown me if I'm lying, but this is a great film! And don't miss the Gigi the Whale short on the DVD."

Technically it looks good, but it is just plain dull, unfunny and downright annoying... particularly Will Smith. Someone should tell Smith that he is incredibly annoying when playing himself (like he did in I, ROBOT), and that he should use some of the acting skills that he's proved in the past that he has. <br/><br/>I think the best thing Dreamworks can possibly do is to poach the entire staff of Pixar, then their next CGI film might have some heart and an actual story that is engaging on all levels... and for all ages.<br/><br/>I am now looking forward to seeing OPEN WATER, as I'm sure it will have a lot more laughs than SHARK TALE."

He works for a puffer fish named Sykes (sp?) whose business is controlled by the Shark mafia headed by Don Lino (obviously Robert Di Niro). Oscar owes Sykes a lot of money and is given one last chance to get it back for him. He tries to do so and fails and is about to be killed by the mafia's jellyfish henchman (Ziggy Marley and Doug E.

Oscar decides to go along with this story and is instantly famous for being the Shark Slayer. He ends up befriending and teaming up with Lenny in an attempt to keep up this appearance. <br/><br/>This movie has some hilarious scenes and some really funny and sneaky references to other movies and things.

","Shark Tale is a film that didn't do well with any critics. Well, I liked it. I liked it a tad more than some of the other Dreamworks films, such as Madagascar. Shark Tale is far from being as good as Finding Nemo. Adults may find Shark Tale more appealing, because it's also a mob movie. I know, a film about fish being a mob movie. Well listen to me and listen to me good, it's a damn good try to be a mob movie. It's funnier than some of the Dreamworks films and deserves a lot more credit than it got. I think a 5.9 is being a little unreasonable. There is really nothing wrong with Shark Tale. It's got the keys to being a mob movie. It's even got Martin Scorsesse in it for God's sake! I don't think Shark Tale is as good as Finding Nemo, a little funnier and less serious. I did like Shark Tale quite a lot, and I think you should see it. despite the bad reviews it got. the film has a great cast, it's a funny film, and it's a partial mob movie, so I would've thought it would entertain most people.

A poor mans Finding Nemo was the criticism levelled at it mostly, so after just viewing it what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be!<br/><br/>De Niro is superb as the mafioso Shark, as is Scourcese, who proves to be quite a good comic character actor.

"Quinoa1984","4","14","28","1 October 2004"," An over-rated Hollywood churner that squanders a cast with only minimal interest
","While Sharktale may appeal to an audience out there, it's hard to tell for which one. The film is not a failure, but thanks to the mega-hype by the Hollywood system, with marketing railing up the walls and the stars of the film (only recognizable by voice and oddly shaped animation on the faces) trumped to bring in the kids and adults, would have to do a lot to live up to it. As it is, the filmmakers bring in not just movie references to not only The Godfather but many other crime films and shows, but urban/hip-hop culture, and corporations like the Gap, Krispy Kreme, Burger King, etc. But the film is such in love with the in-jokes that it leaves the story and characters on the cloth-hanger. The jokes that do work are the ones that aren't as over-the-top as the others, or at least those that don't involve flatulence and over-emphasis on ""bling-bling"". <br/><br/>This is not to say that there aren't ways to make such elements funny- Shrek 2 just skimmed the line on what was tolerable. But Sharktale gives the audience a story that involves a lot for kids to digest, despite the conventions and clichés of it (little fish wants big things, bets all his money at the sea-horse racetrack and loses, blow-fish boss orders execution, then has a run-in and takes credit for a mobster's son's dead corpse, becomes a celebrity, and is under pressure with the other son who's a bit of a wimp, and with his love interest). As for the adults, the gags and puns sometimes doesn't work either, as did in Shrek or Finding Nemo. Some of the ideal wit that emerged in Dreamworks' first CGI feature, Antz, does come through, like an (all to brief) Abbot and Costello riff by the fish played by Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. There's even a funny bit with a shrimp cocktail.<br/><br/>One big problem in the film is that the casting, while somewhat efficient, isn't utilized properly. Actors like Will Smith and Jack Black can be funny, but the lines and jokes they pull in the film lie kind of flat in the water. This might not be so for some of the kids and adults in the audience. However, Sharktale does depend on a varying sense of humor. The ideas being some of the casting is of interest, like small roles for Michael Imperioli, Peter Faulk, and Katie Couric. But then they don't get much to do. Are they just there because they're celebrities, or does the script give them something to do? From my point of view, the script doesn't deliver, at least with the kind of abandon it used to.<br/><br/>In fact, Sharktale seems to compensate such things as a marketing-tested script and mis-casting with the usual extravagant and detailed animation. If not for the huge budget to cast the stars, implement the hip-hop soundtrack, and get the CGI, wouldn't this film be made under a direct-to-video or TV standard? There seem to be two double standards that also got to me as I walked out of the theater- 1) in order for the 3-D to work, as in a classic like Toy Story, the character shouldn't be 2-D. When an actor like Robert De Niro has only one emotion throughout the whole film, and changes at the end of the last act, the character as well as the actor playing him is reduced to something of a video-game caricature. 2) If the message of the film is to accept who you are and not to lie in order to get to the top (an admirable message for kids amid all the phooey in the story), then why would the Sykes character, played by Scorsese, have on the ""bling-bling"" and hip-hop language he hasn't had through-out the rest of the story? <br/><br/>Even just as a stand-alone film, aside from the lineage of CGI in the past ten years, Sharktale is just nothing new. It's the kind of film you're glad to see once, so that you know you saw it, and know why you liked it or dis-liked it. C-"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>In all things that humans make, there are levels of expertise. A matter of necessary education is to be able to distinguish among these levels, and most particularly between the merely competent and the original on which it is based. This a way of saying that to be an educated, cine-literate viewer, you need to perceive the difference between this and 'Nemo.'<br/><br/>A cruel rule in business is that mature markets can stratify between those that define and redefine the market and those that must struggle to keep up. If you succeed in controlling a market this way, you'll always win in the long run in the most important ways.<br/><br/>In computers, its Steve Jobs who defines the market. Always has been. Bill Gates copies.<br/><br/>In film animation, its Steve Jobs again, with his Pixar. The guiding principle there is a matter of original excellence, to understand the underlying fabric of the thing. When Katzenberg was at Disney, he famously said that anyone could do what Pixar had (with 'Toy Story') and set out to prove it. Ultimately, Dreamworks animation was founded.<br/><br/>Pixar made a bug movie, Dreamworks made a bug movie (incidentally funded by Bill Gates). Pixar made a movie about bad guys behind the scenes, and so did Dreamworks ('Shrek'). Pixar made a fish movie, so it is to be expected that Dreamworks would follow.<br/><br/>Here are two indicators of why 'Nemo' worked and 'Shark' doesn't, in other words, why the former is the Tiffany and the latter the JC Penny's of animation.<br/><br/>Pixar works in 3D, and is concerned with _all_ the matters of 3D. Having mastered many of them in the earlier projects, they focused on one of the more difficult in 'Nemo,' the movement of the 'camera.' The reason Nemo is a fish story is so that the set can have movement in three dimensions, with the camera swooping around as if it were a fish ghostviewer.<br/><br/>(You have to understand that the original cameras were stationary at eye height. Most great advances in film have been accompanied by advances in the philosophy of how the camera moves. This is not a mere game, as it implies _who_ and _what_ the viewer is.)<br/><br/>So watch 'Nemo' and see that Pixar redefined the genre with the way the camera exists in and sees three dimensional movement. Now watch 'Shark' and be amazed at how they missed this. All the movement - even the fight scenes which many summer movies already make dimensional - are two D. That's one reason why this subliminally seems pale in comparison.<br/><br/>There are other reasons of course, mostly obvious and uninteresting. Except in the seriousness of the approach.<br/><br/>Pixar takes its stories seriously. They may have some fun from time to time with references to other films, or even stepping back from the story to make a joke about the story. But they never compromise the seriousness of the story. They care about whether Nemo gets lost.<br/><br/>Dreamworks doesn't take the story seriously at all. They decided to bring a bunch of pieces that they thought had value, and highlight those pieces. So instead of having a godfather shark, we have deNiro. It is not a character that grows out of the story that deNiro helps create. It is deNiro _as_ a character, down to that odd mole on the right of his face. And so with all the other characters.<br/><br/>And the songs too. They are wedged in, rather than growing out of the theatrical dynamics. And yes, so are all the references to other films. Sure, that was a gas with 'Van Helsing' but in that case, the picture itself was morphing from one genre to another just like the characters. Here, the references are pasted on as if the story were outlined and the story 'fluffers' brought in to add cute jokes for the adults.<br/><br/>Just doesn't work. At least for the immediate future, Pixar owns this genre, and Dreamworks will have to swim in their turbulent wake.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

A cold blooded killer, which Lenny would never be.<br/><br/>The movie is about Oscar, a fish from the bottom of the reef who works at a whale wash and would to anything for fame and to live at the top of the reef. When one day, Lenny and his brother Frankie go out to train Lenny to be shark. When while Ernie and Bernie are torturing Oscar, they see sharks and Lenny swims over to Oscar. When he pretends to eat him, he tells Oscar to swim away, when he doesn't, Frankie gets mad and goes after Oscar and gets killed by an anchor. When Ernie and Bernie see Oscar on top of the great white, they ask him if he killed that shark, Oscar said yes and became known as the 'shark slayer' and gets famous. He also gets Lola. But then he teams up with Lenny to hide from the sharks that are after Oscar for killing Frankie while trying to hide Lenny from the sharks looking for him to come home. This movie is funny, and charming a family favorite!<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good animated comedy to watch with your family, this is a good choice for laughs and a good story. 8/10, fantastic movie!"

","After the amount of criticism this movie received by critics/film fans alike I was pretty reluctant to sit down and watch this movie which is pretty unlike me seeing as I generally don't go on other peoples opinion. However I'm glad I stuck to my guns as this film really took me on a ride of laughs and emotions.<br/><br/>To start with looking at a cast which includes Will Smith, Robert De Nero and Jack Black you would have to be a really bad scriptwriter to make these guys mess up. The animation is superb and the hidden story lines/jokes make a truly intriguing story.<br/><br/>This film cant be compared to Finding Nemo due to the fact the films are totally different aside from the fact they are both underwater (it has more in common with spongebob than it does Nemo!) A sign of a good movie is when time flies and the film is in the closing credits before you know it, and thats what this film delivered to me, i felt good at the end of it and I would without a doubt watch it again.<br/><br/>'Oscar' is a character a lot of people may relate to, he is in a dead end job, wants to be a character and make people laugh and dreams of living in a far off land getting everything he wants, the film takes us on the ride of what it is like to get it all, and shows its not all we imagine it to be, the rich can be upset to, and again be dreamers, this time of the life they had left behind.<br/><br/>Totally worthy of a 'worth see' movie."

","This movie was another on of those movies that at any age if you watch it you will ove it. It will definitely make you smile and have a good chuckle out if it. It was more enoyable for kids I admit, but it was just so amusing you gotta love it. The story plot is simply and fun and I guess does teach you a bit or two about moral friends and being honest and truthful.. But it was all fun and games. it was a cute movie that anyone will like. So go out there and watch it because it is worth it to watch it. Shark tale is better than Fidning Nemo, but both had there strengths and weakneses. Shark Tale is a great lesson for small kids and maybe even a few adults."
"rbverhoef","7","3","4","18 April 2005"," Fun for adults
","I liked 'Shark Tale'. It is funny and has quite some original elements I will not spoil for you. But while I was watching I realized how many jokes were there intended for adults and how little for children. Since I guess you have to label this as a family film I was wondering if that was really the intention of the filmmakers. I mean, the main inspiration comes from R-rated films 'The Godfather' and 'Jaws'. Other little jokes and one-liners find their origin in films like 'Scarface', 'Gladiator' and 'Apocalypse Now', again R-rated.All those great laughs, for me at least, will not be funny or even remotely understood by children.<br/><br/>That said, let's approach this film as a comedy mainly made for adults. Again, adults will probably find this very funny, even funnier when you have seen quite some films. The story tells about Lenny (voice by Jack Black), a shark who happens to be a vegetarian, a disgrace for his father Don Lino (Robert De Niro). This shark makes a deal with a small fish named Oscar (Will Smith). On the reef where Oscar lives they think Oscar killed another shark, Lenny's brother, so Lenny and Oscar try to keep the rumor that way. Subplots involve Oscar's longtime friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) who is secretly in love with him, a new fish Lola (Angelina Jolie) who likes Oscar now he is famous, and Sykes (Martin Scorsese), a fish who used to be Don Lino's partner but now teams up with Oscar. Sykes has two helpers, the funny sidekicks any Disney-film would be proud of.<br/><br/>What can I say more about this film? The animation is good, although I liked the approach with 'Finding Nemo' better. On the other hand, this is the kind of film where realistic animation probably would be out of place. Now I have mentioned 'Finding Nemo' I could compare it a little more. 'Nemo' is the better film since it is equally funny for adults and close to the perfect film for children. 'Nemo' was simple in its story but very inventive as well in the little things. Think about the fish with short term memory loss. Things like that you will not find in 'Shark Tale' but you will have many laughs and smiles. Especially the one-liners taken from other films were hilarious but I have to say again; you must have seen the other film to really like it. I did, I laughed."

Robert De Niro's always Excellent. He did awesome as the Don and his son Frankie the shark (I'm not sure of the name of the Actor) was funny too. Jack Black played Lenny well, and Renee Zielwigger played her part perfect. I also liked the jelly fish at the car wash they were laid back and comical. The story line was cool, I can relate to it. Who doesn't want to live at the top penthouse and be famous. I also loved how Christina and Missy sang that car wash song at the end.

","** Beware of spoilers here **<br/><br/>Recap: Lenny is not happy. He is a vegetarian and a great white shark, and that don't really work out. His father, Don Lino (the mafia-boss around), is now considering retiring, and leaving Lenny and his brother Frankie in charge. As a last effort Frankie takes Lenny out to teach him how to be a real shark. At the reef Oscar is in trouble. He works at a Whale wash but aspires to become Somebody. His ambition also makes him overlook his co-worker Angie, who is secretly in love with Oscar. But Oscar's boss, Sykes, is under pressure from Don Lino. Sykes in turn, with his jellyfish thugs Bernie and Ernie, forces Oscar to pay his, somewhat large debts. Oscar, with help from Angie, puts the money together but loses them at the races. Sykes's thugs then bring Oscar out into the ""desert"" where Oscar is about to ""get lost"" when Frankie and Lenny stumbles upon them. Ernie and Bernie flees and when Frankie goes to attack to show Lenny how it is done, he is killed in a freak accident. Back at the reef Oscar take credit for the killing, is soon named The Sharkslayer, and becomes the hero and the Somebody he always dreamt to be. Things get complicated when Lenny turns up and threatens to reveal the truth if Oscar doesn't help him start a new life in the reef. Back at the shark hangout, Don Lino is furious about the news that one son is dead, the other one missing. He wants revenge...<br/><br/>Comments: This is a great movie, which I believe can be enjoyed by everyone. The story itself is somewhat focused on ""mature"" aspects as love, revenge and so on. But I believe kids will have a lot of fun watching it as well. For the more movie-experienced audience the movie is full of evident or ¨subtler, all hilarious, references and spoofs of other movies. In other aspects, DreamWorks animators and crew have done a great job. The movie is illustrated beautifully and especially nice is that the characters have borrowed some physical features from the actors that lent them their voice. The actors and actresses do it well too, using their whole range of vocal abilities and peculiarities. And at last, but most important, the story itself is very funny and inventive. No dull moments.

People may say that this is a total copy off Finding Nemo, but i have to disagree. <br/><br/>After reading other comments i got very, very tired. Oh,...shark tale take place in the ocean,...then it must be a copy off Finding Nemo. Except the ocean there are no other similarities.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the others.

"jpintar","7","4","6","3 October 2004"," Pretty fun
","I found this movie to be just fun. It is nowhere in the quality of Finding Nemo, Shrek, or Toy Story 2 but I found it a good time at the movies. Will Smith is very entertaining as the fish who tries to make himself into somebody by claiming to be a shark slayer. Robert De Niro is very good as the voice of the head shark. There are many in joke references to mobster movies and of course Jaws. I also liked Martin Scorsese as the opportunist blow fish who tries to use Smith's character to his advantage. The only one I was not impressed with was Jack Black as the shark who is a vegetarian. Maybe it is because I am not really a fan of his but his character is whiny and weak. This movie may not be appropriate for very young children because the sharks can be scary at times and the in joke references will go over their heads. 7/10"

I loved all made by Pixar 3D movies (Toy Story, Monsters, Ice age and Nemo)and I respect Pixar as the company who invented this kind of cartoons but I loved Dreamworks 3D movies too(Shrek and Shark Tales). So I have seen the all of those. In my opinion Shark Tale is very better than Nemo. Nemo has been the first one under water and I can understand that impressed people a lot but Shark Tale is really funny and cool. I don't know why so many bad posts. Somebody wrote: ""Don't bring your children to this movie they will be bored"". This is an absurdity. I liked this movie very much more than Nemo as it is great in the same way as graphic but very funnier. I guess that many of those posts are pushed by somebody who has a particular convenience to do that. Shark Tale is a great great 3d movie, funny and intelligent. I'm on the point to come back to the theater and see it again. Go and see it with or without your children, you will be not disappointed. My vote is 8 on 10."

"Joejoesan","Null","10","25","17 September 2004"," Don't believe the cynics, this one's great!
","It's risky to rave about a movie you just saw, making all the expectations that other people may have a lot higher. But in the case of Shark Tale I don't mind. All the journalists who saw the movie with me were very excited about the new computer animated DreamWorks flick. This movie deserves to be a massive hit!<br/><br/>Oscar (Will Smith) is a fast rapping streetwise kid who works in a whale-wash (a car wash where they clean whales) and dreams of one day becoming a somebody. When he takes credit of killing a shark (who actually got hit by an anchor) he becomes the Sharkslayer who has to protect the town. Unfortunately, the shark he claimed to have killed, happened to be the son of mobster Don Lino (Robert DeNiro). Soon Oscar finds every shark coming after him.<br/><br/>Lenny (Jack Black), the other son of Don Lino, has other problems. He happens to be a vegetarian who doesn't approve of the Mafia way of life and therefore always disappoints his father. Oscar and Lenny become friends and come up with a plan so Lenny can disappear and that can make Oscar the feared Sharkslayer the city needs. Lucky for them the plan works. But they were not prepared for all the consequences...<br/><br/>Everybody will compare Shark Tale to Finding Nemo and that would be a real pity: they're entirely different movies. For instance, Finding Nemo took place in the ""country"" while the scenery of Shark Tale is a stunning underwater version of New York, complete with a Times Square, yellow cabs and skyscrapers. Most of the characters in Finding Nemo were sweet and adorable, in Shark Tale they all have a dark side (with the exception of Jack Black and Renee Zellweger - she's the girl who is truly in love with Oscar). Not that it's a dark film, but everybody seems to be corrupted in a funny way.<br/><br/>The humour of Shark Tale aims more at adults than in Finding Nemo. Of course a lot of jokes are (mob) movie-based. We see glimpses of Jaws, Goodfellas, Titanic, Scarface, Superman 2 and Analyze This. Usually the jokes work out fine but sometimes they're very cheap (how many times have we heard the phrase Say hello to my little friend?). But although children will not understand all these cinematic references, the movie will certainly appeal to them as well. The story is told so fast that you can't even afford to blink your eyes!<br/><br/>In Cannes Shark Tale was heavily promoted on the fact that a lot of big Hollywood stars had a speaking part. This time that was really justified. Will Smith doesn't only do the voice of Oscar, the character also looks and moves like him! The same goes for Martin Scorcese (as Oscar's manager), Angelina Jolie (as the femme fatale) and Missy Elliot and Christina Aguilera (who have a small part singing a song).<br/><br/>But in the end Shark Tale is really the big ""Will Smith versus Robert DeNiro"" show. Smith does what he does best: rapping, cracking jokes, clowning around and be the Fresh Prince. DeNiro gives Don Lino the Italian authority and the humour we saw in Analyze This. I also liked Angelina Jolie. She did a great job as the sexy femme fatale who wants revenge after she got dumped by Will Smith.<br/><br/>A fast and entertaining story, great performances, stunning visual ideas (New York looks great! There are even floating billboards like in Blade Runner) and a fantastic soundtrack with songs from the seventies: Shark Tale is a highly entertaining feature that will appeal to both parents and kids. The only thing that bothered me was the moralising ending (but then you can't have it all).<br/><br/>My prediction? A 55 million dollar opening week and Shark Tale 2 in 2006!"
"jason06-1","7","3","5","6 April 2007"," Overrated, But Still Watachable
","Shark Tale doesn't live up to it's full hype, but it guarantees entertainment<br/><br/>Plot: Oscar (Will Smith) is a fish who dreams of moving to the top of the ocean and leaving everything behind. This happens when in an accident a shark is killed and Oscar claims he killed it. Soon he has fame, fortune, and a girlfriend (Angelina Jolie) much to the objection of Angie (Renee Zellweger) who secretly has a crush on Oscar. He has a manager (Martin Scorsese) and has moved onto bigger and better things. When he runs into the shark's brother that he killed (Jack Black) they strike a friendship and Oscar tells him what really happened. The father Don Lino (Robert De Niro) still believes Oscar killed his son and sets out to find him. Things become more complicated when Angie finds out the truth.<br/><br/>The Good News: The beginning starts out really promising with a look at life in the ocean. The music is really upbeat and modern all the way through. The animation is outstanding and spectacular. When Skye puffs up and squeaks in his little voice it is hilarious and you couldn't find another voice actor to do it better. Besides Will Smith the all star voice cast is all around great and superb. The characters are all well drawn out and you like them. My favorite character had to be Lenny by a mile. The story was pretty original and entertaining. The direction is good and nothing life changing. The sit down scene is a major standout and everything following that leading into the ending is action packed with some new ideas. The character interactions are all nice and they move like real people with fins. It was nice to see some everyday things parodied like the sign advertising Coral Cola (Coke a Cola) and ""O"" Mints (Thin Mints of Tic Tacs). <br/><br/>The Bad News: Will Smith's voice for Oscar doesn't really fit the character and is really a major distraction. Some of the characters could have been thrown out for their uselessness. The jokes are pretty bad and only a couple of them work which is major foul on the film and maybe it's just my VHS player or video, but there is a large amount of grain. The secondary characters here to provide most of the jokes are downright unlikeable. This film also contains the overly clichéd montage when the main character is feeling down or sad and then the problem is solved which follows into another montage.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Doesn't deserve all its hype, but provides decent entertainment. If you happen to stumble across it on T.V. or at the video store go ahead and watch it if there is nothing else, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Really hard to say on this one.<br/><br/>Rated: PG"

I recently finally accepted the fact that computer animation is the craze and there will probably from now on be no more regular classic animation, so I've pretty much seen all the new computer animation films and Shark Tale was next on my list. While it wasn't up to par with Shrek 2, I still kinda had fun, especially with the cast.<br/><br/>Oscar is a fish who feels like the ultimate nobody and Lenny is a vegetarian shark who's father is kind of the Godfather of the shark world, so his dad expects him to be a meat eating rough tough shark. When Lenny's brother accidentally dies as he's chasing Oscar to eat him, his brother gets slammed on the head with an anchor and dies. Everyone thinks that Oscar killed the brother and names him sharkslayer, too afraid to go home, Lenny stays with Oscar helping him keep his rep by faking a beat up. But when the father wants to see what the sharkslayer is really all about, Oscar may loose his true love, Angie.<br/><br/>Well, the jokes were a little off every once in a while and it wasn't as impressive as some other animated films, but I still had fun watching Shark Tale. I was absolutely in love with the cast and the animation was pretty good, you have to admit.

Usually you'll get the Flintstones kind of logic to explain cars, etc. I can understand if they make references to movies by slipping it in dialog a la Shrek. . But it is basically understood in the film that they actually watched the movies they are quoting. That's just lame. Why are they singing 'Car Wash' at the end of the movie? Oscar worked in a Whale Wash. But even forgetting that they don't even bother to be creative the story is just tedious. This is just some a scam film they can lure you in with the pedigree of big name stars doing the voices and the studio's past success with the Shrek franchise.

","I'm not lying when I say that this movie is my all-time favorite movie. I have watched it almost every week ever since it came out on DVD, and still I can't wait until the next time I watch it. I hardly EVER buy movies on DVD; usually movies for me are one-time events. But Shark Tale was just so funny and overall such a good movie.<br/><br/>First of all, everyone seems to be saying that this is a knock-off Finding Nemo. Yes, it is an animated underwater film and just so happened to be released after Nemo. But they have completely different plot lines, and I must say that I enjoyed this FAR more than Nemo. Shark Tale also related their society to the human world- restaurants, shopping centers, newscasters, police, traffic.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that this is by no means a children's movie. I'm not quite an adult, but I'm in high school, and this is certainly a movie for the whole family. My little siblings (my youngest 7) love it, along with my parents (in their 40's). We all like different things about it, laugh at different parts, and relate to different themes. There's something in this movie for everybody.<br/><br/>The animation is gorgeous and the voices are perfect. There is such a good cast in this movie, and they all seem to fit so nicely together. Will Smith is stellar for this role, Oscar's personality in the movie reminds me of Smith's role in the Fresh Prince -- the unlucky, awkward-with-girls, yet very likable kind of guy. Angelina Jolie as the seductive snob is priceless. Renee Zellweger's sweet sarcastic voice defines Angie's personality. Robert De Niro, in my opinion, seems to portray the perfect protective Italian father (Meet the Parents & Meet the Falkers). Jack Black was hilarious as Lenny.<br/><br/>As for the plot, I'm not going to pretend it's the first time I've seen it. But you can't expect not to see reoccurring themes. The thing that set Shark Tale aside from movies similar to it is the HUMOR and CREATIVITY. Applying this plot to the ocean made this movie so funny. So many jokes are thrown in that sometimes I catch them for the first time, my thousandth time watching. Every moment has you on your toes, not always for the plot, but for the humor that you know is going to continue throughout the movie. I could watch one scene over all day, and chances are I would laugh every time.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fantastic. It's great to watch with the family, and it's definitely something to watch again."
"Derek237","6","2","3","5 July 2006"," The cinematic equivalent of fish food
","Okay, so let's pretend for a minute that a wizard or something cast a spell on all of humanity and we were all turned into fish and had to live underwater, but had to cope with it in some way. This new world would look something like the one in Shark Tale. They're fish, but they seem a lot more like people anyway (and most of the characters resemble the actors who provide their voices). It's the same principle as The Flintstones, really, except with a nautical theme instead of a prehistoric one; instead of seeing Ed Sullistone on TV, we see Katie Current. You get it.<br/><br/>The movie itself is generally pretty silly. It's not like Finding Nemo, a good family movie that all ages could enjoy, it's aimed more at the kids. It has silly jokes and cheap laughs, but the satire in the plot would most likely go over kids' heads. And even some of the smaller gags will not make any sense, as I really doubt any kids watching this have ever seen A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, or, well, actually, some may have seen Gladiator. The boys, at least. But never mind that all. Because it has enough silliness to distract the kids and annoy the adults.<br/><br/>The cast is great, I'll admit that. It is definitely the highlight of the movie. Whoever thought of using director Martin Scorsese's voice? He is such a great director, but does have that unique voice, added to the fact that DeNiro, who starred in many of his most popular films, plays a role- I just think it was a great idea. But, that does bring me to a big nitpick of mine: If you had DeNiro and Scorsese together in an animated feature, such as this, wouldn't you want to have their characters interact more? They have only have two scenes together (3 if you count one with their characters talking on the phone- and since it's an animated film with only their voices anyway, why wouldn't you count it?) and they were just stupid. It was kind of like a pathetic, dumbed-down version of the ""Who's on first"" thing.<br/><br/>I don't really think Shark Tale was a bad movie, but with CGI films increasing and increasing in releases, this will be one that probably won't be remembered as well as some others. It was really just a silly cartoon, and you can't really read too much into it. And it's not a movie you need to devote much attention to. It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of fish food. It keeps the fish alive and everything, but I don't think the fish really rave about the flavour. It works, it's fine, but it doesn't stand out.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

","The animation's not that bad though I can understand why some people think otherwise. The voice acting and characters are pretty decent and the story's ok but some of the characters are unlikable and have questionable motives. Will Smith voices Oscar, a working-class fish trying to live a better life while working at a whale wash to pay off his debt he acquired from his boss. Supporting him is his co-worker Angie (Renee Zellweger) who gives him a pearl which he uses to bet on a horse race rather than pay off his debt as originally intended. Actions like those make Oscar selfish, unlikable and hard to root for. On top of that his design may turn viewers off. It never bothered me though.<br/><br/>Things however look up for him though as he leads a shark that intended to kill him to his death by an anchor leading everyone to think he's the ""Shark Slayer"". using his newfound attention he sets out to create a better life for himself while also enjoying the rewards that come out of his lie. Unfortunately this attracts the attention of mob boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro) who sets out to find out who the killer is and punish him while also looking for is son Lenny (Jack Black) who faked his death with the help of Oscar to start a new life as a vegetarian after his father disapproves of his decision. Will he tell the truth and risk everything of keep it a secret and live the lie? I think you know where this goes. There're a lot of puns based on celebrities and brands and they can either come off as funny or just annoying product placement. It's not one of Dreamworks greatest but I enjoyed it as a kid and I think it's ok."

","This CG animated feature can't boast a truly great story, but it does go far enough on the abilities of its very well chosen cast. It stars Will Smith as the voice of Oscar, a tongue scrubber at a ""whale wash"" in an undersea kingdom. Oscar talks big and dreams big, and is tired of being a ""nobody"". So when one of the sons of great white godfather Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) perishes, Oscar takes credit for killing the shark, and becomes the toast of the town. He also becomes friends with Lenny (voice of Jack Black), Don Linos' wimpy, vegetarian son.<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" is good entertainment overall, with plenty of amusing character design, and a respectable amount of energy. The filmmakers do come up with a lot of chuckle-inducing jokes, both verbal and visual. But the real hook is in hearing various actors play animated sharks as mobsters. On one level, the movie is okay viewing for younger viewers (although it might be somewhat intense for the youngest of them), and on another level, it's savvy comedy for grownups, with references to well known mob movies of the past.<br/><br/>Smith is a real live wire as the fast talking Oscar, De Niro is a pleasure, and Renee Zellweger is appealing as Angie, Oscars' co-worker who's really in love with him. Angelina Jolie is just right as the self-serving, seductive fish who only attaches herself to Oscar when she thinks he's going places. Various other familiar voices here, too: Peter Falk, Michael Imperioli, Vincent Pastore, and Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug as a pair of Rastafarian jellyfish. It's a particular treat to hear the master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who lends his voice to Sykes, a frequently flustered puffer fish.<br/><br/>The hip, catchy soundtrack also helps to make this an agreeable 90 minute long outing.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","1","8 June 2016"," It was the Oscar for ""Finding Nemo"", and Finding Money for Oscar...
","Whatever the differences between Disney's Pixar and DreamWorks Studios are in terms of animation and types of stories, I don't think they have been more opposite as when they were fully expressed by the two rival studios when they coincidentally decided to handle the aquatic world, in a one-year interval: ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003 and ""Shark Tale"" in 2004. If it is a coincidence or a case of some 'leaks' (no pun intended) doesn't really matter as the two films don't navigate in the same seas. <br/><br/>Starting with Disney, ""Finding Nemo"" was a charming and heart-warming tale about a father fish looking for his missing (and titular) son, while the son was trying to escape from a fish tank. The story featured some of the most dazzling images ever created by Disney Studios, with the same hypnotic beauty as ""The Little Mermaid"" and a story that emotionally resonated like Disney's old-school movies, such as ""Dumbo' or ""Bambi"". For a film made In 2003, to be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated movies proved the impression the movie left among the professionals.<br/><br/>On the other hand, DreamWorks has always been about very flawed and loose characters engaged into story lines that worked more as vehicles for countless pop- culture references, remember the ""Shrek vs. Robin Hood"" fight with the whole River Dance and the ""Matrix"" parody, or the fairy tale creatures featured in very modern situation? Well, the counterpart of ""Finding Nemo"", titled ""Shark Tale"" isn't much a story set in the Ocean than all the narrative fragments of other classics reassembled to form a seemingly story. It doesn't strike for its originality (""Shrek"" made the AFI's Top 10, not this one) but the creators seem to have built the fun on our recognition of the many movies or pop-cultures elements they refer to.<br/><br/>Indeed, there is no situation that is not archetypal, no character-type you haven't seen before. In fact, even the characters look exactly like the actors voicing them. So, if you don't have Scorsese's voice in mind, (which would be surprising) you might recognize his fishy alter-ego from his huge bushy eyebrows just like De Niro's shark has a mole, and Jolie's fish huge sensual lips. That's it, it's déjà vu from beginning to end, even the title is a take on De Niro's father-and-son movie ""A Bronx Tale"". But guess what? the story works nonetheless and this is why I'm surprised by Roger Ebert's review, or personal take on the film.<br/><br/>The late critic, who could be wrong but not very often, deplored that ""Shark Tale"" with all its references to classics like ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"" and of course ""Jaws"" (the inevitable one, even parodied in ""Nemo"" and that grabbed the earlier laughs in that one), there's nothing left for the usual universal and simpler material that can appeal to children. And he's right. I'm pretty sure that if I was 10 when I saw ""Shark Tale"", I wouldn't have gotten most of the references, and I would have probably enjoyed like I enjoyed 'Fish Police'. However, I was 22 when the film was released, so I guess I was in the right demographic target.<br/><br/>Indeed, my cinematic education, if not complete, was mature enough to get most of the jokes, to instantly recognize De Niro behind Don Lino's mimics and having ""The Godfather"" as my all-time favorite increased the enjoyment. Gee, I was even a fan of ""Car Wash"" at that time so I didn't miss any reference. And how could I? ""Shark Tale"" is one pop-culture reference after another, it almost becomes a gimmick. And I understand that for some viewers, it might get tiresome, once you have played the spot-the-star game and managed to guess Jack Black or Renee Zelwegger; you want the story to grab you a little, and it does, sort of.<br/><br/>There are basically two plots: Oscar, a whale washer, is a nobody trying to be somebody with a sort of end-justifying-the-means way, ignoring the cute assistant in love with him, and there is Lenny, the vegetarian shark who disappoints his Godfather- like father, Don Lino. The two plots get intertwined with a share of unevenly predictable twists, but let's not kid ourselves, the whole story is rather predictable, countless mafia parodies have been made, including ""Analyze This"" a few years before, but the script overcomes the predictable stuff by providing some nice one- liners and funny moments, and such lousy puns they miraculously work.<br/><br/>The whole thing leads to the kind of conclusion that comforts that this was not a film to take seriously in the first place, it's meant to be fun. Now, to get back to Ebert's comment, yes, he's right that the film doesn't find the right touch to appeal children, and on that level, it would be an average film. But once you get the idea that this is not a film for kids, but for adults young adults or adults adults, its quality suddenly improves. It's all a matter of angle.<br/><br/>And at least, it didn't try to emulate ""Finding Nemo"", and had instead a sleazier ""Finding Money"" story line (and I'm sorry for the lousiness of this pun)."

","I honestly think that this is one of the Dreamworks Animation films that is nowhere near among their best. But it still is entertaining and fun.<br/><br/>Will Smith stars as the voice of Oscar, a fish who seems content with just working at a whale wash. He keeps coming up with these ideas to make a quick buck that never pan out. They cause him to owe a substantial amount of money to his boss, Mr. Sykes. However, we find out that he really wants more out of life.<br/><br/>When he has the money he owes ready to turn in, he ends up betting it instead. First, it causes a fish named Lola to be attracted to him. Then, the seahorse he bets on loses causing him to be tortured by Sykes's jellyfish assistants until some sharks come to attack him. One of them dies. The jellyfish think Oscar killed the shark. Oscar goes with their assumption.<br/><br/>This causes him to live a huge lie. In order for the other fish to not find out, he must conceal with the other shark, Lenny, voiced by Jack Black. However, Oscar's close friend Angie, voiced by Renée Zellweger, finds out about Oscar's and Lenny's act and also has to keep it a secret.<br/><br/>It's basically a fun story about a fish who keeps telling lie after lie in order to keep his reputation as the Shark Slayer. While it is not the best of Dreamworks, there is still some fun to it.<br/><br/>My likes: I thought it was cool how the city that the film takes place in looks like an underwater version of New York City. I thought it was cool how the animation was able to capture the look of Times Square and make it look like a city for fish. I also liked seeing the sharks as a representation of the mafia. It was a great fit seeing how dominant sharks are. I also thought the actors all fit the characters they were voicing, especially Robert De Niro as Don Lino.<br/><br/>My dislikes: I thought there were too many pop culture references. There were way too many lines and scenes that were referencing other films or related to modern culture. Most of the references will not be relevant 10, 20 years from now. The story drags at many times and throws off the pace of the film."

"general-melchett","7","1","1","27 January 2007"," Close, but no cigar...
","Okay, first off, let me point this out to you - Shark Tale is not like Finding Nemo! The plots of the two films are completely different, as are the characters, the situations, and the settings. Finding Nemo encourages the idea of a wide open, empty yet interesting undersea world, whereas Shark Tale encourages the idea of a fish city with a Whale Wash and celebrity town. And unfortunately, it is probably this that ensured Shark Tale was not going to go down as well as Finding Nemo. The film was by no means a disaster (a $300 million box office gross is better than most), but it relied too much on gags, coolness and insanity rather than any real character and intelligence. Though it is very inspired and looks riveting on the big screen, it just doesn't have the ability to touch or grip as much as Finding Nemo. Though there's far more plot and a real dark side to this fish world (shark mafia, anyone?), Finding Nemo did better because it feels more like real life. And though neither of the two films are in the slightest bit realistic, Finding Nemo managed to turn a simple plot into a fun adventure, whereas Shark Tale turns several plots into an array of endless gags, jokes and stupidity. Though I found this far more hilarious than Finding Nemo and a really interesting depiction of an undersea world, Finding Nemo had more realistic animation and characters you could really care about - and not through endless jokes, gags or slapstick scenarios, just plain real life. Shark Tale seems more obsessed with being a cross between FN and The Godfather, and while it does pull off this job with hilarious results, everything is a bit too predictable and easily resolved. And at the end of the day, this really is just your standard animated flick. As James Bond would put it: ""Close, but no cigar."" Dreamworks - you're not quite in the same league as Pixar in animation yet... 7/10"

"Buddy-51","7","1","1","30 June 2005"," The True Chicken of the Sea
","Set on a reef that resembles a pulsating, bustling, underwater Manhattan, ""Shark Tale"" is a reasonably diverting DreamWorks film that makes up in charm what it lacks in Shrek-level sophistication. Lets' face it: the ""Shrek"" movies have set the bar awfully high for animated features and it's hard not to compare every new one that comes our way with those earlier works. Even with that caveat, ""Shark Tale"" still manages to involve us in the world it's created and to make us laugh from time to time.<br/><br/>Lenny (voiced by Jack Black) is the ultimate evolutionary anomaly - a great white shark who just happens to be a vegetarian. This is a particularly dicey problem because Lenny is no ordinary, run-of-the-mill shark; he is the son and heir apparent of a Don Corleone-type mob boss (Robert De Niro) who worries that his son may not have what it takes to assume his rightful place as ""godfather"" of the sea. Down at the very opposite end of the food chain is Oscar, a fast-talking, self-described ""little fish in a very big pond,"" voiced by none other than mega-star Will Smith. All his life, Oscar has felt like an unappreciated ""nobody,"" until, one day, through an utter fluke of fate, he inadvertently finds himself heralded as a fearless ""shark slayer,"" a position that gets him into deep trouble when De Niro and his henchmen descend on the reef looking to stir up a little trouble with the defenseless locals..<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" doesn't have quite the sharpness and wit of certain recent animated films, but it is fast-paced and clever enough to keep us entertained for most of its running time. Many of the gangster movie references may be lost on younger viewers, but adults will smile in knowing recognition at the gentle bits of parody thrown in from time to time (we finally get to see that Luca's been doing more than just sleeping with the fishes all these years). The film is lovely to look at, with the urban aquatic landscape beautifully rendered in multi-colored splendor. The three leading actors provide lively and energetic voice work and they are matched by Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese and Katie Couric in somewhat lesser roles.<br/><br/>As stated before, ""Shark Tale"" is no ""Shrek"" in either the cleverness or laughs departments, but it should keep young and old alike entertained if not exactly enthralled."

","Under The Sea<br/><br/>by Amber Farnham<br/><br/>Will Smith's recent DVD release Shark Tale is unlike his other movies. The wonderful cast in this movie leads you to believe that it will be wonderful, but don't let that deceive you. For a Will Smith movie, it is okay, but that is not saying much. Will Smith plays Oscar, a fish that is lower than whale poop on the food chain and wishes to claw his way up to the top of the reef. He works at the local whale wash where he has the most demeaning joba tongue scrubber. Then one day, when he is in the wrong place at the wrong time, he takes responsibility for the death of the heir of the shark mafia. Being the first fish to ever kill a shark, Oscar achieves his dream and lives at the top of the reef known as the ""shark slayer"" and ""defender of the reef."" It is only after a little bit of time that before Don Lino, the Godfather of the shark mafia finds out who is responsible for the death of his son. He is depressed not only because of his loss, but because now his other son, Lenny, will become the new boss. <br/><br/>Lenny is in trouble too. Incapable of being a shark, he is a shame to his family and decides to run away. In the reef he meets up with Oscar and they come up with a plan to ""kill"" Lenny and heighten Oscar's fame. Their plan soon backfires because it is impossible to keep this charade up. <br/><br/>All in all, the animation of this movie is wonderful. I loved how the animators basically took New York City and splashed it in the ocean. Time Square and its surroundings were constructed out of coral and all of the inhabitants of this city were fish, a personal favorite was Katie Current (played by Katie Courric). The plot of this movie is not spectacular, but at parts it is mildly funny. The movie plays a lot off of American pop culture and many of the jokes are more immature than most are used to. <br/><br/>One big problem in the movie is all of the advertising. Every scene contained an advertisement. This fact plus the terrible storyline leads me to think that the advertisements were how the filmmakers made their money off of this movie. <br/><br/>In one word, I would describe this movie as ""cute."" It made me laugh and it was amusing, but this did not make up for all the advertising in the movie. I would recommend this movie for children who do not have great expectations of the movies they watch, otherwise, stay away from this movie."

","One Friday night I was sitting at home when my phone rang. It was two friends of mine asking me to see a movie with them. I went online and checked the movie schedule and noticed a severe lack of movies that three intelligent sixteen-year-olds would really be interested in seeing, but as it was a Friday night and all of us were sitting home alone, we settled on Shark Tale. During and after the movie I was pleasantly surprised to find that Shark Tale was far more enjoyable than any of us had imagined. We have all been quoting it for a week.<br/><br/>When reading the reviews, I was extremely surprised and annoyed to find that most of the people writing these reviews see it as a cheap Finding Nemo copy. To be frank, that is what I originally imagined it would be, but after seeing the movie, my mind has been changed. The fact is that Shark Tale and Finding Nemo are far too different to be compared. Granted there are similarities, but they are things like: they are both set under the sea, and the main character of both is a fish. Using these kinds of comparisons, I could say that Dog Day Afternoon is a copycat of Bonnie and Clyde because the main characters of each movie are bank robbers, and they are shot in the end. Like those of Dog Day Afternoon and Bonnie and Clyde, the plots of Shark Tale and Finding Nemo bare very little in common. A basic outline of the plot to finding Nemo is a little fish is lost and his dad swims across the ocean looking for him. I don't know about you, but to me that shows little resemblance to Shark Tale, where a fish pretends he kills a shark so that he will gain money, power, and respect. The only thing they have in common is the word fish. I can understand that people would not be fans of Shark Tale, but to say that it is a copy of Finding Nemo is just ridiculous, and anyone who actually paid attention to the movie will tell you so.<br/><br/>Overall, I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun movie. It was definitely worth the time and money I spent to watch it."

Their father was played by Robert De Niro ... what on earth was he thinking? <br/><br/>So the tiny fish that was being chased by the shark becomes known as a shark-slayer and reaches hero status in the reef. He even becomes the face of Coca-Cola (no, really) but eventually comes clean to be with the one he loves and to lead a more humble life ... running a whale-washing business (no, really).<br/><br/>Don't even bother with this weak, shallow little effort.

","The people who made this film and written are no professionals. This is a film about a fish called Oscar who is a hero because everyone thinks he killed a shark. Shark Tale is voiced by several stars (Robert De Niro, Jack black, Will Smith, Renee Zellweger) and even with good old Martin Scorcese. I am very disappointed in them for wasting their time on this joke.<br/><br/>The story is simple and easy to write and you know why? Because the fish are just like humans. They have trash cans, modern houses and TVs, playstations, electricity etc underwater!! I think they really over-exaggerated here. Finding Nemo was great not only because of the story, but it was very realistic with everything; colour, animation etc. This world the fish live in is as though it was fish in this world instead of humans and that they knew how to fly. Colour was good, but much too colourful for me. They rip off dialogue, music and other stuff from great films like The Godfather, Jaws, Apocalypse Now etc. There are a few funny moments, but overall the humour is lame and totally unsuccessful as to being hilarious.<br/><br/>Also, this film is a bit too inappropriate for kids. Sure, maybe some crude humour here and there, but rude dialogue and a sexy fish (if you saw this you will know what I mean) and the ridiculous idea of a shark that says he is a vegetarian? What were the writers thinking? I don't know. Maybe they were not thinking at all.<br/><br/>I do not see how this could be nominated for best animated feature Oscar. I would expect something like this to get nominated a razzie award. This film is strictly for immature people, especially immature teenagers."

","A mafia film of sorts, set underwater and with fish. Will Smith is Oscar, a fish that lies about killing a shark. The shark was actually killed by a dropped anchor, yet Oscar was at the scene and is now known as the Sharkslayer. Mob Boss Robert DeNiro hears about his son's death and takes matters into his own hands, this doesn't bode well for Oscar.<br/><br/>Shark Tale at first glance seems to be a mere rip off of Finding Nemo. The Pixar film that had fish as their main characters was charming, funny and adventurous. It's not fair to compare the two, since this film lacks all of those ingredients. Shark Tale instead relies on pop-culture references to get the adults smirking and the bright colourful fish to get the kids wanting the toys. The story, the animation and the fun are all below the bar. With every film that is released by Dreamworks, the inevitable will happen. People will compare it to Pixar. Pixar is simply in another league, they seem to care about their stories and characters and not just having a bunch of people cash in on the current craze. <br/><br/>Shark Tale has an impressive cast, if this were a live action dramatic film, starring Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro and was directed by Scoresese, then we might have a masterpiece on our hands. Alas, the actors of this world think that just because they lend their voice to an animated character, that their job is half done for them. Jack Black works in this film, even DeNiro, who plays up on his past roles. Jolie, Zellweger and Smith do not. They have nothing to add to the film that some nameless actress/actor could have done. <br/><br/>There is no sense of adventure. We are trapped under the sea instead of exploring the depths of this world. It was interesting to see the fish life here, but I'm sure we've all seen creative takes on modern life in a film that has an odd setting, The Flinstones is famous for this. <br/><br/>I still hear people talking about Finding Nemo today, hell even older animated films like Toy Story, but Shark Tale seemed to have faded the next day after the release. It's not memorable to kids, nor will adults find any real charm or wit. The film tries to hard with a lot of the jokes and references that it becomes tiresome. <br/><br/>Shark Tale fails because it would rather have big name stars on the poster, than a tangible and interesting story. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, what matters most in a film is the story. Sure, it can be done before, but as long as the story teller and the story telling is good and has my interest, I'm game. Shark Tale did none of this and it felt lazy, much like the cast."

","""Shark Tale"" is a very entertaining movie suitable for most ages. The acting is very good and the dialog is excellent. An unusual lot of stars in the cast who seems to have had a lot of fun in their roles. Will Smith is the same as always. The movies suffers mainly from three things:<br/><br/>* Oscar, the main character, is somewhat ugly designed, looking like a dragon fish with a Will Smith-mask pasted on. Some of the other characters are also a bit too human-like, I'm thinking about the character Lola. She is as close to sexy as a ... fish ... can get, and fish aren't supposed to be sexy.<br/><br/>* The soundtrack contains a lot of RNB and hip-hop. While I don't like these genres very much in general, in my opinion they are especially bad as movie music and makes for a lot of the movie to feel like a stereotypical RNB music video.<br/><br/>* What with all the chairs and seats? Fish usually don't sit and it looks very uncomfortable when they do.<br/><br/>The setting is fun, very similar to ""Finding Nemo"", except with a lot more characters, and city-like environments, involved. ""Shark Tale"" is slightly more cartoonish and pop-ish, and with more anatomically incorrect character designs. The cinematics and animation are beautiful and imaginative.<br/><br/>The story is a standard ""things are bad/things get good/things get worse/things get perfect/happy ending"" story, not very unpredictable but both the comic and dramatic segments work fine together.<br/><br/>No masterpiece but definitely not a waste of time. It does not really have the kind of ""soul"" that makes some movies lovable.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10."

Will Smith is totally unfunny, as usual, and is as amusing as a cheesegrater rubbing on a bunion. Smart alec remarks that are stale, and all the sparkling wit of a mouldy cabbage. Really third rate and poor. This only goes to show how really wonderfully talented Eddie Murphy [whom he obviously hopes to emulate here] in Shrek is.

Well, that idea sure has damaged some brains out there because people ENJOYED this piece of sh*t.

","The first thing to say about this film is that although many of the jokes are ""in"" references that kids could never understand (like ""Shrek""), kids seem to love the movie anyway (like ""Shrek""). A lot of good voice talent was assembled for this movie; I don't think the plot was terribly original or even important to the appeal of the film. Mostly it is just fun to look at; CGI works really well for the underwater setting. The film is fast-paced enough to keep you going to the end. <br/><br/>It's doubtful that very many kids will grow up to consider this one of their cherished films of childhood.

Maybe i've been spoiled by Pixar movies and Shrek, but it was just lousy. And, what was the deal with having to have the fish have Will Smith's head on it? Were they afraid that the general public was too stupid to recognize his voice, so they had to super-impose his face on the fish? Whatever it was, it just looked awkward.<br/><br/>And, the product placement in this movie was really shameful. Can Will Smith ever do a movie that isn't one giant commercial? Sure, instead of Coca-Cola it was Coral-Cola, and instead of Krispy Kreme, it was Kelpy Kremes, but you get the idea.

","I thought that this movie was absolutely cold. It was a gangster film, and it was always on the edge of violence; for instance one character actually dies, and they kept trying to kill the Will Smith character. The audience we sat with was very quiet throughout the entire movie. Usually, when we go to an animated film such as this, the audience is more lively, and responds to what's happening on the screen, not so with this production. It also is important that the character voice overs are just that, and no one to really root for. It seemed like the film kept the audience at arms length because there was no character growth or interest. This movie was obviously an allusion to the Godfather, which was not a comedy. They kept saying you are going to sleep with the fishes. It wasn't funny in the Godfather, and it wasn't funny here. This is supposed to be a kid's movie, remember? When will the kids movies actually be for the kids?"

His home was taken from him by the Government for the sake of gentrification and since then he has lived a life of poverty. Despite his poor living conditions he is still willing to stand up to the man and defend his rights as an African American.<br/><br/>In the movie he desperately craves fame and wealth, and is willing to betray his fellow hood-members to do so. This eventually comes back to hurt him, however, when his lies are discovered by the masses and he learns his lesson that black fish have to stick up for one another.<br/><br/>An example of this movie, nay film's brilliance can be seen in the opening sequence, when a Japanese fish is seen opening his sushi restaurant, only to be disappointed at the lack of customers, showing the hatred immigrants experience in modern America.<br/><br/>Another excellent piece of satire is the deuteragonist Lenny, whomst wishes to become a vegan, however pressure form his shark supremacist father prevents him from doing so. This sub plot ends with Lenny accepting his true self and coming out of the vegan closet to his father. Alas, if only real life were that simple.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is perfect for this masterpiece, as it's hip hop roots give the viewer that this series is really taking place in the ghetto.<br/><br/>The secondary villain of the story, ""Female Fish"" seduces Will Smith into sacrificing everyone he has in order to get more money, however he eventually resists her and becomes friends with his old hood-mates once more, this being an astounding reference to the Shakespeare quote ""bros before hos"".<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a master piece, satarising the civil rights movement of the 1960's and is a much watch for any anti-Trump African-American with common sense!!"

Kiddies may not understand all the references to other movies, notably ""The Godfather"" and ""Wiseguys"" although ""The Sopranos"" and ""Gladiator"" are also parodied and they will definitely not understand the subtleties of Lenny ""coming out"" to his father about his secret lifestyle but these add to the entertainment for adults.

1. Will Smith (Oscar), Martin Scorsese (Sykes), and Jack Black (Lenny) all deliver great voice-acting performances.

3. The soundtrack is fun and bouncy and gives the film an airy and light-hearted feel.
4. The humour is mostly slap-stick and lands well for the most part.
5. The ending is largely satisfying and ends the movie on a suitably heartfelt note.
6. Will Smith and Jack Black have really good chemistry with each other.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. The animation is extremely dated and at times, the animation is incredibly distractingly bad.
2. There are a few plot-holes here-and-there: How did Lenny pass as a dolphin, when he's quite clearly painted blue? How did Lenny one-bite through a steel anchor chain? How did Don Lino (Robert De Niro) not know who the shark slayer was at first, when he was being promoted everywhere throughout the media?
3. Angelina Jolie (Lola) gives a rather lacklustre voice-acting performance.
4. Some of the comedy is inserted rather forcefully and jarringly.
5. At the end when Oscar finally comes clean about lying about slaying sharks, everyone just accepts it and he faces no ramifications. It's rather unbelievable."

","The stories about how the main characters who get popular, through either the truth or a lie, are interesting to see how they would handle it. Especially to see if they would feel initially grateful, to then start to have doubts, if it is right or wrong in what the main characters do. As often their parents, their friends or even their fiancés would react in the negative way, to disagree with the popularity of the main characters. Then in the end the main characters would take the decision, by either remaining as popular as the people recognize, or giving everything up to follow a different life and try to do the right thing. The DreamWorks Animation have been interested to develop a story with this theme, but set the story underworld of the sea, as the fishes and other undersea creatures are the characters to be followed in the story. By relating the audience with the way the characters do around in the television, shops, advertisements, journalisms and so on. The filmmakers Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman have been involved as the directors of the project, by trying to develop the story in the creative way as well as in the profound way. The movie has been elaborated with the settings and with the characters, in every single details of the animation in the creative and in the colorful way. After a long time of work, in 2004 came out Shark Tale by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman, with Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and Martin Scorsese. The movie's plot: In the underworld of the sea, the son of the shark mob boss Frankie (Michael Imperioli) gets accidentally killed by an anchor, while he was hunting with his vegetarian brother Lenny (Jack Black). The young fish Oscar (Will Smith) is found in the scene, as he takes advantage by telling a lie that he killed Frankie. While Oscar gets popular like he's a kind of superhero, the boss mob Don Lino (Robert De Niro) seeks vengeance by trying to find Oscar, who gets then called the Sharkslayer. The premise of the movie seems to be interesting, to give the audience some reflections about the popularity. As the animation of the movie has been elaborated, to be as detailed as possible in the colorful way, by making the story funny and in the same way emotional. Especially in the moments where the characters are taking some important choices, to see if they are going to do the right thing or the wrong thing. The movie from the beginning to the end, entertains the audience with funny as well as thrilling moments, which are fused with humor and rhythmic songs. As these elements capture the audience attention, to be perfect as a family movie. But there should have been more exploration, about the lives of the people in different social classes, by making clear if there are some people who want to believe in a big dream, or even what they hope for their future. Will Smith has done a well done performance as Oscar, a young fish who works in the Whale Wash as tongue scrubber and he wants to be loved as much as some popular celebrities. Oscar's biggest influence has always been his father, who was the number one tongue scrubber. Once Oscar gets popular from a lie, he would be initially so happy, to be loved by everyone, until he realizes that is better to be honest, rather than to be a fake image. Even there should have been more details, about the way Oscar lives to see how difficult his situation is, before he gets popular. As well as there should have been sequences, about how the relationship between Oscar and his father, was more or less close with each other. Another more or less sequences which could make the movie interesting, is since Oscar gets popular how he would use the money to make more or less kindness on the people who need help. Robert De Niro did an excellent performance as Don Lino, a shark boss mob who takes care about his sons Frankie and Lenny. Even Don Lino's relationship with his son Lenny is difficult, as he hopes Lenny would become a strong shark like Frankie. Since Don Lino has heard about the popularity on Oscar as the Sharkslayer, his anger would increase to seek the vengeance with no mercy. Even there should have been more details, about the relationship with Don Lino's family, to see how close he is with his family, as well as how his anger would grow in every steps. In the same way, there should have been some flashbacks about Don Lino's father, to see if there are more or less parallelism on the relationship between him and his son Lenny. Renée Zellweger did an interesting performance as Angie, a young fish who is the best friend and colleague of Oscar. Angie is the one to believe in Oscar, as well as she is the one who would make Oscar reflect about the choices he takes. Even there should have been more details, about how Angie hopes to get close to him with love. As well as about what Angie's family think about the way, she moves forward with her choices. Angelina Jolie has done a well done performance as Lola, a seductive fish who pays attention only on the popularity. Since Oscar gets popular, Lola starts to have a romantic relationship, which would cause a problem between Oscar and Angie. Even there should have been more details, about the way Lola lives, as well as if she is following a particular lifestyle. To see if Lola lives in a more or less illusory life, or even if she is more or less involved with the mob sharks. Jack Black did an excellent performance as Lenny, a vegetarian shark and son of Don Lino. Since the death of Frankie, Lenny leaves Don Lino to disappear, as he cannot be as strong as his brother Frankie. Since he finds out the popularity of Oscar, Lenny befriends with him. Even there should have been more details, about when Lenny has started to be vegetarian, to see also who has influenced him to be different from Frankie. As well as what Lenny wishes to become, rather than to become a mob like his brother and especially like his father. Martin Scorsese has done a well done performance as Sykes, the owner of the Whale Wash. Sykes is also the loan shark for which he asks Oscar to find 5.000 clams, to pay a debt to the sharks, after he had been fired by Don Lino. Even there should have been more details, about how Sykes met Don Lino and how the business of Whale Wash has started. To see also how the business keeps moving forward, either in the good or even in the bad way. Shark Tale is an entertaining colorful movie perfect as family movie, filled with humor and rhythmic songs. But the movie has some unanswered questions, which the characters could have been better developed."

","This film is definitely worth a watch. The characters are engaging but simple, the best of which is probably Lenny the shark because he is the more complex and relatable character. The graphics leave a bit to be desired, simply because they are quite childish and 2 dimensional rather than attempting to look immersive and 3D. There was the odd funny moment, but most of the humour was aimed at kids and so it wasn't all that great. It's probably a good film to see with your kid, but probably wouldn't merit a second viewing."

And all those puns and pop culture references are just cringeworthy.<br/><br/>The under water world was kind of creative at times, but not that special, but the character designs were horrible.

I am just going to talk about characters and I few scenes but no more ""main points"". What I will tell you is that Oscar is a ""whale wash"" worker. You'll find out what I mean by that.

The brother of Jack Black's character is the main part of this and Oscar tries to make up a story of what happened and calls himself ""The Shark Slayer"".

","This film has all the classic Disney elements that we've all grown to loathe so much: loud, obnoxious pop-culture references, a story-line so weak that it assumes the viewer has no intelligence and the ever-so-popular product tie-in placements in your face. It doesn't matter that some of the letters have been changed to make a pun; everyone still recognizes the brand and the effect is achieved.<br/><br/>I grant that in watching any of the animated movies you have to suspend a certain amount of belief, but do I have to pretend I'm stupid, also? The final wrapup was so contrived that it wouldn't have played any worse if Dreamworks had chosen to have sharks all come out of the water and take jobs as stockbrokers in New York.<br/><br/>I wish I had read some reviews before going to see this movie but I was duped by the name (they made Shrek, right?) and current quality trend in animated features from Pixar and Dreamworks. A waste of a talented cast all playing caricatures of their famous roles. Often, this can be funny as a passing reference but grows really tiresome after five minutes. Is there any doubt Will Smith can voice the Fresh Prince, Robert DiNero a mobster, Angolina Jolie a golddigging temptress, etc.? Have the kids really seen these movies? Who is this aimed at? It is certainly not on an adult level.<br/><br/>Message to Dreamworks: Lose the commercial endorsements. It's bad enough that we'll all be beleaguered with them for six month afterwards for free; we don't need to spend the ninety minutes that we paid for with them in our faces also!<br/><br/>Message to Everyone Else: Save your money-go rent Toy Story or Nemo again!"

","Excellent animated feature that many have shunned because they feel it paints a stereotypical picture of Italian-Americans and African-Americans. Ignore those people who overlook the vivid animated characters, the highly creative style, the smart story, the strong social messages, the smashing soundtrack and the wonderfully hilarious moments which combine to create a picture that has a little something for audiences of all ages. A two-bit fish (voiced by the always enthralling Will Smith) who works at a place where whales are cleaned constantly dreams of a better life. His life is not all that bad to start with as he has loads of friends and is secretly loved from afar by one of his fish co-workers (voiced by Renee Zellweger). Across the New York-style underwater scene a meek shark (brilliantly voiced by Jack Black) tries to be himself, but does not fit in with his father's (the always rough Robert DeNiro who dominates once again) ""family and associates"". An odd twist will bring Smith and Black's characters together and everything in the exact landscape of the picture will be turned upside down. The voice characterizations (which also includes Martin Scorsese, Angelina Jolie, Peter Falk, Doug E. Doug, Katie Couric and a whole host of others) are right on target as the actors match their animated alter egos perfectly. The creativity of the film is second-to-none. This is a project that swims like a gold medal winner from the starting gun. 5 stars out of 5."

","This is probably one of the worst movies of 2004. I gave it a the lowest rating because it was very painful to watch. It was slow, boring, stupid, and, most importantly, NOT FUNNY. I love kids movies - I can watch all kinds of ridiculous kid stuff so I can't say I didn't like it ""because it was for kids."" The children in my theater were not entertained in the slightest. The five-year-old next to me was ready to leave about 20 minutes into the movie, and there were babies crying galore from sheer boredom. Finding Nemo this is not! Next to me were also a group of preteens who squealed ""NO THEY DIDN'T!""(directed at the makers of the film I assume) at the end of the movie because the ending is so dumb. There are plenty of ""Godfather"" references that I'm sure anyone that likes comedy will have seen the jokes done before (and better). Most importantly, Will Smith is no comedian. When he sings ""Can't Touch This"" I can't help but think: no kid is going to get that reference, and the adults are going to think it's just plain stupid...isn't that song a little dated? And that's the thing - all the jokes are dated. The romance in the story falls totally flat, and not even the bright animation looks very well done. <br/><br/>If you have kids, pop in a DVD and save your money."

Afterall it was made by DreamWorks which gave us both installations of Shrek and therefor if nothing else, I expected it to be funny.<br/><br/>OK, I'm not going to argue about the animation, because probably most of you saw what computer cgi animation looks like... the main problem with this movie is that it wants to be Ice Age cross Shrek cross Finding Nemo, but in the end it fails as it turns out that people who made Shark Tale are probably the same ones as those from Beauty and the Beast. I mean, you can't make an impression just by terrific animation.<br/><br/>The plot is ... well in one word... ridiculous. No, wait... there is no plot. Something happens and it ends. Be yourself. Don't lie. Get rich quick.

"Rob_Taylor","5","3","9","24 January 2005"," Very hit and miss
","Shark Tale is not a bad film. A lot of thought and effort went into making this picture. Yet, when you sit down and watch it, two things become apparent.<br/><br/>First, and most obviously, the movie is very hit and miss. Some scenes work well, others fall flat or are downright dull and tedious.<br/><br/>Secondly, just who was the target audience? Very small children will, no doubt, appreciate the bright colours and simple action sequences, but if they are the audience, then why so many more adult themes here than, say, in Shrek? If adults were the target group, then why the silliness intended solely for children? In short, it comes across as a film uncertain as to what it was trying to achieve, and who it was primarily aimed at. As a result of this dithering, the film, which could have worked well if a specific audience was targeted, meanders along with little direction and little to keep you watching with anything other than mild interest.<br/><br/>Will Smith reprises his role as The Fresh Prince here verbatim, almost to the point of annoyance. The others mostly have a good time with their voice roles but there aren't really any stand-outs among them, though it was good to hear Peter Falk in a role.<br/><br/>In short, this one is purely for the little kids, who'll no doubt watch it again and again with glee. But for the adults, the humour runs out long before the end of the first viewing. Disappointing."

"JimD73","2","2","5","13 April 2005"," Some Funny Mobster Jokes Can't Keep Shark Tale From Going Belly-Up
","Plot: 8/20: Oscar (Smith) feels like a little fish in a big pond. Literally. In the world of the fishes, he is a simple tongue scrubber at the Whale Wash (a car wash for whales). Oscar also happens to be a rapper wannabe, and his best friend Angie (Zellweger) is secretly in love with home, for a reason that remains a mystery to me. Oscar is sick of living at the bottom and wants to live at the top of the reef, where all the 'somebodys' live.<br/><br/>The sharks, whom all the other fish are afraid of, are essentially the mafia. The current godfather, Don Lino (deNiro) is soon retiring and leaving control of the reef to his two sons, Frankie (Imperioli) and Lenny (Black). Frankie has the brawn for the job, but Lenny, on the other hand, is afraid to eat anything alive, and has become a vegetarian.<br/><br/>Also, Don Lino is cracking down on pufferfish Sykes (Scorsese), who owns the Whale Wash, to pay up for protection. To come up with the money, Sykes cracks down on Oscar to pay the $5000 he owes. Angie lends him the money, but he blows it all on a horse race. When Syke's bodyguards Ernie (Marley) and Bernie (Doug) are torturing Oscar, Frankie is attempting to train Lenny. When he sees Oscar, he tells Lenny to attack. Ernie and Bernie run, but Oscar is tied down. Just so happens that Lenny sets Oscar free instead. When Frankie sees this, he chases Oscar himself, only to be hit by an anchor and killed during the chase. Lenny runs away, and Oscar takes credit for Frankie's death. In doing so, he becomes a phenomenon, the legendary Shark Slayer, and finally lives at the top of the reef.<br/><br/>However, when Don Lino finds out about this, he is going to get very angry<br/><br/>Technically, the plot works. It doesn't come with any clever twists or anything really original. It is a nice send-up of mobster movies, though the rap influence is cringe worthy at time. And by 'at times', I mean through 90% of the movie.<br/><br/>Not to mention the whole ""Be yourself"" message is pretty worn out by now.<br/><br/>Comedy: 12/20: Surprisingly, this movie manages to have some funny bits. However, they only occur when it attempts to satire the mobster movies. Aside from the opening sequence and one or two jokes here and there, all of the comedy is derived from the mobster spoofs. Some are subtle, some are more obvious, but this movie does manange to be a rather clever mobster spoof. Most of this may go over the heads of the younger crowd, but it manages to keep the older crowd interested, at least for those parts.<br/><br/>However, when it tries to put on its pimp face and do the normal silly crap we despise in animated movies, it falls flat on its ass. There is nothing I hated more than seeing a Martin Scorsese voiced pufferfish wearing a pimp hat and touching his butt and saying ""I'm hott!"" It just isn't necessary. It just isn't humane.<br/><br/>Animation: 7/20: DreamWorks made Shrek, and Shrek looked pretty good. Then they made this, and while it holds up to old standards, it isn't all that pleasing to look at. The sharks looks good, but some of the fish, namely Oscar, look pretty bad. They manage to make the characters look like the actors playing them, which works well with people, but bringing the concept over to fish doesn't work as well. A mild taint of the actor is fine, but do not try to recreate the actor. Sykes is probably the only fish who looks good, and the technical crew had better luck with the sharks than the fish.<br/><br/>There were also some major inconsistencies. Oscar's size grows and shrinks multiple times. Sometimes, he's small enough to fit in anywhere. Sometimes, he's big enough to logically fake taking down a shark. They really needed to fix that problem there.<br/><br/>Voice Acting: 13/20: The voice cast has some bright spots. Robert deNiro (Goodfellas) is the obvious choice to spoof many of his old roles, and he does it pretty well. Granted, how hard could it really be? Its voice acting, it doesn't take much talent.<br/><br/>Jack Black (Orange County) is the only real standout. He does a great voice for Lenny, and is the only one who doesn't sound like just his real self.<br/><br/>The rest are mediocre. Scorsese just embarrasses himself with stupid pimp lines. Smith spews out enough bull that he gets on my nerves. No one else really deserves mentioning.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 8/20: If you are in the mood for a gangster spoof, you will find parts of this hilariously entertaining. However, if you are one of these types, chances are the rap influence will just annoy you. Those who enjoy rapper slang will likely not catch the gangster references. It's a vicious cycle.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/><br/>-.3 for the advertising: We get pumped full of ads for Gap and Coke and, hell, we even get ads for Preparation H. Will it never end! At least it doesn't try to hide it at all and just comes out and says ""These people paid us!"" -.3 for rap influence -.5 for the end scene: Just to show that this movie is riding off of Shrek's success, there is a dance sequence at the end. Kill me now.<br/><br/>TOTAL: 36%: I could tell that Shark Tale, beneath all the rap influence and bulls*** messages, was a decent gangster spoof. However, to look through all that crap for a couple jokes is just not worth it. Kids will not get the gangster references and basically only enjoy a pufferfish in a pimp hat. Adults will like the gangster references, but will cringe to tears at the rap influence. It is a lose-lose situation."

","I think this movie is very underrated! Its one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I liked it as much as Finding Nemo (there were few similarities) and it was certainly better than that horrible The Incredibles.<br/><br/>This movie has so many hilarious lines, and so many great characters. Unlike Nemo, which had several annoying characters (Crush, the sea turtle), SHARK TALE has no annoying characters. Its actually not easy to pick a favorite. (Although I like Ernie and Bernie best) I thought that my parents wouldn't like the movie because it has a lot of street slang, but they actually really enjoyed it. There are several good lessons in the movie; 1) You shouldn't lie 2) You should appreciate what you DO have, and 3) You should accept your loved ones no matter what makes them different and weird (for example, being a vegetarian shark).<br/><br/>I don't like to see comparisons to Finding Nemo, but everyone seems to do it. Finding Nemo is more innocent...there's no hemorrhoid or fart jokes. It takes place in a reef that LOOKS like a reef, and the fish look more like fish. SHark Tale on the other hand, takes place in a reef that looks like New Yorks Times Square, and there are shops with fish related names. Its a big city really. The only similarity is the fact that Lenny is a vegetarian and the sharks from Finding Nemo are attempting to give up eating fish.....because sharks have a bad name.<br/><br/>Its absolutely hilarious.....a definite recommendation!"

","Don't get me wrong, this is actually quite a dynamic and enjoyable movie. It has a great voice cast, plays very snappily, full of humor and emotion, and certainly works as a fun entertaining story for everyone.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed Martin Scorese in this. I've always thought he makes a neat actor - I also liked his role in QUIZ SHOW, and as a documentary narrator. His character is actually very funny in this; especially the fight scene with the ""turn on the TV, turn off the TV"" bit.<br/><br/>I also give credit for Jack Black's work. If I hadn't known I would never have recognised his voice in this. It seems one of the few times when a modern actor has been allowed to put on an artificial persona for a role, and get away with it. And I thought the guy who played the octopus was very good, and gave some great personality to the story,<br/><br/>And of course Will Smith and Robert DeNiro do hold their own as the central protagonist/antagonist of the story. Perhaps I'm being a bit flippant in almost taking them for granted.<br/><br/>One of the scenes I didn't like however, was the big climactic statements in the ending. They are just too over-stated and pushy. The wrap-up is a little too neat and sentimental. In fact the big problem is that the whole story really doesn't seem ""worth it"" somehow. It's okay; but compared to some of the great CG animated movies we've been lucky enough to get over the past couple of years, this one does seem a bit second-class. Nice try however, just not totally memorable."

","DreamWorks Animation wasn't satisfied with the blindingly successful 'Shrek'; now it has created the almost as entertaining but thematically inferior 'Shark Tale.' It's another anthropomorphic adventure, this time under water with fish voices and faces of movie stars such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, and Angelina Jolie. While it doesn't have the universal appeal of Pixar's 'Finding Nemo,' it will do swimmingly well. While it doesn't do anything new to the standard animal kingdom metaphors in the way 'Shrek' revised the fairy tale, it is superficially enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's a real underworld with De Niro as Don Lino, the Vito Corleone of the sharks, a mafia godfather with a fey son, who, as a 'coming out' vegan, doesn't look like a good candidate to take over from dad. Oscar (Will Smith) is a little fish caught up in his own lies and the machinations of the gangsters. His resolve to do the right thing is frequently neutralized by the sea siren Lola (Who else but Angelina Jolie?) but aided for good by the virtuous Angie (Renee Zellweger). The female fish all resemble Jolie with her bee-stung lips, not necessarily a bad thing; the male fish are spot on caricatures of the actors (See Martin Scorsese's eyebrows).<br/><br/>However, what's important here are the ingenious adaptations of fish life from human and the didacticism that usually accompanies these colorful animations. If you want someone to learn an au curant lesson about diversity or honesty, this film will get the point across with humor and grace.<br/><br/>Like the 'animals-are-humans' motif, much of the film seem like an homage to old days or tired allusions-- Sir Mix-A-Lot's ""Baby Got Back' has been used too many times before, for example. Although I question whether kids will fully appreciate the parallels to the gangster world or the gay sub-theme, there is enough for the whole family to enjoy. And with a PG-13 rating there is a little sex and violence to keep adults interested."

Oscar has been getting advances on his wages from his boss, Sykes (Martin Scorsese-voice) a puffer fish, to bet on the seahorse races. Don Lino (Robert DeNiro-voice) is the great white shark mafia boss at the top of the Reef's food chain, who wants his two sons, Lenny (Jack Black-voice) and Frankie (Michael Imperioli-voice), to take over the business. Don Lino orders Sykes to pay what he owes him. In turn, Sykes orders Oscar to pay the 5,000-clams debt he owes him. Oscar is able to get the clams from his best friend, Angie (Renee Zellweger-voice), who has a secret crush on him. Oscar is supposed to pay Sykes at the racetrack; regrettably, Oscar makes a 5,000-clam bet, and Sykes ends up ordering his jellyfish to take Oscar out. Frankie is about to eat Oscar when he is hit and killed by an anchor. Oscar takes credit for killing the shark, and he becomes the Sharkslayer and protector of the Reef. Lenny, a vegetarian, becomes Oscar's friend and helps him with the charade. Don Lino is out to avenge his son's death by ordering all the sharks to find and eat Oscar. This is a cute animated comedy of a little fish finding his real friends. Even though Oscar is a little obnoxious with all his wisecracks, you will get used to his character. I think Oscar's wisecracks are more orientated towards adults than kids, and the kids will not understand some of them. The most lovable character of the movie that kids will like will be Lenny, not Oscar. Be sure to read the advertising signs in the city. (Dream Works Pictures, Run time 1:29, Rated PG) (6/10)"

Oh, coral. Heh.) The animation feels as artificial as the story, never feeling like it's taking place underwater. Now that I think of it, why did it take place underwater? The characters don't really act like fish, they just act like whoever is voicing them, or whichever characters they would normally play. The same story could've been about mountain goats or talking staplers. Oh well, I guess the Coral-Cola joke would not have worked in a different setting. <br/><br/>This movie is mildly entertaining at some parts, but mostly unmemorable. If you've ever watched Fresh Prince and thought: ""Man this Will Smith guy is funny... but he'd be even funnier as a fish!!!"" then this movie is for you. Then again, if you're that person, you're riding a unicorn in the forest of rainbows, because you don't exist.<br/><br/>Dreamworks should really take a close look at what makes Pixar films so great: story, characters, and humor that anyone can relate to. Pixar films are timeless classics; Shark Tale, with all of its ""currently hot on MTV"" hip hops songs and whatnot, will look ridiculous in ten years. Er, more ridiculous."

","The Pixar computer animated classic ""Finding Nemo"" found itself a pool of box office euphoria. Since ""Finding Nemo"" were ""the fisher kings"" of the box office last year, Dreamworks decided to go fishing for some of their own dough and develop their own fishy animated story. I introduce you ""Shark Tale"". Audiences also took the bait on ""Shark Tale"" by rounding up satisfactory box office coin. However, it did not reach the deep sea pockets of Nemo. ""Shark Tale"" stars Lenny the tiburon (voiced by Jack Black) as a gentle sharkey lacking the fury of his fellow sharkanians. In other words, he is no sharkey's machine! I guess Lenny does not fit in the school of sharks. The situation does not ""boat"" I mean bode well with Don Lino, Lenny's shark daddy (voiced by Robert Deniro). Don Lino wishes Lenny was a bone shark instead of a lone shark. Next, I introduce Oscar the hyper bling-bling fish (voiced by Will Smith). Even though Smith will not receive any Oscar nominations for his voice-over of Oscar, it is still deserving of a goldfish statuette instead of the aforementioned goldman statuette. Oscar is chatty, manipulative, and debonaire. Angie the pescada (voiced by Renee Zellweger) is in love with the big ""O"" and would give her left gill for him. She wants to have Oscar at below! Then we come to Lisa (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who is the fish girl interrupted who is trying to prevent from Oscar & Angie from hooking up. However, Lisa wants Oscar for his bills and not for his gills. Through some unforeseen circumstances, Oscar is recognized as ""the shark slayer"" because of Lenny's generous antics. Shark Tale's relentless puns was the prominent feature why you should deep into ""Shark Tale"" at your own risk! **** Good"

DreamWorks must know it can't milk the Shrek franchise forever and if it was hoping SharkTale could prove a worthy successor, they are sadly mistaken.<br/><br/>I believe this film was originally titled SharkSlayer (before becoming the unimaginatively titled SharkTale), and I bet DreamWorks was hoping it would be their NEMO Slayer. Too bad, try again. I'm sorry but comparisons are inevitable between two completely CGI films set in a vast watery expanse. <br/><br/>SharkTale is all flash, pretty colors and big name actors with an endless drivel of pop- culture references. Pretty on the surface, completely lacking underneath. Will Smith's over the top, contrived schtick became irritating after the first couple of minutes and Black, De Niro, Zellweger and Jolie are nothing but big name drawcards.<br/><br/>The ""weird-looking humanized fish-people"" kept making me think I was watching some alien film. It was only because of the bubbles and seaweed and sand that I was reminded this was set under the ocean. <br/><br/>This film is for the kids, and anybody who gets a kick out of pop-culture jokes and flashy CG visuals. For something meatier, with heart and originality, go elsewhere.<br/><br/>DreamWorks had better get a new recipe because this one was tired and stale six months ago. Get some better stories. Get some funnier jokes. Get some originality. For now and the foreseeable future, the computer animation crown is safe and sound in Pixar's hands."

","It is commonly known that Pixar and Dreamworks have been duking it out for quite awhile. Pixar, with the big splash, Finding Nemo, and Dreamworks with their big hit, Shrek, have been trying to out do the other for years now. But this time, Dreamworks has crossed a line. Spinning off of one the biggest animated under the sea flicks, Dreamworks' picture Shark Tale falls short of mimicking any of the charm portrayed in the clown fish's folley. Mixed with pop culture slurs and a soundtrack with a bass beat, it is all too apparent that the creators were targeting the teens and children of today by bribing them with big star names and a popular soundtrack. While the story line is a bit miffed, the animation is something to really scoff at. Compared to the precision and quality portrayed in Nemo, the animated quality in this shark flick belongs back in the deep blue, where it should stay forever. There were some high points of entertainment, like the cliché mofia fish scenes and the shark disguised as a dolphin, but other than that.. this one was a BIG flop that should have just stayed in the seaweeds."

Like another reviewer, I felt that after awhile, the characters got annoying and I could not wait for the film to end.

","Alright I want you to look at the cast. A lot of names you recognise right? Now I want you to find any still frame of the film. Look back at the cast. HOW?!
This film is the closest animation can get to having a feature length film being filmed on an iPhone 4. Actually I take that back because I wouldn't want to disrespect the iPhone 4.
This film had so much potential and the only reason it's not 1 star is because it manages to have some semblance of a plot be carried by these big names.
The best analogy I have is this: imagine you are on a large boat with some of the greatest and most popular musicians of all time. Up ahead you see a crew man panic and before you know it the ship has hit something. It appears you hit an iceberg. As the life boats lower the musicians play for your amusement and as the ship sinks you and the rest of the survivors make it away safely. That's this film. This film is the titanic.
Don't believe me? Watch it your self, but let it be remembered I tried to prevent the suffering you will endure.
Perhaps the worst crime is that this film came out at the same time as the Incredibles. Just think about that.
If you like watching bad films but don't want to watch a film that is incomprehensible then this is exactly your film. Enjoy!"

","When it comes to the new genre of digitally animated films, Shark Tale falls around the middle (still an enviable place to be, considering the high quality of most of the entrees). It's not as good as Shrek, the Toy Story movies, or Finding Nemo, but it's better than Ice Age and Shrek 2. I would place it on about the same level as Monsters Inc.. The key thing to note is that Shark Tale represents solid family entertainment, and will find a special place in the hearts of those who adore the Godfather movies and the TV series ""The Sopranos.""

","I watched this film for the first time with my sister as part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. This is not a good film, not by any means. It isn't suitable for children in any way: not because of crude adult humor, but because the subject matter of loan sharks, mafia crime bosses, and MTV's Cribs would go right over their heads. Shark Tale also stereotypes black people and Italian people to the impressions of both races given from films like Friday and The Godfather. That being said, racism has never been so charming. This film has an undeniable charm that adults will enjoy, not because it's a quality film, but because it's quite the enigma. How could such a racially stereotypical film be so damn entertaining? Well, Shark Tale is one of those ""So-Bad- It's-Good"" movies. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro had a great scene together, and I only wish we saw more of them. This movie is predictable, basic, and racist: but goddamn it was a fun investment of my time."
"Angels_Review","6","1","2","5 April 2014"," The story feels a bit bla. Very Typical
","As a concept for this movie, I have to say this is a pretty typical story falling in the same lines as Dragonheart or other 'fake something to get famous' story lines. You know that soon the guy will be found out and that he will end up having to do something to make up for it. What I guess I wouldn't see is that Will Smith would have a face as fish but I guess being a blood cell would change a guy (Osmosis Jones). This show is very different then 'Finding Nemo' in that it's not a heart warming story but pretty much a make it or break it story. I find it slightly boring in that aspect since you pretty much knew exactly how the story would pan out. It's a simple story, city plagued by mobsters, one man that is on the bottom of the ladder wants to become better but he doesn't know how till he pretends he has done something really high and mighty to get there, screwing it up in the end.<br/><br/>The character Oscar is a really predictable character. He is a man who can never really catch a break no matter what he does. He tries to become rich but then crashes to the ground. Soon he becomes a liar just to get on the top and ends up hurting those around him. Lenny on the other hand is a black sheep of the family who wants to just be left alone. I think Lenny's story is much more interesting although again, very cliché. There really isn't that much of a difference between other movies I watched with the same basic outline and it makes me feel bla about the show. They could of taken it much farther but came up short.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty good, characters look more like humans then fish in the face and movement but still retain their fishy way of swimming instead of trying to walk on the bottom like some other shows. Textures look like they are where they are supposed to be and make everything real looking and popping out but the colors make it more childish. It has pretty much a perfect balance between 'real life' and animation. Some character designs have been made for the fish that it's supposed to be to a point that if you look up the type of fish they represented, it would look very close.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, Jack Black, Will Smith and a couple other big names and voices are some of the bigger parts. I don't really have a problem with any of the voices in the main cast, though the problems I see are that some of them have been rather stereotyped. Still, it was rather enjoyable for the most part. Music sounded pretty good but I still have problems with the story even if it worked on the sound aspect."

A loser fish accidentally was present in the event of a death of a shark who is a son of a powerful shark Don. The loser fish sees his opportunity to claim the title of 'sharkslayer' which makes him famous and rich. But it also brings the wrath of the shark Don upon him. Then the excitement begins...

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","2","8 August 2012"," Bland, dull, lifeless fish food . . .
","It may not be possible to view Shark Tale and put Pixar's Finding Nemo completely out of your mind. That great film, one of the best of 2003, still lingers in our minds and, I suspect, will stay there for years to come. It should, it is infinitely better than this lackluster, badly-made mess that does nothing special and tells a machine-made story that kids aren't likely to enjoy.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the story, which is bland and uninspired. It involves a near-do-well fish named Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) who works at a station under the sea that scrubs whales like cars in a carwash. He's in charge of scrubbing the slime off the beast's tongue. Like every other character in the movies, he wants a better life, away in the penthouses, up in the lap of luxury. He makes some financial mistakes and finds himself in Dutch with some sharks by gambling their money on a seahorse that seemed a sure thing. Sharks, you see, are the mafia of this movie. When a ship anchor accidentally kills a nasty shark named Frankie (voiced by Michael Imperioli), Oscar is credited with his death and becomes a local hero with the nickname The Shark Slayer. This information comes mostly from Frankie's brother Lenny (voiced by Jack Black), an effeminate shark who is an embarrassment to the family.<br/><br/>Frankie's death doesn't sit well with the Godfather Shark Don Lino (voiced by Robert DeNiro), who is the dead shark's father. He wants Oscar's head on a plate, and doesn't have to look very far to find him. After all, Oscar is currently basking in the sweet glow of celebrity from those who think he is a killer of sharks. This leads to the old tired cliché of the supposed hero becoming too big for his britches, offending his loyal friends and eventually having to tell the truth. Are you yawning yet? As stories go, this one is pretty thin. It pads the emptiness with a gaggle of movie references that kids aren't likely to understand. This movie depends greatly on your knowledge of gangster pictures; The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface. And other movies like Jaws, Apocalypse Now, Raging Bull, Once Upon a Time in America, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire. Will small children have seen these movies, God I hope not. Will they get the reference to DeNiro's role as the Godfather. Will they know that he and Scorsese made all those great pictures together? Martin Scorsese is pulled in to provide the voice of Sykes, a fast-talking puffer fish with massive eyebrows, but it is a wasted opportunity. His role is to play Oscar manager and haggle over percentages.<br/><br/>Is this what kids care about? Do they care about loan sharking? Family conflicts? A love triangle? Betting on horses? Financial management? There's even a tired, creaking old subplot about Oscar's relationship with a good-hearted fish named Angie (voiced by Renée Zellweger) that is thrown asunder by a seductress fish named Lola (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who only takes an interest in Oscar when he becomes famous. This is a kid's movie, right? As baffling as those clichés are, just looking at Shark Tale is no picnic either. The colors are bold but the animation is half-hearted. They look like characters out of a bad cereal commercial. Thinking back on it, I find it really difficult to understand exactly what the movie is trying to accomplish from a visual standpoint. While Nemo created a wondrous and beautiful world in the depths of the ocean, this film transplants the human world into a world under the sea without a sense of purpose. Like The Flintstones, it doesn't succeed at creating a world unto itself but rather takes our world and refits it with sea life parodies. Why then do the characters even need to be fish? Some of the parodies are cute for a few sight gags but they grow tiresome after a while. It becomes apparent that the movie is not really interested in its undersea world so much as it is in pop culture references, guest voices, sight gags, one-liners, and a long stream of current hip hop buzzwords. Under the weight of trying to desperately to get us on the movie's side, Shark Tale drowns itself.<br/><br/>*1/2 (of four)"

"Ostrumation","Null","1","2","22 April 2010"," It Has Its Moments, But It's A Weak Effort From DreamWorks
","DreamWorks Animation had its glory when ""Shrek 2"" became the highest grossing animated film back in 2004. They had topped the previous record set by ""Finding Nemo"", which was released a year before that. DreamWorks pretty much assumed that ""Shrek 2"" was going to outdo the record set by ""Nemo"". From what I've heard, this fish film only took around 2 years to make. ""Shark Tale"" might've obviously been conjured up to see if it can be huge since ""Nemo"" was huge, being something like a cash-in. Before ""Finding Nemo"" hit theaters, it was expected to be a disappointment due to tepid test screenings. When this film began pre- production, the title was going to be ""Sharkslayer"", and this was prior to Nemo's release date. Now DreamWorks spent 3 years on ""Shrek"", and it was a great film. DreamWorks spent more than 2 1/2 years working on ""Shrek 2"" and it turned out to be a good sequel (Not as good as the first in my opinion). If ""Shark Tale"" took only 2 years to make, then something tells me this film was obviously rushed. Perhaps DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg saw that their big rival scored a massive hit with ""Nemo"", so thus ""Shark Tale"" was rushed to meet a release date not too long after ""Nemo"". According to some sources, animation production took only 7 months. ""Finding Nemo"" took 3 years. Recent Pixar films take about a year of animation production. This shows that ""Shark Tale"" was definitely rushed during production and it was probably altered to be potential box office gold. (The all-star cast prove this and 2003-2004 pop culture jokes prove this)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, ""Shark Tale"" is not the worst thing ever. It's not a rip-off of ""Nemo"" either. It's not very good, definitely. It has it's moments. The story is a muddle. Basically Oscar, the main fish, is a nobody and he wants to be seen as someone important. Oscar starts a big white lie that he is a shark slayer after his encounter with Lenny, a vegetarian shark (""Finding Nemo""'s sharks, anyone?) from a mafioso-like family of sharks. Throughout the film, we basically see how long he keeps that lie. It all leads up to a somewhat absurd climax. But hey, I don't think this was intended to be some animated classic like ""Nemo"" was.<br/><br/>On the positive side, ""Shark Tale"" has some funny moments. However, a lot of it is dated. All of these pop culture jokes and parodies of real-life products were obviously thrown in because ""Shrek 2"" had them. Now, most of jokes are now dated. ""Shark Tale"" comes off as very formulaic, which would seem to plague a lot of DreamWorks Animation's films. The animation is nice and colorful, and I thought the underwater city was kind of unique. I thought the two jellyfish characters were pretty funny, as well as some other scenes. It's basically a fun animated comedy flick. I remember disliking it when I first saw it, but I gave it another chance I somewhat enjoyed it. It's no ""Nemo"", and it's no animated masterpiece, not at all. But compared to some later DreamWorks efforts like ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", it's a weak effort."
"jboothmillard","5","1","2","13 December 2009"," Shark Tale
","From Dreamworks Studios, who had huge success with Shrek, I was really looking forward to this computer animated film for the cast more than anything else, but I was up for a giggle too. Basically, beneath the deep salty sea live Oscar (Will Smith), the young whale washing and tongue cleaning fish who aspires to be famous, with best friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) having a crush on him. Oscar chances on an incident that brings him instant fame, an anchor drops onto a shark killing him, and everyone thinks that it was Oscar that defeated the shark, so he has become known as the ""Shark Slayer"". Don Lino (Robert De Niro) and his mob gang are in fear, unaware that Don's secret right hand Sykes (Martin Scorsese) is behind the merchandising of Oscar, getting attention from Lola (Angelina Jolie), making Angie very jealous. Then Oscar meets the shark he met before after seeing his brother die, vegetarian shark Lenny (Jack Black) who has nowhere else to go, and wants to help him retain his fame faking a death. In the end though, after some chases and squabbles, Oscar comes clean about his fake status, and knows he does love Angie like she does him, and he goes back to his washing job. Also starring Peter Falk as Don Feinberg, Michael Imperioli as Frankie, Vincent Pastore as Luca, Ziggy Marley as Ernie and Doug E. Doug as Bernie. The animation is pretty good, the voice casting is very good, and the jokes along the way do have some good irony and satire. It might be a slightly predictable plot, and be an obvious morality lesson, but with sequences like the ""Car Wash"" song by Christina Aguilera and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott, it is a pretty good family comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Worth watching!"

","A fun story and good animation make this feature a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. There's nothing particularly deep or original about it, true, but to expect that would be to miss the point of the movie: it's intended largely for kids, who don't really care about depth or originality - they just want to have fun with it, and for parents who just want to be able to watch a fun movie with their kids. On those notes, the movie scores quite well. The characters are fun, and to the extent that one can talk about ""performances"" in an animated movie, both Robert Deniro (as the shark ""Don Lino"") and Will Smith (as the Shark Slayer ""Oscar"") put on good ones.<br/><br/>Essentially, Oscar - a tiny fish who works as a tongue scrubber at the local whale wash - is mistakenly identified as the killer of a great white shark (Lino's son). From that point on, Oscar relishes his newfound celebrity, but finds out that his fame comes with a price (he now has to be the defender of the reef against all sharks, and he has to deal with Lino's desire for revenge against the guy who he thinks took out his son.) Oscar teams up with Lenny (Jack Black), Lino's other son, who happens to be a gentle, vegetarian shark who's something of an embarrassment to his tough dad. (This, and Lenny's decision to dress up like a dolphin, lead to some limited social commentary about the importance of accepting those who are ""different"" - which seems to be a message to parents with gay kids, frankly. Adults would get that social commentary; most kids wouldn't.) Eventually, through his adventures, Oscar discovers the value of honesty and Lino comes to understand the importance of accepting people (or fish) as they are.<br/><br/>Some of the references in the movie (especially the repeated allusions to ""Jaws"" and ""The Godfather"") are going to be over the heads of the kids watching and, in all honesty, the story - while fun - isn't going to rival either of those movies, either, but what makes this movie work is the ability for parents and children to enjoy it together. It might not be the best movie either have ever seen, but it has enough for both to make it enjoyable. Other featured voices include Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Katie Couric and Martin Scorsese. 7/10"

Shark Tale (or at least the first bit) has the feel of a cartoon designed by a computer that was simply fed all the recent hit cartoons. It is achingly predictable in every detail. Which would be fine if it was funny. It's not like I look to cartoons for brilliant, incisive stories that comment on the human condition (although it's nice when it happens). A funny movie about fish would have been just fine with me if it were funny. Ice Age had one of the same writers and it was very funny, and that's what I was hoping for, and I didn't get it."

And will he figure out his romance situation before he's iced by the local Mob boss Don Lino (Robert DeNiro), who happens to be the father of the shark who was killed by the anchor, the shark everyone thinks Oscar killed? Charming, whimsical, and fulla heart and moxie, Shark Tale tries - and succeeds - to do for fishfolk what Antz did for insectfolk. Both, incidentally, were Dreamworks creations, and it's somewhat assuring to see a company other than Disney consistently turn out fun, high-quality animation.<br/><br/>For once, Smith is perfectly cast. Don't get me wrong, I've liked quite a few Will Smith films, but most of the time he's an entertainer and showman, not an actor. There's plenty of showmanship in his performance here, but for some reason the animation comes across as completely sincere. So it's the Will Smith show again, but against the animated backdrop of the briny deep, it somehow works wonderfully.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that during the making of animated films, the actors providing the voices often do not work simultaneously (although they did do so a few times for Shark Tale), I thought the vocal chemistry between De Niro and Smith was excellent. Strong performances abounded, from a fairly disparate selection of actors: De Niro, Smith, Zellweger, Jolie, Peter Falk, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, and Doug E. Doug.<br/><br/>So all in all, a whole lotta fun. You might say the movie has teeth, but you'd be wrong - it's an innocuous PG-rated movie, so rated merely for its mild cartoon violence. Your kidlets will probably love it - or at least they will if there's a Happy Meal involved, which I'm sure there was."

","I thought Shark Tale would be much similar to Finding Nemo, but after watching the movie I must say that its predecessor was way too good.....<br/><br/>The one thing which maybe was a little more enjoyable than Nemo, was the script.... And that was expectable, since Will Smith had to have a funny script.... Tha animation and underwater graphics, is still the same if not a little better, than Nemo, but the entire story line is hopelessly weak.....<br/><br/>The story revolves around a tiny little fish, Oscar, who aspires to be the most popular fish of the reef, but hasn't got the capability.... He owes loads of money to his boss, who decides to get rid of him... He orders his henchmen, 2 jellyfishes, to scratch him, but whilst they were planning, a shark comes out of nowhere, to have a bite.... Here in a an accident of the most freakiest kind, the shark dies.... But this shark was no ordinary shark, he was the son of the mafia don..... Maddened with grief, the dead shark's younger vegetarian brother, goes away, and stumbles upon Oscar.....<br/><br/>From here on, the story goes on revolving upon the love interest of Oscar, and how he gets everything okay between, the sharks and the fishes.... The movie has parts which are sure to remind you of the godfather, and Robert DeNiro, gives an amazing performance as the shark don.....(For instance the don's right hand man's name was Luca, remember The Godfather) Also, Jack Black gives another great role as Leni, the vegetarian shark.... Renee Zelwegger's role as Oscar's love interest is also, very good and stellar, Angelina Jolie's small role as the illustrious Lola, the sex doll, is also pretty good, Martin Scorsese, does a cameo, as Oscar's boss, but doesn't create much of a mark to the movie.... And lastly Will Smith, well basically this was his movie and his voice gave a new life to Oscar, the shark slayer, and he brought the character to life, giving him the cool attitude that he is known for, and that may well be the only thing worth watching for in Shark Tale, otherwise a pretty forgettable movie.........<br/><br/>7/10 from me....."

","When my wife and I decided to see a movie last weekend, we didn't expect it to turn into an incredibly painful evening. But when we chose to see ""Shark Tale,"" we set the stage for a most boring and, as I mentioned, painful experience. First off, I should mention that the animation was fairly impressive and the actors chosen are well-known greats. However, that's as far as the good stuff goes. It would appear that all of the movie's budget went to hiring famous actors and animators, at the cost of anything resembling a script. The entire premise of the show is boring and predictable - a vegetarian (Italian-type stereotypical mafia) shark and a ghetto fish work together to take a shot at their dreams - and the show didn't get any better from there. There were lengthy periods of bad music with fish dancing around (for no actual reason) and every few minutes, a really (and I mean incredibly) stupid joke would pop up. I didn't hear anyone in the audience laughing... even the children. Really there's only one thing you need to know about the film - Don't Watch It!"

","DreamWorks rolls out big-hitting voice overs - Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Renée Zellweger and more - for this CGI underwater romp about what happens when a shy shark crosses paths with an ambitious fish<br/><br/>Since Disney and DreamWorks raised the bar by putting CGI and knowing humour into their films in the 1990s (with hits such as Toy Story and Antz), animated movies have changed. Romance and songs are still important, but positive responses from grown-ups are also elicited. References are slotted into scripts that only adults will understand, nods given to other movies and celebrity voice overs heartily encouraged. These are the things that will get adults trooping into the multiplex - naturally, with their children in tow. <br/><br/>DreamWorks' Shark Tale works this style very well. Considered by some the company's comeback to Disney's Finding Nemo, its cast list is much more top-drawer, with each character's features matching the actor giving them their voice. De Niro's shark has a mole and a drooping mouth, Zellweger's angel fish the same quirky smile, Scorsese's puffa fish the director's wild eyebrows. And then come the references to other movies. The Great Whites are an underwater Mafia family, puffing on cigars and hosting elaborate funerals like The Godfather's Corleones (scripting in Joe Pesci's ""Am I a clown to you?"" speech from GoodFellas beefs up these credentials). The ocean is a capitalist haven - apart from one public spirited poster for Tuna History Month - full of chain stores like Gup and billboards for Coral-Cola. One shark sings the Jaws theme tune to make himself scarier - while another camply comes out of the closet as a vegetarian. <br/><br/>However funny these references are, Shark Tale prides style over substance. Its plot suffers as a result, swooping clumsily between its two major characters, Lenny (Black) and Oscar (Smith). Lenny is an effeminate shark whose father Don Lino (De Niro) wants to toughen him up (unlike the similarly single father in Finding Nemo, who is fiercely protective of his charge). Lino wants Lenny and his brother Frankie (Imperioli, from 'The Sopranos') to take over the family business; Oscar (Smith) is a fish who works in a whale wash and wants to be ""at the top of the reef where the somebody's live"". <br/><br/>Their paths cross when Frankie is training Lenny in the dark arts of machismo. Frankie tragically dies, and Oscar, from then on, is mistakenly thought to be a shark slayer. Leaving his best friend Angie (Zellweger) down at the ocean floor, still desperately in love with him, Oscar joins forces with Lenny and the corrupt Sykes (Scorsese) to nurture his fame. A money-digging lion fish Lola (Jolie) latches onto him, a Jessica Rabbit with fins. Despite the fame and the accolades, of course, things soon fall apart for our shark slaying friend, and our hero learns the error of his ways.<br/><br/>The morals here are basic enough - don't cheat your way to the top; don't go looking elsewhere for what you can find at home; be proud of who you are. Nevertheless, this morality is only engaging when applied to Lenny, a truly adorable character - voiced well by Black - who carries the film. Smith's Oscar, on the other hand, is intensely annoying, and you cringe at his energetic outbursts. He's especially embarrassing when bantering with the West Indian jellyfish, whose heads are turned into tams. Characters' attitudes also change completely as the film comes to a close; De Niro becomes sympathetic and Smith becomes lovelorn. The storyline is secondary to the bells and the whistles, which is Shark Tale's ultimate flaw.<br/><br/>Verdict The special effects may be appealing, and the script often funny, but this tale is clumsy and clunky, and ultimately unsatisfying."

","And I'm sorry to say it, but Pixar's Finding Nemo is way better than Shark Tale. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: Shark Tale is a great film. Its colourful, funny and a delight to see in the cinema. The best choices for voice-overs are in this: Will Smith is perfect; Renee Zellweger plays her sweet charm; Robert De Niro is doing what he does best. There are even some surprises: never ever thought that Jack Black, last seen in School of Rock, would voice Lenny, the vegetarian, unhappy shark.<br/><br/>But Finding Nemo succeeds because it was original. FN was beautiful. ST is unfortunately nothing more than a parody of as much as it can get away with. And most of the time, it's in bad taste. Jaws has been used way too many times. We've had enough of the Godfather. They even used the blowfish (or whatever it is. You know what I'm talking about) from FN and over-used it. Even the plot is too familiar. And why, oh why does every character look like the voice star? And are they fish, or eels?<br/><br/>The best thing going for it is Lenny. The ""I'm a vegetarian"" scene: I found it touching. Not funny. Was that the effect it was meant to have, or did they just do it wrong? Also, the nice thing about FN was that the fish hug, which shows even more affection than a weird snog. It is just as bizarre watching fishes kiss as it is watching plasticine chickens snog in Chicken Run (and you don't even see that kiss, cos Rocky's in the way THANK GOD). In ST it's not ""Awahhhhhhh-ARGH!"" - it's ""ew"".<br/><br/>Pity really. Shark Tale's brilliant and worth your money and time, but it doesn't stand a chance."

","I went and saw this movie last Sunday, expecting a funny, cute comedic kid's movie like Finding Nemo, only with an urban twist. Perhaps, it was a little too urban. I did laugh, and I did think this was a funny movie, but it should have been aimed more towards teenagers. You see, my theory to why this happened is this: Rap is taking over the world. If I ever hear a little kid say: ""Forsheezy"", I'll have a good idea that it's because of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is about a fish who works at a whale wash. He owes his boss money he cannot pay so his boss's goons take him out to the middle of no where to either torture him or kill him. (His goons are Jamaiican jellyfish.) Then a shark appears and is killed by an anchor. The two jellyfish assume that the fish killed the shark and they free him. Unfortunately, the shark is part of a family of mobsters. There's also a vegitarian shark in there somewhere. I'll let you sort it out. <br/><br/>I wonder what parents thought when they heard a shark wish that Oscar would burn in the fiery pits of Hell. It was all a little too extreme for the young children I saw there. This is just my opinion, of course. Not to mention adolescent fish vandals. Is it any wonder that America's youth is corrupted? My rating: 7/10. (Unnecessary language, annoying dialogue, and annoying characters.)"

","Congratulations are due to Hollywood: in the past, studio spies found out about rival productions and rushed to make films with identical synopses in order to undercut the competition. [See Volcano, Dante's Peak - Kundun, Seven Years In Tibet - The Sopranos, Analyze This]. It's remarkably easy to do - you approach studios with a completed spec script, get rejected at x, get accepted at y, and then x has still got your old screenplay when it's finally put into production at y. <br/><br/>In this case Dreemwerks simply copied Pixar. So for people with a whetted appetite for CGI fish movies, 'Shark Tale' has all the right stuff to succeed; strong writers, animators, a big budget. And it still fails.<br/><br/>-Fish moving through water encounter resistance and must use muscle power to move forward.

This doesn't stop the producers from shoving a box of Krispy Kreme donuts in our face [twice].<br/><br/>I'll give ST a couple points for converging Oscar's story with Lenny's skillfully, great overall story structure, and some funny jokes [not including the Jerry Maguire reference].<br/><br/>5/10"
"TheMovieMark","Null","1","2","15 October 2004"," Well, that was lametastic.
","Well. That was quite unimpressive. To be honest, I didn't really expect much from the movie, but I certainly expected more than this, especially when you look at the talent they had to work with. The movie *looks* pretty good, and it's technically sound, but it's just boring. Seriously, I nodded off at least twice. After a while I was just ready to head to my truck because, unlike with the movie, I knew I'd actually be headed somewhere of interest.<br/><br/>I guess I just don't find all the hip-hop music and hip-hop jokes as entertaining as some might. Maybe I'm just jaded since I've seen those jokes used in about 32 different movies. They lose their shine after a while. I'd like to chalk it all up to the humor being directed at kids more than adults, but there were a lot of kids at the screening I attended, and they didn't seem to be laughing that much. How many 10-year-olds are gonna laugh at MC Hammer references? I mean really. When did they start production on this, 1990?<br/><br/>You're in luck if you love bad puns though. For names we've got: Jessica Shrimpson, Cod Stewart, and Mussel Crowe. Then you've got some punny product placement such as, The Gup, Coral Cola, Kelpy Kreme, and Old Wavy. Then there are the expected pop-culture puns like, shell phones, scallop polls, and raise the reef. There are plenty others, so keep your eyes and ears open. If you can. Otherwise, just bring a pillow if your kid forces you to go.<br/><br/>The most clever thing about the movie is how most of the characters have physical similarities to the actors voicing them - De Niro's shark has a mole, Martin Scorsese's blowfish has huge eyebrows, Jolie's fish has big lips, and Will Smith's Oscar actually looks like Will Smith. However, portraying Christina Aguilera as a hooker fish seemed a tad inappropriate.<br/><br/>There are some funny jokes scattered throughout, but mostly this movie only managed to elicit polite chuckles from me. I can't remember a single guffaw-inducing moment. It's not a horrible movie, but it just didn't do anything for me. The pace gets surprisingly slow at times, and the attempts at a little relationship drama aren't the best ways to keep the kids' interest.<br/><br/>Oh, and I had a bit of a scare at one point in the movie. I thought the theater ceiling was falling on me, but it turns out the movie was just beating me over the head with its ""accept people for who they are"" and ""being loved is more important than being famous"" messages. Yeah, yeah, pass out pamphlets if you're so desperate to get that message across. That way I can just throw it away on my way out of the theater and not worry about it.<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>I usually enjoy CGI-animation, but Shark Tale isn't in the same league as Toy Story, Shrek, or Finding Nemo. If you're looking for outdated jokes and an uninspired storyline, then this will be right up your alley. As far as entertainment value goes, it's about on par with Garfield, except it doesn't have the benefit of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a cute skirt."

","When I watched the trailers of this movie, I sensed that this movie would not turn out to be a winner. Against all my judgment, I went to watch this movie (partly because of my 4-year old girl who is in love with ocean creatures), hoping that I was wrong. Sadly, I was proved right. This movie was a disaster -- I've never been more bored in watching a computer-animated film. This movie has a number of problems including:<br/><br/>(1) The story/plot (if there was any) was incredibly shallow and flat. It was the old, million-times-tried-and-failed story of ""realizing true love is most precious thing."" I am not saying this is a bad theme. That is a very important piece of philosophy that any human being should live by. But the story presented by this movie was so stereo-typed and monotonous that it was almost insulting. Anyone with an average movie-intelligence will figure out how the story will unfold within 3 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>(2) The character development was very poor. Sure, Dreamworks managed to cast all star voices, but we know that it is usually a source of problem. Good acting is not to be yourself in the movie, but to create a credible character. All the characters in the movie are the actors themselves. This movie quickly degrades itself into a big excuse of showing off multiple stars. I like most of the stars in this movie. An amazing thing is that this movie managed to bring out the worst of those stars. For example, DeNiro acted (or sounded) exactly like the character in ""Analyze this."" I am sure most of you will agree that it was not the best of DeNiro. Will Smith was incredibly annoying, and portrayed a very stereotyped character. He was ten times more annoying than the donkey in Shrek -- you know it is not an easy task to achieve. Jack Black, a very good actor, was wasted as well. What a shame.<br/><br/>(3) The animation was good although you should not expect any Pixar quality here. It won't bother you. However, the character designs were far worse than what you saw in Nemo -- in fact, I feel almost unfair to compare this movie to Nemo because they are in a totally different league especially as the character design goes. The fish characters looked ridiculous (sharks were better) and even scary. They looked like goldfish that is genetically enhanced with human genes (fish with human face, that is), and were ugly say the least. My daughter slept with Nemo for months after she watched it, but I do not think she will ask me to buy her the Will Smith fish.<br/><br/>(4) I liked Shrek for the smart jokes although Shrek 2 overdid it a little bit. Jokes should exist in a movie to make the story better. But this film exists to make jokes. Uninteresting and uninspired jokes at that too. I laughed about twice (one being the mole on DeNiro shark and the other I don't remember, maybe I laughed only once).<br/><br/>All in all, the highest rating I can give this movie is 4/10. Skip this movie unless your child is bugging you to death. If you can persuade them, please do so. The chances are your child may not like it either."

","Lots of celebrity voices contributed to this animated movie (you've no doubt already perused the IMDb credits list). <br/><br/>Presumably everyone involved tried to creatively improve on, say, animated features such as Dreamworks ""Shrek"" or, more to the point, Disney's financially successful ""Finding Nemo."" But then, if you think about it, Dreamworks was probably less concerned with making a cookie-cutter version of successful cartoons made previously and more concerned with successful marketing. I was given free tickets so I wasn't disappointed one way or another. ""Shark Tale"" is good... It delivers, it entertains and it provides a few good laughs. <br/><br/>In ST, most of the male cartoon characters sound like they're trying to imitate Danny DeVito (not a contributing voice here), and the voices sometimes sound electronically altered (?). <br/><br/>Comedian Black's ""Lenny"" protagonist-shark sounds more like David L. Lander's 'Andrew ""Squiggy"" Squigman' on the TV comedy series ""Laverne and Shirley,"" or 'Curly' from the ""Three Stooges."" In fact, ""Lenny"" sounds no different from Hanna Barbara's ""Jabberjaw"" shark (a voice also based on the ""Curly"" character). <br/><br/>Still, the predictable song/dance finale will have you stomping your feet and clapping your hands with rhythm and glee. Once again we board the Stuck-in-the-Seventies music train, and all ends well in this hip-hop, busta'hip dancin,' Rastafarian-rappin,' soul-diggin' undersea world."

","Don't get me wrong, I like Pixar; I like them a lot. But they are not the ONLY people who can do CGI films. I heard all of this crap several years ago when someone dared to make Antz, which people compared to A Bug's Life; but because Bug's Life was Pixar, everyone embraced its mediocrity (IMO it was Pixar's one significant misstep) and shunned Antz, which was on the whole a superior film. Not that I would argue that Shark Tale is better than Finding Nemo; personally I don't think they're aiming at the same thing, anyway. But just because it isn't Pixar doesn't mean it's bad; and if you disagree with that statement, then just stop reading right now, because you won't like anything else that follows.<br/><br/>Shark Tale follows the adventures of one Oscar (Will Smith) who dreams of being a big fish in, okay, a big pond. His best friend Angie (Renee Zellweger) loves and supports him no matter who he is. Trouble is, he's into his boss Sykes (Martin Scorcese) for five thousand clams, and a get-rich-quick scheme explodes in his face. About to become food for the fishes, Oscar has the good luck to run into Lenny (Jack Black) a black-sheep shark who is hiding out from his father, Don Lino (Robert DeNiro). Together the two of them make unlikely allies as they try to help each other out.<br/><br/>Shark Tale indulges in a lot of puns, but most of them work pretty well. The non-traditional animation style  the humanoid fish sort of vaguely resemble the actors playing their voices  works better than you'd expect; the likenesses are pretty good, and yet still manage to fit the characters and their personalities (though featuring Angelina Jolie as, well, an overtly sexy fish reminded me mostly of Troy McClure from the Simpsons). The humor isn't aimed at kids; while they will appreciate much of the movie's bright colors and the broader jokes, a lot of the verbal play and send-ups are based on spoofs of adult films. I think your average adult will get more out of the film than your average kid.<br/><br/>The voice acting is a cut above; Smith is right at home, and Zellweger, whom I normally don't like, is excellent. DeNiro is fine, as you would expect, as is Jolie; but the movie is really stolen by Jack Black and Martin Scorcese. The director's blowfish is the funniest thing about the film, from his quick rejoinders to the way his voice goes all helium when he balloons up. And Black, whom I really do not care for, is simply excellent.<br/><br/>I was also surprised by the decision to have the central character be gay. While they never come out and call Lenny gay, the entire movie he is struggling with who he is, how he doesn't fit in with his family, and how he just wants to be loved and accepted by his father; interestingly, he is accepted into an urban culture, and then masquerades as something he's not. Again, while no one ever actually says the word gay, the metaphor is inherently obvious, and I liked and respected the movie for going in that direction; teaching tolerance, even in a semi-treacly form, is usually a good thing.<br/><br/>I found Shark Tale to be witty, clever, and well-designed; it goes a little overboard in a few spots, but by and large it was immensely entertaining and I laughed most of the way through the film. I found it clever and engaging and a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half at the movies. Whether or not you go is your own decision, but I think you could find far worse ways to spend your time and money than to see this movie."

","Being perhaps the only person I know of who HASN'T seen Finding Nemo, I was able to relax and enjoy watching this CG animated tale of a fish named Oscar (Will Smith) who dreams of being ""on the top of the reef"" without subconsciously making comparisons of the two films. The ensemble of famous voices and characterizations that accompany these voices are first-rate. For those who enjoy mob classics such as Goodfellas, The Godfather Part II, Casino, etc. they will be pleased to hear the voice of Robert Di Niro (who elso can set the ""standard""?) , as well newly made ""familia"" such as Vincent Pastore and Michael Imperioli (from the Grammy-laden HBO Hit - The Sopranos) as well as what I found as a unexpected surprise - Peter Falk voicing the character Don Brizzi. This is not the only fast running fun-pun going on in this film, the voices of Jack Black, Rene Zellweger and Angelina Jolie complete what I feel is a ""killer"" cast. Martin Scorcese making a rare on-screen appearance, even if only in voice, adds a lot of subtle humor, especially when you consider it so ironic that he a Robert Di Niro worked together 28 years ago to make a great movie classic - Taxi Driver. What made this especially enjoyable is that not only have the creators of this film used an eclectic mix of popular familiar voices, but the CG graphics have so well captured the ""essence"" of many of this fine actors, especially Rene Zellweger who steals her share of scenes. There are a lot of ""supporting voices"" lending to some instantly memorable secondary characters, such as Ziggy Marley as one of the two ""Rasta"" jellyfish bodyguards for Martin Scorceses' character ""Sykes"".

Surely they all saw something in the material? Perhaps Jack Black would be funny as the cowardly shark? Nope. It's just poor animation in a poor film with poor humor and so-so vocal talents. First of all Will Smith is too self-aware. He seems to ""know"" he's providing his vocal talents so everything is sickeningly over-the-top and staged. De Niro's good but rarely in the film to be honest. Jolie is OK, Scorsese and Black are pretty funny and Zellweger seems to be most at ease with voice recording.<br/><br/>Whereas the animation in ""Shrek"" was rather good (in a purposely fake way) the animation in ""Shark Tale"" is sloppy and disappointing. Also, I hate to sound racist but this really just seems like a version of ""Finding Nemo"" targeted towards the African-American demographic. Oscar the Fish (Smith) and his grandfather (complete with a stereotypical afro) run a ""wash"" and so we get a soundtrack with songs like ""Car Wash."" How original.<br/><br/>The humor isn't consistently funny, there are a few good gags but they've all been done before (such as Katie Couric being replaced with Katie ""Current"" - didn't they do this in ""Shrek 2"" with another news reporter??).<br/><br/>The fact that all the ads boast FROM THE CREATORS OF SHREK! says something for the quality of this film. It relies upon the reputation of its big brother for success. ""Shrek"" walked the thin line of brilliant satire and muddled adult animation. (I.e. adult-oriented jokes.) ""Shark Tale"" seems to stray from the path and somewhere along the way becomes _too_ adult in nature, creating a rather uncomfortable undercurrent dealing with murder and Mafia and violence and even sex, depending on how far you want to take the implications of the sensuous, seductive fish voiced by Jolie.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say it's a bad film because it's adult. I'm just saying that's one of its fault. Overall, it's just not very interesting, funny, well-acted or impressive, in terms of both animation and story. I wasn't disappointed as I didn't expect very much. I'm hoping Dreamworks stops making animated CGI films - they've proved countless times with projects such as ""Ice Age"" and the overrated (albeit enjoyable) ""Shrek"" that Pixar is far superior.<br/><br/>I really loved ""Shrek 2"" (more so than the original - by a long shot) and that gave me some hope in this project, but after seeing it I felt assured that the best parts were included on the trailer - and since the trailer was rather unimpressive to begin with, that just goes to show how mediocre this film really is.<br/><br/>A milestone: the first CGI film to gain a majority of negative reviews from critics nationwide."

If I want to see De Niro, I might watch GOODFELLAS or RAGING BULL and I can't see why such an adult actor is given a role in what should have been a purely kids' film. Nothing new or memorable here--just a pale imitation of NEMO with some heavy-handed touches. The charm just isn't apparent and I can't see a compelling reason to seek out this film, though it is an agreeable enough time-passer."

","I was completely excited about going to see ""Shark Tale"" when I first heard about it. I was expecting a fish story that was as good, if not better than ""Finding Nemo"". I went and saw it and came out with not a very good impression of the movie. I had seen the previews, and I thought that the movie would be absolutely hilarious. But all of the funny things that were said in the previews...was really the only funny parts in the movie! Another reason that I really wanted to go see this movie, being convinced that it was going to be really good, was that Renee Zellweger is a voice to one of the fish in the movie, Angie. Well Renee Zellweger is one of my favorite actresses, and her movies are usually really good...but this one wasn't."

","I wasn't going to add to the tales of disappointment regarding this film, but: the producers deserve yet another diatribe.<br/><br/>Perhaps we've been spoilt with choice. Previous CGA (no, I didn't mean CGI: it's an A for animation) epics and short films have had, in the main, original stories and plot lines. ""Shark Tale"" has no originality at all. Is it ironic? No. It's derivative and badly so. Is it contemporary? No. We saw the same films masquerading as entertainment last century. (I've always wanted to say that!) Any 'hip' romantic/musical comedy such as ""Carwash"" et alia would always have been uncomfortable with or refused bonding to ""Goodfellas"" or (because of casting and plot line) such TV staples as ""The Sopranos"".<br/><br/>OK. The chosen voice talent is excellent. What happened to expression and nuances in delivery? It would perhaps have been better (and ironic) if each actor had reprised a recognised screenrole. The only one seeming to do this is Will Smith. Yet Oscar/Will is exactly what we expect: smartmouthed express delivery of clichéd dialogue.<br/><br/>Look: the animation is excellent, the backgrounds to die for. Apart from the excessive product placement, they are exceptional. But it all seems so tired, so been there before.<br/><br/>Loved the visuals, hated the film. A begrudging 3/10."

","I certainly expected more from the group that put out the excellent ""Shrek"". The story is boring, the characters are not sympathetic, and the whole movie seems to lack heart. The lead character, ""Oscar"", is one of the least appealing cartoon characters I have ever seen. He is a liar and a cheat. He is also lazy, selfish and a slacker (just the kind of role model kids need). There are a couple of funny spots in the film. For example. some of the action takes place on the wreck of the Titanic and in one scene a character is thrown against the wall. He lands on top of a picture which is the famous drawing of ""Rose"" from ""Titanic"". Unfortunately there are not enough funny spots to make up for the long unfunny segments. Very young kids, especially those who go for hip-hop. will probably like it, but adults will be put off by the whole thing. This is one that won't be in my library of films."

","Now keep in mind the following is my opinion and you are allowed to disagree, however may I remind you that you are also allowed to go suck a lemon.<br/><br/>Shark Tale (a.k.a. Shark Tale: Capitalizing on Finding Nemo) has in my opinion the humor value of a rather unfunny tuna sandwich. There are only a few redeeming values about this film, they include the fact it did not cost me more than $3.50 to watch, it eventually ended and it had many bright flashy colors. As much as I enjoy bright flashy colors (and who doesn't) the film had too many other things going against it. The humor I mentioned earlier was composed completely of bad parity, awful puns and a fart joke. Previous to this movie I was not even aware fish farted. The biggest problem that I saw was the fact that the entire movie was made up of fish (a few whales, one causation and an octopus too) where there was absolutely no need for this. Someone must of simply thought up a bad fish joke and based an entire script around it. The film could have worked at least as well with live actors or as a human cartoon. For that matter it could have been done with ring-tailed lemurs and it would not have made any difference more superficial than the movie's title.<br/><br/>For those of you who are still reading and actually want to know a spoiler free plot summery continue as you were. The story of this film is you basic boy fish meets girl fish film where the boy fish does not grasp the fact that the girl fish loves him, and that he loves her in return, in a slimy awkward fishy kind of way of course. On the way boy fish watches the gruesome crushing death of a shark, lies, loses girl fish, tells the truth and regains girl fish. The only real difference between this fish love story and all of those countless other fish love stories are sock puppets.<br/><br/>Much like a tuna sandwich this movie left a bad taste in my mouth, at least however I get to eat the aforementioned tuna sandwich.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: This movie is better when you spend your money renting Disney's Finding Nemo"

","My Take: Colorful yet under-written animated movie. <br/><br/>Despite ""Shark Tale"" being a rather comical and colorful animation serial by Dreamworks Studios, this film somehow marks the beginning of the end for the studios big success, starting with such delights like the two ""Shrek"" films. ""Shark Tale"" started to loose its charm as time passes, something that any change to DVD can't cover for. This movie is rather unfunny compared to the likes of the first ""Shrek"", and most especially the superior sequel ""Shrek 2"". The film follows the success of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"", but is sorely left behind by how much ""Nemo"" succeeded. How could it? Because this one tried to be cool and serious at the same time in one movie. They wanted to give its viewer both a fast-tongued comedy spoof and a ""Godfather"" of the animated kind. But some success are too big for all to come true.<br/><br/>Now, enough of negatives. ""Shark Tale"" does offer some entertainment. The voicing may get pretty annoying at times, but Robert DeNiro's voice as Don Lino, the shark mob boss is very good. Admittedly, it's fun to see DeNiro going tough and bad as a shark. The animation is colorful and clear, may you see it on either the big-screen or DVD. And some of the laughs does work sometimes, when seen in the right mood.<br/><br/>Overall, not a success, but not much of a disappointment. If only it targeted more on a frequent audience and had a more kid-friendly plot to accompany the fine colors.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

","Being a huge fan of all animated films, I was really looking forward to seeing ""Shark Tale"". Unfortunately, it did not live up to the expectations that I expected.<br/><br/>""Shark Tale"" takes place in an underwater version of New York City. The story follows Oscar (voice by Will Smith), a small fish that works at the whale wash. Oscar dreams of bigger things, and when is mistaken for killing a shark, he is propelled into the spotlight that he so craved. Unfortunately, the shark was the son of Don Lino (voiced by Robert DeNiro), an underwater crime boss, and now Oscar has to hide from the mafia.<br/><br/>The animation is superb, as is to be expected by the animators of ""Shrek"". However, the story to me was just not funny, and the characters were annoying, as was the music (sorry folks, I'm a rocker, and rap just does not work for me). Of course, the small fry will probably giggle at this film.<br/><br/>It seems that I have been spoiled by the fantastic film ""Shrek"", and expected the same here, but I was wrong. I will definitely stick to ""Shrek""."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","13 February 2005"," Beautiful animation, superb sound track, but only a so-so story.
","The past six years or so have spawned a new genre of animated movie, the super realistic, super sharp, almost 3-D computerized animation. So any movie like this one, ""Shark Tale"", will automatically get compared to all the others in the genre. For me it falls near the bottom of that heap. Not that I didn't enjoy it, because I did. But the story itself, of a vegetarian shark, offspring of a shark 'Don' who wants him to be able to kill like all the other sharks, isn't very interesting. It is there just to provide cute and mostly funny episodes involving the fish that live in an underwater community that looks amazingly like Times Square in Manhattan. But the animation and colors are beautiful, and watching the movie just to marvel at that aspect is enough for most of us. My advice, watch it for the beauty, and don't worry about the story itself.<br/><br/>The voice acting features quite a fine cast, including Will Smith as Oscar, who works at a whale wash business, and whose job is to clean the tongue. How low can you get?? Robert De Niro is Don Lino, the old papa shark. Renée Zellweger is Angie, who works at the whale wash also, is sweet on Oscar but doesn't get much attention. Jack Black is Lenny, the young shark who can't bring himself to eat anything alive. The story is two-fold -- how does Lenny get acceptance from his father, and how does Oscar come to discover true love? <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is the sexy Lola, and Today Show hostess Katie Couric does a good turn as Katie Current, a news reporter. Not much of a stretch, but she does a fine job. Other voices of note include Martin Scorsese and Peter Falk."

Another factor that did not make this movie hit so much is competition, right now incredibles has carried whatever of those people that hadn't seen shark tale away from it cause to be honest was quite better in terms of story line and comic relief thumbs up to Robert Deniro as usual he made his presence known Will Smith performed averagely but generally the movie is okay"

I'm Sebastian the whale washing dolphin"". It kills me. <br/><br/>Also the animators were so funny with the way they took footage of the various actors' studio recording sessions and made the fish characters take on the characteristics of the actors. There is a scene where Angie the Angelfish, as voiced by Rene Zellweger, vents her frustration at Will Smith's character saying, ""Sometimes I just want to take your dumb...dummy head and Nyuhhhhh"" and the animated fish mimics putting him in a headlock and punching him in the head repeatedly. With the accentuated facial expression when this is done combined with Zellwegers voice it is so adorable all while still being funny that I have watched the animation online several times and still laugh at it. <br/><br/>Oh...did I mention you can see that scene and others at www.sharktale.com (duh)?<br/><br/>Having viewed Shark Tale twice now I think I can see why some adults may find it a bit much to take. First and foremost there are themes that are touched upon that can be a little sensitive when thought about in the arena of the real world. And...just to be helpful and name a few *smile*: a. career and economic failure. b. being taken for granted by a loved one. c. the laws of sexual attraction. d. issues of self control in regards to gambling and money. e. organized crime f. passion and revenge g. using people (fish) for their money h. sadism i. cross-dressing (well...a shark posing as dolphin) j. ""passing"" as someone you are not in order to get ahead. k. Social acceptance for being...""different"". (see item i.) j. youth vandalism (i.e. young graffiti spraying 'hood fish) k. Mental Illness (unstable hermit crab)...etc.<br/><br/>Now all of this actually comes off funny if you don't focus on it. However if you actually have issues with any of the above and just aren't carried away with the rest of the show...it could all get you all grumpy. It seems a lot of the reviewers of the movie got hooked up on some of those subjects.<br/><br/>What can I say...obviously I watched it and I could see these sometimes thorny issues poking out. <br/><br/>It seems a ten year old I know liked it all very much and thought it was better than Saving Nemo.

The film is as others have said here - a 'star vehicle' -in which the fish characters are made up to look like the actors. Just as well no one asked to have their performance removed from the movie ! When you compare this to Nemo - does Dori the fish look like Ellen DeGeneres or the pelican remind you of Geoffrey Rush. Thought not. <br/><br/>Perhaps the analogy here is a bit like the old days of Disney and Warner Bros cartoons - the later were always a bit of a Fast Food approach to animating movies. Perhaps Dreamworks wants to mine the same seam of humour - which will be OK for the next few years but will leave audiences puzzled in about 20 or 30 years when they try to remember who Will Smith was. <br/><br/>So my advice to 'Dreamworks' is plug and promote 'Shark Tale' for the next year or so but don't expect to see this as a long distance franchise."

Will Smith is the streetwise but lovable hustler that is destined to find his inner depth; De Niro is the Don, Jack Black his the annoying prodigal son, and Scorsese as the spineless tough guy.

","Start with DreamWorks. You all know them as the new kings of movie animation, the crew who brought you Shrek and Shrek 2. Add in a heaping helping of all-star vocal talent from Will Smith to Jack Black, from Renee Zellweger to Angelina Jolie. Sprinkle in what should be an obvious ""rags to riches"" tale about a poor fish named Oscar who makes good, only to find out the good life isn't what it's cracked up to be. With all those ingredients the end result should be a tasty morsel of a movie, but the only thing these sharks take a bite out of is your wallet. What's really surprising about this film is that with the previous deft hand the DW crew showed at appealing to both kids and adults by mixing slapstick and action with romance and subtle (and occasionally naughty) jokes, this time they manage to not hit any of the marks. Sure this film is ""cute"" but unless you are taking very young children to the theatre, cute alone isn't enough to shell out $10 for let alone cut it as a rental or a take-home purchase. Cute is quickly replaced by vapid. The over-the-top stereotypes quickly become offensive, from rastafarian jellyfish who talk jive to Italian mobster sharks complete with a ""don"" voiced by Robert DeNiro (and he should be ashamed of this role). The storyline hints at a desire to delve deeper into issues of class and disenfranchisement, but Will Smith's hammy dialogue keeps you from taking him OR this movie seriously. And seriously, who decided fish should emote? They are not exactly the best choice for conveying a range of complex emotions, but those poor schelps who spent tens of thousands of man hours at computers animating this dreck tried anyway. In fact they even tacked on a pointless short for the home release where all the fish and sharks ""get jiggy"" in the film's car/whale wash, turning into a nightclub for the evening. What this movie proved to me is that even when you follow a perfect recipe, you can make a mediocre product. Repeat viewings are not necessary, and you may even feel once is too much by the end. Save for the sparks of life Jack Black gave this movie as a misunderstood shark who wants to eat plants instead of animals there's almost nothing memorable about ""Shark Tale""; that is to say there's nothing memorable in a GOOD way.

","I watched Shark Tale, with not too high expectations, because critics can completely trash a good film, or give good critic to a bad film, so I watched it with open mind. <br/><br/>It did have very good animations, beautiful colours and a good set (reef), but the plot was too simple to intrigue anyone over the age of ten. It was slightly predictable probably because it is aimed at a younger audience as well, so it couldn't be very complicated. However, I really enjoyed Robert De Niro, and his shark 'mafia' boss character, and Jack Black the ever so friendly shark. Will Smith was good, and had some funny lines, although half the time I could not understand what he was saying. All the main characters were good and their part was essential to the film. I especially enjoyed the two jellyfish.<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like and put me off was the usual racial comment made by Will Smith (Oscar). I just don't understand. This film is about fish. Green, blue, red, all kinds of colours, yet there is a 'joke' about Sykes not being able to do some 'cool' handshake, because he is a white fish. Well to me it looked like he was a puffer fish. <br/><br/>Overall, it was an average film. It did make me laugh a few times, and was quite easy and pleasant to watch.

"pifas","6","1","4","16 February 2005"," Comparisons are not fair
","I've seen in a lot of comments on Shark's tale that many reviewers says Pixar's Nemo this, and Dreamworks' Shrek that. Well, I think that comparisons are not fair. This film has pretty much edge (maybe not as much as any of those), but overall I believe it stands on it's own for all the elements and details it contains. I didn't think once on Finding Nemo watching this because the story, besides being underwater, it's solid enough to capture your attention, and it has to do also with the great cast in voices and the terrific job they've done. The only thing I agree with is that Dreamworks' tends to be more adult oriented in it's jokes, and despite I prefer Pixar in many entries, it's because of that (it's humor) that I enjoyed this one a lot, adding the scenarios, the metaphors they use, it's satire on mobsters, the well rounded characters despite their motivations (and I also loved the strong resemblances with the ones whom put the voices on, at least De Niro, Scorsese and Smith, which I consider it gave an extra in defining the character), and all the references in pop culture that whale with the ""wash me"" written on it was superb, and so it was Ernie and Bernie playing that Oscar's game on Playstation.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly new in animation, so I'd like to think of myself as someone who can recognize whether if a movie is good or not, so when I rented this one didn't expect much based on all the things I've read, but I'm glad to see that I was way wrong. One could argue that it may be due to my low expectations, but I don't think so. I liked the story, the animation, the gags, the characters, and so on. I know it's not a masterpiece, but I chuckled hard with the little details thrown every now and then, and did it harder with the humor displayed by Lino, Lenny, Oscar, Ernie and Bernie. I rented Shark tale to see if it was worthwhile, but now I must have it."

","After watching this movie, you'll know why Dreamworks Animation's IPO is worth billions. Going by their success of the Shrek Movies, and now Shark Tale, they'll be the studio that will give Pixar a run for their money.<br/><br/>The premise for this animated film is similar to Shrek's, adapting modern day icons to suit the mis-en-scene, thus providing tongue-in-cheek references as well as opportunities for a gag or two.<br/><br/>We follow the exploits of Oscar (Will Smith), who lives in a fish colony modeled after New York's Times Square, with neon billboards screaming recognizable brands like ""Coral-Cola"" (Coca- Cola), ""Fish King"" (Burger King), ""GUP"" (GAP), ""FQ Magazine"" (GQ Magazine), etc. Look out for references to Titanic (the sharks' lair),<br/><br/>and one liners from movies like A Few Good Man, Gladiator and even Jerry Maguire (in one of the most direct references towards Renee Zellweger)<br/><br/>As the simple story goes, it's about redemption and learning not to lie (hey, it's a G-rated movie!), about who your true friends (those who stuck by you even when you're a nobody and have nothing) and about family.<br/><br/>One thing I've always enjoyed about Hollywood animations, is that the toons are carefully caricatured after the real life actors bringing their toon counterparts to live. Even Robert De Niro's mole is cheekily added, and Angelina Jolie's poutty lips are featured as well and even Martin Scorsese lends his voice in this show.<br/><br/>Stay throughout the end credits, and I mean throughout the end credits.

","Now a days, when you see a computer animated film (especially from Dreamworks), you expect it to please not only the kiddies, but the adults as well. You assume there will be humorous references that some children won't be able to catch, but that the grown-ups will understand and find entertaining as well.<br/><br/>You count on a little something in there for everybody (i.e. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Shrek, Toy Story).<br/><br/>More importantly, you hope the movie will strike the funny bone of both generations so that the film can be appreciated and enjoyed by both genres.<br/><br/>Shark Tale has very little of this, and what it does manage to muster up, is surprisingly unfunny. In fact, Shark Tale is a pretty horrible film altogether. Not all the star power in the world could make this film less than the dreadful bore that it is.<br/><br/>These fish live in a very adult-like society (think of New York underwater), but there is just no good adult humor in this film!! Maybe kids will like it. But this is not an enjoyable film for us grown-ups. In fact, this movie is so bad, I won't bother to review its lousy story any further. There are plenty of other reviews that do that.<br/><br/>Be warned: This fish STINKS......badly. <br/><br/>The best thing for this reviewer about Shark Tale was the fact that I rented it and didn't buy it.Returning a movie never felt so good!"

Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Katie Couric, Peter Falk, what a list! And they all just left me with a bland feeling. I didn't really feel much of anything one way or the other about any of them. They didn't make me love them or hate them. I just felt indifferent about all the characters. And, excuse me, a vegetarian shark? Where have we seen that one before? Does Finding Nemo sound familiar (""Fish are friends, not food"")? I watched this film with great anticipation and was really let down. I gave it a 6 for the strength of the animation and the story itself, but the voice work just left me cold."

","Sure, this movie got a lot of publicity, but overall, it was very disappointing, especially since Shrek 2 (made by the same people) was so good. I liked the animation, and for that I give it 3 points. Otherwise, it was horrible. The filmmakers spent so much time showcasing all the top Hollywood actors' voices and showing us how many equivalents the Underwater Times Square has to the real Times Square that they totally forgot to create a plot! Hardly anyone in the audience laughed, because no one got any of the so-called jokes. It would've been a far better movie had they followed Pixar's lead and focused on the STORY first and not the icing on the cake."
"toontje-1","4","1","5","15 February 2005"," Shark Tale doesn't flow!
","This movie has to much of a B-movie black exploitation musical feel to it. It would be fine by me if they didn't include all the spoof, the mafia angle and the forced ""I saw that coming ha ha"" kind of jokes in it. I think PDI wanted to incorporate so much in this movie that it became very thinly spread. The result: the story got totally diluted, which is a hard thing to do given its simple plot. The main failure of this movie is that they wanted to develop the characters more than the plot. But the problem is that the characters are very shallow, so when Oscar does his hip-hop thing for the 20th time, it just get boring, repetitious and the plot looses its drive. The visuals are OK. It is not my style. I think the color scheme is aimed at a more juvenile audience. My 2 year old son bursts in a laugh every time something purple appears on the screen. So that target audience is covered. And now for the inevitable comparison with Finding Nemo: there is no comparison other than it involves fish and water. The color scheme is different, the technology seems different too. In my opinion Finding Nemo looks more realistic (more accurate ocean and light simulation) than Shark Tale. Finding Nemo is about real fishes, Shark Tale is more symbolic. It is more like people disguised as fishes. My conclusion: if you belong to the crowd that loves flashy, 1-second-attentionspan MTV video clips, then Shark Tale is the thing for you."

","Shark Tale is another big CG film from Dreamworks. You'd think with all the big actors they got for this film that it would be a good movie, but it is not. Its attempt at being an urban-like film and the fact that it plays off stereotypes does not help either. The biggest problem was Will Smith.<br/><br/>First, let me get one thing out of the way. This is not a Pixar Animation Studios Film. There are other studios that can do movies in CG. 20th Century Fox evens does some films in CG. So everybody that says this is a Pixar film, shut the hell up. Pixar does not need this stupid movie on their list.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the life of Oscar, a little fish with big dreams. When he pisses his employer off by having him bet on the wrong sea horse, he is left in the middle of the ocean. As he is chased by a shark, an anchor falls from the sky and crushes it. A few jellyfish that were in the area look up at him and believe he killed the shark. Through the rest of the movie he goes around, pretending to be a ""sharkslayer"".<br/><br/>This movie could have been good, but they decided to focus it on Oscar instead of the Mafia sharks. The only reason I sat through this whole movie was because I liked those guys, and wished they had been in the movie more. I did not like Lenny. He was just dumb character. He was hardly funny, and he was just annoying.<br/><br/>This movie did play off stereotypes. What the hell did they mean by ""A lot of WHITE FISH can't do it."" White fish? Then of course they had the Jamaican jellyfish that could not speak English very well. The had the Mafia sharks, who were Italian. Simply saying that um... ""BLACK FISH"" are supposed cool while ""WHITE FISH"" are not. The movie did not need any of that, but that's the problem. That's what the whole the movie is about.<br/><br/>Will Smith was just terrible. He's a good actor, but the character was stupid. He was not the right person for it. Listening to him talking ""BLACK"" gets annoying after the first few sentences, and does not let up. It continues on through the entire movie. He was just not the guy to get for the part, but then all the other actors, except for the Mafia Sharks (Not Including Lenny), were not right for the parts either.<br/><br/>This was such a stupid film. I believe I laughed once during the whole thing. It was an okay story, and a cast of well-known actors, but not even that can help this movie. It was boring most of the way through. I'm a teen, and I didn't like it. I probably still would not have liked it if I was in my childhood years.<br/><br/>Entertainment = 4.5/10 <br/><br/>Favorite Scene = Almost every scene involving the Mafia Sharks, without Lenny.

Really, it could have been produced with humans on dry land and it would have been the same. The fact that they were aquatic beings gave nothing to the film because every character was made to appear and move as much like a human as possible. So what's the point?

"Victor Field","4","1","5","6 November 2004"," It's not fair to compare this to ""Finding Nemo."" Now ""Jabberjaw"" on the other hand...
","The best moment of ""Shark Tale"" comes in the beginning, when the little boy in the DreamWorks Animation logo casts his fishing line out from the moon and sends the hook with a worm on it down to the sea. Unfortunately it serves as a cue for one of the movie's problems  when two sharks come along, one humming John Williams' shark motif from ""Jaws"" to the disgust of the other, and the first one says ""Hey, it's our theme song,"" we're supposed to think it's clever. It's not  it's obvious, and it's also representative of the movie's fondness for riffing off pop culture aspects - something ""The Simpsons"" also does, but it also does far more than this movie does. This laziness is so prevalent throughout the movie that the overall effect is of something that's computer-generated in more ways than one.<br/><br/>The story is dull, clichéd and predictable  it's shocking that such an impressive cast was convinced to bring life to a script that's on a level with ""Fish Police,"" with its endless bad fish-related puns and dreary plotting. Come to think of it, the voice cast is another problem; there used to be a time when animated movies didn't feel the need to plaster the names of the voice actors, whether known or unknown, on the posters and in the trailers but even some of the TV spots for ""Shark Tale"" featured the live actors during the recording sessions, making it feel even more like a corporate concoction than it already is (and why did the producers gather such an impressive cast and then give them practically nothing to do?). The characters Smith, Jolie, DeNiro, and company are voicing aren't a help either  unlike ""Finding Nemo"" (I know I said it's not fair, but the point has to be made), we're denied anyone to give a toss about because they're nearly all stereotyped ciphers (especially the Jamaican jellyfish voiced by Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley), with Will Smith proving that even in animation he has to hog the limelight... if any character here is the star, it's Jack Black's fey shark (who practically has ""gay"" stamped on his fins). Just to add to the irritation, the movie's commercial instincts all but override the storyline  it often plays like an extended TV spot for its soundtrack (and both the songs and Hans Zimmer's score are nothing to write home about), especially with the presence of Missy Elliott and Christina Aguilera in fish and jellyfish form performing their appalling version of ""Car Wash""  as if the live-action forms weren't repellent enough already.<br/><br/>With its sledgehammer winks to adults (although the newspaper ad for a horror movie called ""The Hook"" modeled on DreamWorks' version of ""The Ring"" and casting Peter Falk and two cast members of ""The Sopranos"" as mob sharks is almost okay) and the overall feeling of a bad '80s TV cartoon dressed up in 2004 silver screen trimmings, ""Shark Tale"" has no chance of being included as one of the three nominees for Best Animated Feature if there's justice in this world. And who decided to include British morning TV irritant Fiona Phillips on the UK release print (Fiona replaces Katie Couric as the voice of on-the-spot reporter Katie Current, which pretty much removes any possible point to the fish's name)? Fiona Phillips and Christina Aguilera have no business being on the same credit roll as Martin Scorsese and Renee Zellweger."

","Excellent animation. Great cast. Fun music. Engaging story. However, the overt purpose of this film appears to tell children that they MUST accept homosexuality as normal, and in this movie, even desirable. There are many great movies with the good moral of accepting others who are different. This tale crosses the line by a specifically effeminate character who wears ""different"" clothes, hangs out with ""different"" friends, and is repulsed by that which is normal to the other sharks. Of course there is no direct mention of sexual preference in the movie. The 'victim' is a vegetarian shark. But don't be fooled by the analogy; the very precise use of gay stereotypes in the Lenny character leads me to believe this movie has a very specific pro-gay acceptance moral. The characters who don't accept Lenny for ""who he is"" are vilified as unintelligent, ferocious looking, but cowardly bigots. This reads agenda with a capital A. <br/><br/>For those readers who are now seething in hatred towards me, don't misunderstand: I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER TREAT ANYONE ELSE WITH HATRED OR LACK OF HUMAN DIGNITY, NO MATTER WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR OR SOCIAL ""PREFERENCES"".

","Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) is a lowly fish in a big reef. He works at the local whale-wash (car-wash on land) as tongue-washer, but dreams of bigger and better things. He's in a 5,000 clam debt to his boss, Sykes (Scorsese) and is in the mindset that 'nobody loves a nobody'; hence, he wishes to become a 'somebody'. What he doesn't realize is that his best friend, Angie (Zellweger) already loves him, just as he is. One day Oscar gets his lucky break. A shark is killed by an anchor to the head, and by being in the right place at the right time, everyone assumes Oscar was heroically responsible and dub him as the 'shark slayer' and defender of the reef. Fame, fortune and a hot little lady fish named Lola (Jolie) finally come his way... but there's a catch. The shark he has boasted about killing was the son to mob-boss, Don Lino (De Niro) and along with his vegetarian brother Lenny (Black), was going to inherit the family business. Now Lino is out for revenge. It's only with the help of Lenny that he can hope to keep up the charade. Lenny isn't your typical shark you see, he disappoints his father by rejecting meat and when his brother is killed, he runs away, hoping to neglect his position to the family business. Now Oscar has to try and keep his big lie from being exposed so that he can continue living the High Life.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much going in to this film, and luckily this mind-set kept me from being disappointed. <br/><br/>Obviously this movie has lost much possible luster as it is released in the shadow of the hugely-successful Pixar film 'Finding Nemo'.<br/><br/>Comparing the two films is really pointless because really, Shark tale ain't got nothing on Nemo. But if Dream Works were going to try and compete against the ultimate in animated film, Pixar, I thought at least they'd put a little more effort into their attempt. Honestly, this is one of the worst animated films i've seen in a long time. I thought the bar had been raised over the past few years with films like 'Toy Story', 'Shrek', 'The Emperors new Groove', 'Monsters Inc' & 'Ice Age' setting new standards. Apparently not. Oscar is annoying and loses his appeal after the first ten minutes in which he's already made a dozen wise-cracks. Lenny is your typical dopey character and a pretty boring one at that; you never really care two hoots about him. The other characters are all pretty dull and forgettable. Though i must say that Angelina Jolie makes a hot fish. The story is damn ordinary and quite boring as it is propelled by a lousy script with fall-flat jokes that don't live up to the more high-brow humour designed to amuse parents as well as kids in Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Its all a big yawn to be perfectly honest."

","Italian American COALITION ALERTS PARENTS TO SHARK TALE VIOLENCE AND STEREOTYPING <br/><br/>CALLS FOR NATIONAL BOYCOTT OF MARKETING PARTNERS <br/><br/>Washington - September 24, 2004 - The Coalition Against Racial, Religious and Ethnic Stereotyping (CARRES) today alerted parents to the violence and ethnic stereotyping in DreamWorks' soon- to-be-released animated children's movie, Shark Tale and called for a national boycott of all products that promote the film and its characters. <br/><br/>The movie is about a fish named Oscar, who gets involved with gangster sharks and killer whales. The gangster-fish have Italian names and are voiced by Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese and actors from The Sopranos. It premieres nationally Oct. 1, the first day of Italian American heritage month. <br/><br/>Shark Tale is a production of DreamWorks SKG, owned by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. To promote it, DreamWorks formed partnerships with some of the nation's largest corporations, including Coca-Cola and Burger King. <br/><br/>Since January CARRES has petitioned DreamWorks to change the names of the gangster characters and remove Italian expressions from the dialogue. It also has written to the movie's corporate sponsors asking them not to promote the film. <br/><br/>""Since our requests fell on deaf ears, we are calling for a boycott of Coca-Cola, Burger King, Krispy Kreme, General Mills, Hasbro Toys and Activision, the movie's principal marketing partners,"" says CARRES spokesperson Dona De Sanctis. <br/><br/>It is the first time that the major Italian American organizations have called for a national boycott to protest the defamation of people of Italian heritage. <br/><br/>Italian Americans represent the fifth largest ethnic group in the United States, numbering 16 million according to the U.S. Census Bureau.<br/><br/>CARRES is composed of more than 25 ethnic organizations, including all the major national Italian American organizations: <br/><br/>· The Order Sons of Italy in America (OSIA) · UNICO National · The National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) · The Columbus Citizens Foundation · The Italic Institute of America <br/><br/>""Shark Tale is a kid's version of GoodFellas,"" says CARRES member John Mancini, chairman of the Italic Institute. ""We are profoundly disappointed in Steven Spielberg who chooses to negatively influence children this way.""<br/><br/>""Shark Tale will be translated into many languages and reproduced on DVDs,"" says OSIA National President Joseph Sciame ""The characters will be in video games, on cereal boxes and fast-food meals all over the world.""<br/><br/>Referring to the movie's corporate partners, UNICO National President Michael Mariniello notes, ""How could these otherwise socially responsible corporations, whose businesses are sustained by American families of every racial and ethnic background, be a party to such a reactionary movie based on ethnic caricatures? It literally takes America back to the 1940s.""<br/><br/>Lawrence Auriana, president of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, targeted Spielberg's role. ""Despite his enlightened statements about stereotyping, Spielberg has allowed DreamWorks to produce the first children's movie in at least 25 years that promotes bias. By supporting this movie, Spielberg is being hypocritical."" Auriana's foundation, which organizes New York City's annual Columbus Day Parade, banned members of the cast of The Sopranos from marching in the 2002 parade. <br/><br/>U.S Congressman, Bill Pascrell Jr (D-NJ) contacted DreamWorks on Jan. 9 and again on Sept. 8, requesting a review copy of the film before its Oct. 1 national premiere. ""I am concerned that the character images of this film do not meet a wholesome standard and will instill societal prejudices in our children,"" he wrote. <br/><br/>To download the CARRES boycott brochure Click Here .

","I was expecting this movie to be along the lines of Finding Nemo. (I mean, come on, another 3-D animated underwater film with talking fish. How different can it be?) Maybe you can blame my lack of imagination, but this movie crosses the limits on turning the sea world into a human world. Finding Nemo had an innocent environment with ""schools"" of fish. Shark Tale had corruption, gangs, greed, seduction, a social hierarchy, racism, poverty, and even a Times Square. I'm sorry, but including all of these things in an animated children's film defeats the purpose of personifying the marina life. It's not like the story is unique either. It has the typical plot in a countless number of movies. This movie not only alienates the adult audience but conveys all the despicable aspects of our society to the kids."
"majikstl","5","1","6","12 February 2005"," Something fishy is going on...
","SHARK TALE is an animated feature about fish and sharks and other creatures that live under the sea. So, why does Don Feinberg, the shark character voiced by Peter Falk, sing ""The Wind Beneath My Wings."" I mean in a film all about fish, shouldn't he be singing ""The Wave Beneath My Fins?"" There is no wind and they have no wings and logically these characters would not even know what ""wind"" and ""wings"" are. And when everybody is celebrating life at the Whale Wash, why do they all sing ""At the Car Wash"" and not ""At the Whale Wash?"" It would seem that they don't have cars and shouldn't even know what one is either. Could it be that funny parodies of the songs would be less marketable on the soundtrack CD? <br/><br/>There is no real logic in this fish world. One creature is seen pouring tea into a cup, but none goes in because it disappears into the ocean water. Which is only logical, so why was he pouring tea in the first place? But other fish are into graffiti art and their canned spray paint isn't effected by the water. Oscar, the protagonist voiced by Will Smith, longs to live in a penthouse so the he can enjoy the view, but he is a fish in gravity-defying water so he can swim up and enjoy any view he wants, any time he wants. Plus, why would the said penthouse require an elevator? <br/><br/>These are, admittedly, silly, insignificant details individually, but put together they are examples of just what is wrong with the film. It goes to extremes to make the fishy world on view a parallel universe to ours, like say, SHREK; while at the same time suggesting it is an unseen part of our world, like say, FINDING NEMO. The action mostly takes place in what appears to be a submerged human world, most notably New York City in general and Times Square in particular. But if it is a sunken part of the human world, why is it implied that this a uniquely fishy world? The film can't make up its mind: The Coca-Cola sign in Times Square reads Coral-Cola, yet Will Smith's Oscar brags about owning a PlayStation. (Did PlayStation pay for a plug and Coca-Cola didn't?) And apparently this civilization has electricity, but how it functions under water isn't clear. It is annoying that the film can't decide just what universe it exists in. Is this a fish built society (then why are there knobs on the door?) or is it a man-made world that has fallen to a watery grave like the Titanic (then what caused New York City to sink?)<br/><br/>Likewise, the film suffers from a muddled story line. Basically, we are given a Damon Runyonesque tale of small-time hustlers and gangsters on the streets of New York (which raises the question of whether swimming fish would even need streets). But into this Guys and Dolls milieu we are also given hip-hop characters and hoods right out of GOODFELLAS. It is an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach, which should make it funny in an AIRPLANE! sort of way, but instead the inconsistencies are just annoying. It is like nobody thought this through; this isn't inspired chaos, just confusion.<br/><br/>The art and animation is just fine, exactly what we have come to expect from DreamWorks, but it is betrayed by a trite and sloppy screenplay. A simple test would be to ask ""Would this story work without the animation, with real actors?"" I don't think it would. Even with -- especially with this cast. Other than Falk, whose part is a slight cameo, the only strong vocal performance is given by Martin Scorsese, and overrated director and an underrated actor. His hyperactive, twitchy vocal patterns were made for cartoon voicers. The rest of the cast -- Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Renee Zellweger -- all seem to be examples of stunt casting; none give their characters a distinctive voice to match a distinctive character, like Ellen DeGeneres in FINDING NEMO or Eddie Murphy in SHREK or Holly Hunter in THE INCREDIBLES or Robin Williams in ALADDIN.<br/><br/>The stakes have risen; remarkable films like TOY STORY 1 & 2, MONSTER'S INC. and SHREK 2 with their mix of artistry and intelligence, make it harder to accept that excellent animation can compensate for poorly crafted storytelling. SHARK TALES is well intentioned, with a moral about honesty and acceptance -- one shark confesses to being a closet vegetarian, with being gay the suggested subtext -- but the happily ever after, Capraesque finale seems fake. SHARK TALE is a well made film, but it is a small fish in an increasingly larger ocean."

","Another American Airlines flight...another movies I'd never pay to see in a theater, but, since it was available to me, I watched.<br/><br/>I've read several of the comments on here, and although the criticisms are different, the overwhelming theme is the same...who were they making this film for? I don't consider myself slow on the uptake at all, but, this film went too quick for most of us who've sworn off cocaine since our rock star moments from the '80s. Therefore, I'm not the least bit surprised that kids were bored and/or lost interest.<br/><br/>So, was it meant for adults? Possibly, I guess. I don't know many toddlers who could make the connection between Katie Couric and Katie Current--but, then again, I can't say as I run in too many circles where toddlers are present, so, maybe I'm sorely underestimating our wee youth in America. All that aside, it had elements of ""The Godfather,"" but was a little too hip-hop for me to truly identify with it. WAY too hip-hop, truth be told. Before I'm labeled as someone who's completely out of the loop, it's fine to have those references--but, there's such a thing as overkill. If you overkill with someone who doesn't listen to Missy ""Misdemeaner"" Elliot on a regular basis, you can't be too shocked when someone feels alienated.<br/><br/>So, what about teens? I can't imagine they'd pick up on ""The Godfather"" references--but there again, I don't run in packs with teenagers. Also, the overall ""themes"" the movie tried to hammer home--honesty and acceptance--would seem to be a little too remedial for anyone over the age of 10.<br/><br/>Target audience aside, there was nothing truly spectacular outside of the animation. This is sort of disappointing considering the vocal talents cast list included the likes of Robert DeNiro, Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellwegger, and Martin Scorcese. I've always thought Will Smith in the flesh was so over the top that he bordered on being a walking ""Looney Toon."" To experience him in actual animated form is a bit like dropping acid and participating in a high speed chase from the cops on a stormy night in Vegas. Scorcese's puffer fish dancing the ""cabbage patch kid"" was a little reminiscent of Barbara Billingsly speaking jive in ""Airplane!""--only not as funny. And, once again, we have a effeminate shark in ""dolphin drag"" coming out of the ""vegetarian closet"" to his mobster father shark. It doesn't tax the imagination too much to see where they were going with this, but, there again, the Island of Misfit Toys in ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" handled it with much greater sophistication...after all, no one wants a ""Charley in the Box."" <br/><br/>Cost of plane ticket aside, I wouldn't have seen myself renting this film, and, as I said from the start, would never have paid to see it at the cinema. I guess if you find yourself on a flight across the country and it's on, provided there's not a $5 charge for headsets, you could do worse as a captive audience."

","Do not be fooled by the CG animation. Everybody thinks because a movie is animated by a computer, it's good. Thus far, most of Pixar's and Dreamworks' CG movies have had great successes in the box offices. And those movies that were smash hits, as they say, deserved to be. They were funny, entertaining, creative, novel, enjoyable, and always original. Shark Tale is grossing $147 million as I write this, but it has none of the qualities that made the previous CG movies great. Sure, it has its funny moments, but most of the humor is largely clichéd and overused. I suppose one could argue that most of the clichés are supposed to be parodies of ghetto and mafia movies. But if that was true, then the movie fails in its execution of the parody, which is merely a better way of saying the same thing.<br/><br/>Shark Tale is in essence the mob meets the ghetto. It includes the well-overused themes of being different, wanting wealth and fame only to lose the self, lying to achieve that wealth and fame, girl loves boy but boy doesn't realize it, etc. Put it all behind some spectacular underwater animation and throw some famous names into the mix as the voices, and you have the whole movie. Best part is, you know exactly what is going to happen in the end at around 10 minutes into the movie. <br/><br/>What irked me greatly throughout the entire movie was the inaccuracy of underwater life. Rather than a movie about fish, Shark Tale was more like a movie about humans, but hidden behind figures of fish. The setting could have been on the surface, and the characters live-action, and the movie would have been exactly the same. Well, except for a few bits of comedy here and there, the underwater setting was completely irrelevant. Now, if the characters are essentially humans, how accurate would the biological aspects of the characters be? Oscar doesn't even move like a fish. He has eyebrows and wears bling bling.<br/><br/>But that was merely something that irked me. The story made me think I had wasted my time. I was going to put that there were spoilers here, but I don't think there's anything to spoil. After all, this isn't a deep movie in any way, and we all know what happens in the typical cliché movie about a guy who strikes it rich through a lie. We also know what happens when somebody who likes that person is introduced into the storyline. Add your typical ""different"" theme (a homosexual among the homophobic is my favorite example) sprinkled with mafia references throughout, and that's the entire story. <br/><br/>As I mentioned above, this is supposed to be a comedy. Most people would call it an adult comedy, though there's no cursing (poopy-head, I think, was the worst it got). More accurately, it is a children's ghetto comedy. I don't have anything against black comedies per se, but to me, they're all the same, with the same overused humor, the same themes, and the same, predictable endings. This movie is exactly that. Basically, if this movie was released during any other time of the year, it would have probably done marginally better than Soul Plane, and only because it was computer animated rather than live action.<br/><br/>There are several redeeming qualities. For example, the obscure references here and there are interesting. The comedy that actually involves fish can be funny at times. The technical aspects, including the graphics, are particularly notable. The voicing was done well. But these are nothing in terms of what makes a movie good compared to the story. After all, movies are supposed to tell a story, and if the story a movie tells is bad, then the movie can't be too much better.<br/><br/>Keep your money for The Incredibles, and go to a bowling alley to hang out instead."

","A poor urban guy by a series of chance occurrences becomes rich and famous, only to face an identity crisis which brings him back to his urban roots. Throw in a love interest, a few homie punchlines and Will Smith and you essentially have an episode of the wildly successful Fresh Prince of Bel Air TV Show. But this is no TV show, you just paid to watch Dreamwork's take on Disney's Finding Nemo. The comparisons will undoubtedly arise between these two underwater computer animated movies, and it's safe to say that Nemo blows this Shark out of the water.<br/><br/>Let me get straight to the gripes. The cool factor of being underwater is that the dynamics of underwater locomotion. Let's face it, even Ian Thorpe isn't all that graceful with his splashing around in the water compared to a fish. And this is the source of my first gripe, these ""fish"" tend to just FLY around with no illusion of underwater movement. They could have been airborne humans. And they have HANDS! And they build building underwater with glass, bricks, concrete, asphalt, metal, and elevators! WHY does a fish need an ELEVATOR?? It's supposed to be a coral reef! And the Whale Wash uses suds and jets of water! That just doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>OK logical gaps are usually explained away as ""suspension of belief"" so let's look past that and get to the characters. I find it an odd choice that when depicting fish, that they look more like humans and less like fish. They have arms and legs that are supposed to be fins. And their faces! Really that fish's face looks exactly like Will Smith including the crazy ears. Did they do this just to get away from being too much like that other fish movie? However, I do give kudos to the sharks and the 2 reggae jellyfish guys. They look awesome.<br/><br/>Now where this movie truly falls apart is the story. There's no reason why we should like Mr. Smith. He's a user, a poser and only at the brink of his best friend being killed does he ""take action"" ... which of course works out marvelously netting him even more fame and fortune. Honestly, this whole ""Shark Slayer"" thing was just a terrible plot device. Terrible. There's just none of the zing in this show. No magic, no charm. It just plunges through it's inane story to the end, not looking back to see if anyone really cares. This is a wrecking ball of computer animated movies.<br/><br/>Now that's not to say that this film has no redeeming qualities. Kids would love it as my wife did. For me the movie was saved by some great supporting characters. Jack Black plays a genuinely lovable vegetarian shark in dolphin drag. Robert De Niro's mafia kingpin shark was hilarious, bringing to mind his comedy shtick from Meet the Parents. Simply great. Finally the two jellyfish guys, Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley, are spot on funny. Off the wall and well thought out. If only the rest of the movie could reproduce hilarity of these guys.<br/><br/>Really this movie could have been so much better. Shame on you Dreamworks for trying to cash in on an animated underwater movie that's just like Nemo but not. All the big name voice actors in Hollywood can't save this one. Something smells fishy here, throw this one back."
"cobbler88","4","1","7","10 December 2004"," Decent production, but hard to identify with
","First, I can see why people may feel the need to criticize the story of this movie. After all, it's been done a few thousand times. Keeping in mind that a young child has probably only seen the story played out a few dozen times, though, I can let that slide.<br/><br/>What I would inform parents about, however, is that this roughly seems to be a hip-hop culture flick as much as a children's flick. The musical turns are to that culture, as are most pop culture references. A number of children in the theatre when I attended did not seem interested in the characters. My guess is that they couldn't identify with the characters, or understand some of their behaviours, because they don't share the cultural experiences. While I support diversity in a film's characters, it really only works when children can empathize with the bulk of the characters.<br/><br/>And is it necessary to put images of seemingly stoned rastafarians in a children's movie? It seems to me that, as is the case with many Disney and other animated efforts in the past 70 years, only supports racial stereotypes.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the story is simple and may have a valuable lesson for the child who is actually able to stay with the film to the end. There are just too many obstacles to arriving at the end, regardless of how visually appealing the film may be. Take care."

","Shark Tale was released in 2004, to mixed reviews and financial success. Now while many have brought up the fact that Dreamworks released this only a year after Finding Nemo came out. Does that mean it's a shameless ripoff? Eh, not really. Does that mean it's good? Eh, it's alright. <br/><br/>The animation is good, but not as good as it could have been for the time it was made. Dreamworks released Shrek 2 that same year with far better animation to showcase. So it's not like they we're limited by the technology they had available. The character designs are a little off-putting at times. The concept to anthropomorphize the fish characters was an odd one, especially since they didn't do it to all of them. Some of them look just like the real fish counterparts, while others are designed to look like the actors portraying them. This is inconsistent and for the most part kinda creepy looking. At least the shark didn't look like Jack Black, shark were scary enough beforehand. <br/><br/>The story line is very standard for a buddy comedy film, not much else to say about it. It's not unique, it's not that bad. As with every comedy film, it should be judged on the quality of it's humor. This film is actually pretty funny. Although it is filled with references that kids won't understand for the most part. Have your kids seen the Godfather or Titanic? No? Okay well they probably won't understand this movie's humor very well. Are you an adult watching this with your kid? Or alone? In which case you'll probably laugh. Crazy Joe was funny! Watch it and find out. <br/><br/>""You're blowin' it man!"" -Crazy Joe. <br/><br/>The acting is actually not that bad. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are particularly good in their roles. Will Smith is not suited for animated roles, most of his cool charisma comes from being on screen. Anjelina Jolie and Jack Black are alright, but both would eventually do better work for Dreamworks in the Kung-Fu Panda films. <br/><br/>Overall this film is too adult oriented for children. Although it has enough clever humor to be appealing to those of us who saw it as kids and revisit it now. Although there is a great deal of humor involving knowledge of gangster films such as the Godfather, those unfamiliar with these film may not find this intriguing at all. De Niro and Scorsese are fantastic in their roles, both being walking talking references to their own classic gangster films. <br/><br/>Shark Tale is not on the same level as Finding Nemo by a long shot, but it makes for enjoyable viewing for the kids at heart."

Like Pixar's Cars, the whole idea makes no sense. How are there complicated electronics like video games and TVs working underwater? How do lava lamps work underwater? The endless fish puns are insufferable too (Mussel Crowe? Ha. Ha.) Most of the anthropomorphic character designs of the fish are weird and off putting. And Will Smith's fish protagonist is too thoughtless and uncaring to be sympathetic. <br/><br/>Another problem is the tired ""Go to the big city story"". How many times have we seen this played out trope which has a bumbling but likable hero who has big plans and dreams of going to the big city, or moving up in the world.

Will Smith voices Oscar, the small fish destine for greater things. Jack Black voices Lenny whose vegetarian ways provide some humour. Other roles are merely celebrity character based. Renee Zellweger voices the standard female fish love interest, and Robert De Niro voices Lenny's mafia based father who would prefer that his son act like a real shark. Angelina Jolie plays a seductive female fish whom Oscar becomes distracted with.

The film has all these big names that you know they only got to draw in big audiences, and there are a bunch of really bad puns. I'm not even kidding about that. The puns in this movie make A Bee Movie look funny. Oscar (Will Smith) is a cool hip hop fish in the underwater city, works at a ""whale wash"", and he's being admired by his coworker Angie (Renee Zellweger). But not all is well for Oscar as he owes money to his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) and he can't pay it off. Well Oscar inadvertently meets a vegetarian shark named Lenny (Jack Black) after it looks like Oscar killed Lenny's brother Frankie (Michael Imperioli). This is bad news because Lenny's father is the shark mafia boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro). Oscar and Lenny then make it look like Oscar killed Lenny making him the shark slayer so Lenny can run away and start a new life. Spoiler alert! We have to go through the liar revealed story again. I understand why they put that in kid's films but it get's old and predictable. But the real problem with Shark Tale is the idea. The story isn't done very well and you know right from the get go that this was an excuse to make money and throw in some pop culture references. Think about it. When you see the characters, you don't see the characters you just see the actors playing them. You now they choose them because of the names and nothing else. Smith's character is also annoying and to be honest a bit of a jerk. There are some moments when the film is enjoyable, particularly with De Niro and Scorsese, but even here you can't shed the light that you are watching De Niro and Scorsese. Honestly I really don't recommend it."

","Oscar (Will Smith) is a tiny prey fish working at a Whale Wash. Like everybody else, he cowers in fear of the sharks. In a freak accident, he survives a shark attack, and everybody believes that he actually killed the shark mobster's son. He encounters the shark mobster's other son Lenny (Jack Black) who is a vegetarian and they concoct a great scheme to increase his reputation as the Shark Slayer.<br/><br/>First off, I don't like Oscar's character. Second I don't really like the Godfather motif. The animation is OK for the era, but I don't really like their faces either. The automatic comparison is to 'Finding Nemo' from a year earlier. The one word I describe Nemo is joy. This one leaves me feeling the blues. Oscar is a cynical fish, and his well being is of little importance to me. Also none of it is funny. It's just a bunch of quirky fish equivalence to the real world."

","I had expectations. Whoa, whoa. Don't freak out like I said something wrong. The cast was the only thing building up my expectations. The animation thing was out of my mind. It was made by Dreamwork's too, which is the only animation company that has reached heights Pixar has. And it was a film with gangster sharks. If that's not enough, the man himself Martin Scorsese plays one of the main characters. So the film had loads of potential. Potential that could either be surpassed or smashed...<br/><br/>Smashed.<br/><br/>I didn't like it, at all. My expectations were completely crushed from just the first ten minutes. So I'm going to tell you why exactly not to see this film, because there is no exact reason to anyways:<br/><br/>Voice acting. It seemed liked the actors didn't even care. I mean the cast was built-up so well, this was the main thing keeping my expectations up and running, but no. It was the acting you see where you can hear the pain in the actor's voice, where they are waiting until their break-time to go out and escape this hellish film..<br/><br/>The animation. Really? This was 2004. Animation was just picking up, I mean tremendously. But Shark Tale completely reverses what it could've been. The CGI was lazily-done and the colors were off-beat. It was almost like watching a bunch of colors dancing. But not good dancing, I mean really bad dancing.<br/><br/>The story. Well, I can't even say it's the worst thing here, but it doesn't really attempt to tell a story. The film was meant to be a kid's version of gangster flicks, correct? Well, it's not. It's a disgrace to them. Almost like burning all the classics in your fireplace. It almost hurt seeing the plot mushed by the confused writers who have no idea what they are exactly doing. It hurts!<br/><br/>But the film isn't the worst one ever, and it has a few redeeming qualities, but not the kind that makes you want to see it. I love the gangster references, and I found some of the humor to be somewhat hilarious, but other than that? I was sorely disappointed with what could have been.. I don't recommend. Please don't see this, whatever you do, don't see this. <br/><br/>4/10."

"Electrified_Voltage","6","0","1","16 September 2008"," A film from DreamWorks Animation with some things to like, but it's still a bit bland
","After Pixar had a hit with their 2003 underwater adventure, ""Finding Nemo"", another film featuring anthropomorphic sea creatures was released in 2004, this time from DreamWorks Animation, called ""Shark Tale"". When I heard about this film, I guess it was shortly before it came into theatres, it looked like something I would want to see, and it wasn't long before I did (it was shown in my English class during my last year of high school for some reason). I'm not sure how I would have rated it at the time, but I remember my verdict was that it was definitely inferior to Pixar's anthropomorphic fish story, but not bad. I've seen it twice since then, but I believe I think less of it now than I did when I first saw it.<br/><br/>Oscar is a bottom-feeder fish in the ocean who feels like a nobody, and dreams of becoming rich and famous. Lenny is the son of shark mob boss Don Lino, and the brother of a shark named Frankie. However, Lenny is an outcast amongst the rest of the shark community, as he is a vegetarian and does not want to kill. Determined to make him a killer like the rest of them, the shark mob boss sends his two sons out, so Frankie can teach Lenny how to be one. However, while they are out, an anchor comes down, hits Frankie, and kills him, leaving Lenny feeling guilty! Oscar, the one Frankie tried to get Lenny to eat, has just witnessed the incident, and apart from Lenny, who has left, nobody else witnessed it. Being seen with the shark's body, the bottom-feeder fish claims he killed him, and soon gets a reputation around his part of the ocean as the ""Sharkslayer""! So, he gets the fame and fortune he's been dreaming of, but the fact remains, he didn't really slay a shark, and after the false news about the ""Sharkslayer"" gets to Don Lino, it appears Oscar is in a lot of trouble! <br/><br/>One thing that makes this film suffer is the Oscar character - so dimwitted, so naive, and not too likable. He tends to get himself into so much trouble, and I'm sure he would be able to stay out of this trouble if he actually thought before he acted! Also, the things he does that get him into trouble are things he does for his own personal gain (before the shark incident, he bets money on a seahorse race instead of using it to pay off his debt)! As a comedy, the movie has its moments, but often fails with its humour, such as the part where they use a typical unfunny fart joke. The whale mouth cleaning part involves gross-out gags involving the filth from the whale's mouth. Although I've definitely seen much worse than that, this part is another example of failed attempts at humour in the film. Another problem I can't forget is that the quality of the writing isn't really that good, and it seems the writers may have been thinking a little too much about pop culture, and perhaps not quite enough about the quality of the writing.<br/><br/>Some may call ""Shark Tale"" a ripoff of ""Finding Nemo"", but I tend to disagree. Yes, they are both CGI animated films involving anthropomorphic ocean fish, but they have a totally different plot, and not exactly the same type of characters. However, that one thing they have in common, and the fact that one came out the year after the other, makes it hard not to compare them, and in my opinion, Pixar's underwater adventure is far superior to that of DreamWorks Animation. I'm sure many would agree, since ""Finding Nemo"" has received a lot more praise. ""Shark Tale"" does have some good parts, sometimes because of humour, and sometimes maybe because of excitement, enough to earn it a slightly above average rating from me. The animation is nice and colourful, so I can't complain much about that, either, and the story might get a bit better as it goes along. However, due to its flaws, this DreamWorks Animation effort is a bit bland (overall, I would say Pixar is the superior CGI animation company), and not one I desire to watch again any time soon."

","Why it is they still have Dvds this garbage on Targetin the Us is beyond me, for years they've shown this and I grow more sick of this movie's Voice acting.<br/><br/>Why? Several reasons.<br/><br/>1. Lousy Voice Acting.<br/><br/>The Actors as you may know seem to be based crappier PBS Programs like Arthur, and animation style has been applied accordingly to the illustrations on Marc Browns book books, by giving everything extra outlines. That's fine for still images but it doesn't work so well when it comes to animating, the lines just annoy you.<br/><br/>2. Bad characters.<br/><br/>So get this, the movie is called ""Shark Tale"" in which the show is based around a retard fish & a shark, here's the thing though, they have nothing to do with each other, they have different interests, appearances, opinions, pretty much everything, which more or less defeats the object of them even being friends, they may as well be just brothers. As well as other things, the drug user Jellyfish who'll do unethical things to there own clients, and the stupid don who sells ""living things"", which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>3. Unexcusable plot.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot fails to entertain. Last I checked, nerds who have no friends and do things no-one cares about like saving a tree are not exactly liked in real life, so WHY center the plot around Oscar, the complete, no interest character? His ""friend"" Lenny doesn't really have much of a point either other than to be vegetarian once in a while, it's all around what Oscar does.<br/><br/>And what Oscar does is basically be pathetic in attempting to protect his mentally challenge-ness. His acting is far too corny, if not intentional to be a little and then there's his competition with Hazcam, the major food product company that seems to control the town with it's lousy hate-tred.<br/><br/>That being said, it doesn't entertain you, just an all out terrible movie that baffles me how they still shows dvds of it on many ratales.<br/><br/>If this movie ever reaches your local shopping store, avoid, for the love of god avoid this crap."

","In the annals of computer generated animations, ""Shark Tale"" will not be mentioned with the best of them. The animation was fine, they usually are. The story is what was totally lacking. I had no interest in a fish trying to become a rich big shot... I mean come on, it was a fish. There were a couple of compelling characters, Oscar (Will Smith), not being one of them. Oh, wait a minute... I'm confusing this movie with ""Finding Nemo""... there were NO compelling characters. Well, I guess those Jamaican Jellyfish weren't so bad. To top it all off, there was nothing to laugh at. Every good animation has to have its good comedic moments, or at least the one funny character. ""Shark Tale"" lacked both of those. But, ""Shark Tale"" was an animation, it was mildly entertaining, and as I always say: it's hard to go wrong with an animation. <br/><br/>Let's review: Animation, good. Story, marginal. Characters, not compelling. Jamaican Jellyfish, OK. Movie, mildly entertaining."

","This movie had to been my favorite of all times, why? Because the movie was finally showing someone who had a disability and was put down for his differences. Many people mistake Lenny's gayly behavior as being a homosexual, I didn't consider him gay. To me he had a disability and a warm heart, I was very giddy to when I was in H.S. and many people thought I was gay and I am not.<br/><br/>Besides this it was a good movie played by good actresses and actors, the music was good. The movie was more cartoony looking than Finding Nemo, and was a bit like Shrek in these ways. Shrek had some jokes that mostly adults would understand, although in today's world kids are able to catch onto it quickly. Lola the trampy fish came onto Oscar too strongly, and you could see in the body language and in the eyes where it was going. When I was a kid I don't remember seeing children's movies in this way with this kind of behavior or language, and in this case I can understand why parents are complaining.<br/><br/>Not every parent wants their children learning about the mafia or what the mafia is, although there was no violence or no blood. What touched me in this movie was how even though Frankie was embarrassed by Lenny he always tried to stand up for him and help him even when his father was trying to put down Lenny.<br/><br/>Other comments I read was the movie copy's too many other movies. Don't all movies have music and jokes about other films, in The Godfather Luca was a killer in Shark Tale he was the right hand boss ( I think ). In this movie it was Don Lino not Don Vito, this movie may have had similar name to The Godfather but the violence and take offs were no where close to being copied.<br/><br/>This is my opinion about the movie, take a closer look at Lenny and take a closer look at adult handicapped people, they often act childish and that's how Lenny was acting. This is why I liked it because not many movies show characters with disabilities, I am not insulting people I am just correcting people who say Lenny was gay."

","Despite having the benefits of a very talented cast and some of the best digital animators in the business, Shark Tale ultimately fails to reach the levels of success achieved by its contemporary, Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Nemo had a sharp uncomplicated script that was primarily aimed at the kids, yet was funny and clever enough to amuse the adults as well. The characters were appealing without being too nauseating and the CGI was superbly executed  state-of-the-art, colourful and detailed without being too fussy.<br/><br/>Shark Tale, on the other hand, is... ahem... a different kettle of fish. It has a leaden script, hampered by a lack of really funny jokes and too many references to urban popular culture, most of which will go way over the heads of younger viewers. The characters are some kind of freakish amalgamation of human and fish  quite possibly the ugliest animated creatures ever (the fish resemble the actors providing the voices  a bad move!). The CGI is packed with detail but is far too brash and fails to convince the viewer that the story takes place in an underwater environment.<br/><br/>Sure there are the occasional funny moments  the two Rastafarian jellyfish and the shrimps made me chuckle  but these are too few and far between. What we are left with is a rather soulless affair that will struggle to find an audience when there is much better out there."

This film is slick and in some places quite amusing but it doesn't ever really engage the audience and I found myself really not bothered about any of the characters or the story. Admittedly this is for kids (and I'm 24) but I love a good cartoon/animation and to be perfectly frank this wasn't one.<br/><br/>From the second the film was advertised I knew it was going to be a 'voice fest' - lots of famous people, playing caricatured versions of themselves for comedic effect. I sincerely hope that the good people at Dreamworks have learnt their lesson, in animated movies it's not the stars who sell, it's the story. Okay, there are probably Dreamworks fans who will jump to it's defence and draw parallels with Shrek, and yeah Shrek was loaded with stars but it also has a brilliant storyline and succeeds where this film fails.<br/><br/>My advice for Dreamworks execs; with more plot and less stars they might have made a movie that didn't just sink into oblivion like a dead whale.

When, by chance, the two meet one another, a rather large and unpleasant mix- up occurs, with Lenny's father believing that Oscar has killed his son, because the little fish was seen near the death site of his son.

A son shark not being accepted by his own father. We see another stupid movie where someone bets everything that he owns and loses all of his money at the 11th hour. When the big brother shark died, that was the phoniest death scene I have ever seen in an animation in my life! Jack Black plays the role of someone who is very stupid in every movie that he's in, even though he was a shark in this movie."
"the amorphousmachine","6","0","2","16 June 2005"," Light-hearted viewing, but lacks the magic of other computer animated films, particular its obvious competition in 'Finding Nemo'!
","The influx of computer-animated films in recent times is proving to make for some interesting competition. 'Shark Tale', following on the heels of the well-received 'Finding Nemo' displays the comparison. No doubt about it, 'Shark Tale' is as hip as you can get, or at least it tries to be hip. Lots of cultural and movie references (some clever, some lame), in-jokes, and emphasis given to the voice cast. However, there is no magic in this film and no real awe. It's entertaining enough, and gives us an underwater version of pop culture, much like 'Robots' gave us the robotic version of what society would be like! 'Shark Tale' did manage to make me laugh, and Will Smith as Oscar does okay. Still, even with Robert DeNiro as the Mafioso shark in Don Lino- there is no formidable bad guy in this film! However, 'Shark Tale' does get the point over that getting fame based on a lie is never a good thing, and being yourself is the way to go. Jack Black does okay as the out-of-place shark who disguises himself as a dolphin, and you can pretty much guess the hidden reference about acceptance there-, which again is okay. All in all, this is a kids film with some adult themes chucked in, and its pretty good for a rainy day, but it hardly reaches 'Finding Nemo's' status as the ultimate underwater adventure, probably because 'Shark Tale' is too gimmicky and reliant on pop culture, and not to mention the god-awful ""Car Wash"" song at the end with many a fish rapping. Some nice touches like Katie Current (a spoof of Katie Couric and was the recast voice to represent the news presenter of Today in country of release even though the underwater city was New York amalgamated with Hollywood and the rest of the voices), as well as Coral Cola, the Whale Wash, the Sea Horses races etc. Now, all I have to do is see the other underwater-animated flick in the 'Spongebob Squarepants Movie'! 'Shark Tale' is okay in my book, and besides the very last groan inducing song at the end, it's light-hearted viewing!<br/><br/>*** out of *****!"

Unfortunately, the same amount of thought was not put into the script and the movie definitely fell flat. The plot was typical; hero at the bottom of the food chain, wants to be at the top. He makes it to the top through some trickery, goes for the goldigger. And he finally sees what is really important and returns to the down-to-earth sweetheart that loved him all the time. This is also a case of too many big names spoiling the movie. I spent half the film trying to decipher who lent their voice to what character.

","Since this animated movie did come from Dreamworks the same company that made Shrek than it cannot be avoided that I compare the two. This movie just didn't have the same ""enjoyment factor"" as Shrek. The humor was not as good and the characters were not as lovable.<br/><br/>Frankly the only character that I liked in the movie was that of Oscar (will Smith). The rest were just dull considering that this was a comedy. I thought the most disappointing character was that of Jack Black. He did a great job in School of Rock and I was expecting more of the same in this one but got very little of his wisecracks and antics. Perhaps it was a miscast and another actor could have been drafted in.<br/><br/>I also felt that some of the characters were given less than desirable amount of screen time. I guess this was an effect if studios loading their cast with many star names with an eye to using this as marketing tool to sell the movie. I definitely would rather have had less stars but it would have meant more screen time for the main characters.<br/><br/>In terms of the animation, I'm not really as astonished with the quality of the animation. Yes perhaps it may have the same quality as previous films like Shrek or Finding Nemo but given that almost everyone is using this technique it now looks all so ordinary. If this movie were done a few years /months ago then I would definitely be raving about the animation."

","I've really enjoyed the little things. As; the comments and references to other movies, especially the godfather trilogy that I just saw recently. The shark voice over by de Niro WAS de Niro, his voice, his face marks, the details, they were all great. Without analysing and telling what line and expression comes from what movie, it's fun game to play with friends when you are watching. As for the star; Will Smith is funny, his ability to be fun cool and quick is an undisputed talent from the days of the Fresh Prince. The story was simple but fun, I really liked the way the parallels between a vegetarian shark and coming out of the closet. With all these pros, what is wrong with this movie? My guess is the too big an emphasis on the MTV R&B culture. In the beginning it's fun, mimicking MTV's crips, but in the end it's too obvious and it starts to annoy. For me the song in the end, too much! And please oh please don't forget the sponsors. Why oh why didn't they use the blue Coca Cola sign? sorry; Coral Coca Sign. The coffee that floats away in the see is funny, but this against the very big 10 seconds 2 times reoccurring cola sign. I know a studio has to make money but less obvious, please? In conclusion it wasn't bad and 5.8 average is quite right. The hints to other movies like (Theme song Jaws is from Spielberg, and he's owner of Dreamworks) That makes this movie fun. The weakness is that the creators watched too much MTV television, and that is bad for you! if you are above 23."

","What's happening to the world of animation? I remember the days when animation was all about telling/visualizing a story in animation form to provide good and wholesome holiday entertainment for the whole family. The names of the voice-over actors could be found, discreetly mentioned, in the credit rolls at the END of the movie. Gradually we saw more and more big names lending their voices to animated works usually ""in order to do something for their children"". Noble cause huh? OK, I must admit it was amusing for me as an adult to recognize a well-known movie personality acting out his or her typical roles in an animation. I was much less amused with the happenings in ""Sharktale"". We were first of all bombarded with the all the names of the big stars lending their voices to the movie. Mind you 1 whole frame for 1 big name. (Robert DeNiro, Will Smith, Jack Black, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese etc). Then to my utter astonishment I had to observe that their fishy counterparts were exact lookalikes. It was so dominant that it seemed to me that the whole movie was about THEM. Must be great not only to hear your mummy or daddy in a cartoon but see them ""animated"" as well. But I wonder seriously if this going to be a fashionable trend in Hollywood. Is it going to be a sign of true stardom to :a) have your name, feet/hands/boobs imprinted on a tile on the Walk of Fame and b) have yourself eternalized as an animated character? From a business point of view it is of course a clever gimmick to have these famous movie personalities in animated movies. Cartoons were for kids and families with kids mainly. A movie like Sharktale shall undoubtly attract a whole lot of teenagers and young adults. I feel mostly sorry for the kids though. Unknowingly children are now being ""familiarized"" with the big movie stars of today whose movies are as yet unsuitable for them. Perhaps this is a big Hollywood psychological plot to guarantee that the next generation of moviegoers will be guaranteed fans of the stars of today? In my opinion it is a sick trend!!!"

In the ocean the crime bosses, sort of like mafia fish, are the sharks. The lead crime boss shark is Don Lino (Robert De Niro) whose son Lenny (Jack Black) doesn't like to eat fish. Don Lino's other son decides to make Lenny eat fish so he makes Lenny try to eat Oscar.<br/><br/>Lenny won't do it, so Don Lino's other son goes after Oscar to eat him and gets killed when an anchor falls on his head. Oscar pretends that he slayed the shark and goes famous underwater, he also befriends Lenny who accepts that Oscar killed his brother. Soon Don Lino figures out that it's Oscar who killed his son and goes after him. And yada, yada, yada. This movie wasn't all that great so go see some other movie. I give Sharkslayer a ""1 out of 4"". Basically go see something else, like Ladder 49, which is about firemen, I hear that's good, so go see that instead. Bye"

","Not an immediate classic, but I loved it all the same. Some real funny bits and some quite touching moments as well, although maybe it was just me who thought so. Unlike some of DreamWorks other releases, it is probably not as appealing to adults as to children but still family fun that the kids will definitely love. No extreme scary bits I could pick out, so really young kids should be fine as well. The characters are great, and the voices are spectacular, I couldn't pick out one to fault. The gangster sharks are quite funny and cleverly thought out. I especially liked the crazy lobster and mad shrimp. I also enjoyed the beginning where life in the reef looks very much like the life we live, very amusing. There are continual references throughout the film. Just another thing I find entertaining, don't know why. Some of the jokes are too obviously intended to make you laugh that they just don't, if that makes any sense, but aside from this, the film has a great plot, strong characters and great voices, so I would see it again and recommend it for anyone just looking for a good film to see at the cinema. Nothing too heavy. Enjoy! 9/10"

","Yes, it is true that if Nemo was not set as a mile marker for Shark Tale to live up to, it would be a better hit. And all this is coming from a person who saw Nemo on opening day, plus numerous other times in theaters. But, of course, this one I did the same for. I will never choose favorites, as they are both my favorite in their own way. This movie is incredibly funny, and definitely worth seeing. Now, I know many parents may say, ""Well that was kinda stupid"", but it does get its point across. Yeah, it's kinda obvious, like, ""Well duh"" obvious, but you wouldn't want a theme that the stupid people wouldn't get. I, as a teen, loved the jokes, some kiddies may not get them, and neither the parents. I say they did a good job in aiming for everyone- including teens with some Sean Paul/Missy Elliott/D12 music. But what drew me the most was the awesome animation. ""Definitely worth seeing""."

","Overall, I liked the movie. I thought the plot was decent, and the movie contained a lot of creative ideas and concepts. That being said, I felt the animation was rather flat. I would have expected more from Dreamworks. Most of the time it was hard to tell that the scenes were taking place under water, with the regard to the lack of depth in color and special effects. I liked the characters in the movie and thought their respective personalities were well written. I think kids will get into it, particularly with all of the pop culture references throughout the movie; however, at the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking it was definitely not Nemo. Or Shrek. Or Shrek 2. It's a fun movie, but with all of the talent behind the characters, you would think they could have put more into the animation."

","My eleven-year-old daughter loved this movie, and it certainly does have its moments of humor and absolute fun. However, with the cast they had assembled, the potential was there for true greatness, and this movie misses that by a mile. It has some great sight gags and jokes and some really good voice acting but the story just isn't enough to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The sendup of ""Godfather"" is great - De Niro is great, as always, and if you can see this movie as a ""Godfather"" satire - well, it succeeded in that role, and wildly so. In most other areas it isn't quite so great, and the story suffers from one of the lamest Deus Ex Machina endings ever.<br/><br/>Still, its moments are enough to make it worth watching once, maybe.

","What a cast for an animation movie ... but does it matter? Actually, no.

The jokes and sidekicks work from the beginning, you laugh about the ideas these crazy Dreamworks guys came up with, but you did so in all the other animation flicks, too.

","I don't know why this movie got bad reviews. It has a good story, funny characters, good computer graphics and it was just fan to watch. If you didn't think this movie was funny then I guess you have little or no sense of humor. You can't really compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale because they are really different movies. There is no reason for Disney to sue Dreamworks (like some of you say they should) because even though Finding Nemo is copywrited Shark Tale is not copying Finding Nemo. Even though the story is about life under the sea doesn't mean that it is copying Finding Nemo. Shark Tale is a totally different story and has none of the same characters than Finding Nemo.

After all, I don't want to waste my money on a bad movie!! But as the weekend passed, everyone told me that the movie was great, and that I should go and see it. So on Sunday, I caved and took my family to the 11:30 showing. The crowd was full of young families and we had to sit in the second row because of the parties of little kids all over the place. But it turned out not to be a kid's movie. It's not up to Shrek caliber, but it's definitely a smart, funny film meant for both kids and adults. The little ones were constantly in giggles but there were a few one-liners that went right over their heads and directly hit the adults, so everyone was happy.<br/><br/>The movie is about a fish named Oscar (Will Smith) who wants to do something with his life to become a ""somebody"" and live at the top of the reef instead of in the ocean ghettos. Already, you can tell that this concept has been covered before and this only leads to more predictability. When the brother of a misfit shark (Jack Black) is killed, Oscar is at the scene of the crime and becomes an instant hero. In a matter of hours, Oscar is whisked to the top of the reef and living a totally different life. He also meets Lola (Angelina Jolie), a fish who suddenly is attracted to this new ""somebody"". I don't want to give away much more than this, but I can pretty much guarantee that you can guess the outcome of this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line, although this story has been explored in MANY other movies before, it's given new life with this all-star cast and witty humor that is guaranteed to make you smile. 7/10"
"JAKastner","6","0","1","4 October 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Shark Tale
","Undoubtedly one of the most famous, and most entertaining (depending on who you ask), rivalries in Hollywood would have to belong to the ongoing conflict between the Walt Disney Company and Dreamworks SKG. After Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 to form his own movie studio with hot-shot director Steven Spielberg, the two studios have butted heads on more then a few occasions and look to continue to do so in the future. This rivalry has gotten so bad that one or the other have accused the other of ripping off their ideas in order to profit from their success. In 1998, two animated films featuring insects opened up in theaters  PDI's Antz in October followed by Pixar's A Bug's Life less then a month later. Conveniently Dreamsworks' eventual Oscar winning animated film Shrek, featuring a monster for a lead, opened just six months prior to the release of Disney's Monsters Inc. which, obviously, focused on the world of monsters.And if this obvious trend of copy-catting isn't apparent by now then perhaps this latest match-up will. Following the smashing success of Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo which netted $340 million domestically alone, Dreamsworks, attempting to one-up Disney before the release of their latest venture with Pixar The Incredibles, hopes Shark Tale will raise their future IPOs to sky-high levels.<br/><br/>The story centers on a 'small fish in a big pond', also known as the ocean, who lies to become a big shot but finds out that holding up the lie was a lot harder then he originally thought. Oscar has huge aspirations for himself but little effort to back it up with. Most of the time he spends coming up with crazy 'get rich quick' schemes, for example  bottled water, and trying to persuade his boss to give him the money to enact on those plans. Unfortunately, those plans, as would be expected, never pay off and Oscar finds himself five-thousand clams in debt with his boss, who is pressuring him for the money thanks to his partnership with Don Lino, the mafia shark of the ocean. When Oscar can't pay his boss, he's tied up and dumped into the middle of a training ground for sharks, with Frankie, the oldest son of Don Lino, heading straight for him. Just as Oscar seems to be done it, an anchor mysterious falls onto Frankie's head and kills him. Since no one is around when the event occurs, Oscar makes up the story that he beat up Frankie in a fight and dubs himself 'The Sharkslayer'. This outrageous event brings Oscar a wide range of fame and fortune but when the Don discovers who he is, a bounty has been placed on his head. Oscar can't see what the fuss is all about over one teeny-tiny little white lie. The story for Shark Tale is a problem within itself, specifically there's very little of it present and any that does exist is all too generic and predictable to be called the least bit interesting, even by preschool standards. The film's entire premise and purpose is based on its trivial references to popular culture. This means that whenever there is a drought of references then the story suffers severely and slowly begins to drag. Even when references are made (for example, Corral-Cola  big laugh everyone) they aren't gut-busters, let alone thought provoking, which is the direct opposite of Pixar's line of humor.<br/><br/>As with any Dreamworks animated venture, whether it be traditional, which has virtually gone the way of the dinosaur not just with this studio, or computer-generated, the studio devotes more time on stock-piling A-list voice-over talent rather then a more prominent issue, specifically the story, and Shark Tale is no exception to the rule. Will Smith, the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, voices the fast-talking fish-out of water  well, umm, fish named Oscar. If you find Smith's slick spiel and  then you'll be loathing the hour and a half of this film. There was so much promise as his fabulous performances in Men In Black and Independence Day but now it seems as though Wild, Wild West woke us up to the reality that, like the film, his choice of film projects stinks on ice. And here's a question for the older audience members, aka the parents purposely dragged to this feature by their all-too cute children, does Will Smith's Oscar not draw eerie similarities to the Incredible Mr. Limpet? Scary, huh? The problem with the film's aquatic cast of characters is not exactly their material, though that's separate problem itself, but rather it is the performers themselves. The real issue is that we've all seen, or heard, these actors and actresses play out these exact same characters in an obviously different environment. For example, Robert DeNiro as a mafia boss  Who didn't see that one coming? Granted it might have been slightly more entertaining had the filmmakers stuck with their original choice, that being James Gandolfini, but not by much. The same goes for Smith as the fast-talking and wise-cracking hero, Jolie as the sexy seductress, and Black as the dim-witted, yet lovable, sidekick.<br/><br/>Overall, whether Shark Tale is a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the underwater family film Finding Nemo or a lame attempt at pop culture humor, in either case it just simply doesn't work. After marveling audiences this past summer with the vastly superior Shrek 2, both Dreamworks and PDI demonstrate that someone seriously dropped the beach-ball on this one, perhaps while executives at the top were distracted counting the stockpiles of money the highly anticipated sequel brought it. It's a hard job but someone, beside the accountant, has to do it.First off, there doesn't seem to be a story with this film at all except for a striking similarity to the Brave Little Tailor, but other then that, it was basically free reign for the animators to do what they wanted. And secondly, the differences between Pixar and PDI are prominent when it comes to pop culture references. With Pixar, they concentrate primarily on the film's story and, whenever they have the opportunity to, they insert a reference to a movie or a celebrity or something like that  they never force the story into a direction for the sole purpose of a joke or base an entire film on a running-gag concept, as this film does. Shark Tale is not by any stretch of the imagination a horrible film, parts are even quite charming, but, not to give the filmmakers too much credit, does lack the originality and spunk that would deem it an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)"

","""Shark Tale"", for what it's worth, isn't simply a mindless visual feast for children. It has its share of whims, delights, and good humor, and in many respects, it can be a quite enjoyable experience. I enjoyed the ""shark mob"" scenario, especially interesting with the likes of Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorcese offering some pleasant humor in reference to ""The Godfather"". On the other hand, not all of the fishes in the sea are great catch. Will Smith, providing his usual ""bad boy"" talents to a ridiculously lame looking fish is sorely ineffective and sometimes annoying: the ""impervious sharkslayer"" scenario can hardly sustain this plot without becoming tedious, predictable, and even lamentable. Oscar the fish's love interests, Renee Zellweger and the luscious Angelina Jolie are decent diversions to Will Smith's cawky character, yet are extremely spared, and even when they receive presence, Oscar stands in the way of them having any memorable dialogue or significance to the story. The most perturbing character in this ""sea of wonder"" was Lenny the Shark, a wimpy, sentimental, pathetic excuse for an ocean warrior, who becomes immensely unwanted throughout the story. The dialogue is routine, and borrows heavily from mob classics and Smith hits, and rarely can you take a shark or a fish too seriously. The music is pleasant and droll, if not entirely portentous, and it too is nothing original. Overall, I'd deem this ""Shark Tale"" a step above the usual Disney family fare (e.g. ""Finding Nemo""), with many delights, fancies, and whims, yet many of the characters, the plot, and the hastiness of the film can hardly sustain even a seemingly fun fare as this. After all, there are fairer fish in the sea for catching. **1/2 out of ****"

"billthebutcherofthe5pts","4","0","2","26 September 2004"," As Thin as a Shark's Fin: Dreamwork's Animation has Become the Pop Culture Pixar
","Dreamworks' animation seems to continue to rip off of Pixar (currently owned by Disney), left and right. In 1994, Jeffery Katzenberg left Disney to form Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. It is rumored that he took the idea of Pixar's A Bug's Life with him, and made Antz. In my opinion, Antz is a much deeper film where the ant colony represents a communistic society that the hero must overcome. A Bug's Life had a bit more flimsy plot, with the hero ant trying to save his colony from grasshoppers.<br/><br/>Since Antz, Dreamworks' animation has gone downhill, from Shrek and it's sequel, to their new film, Shark Tale, coming out after the success of Pixar's Finding Nemo . Full of pop culture references that don't fit in, bright glitzy eye candy for the kids, and an easy to follow, albeit flimsy plot, Shark Tale may entertain the children for 90 minutes, but it shows how much of a shoddy trend Dreamworks is setting, trying to keep up with the creativity of Pixar.<br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>Set in an underwater New York City, Times Square and all, Shark Tale follows Oscar, a lowly fish who works at a Whale wash. He always seems to be down on his luck and broke. The city of fish is terrorized by sharks, who are made out to be like the mafia.<br/><br/>Luckily, Oscar winds up in the right place at the right time, as an anchor falls on a shark who's chasing him, son of Don Lino the infamous head of the sharks, and kills him. Some other fish happen to see Oscar there, and he takes credit for killing the shark, and now becomes the infamous 'sharkslayer.'<br/><br/>I will give Shark Tale its props for being one of the most politically correct animation films in recent memory. It attempts to display many different ethnicities through it's fish, from the Will Smith voiced Oscar representing black culture, along with his father having an afro, to the sharks representing the mafia culture-not the Italian culture, as not all Italians are in the mafia; I too wish to be politically correct, to the gay culture. Yes folks that's right, there is a gay shark in Shark Tale. Lenny the shark, voiced by Jack Black, is gay, and I beg anyone to argue.<br/><br/>Sure, the writers don't actually come out and say it, but Lenny is a vegetarian, i.e. different from all the other sharks. When he sits in certain scenes, he crosses his fins, like a girl. And he eventually paints himself blue, to resemble a dolphin, and dresses up like one of the Village People. His main desire is to have his father, Don Lino, accept him for who he is. Again, put all that together, and you have a gay shark.<br/><br/>What really irks me about this film is the out of place pop culture references. At one point when Oscar is on TV after he defeats Lenny, a set up, he blurts out, 'You can't handle the truth.' And right afterwards, 'You had me at hello.' Two famous movie quotes that had absolutely nothing to do within the context of the scene. They were just there to get laughs, I guess, but it surely didn't work. <br/><br/>Besides the plot wearing thin after awhile, a lot of the writing is just so lazy. For instance, the script tries to have all these creative references, but they don't work. One is to The Godfather, with the octopus being named Luca, ala Luca Brasi. Yet the octopus is only an assistant to Don Lino, while Brasi was a cold blooded killer. They also could have made the octopus bigger, to fit the look more of Brasi. They could have done more with that reference, it's just like the lines of dialogue above that don't really fit in. Why make a reference like Luca and not go anywhere with it.<br/><br/>The kids are sure to love the bright colors and unoriginal music, like the cover of 'Car Wash.' And the product placement in Shark Tale is disgusting, from Coke to Krispy Kreme donuts-another attempt to get kids hooked on these brands early. They were even giving out free Krispy Kreme donuts after the screening; great idea for America's overweight children today.<br/><br/>I will admit the eyebrows on Sykes, voiced by Martin Scorsese, is pretty funny, and his character is probably one of the better aspects of Shark Tale. Overall, this feels like a dumbed-down Shrek 2, which I thought was pushing the limit between creativity and spouting off pop culture. After seeing Shark Tale, all I can say is, I can't wait for The Incredibles, the new Pixar film. I guess nothing will measure up though to the most creative animation film in the last 10 years, The Triplets of Belleville."

Even that very charm of most animated movies, which is taking audience into an adorable fancy journey, was missing. Despite having it all (a team of A-list actors and an undeserved huge success of Shrek2), this one still misses the bus this time. I think commercially movie will do well and it is only because of lack of competition, but I am not too sure about it either. Because in Australia, where I watched this movie, tickets were easily available for a 7:30pm Friday night screening just 15 mins before the showtime which is very rare and the cinema was only 60% full, now do the maths and figure out how far would this one go !!!!"

","Shark Tale was entertaining, but ultimately rather cheesy. The storyline is fairly simplistic about a fish named Oscar who wants to move out of the inner city and to the ""top of the reef"" without having to do anything to actually deserve it, like work. It comes out like a cross between Car Wash and the Godfather, which is basically as bizarre as it sounds.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's full of sight gags and you'd have to watch the movie several times to determine what all those undersea versions of popular brands are (""Coral Cola,"" ""Kelpy Kreme""). Most of the dialogue is peppered with Wiseguyisms and hiphopisms that are a bit dated and unfunny. It was a bit bothersome that they bothered to use the ocean as a setting, yet made all the fish move in a completely human manner. But it was really fun seeing certain actors as fish, and the introduction of ""Sebastian the Whale Washing Dolphin"" was highly amusing. I also found Ziggy Marley telling Oscar that he was singing a reggae song poorly to be very funny. <br/><br/>Decent enough movie, but not as good as recent DreamWorks animations."

However what I found was that Dreamworks have taken their intertextuality license and worked it for all it's worth (and then some).<br/><br/>The story is quite unremarkable, and the worst element is the main character - Oscar, who is incredibly annoying. The character is far too willing to wise-crack every second of the film, obviously because Dreamworks is desperately afraid that the audience may get bored. This has a very adverse affect however, and it is very easy to grow tired of what would otherwise be a ""sidekick"" character who will.not.shut.up. Empathy is hard to muster with a character like this, and does not compare to a character like Shrek, Woody, Z or Flik. Even Mike from Monsters, Inc. knew when to be silent and let the story carry itself. Other characters are really just filler, and are either boring (Angie) or unnecessary (Lola).<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the racial stereotypes within this film, and although they are all in good fun, they do tend to grate. The sharks are an exception however, and really do steal the show whenever they are present. In fact, it's the references to Goodfellas, Jaws, the Godfather and other mobster movies which are the only ones which actually do generate some laughs. The rest of the film spoofs/nods really seem to be tossed into the sea hap-hazardly, or ""for the sake of it"". Many moviegoers may get some kind of kick out of hearing a fish say ""You had me at hello"", but I for one think there is a clear difference between using other films to be truly witty and clever (think Nemo's nods to Psycho, The Birds and Fight Club) and throwing in movie quotes for cheap laughs, which is what we see here.<br/><br/>Other gags often fall flat due to being either too cliché, or not really relevant or humorous within the context: ""Don't worry, a lot of white fish can't do it.""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Shark Tale is not all bad. There are some redeeming qualities in the film. As I said, the sharks, particularly Don Lino and the ""extended family"" are really enjoyable, as is much of the animation (particularly when we really get to see the reef city). The film opens really well, with a number of great sight gags - which really set up the world nicely. It's just a shame that the characters and the story were not as well-rounded and formed enough to make use of this world. Even Lenny is not as enjoyable as he could be, until towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>We have definitely been spoiled with the quality of previous computer-animated films, and a lot of love and attention has gone into their construction. This is obviously a back-burner project that falls behind Dreamwork's most important franchise, Shrek, and it is obvious that it hasn't received this care. It definitely is worth a watch, but high hopes may leave viewers disappointed, like me. Truly an example of how a cinematic format is only as good as its story and characters. Companies cannot ride the ""3D success wave"" forever..."

","It was nine years ago this November that one of the most influential movies of the next decade was released to mass audiences. The film was Toy Story, and it is credited as being the first fully computer generated feature length film. Expectations were fairly high for the $30 million production and continued to gather momentum through the roaring responses by test audiences and the reaction to the trailers and media hype. When released November 22, Toy Story flew out of the gate with nearly $29 million in its opening weekend alone. The landscape for films and the entries into the top grossing films of all time would be changed forever.<br/><br/>In the nine years since Toy Story debuted, studios have yet to have a misstep with the computer-generated format. Monster's Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2 became incredibly successful films eating up box office dollar stats upon each release. Not be left behind in the cold, other studio's began to see the Disney cash cows mooing every time a Pixar/Mickey Mouse collaboration hit McDonald's Happy Meals. Fox Studio's released Ice Age (2002), and Dreamwork's lined up the Brinks trucks for Antz (1998) and everyone's favorite Ogre, Shrek and his even bigger sequel Shrek 2. <br/><br/>This fall, children will throw sugar rush tantrums when two films, Pixar's The Incredibles and Dreamworks' Shark Tale hit theaters in the same season that Shrek 2 gets its widely publicized DVD release. In fact, Hollywood is banking on it. Animation studios and their respective creative powers are being dropped like stock in a Martha Stewart portfolio. Gone are the hand drawn ordered celluloid prints of The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan and The Aristocrats. We are in a new world now where even Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius can knock on the $100 million domestic gross doormat. <br/><br/>I had the privilege of a screening of Shark Tale at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. Although only a child at heart, I will admit that I was more than a little excited amongst all the glitz and glitter of the red carpet. Trailers for the movie did not have the effect on me of say a Shrek or Toy Story. But whatever the coming attractions' originality lacked, Shark Tale more than made up in sheer star power. Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Peter Falk's are some of the names that can all be found in print on the films' poster. One of these names alone might get me to buy a ticket for a panned film entry so surely this was a can't miss proposition. Surely?<br/><br/>Well, fret not ye parents who will be dragged by shirttails on opening weekend 'cause Shark Tale fits along nicely amongst its peers in terms of effects, laughs and originality.<br/><br/>Set in the undersea world, Shark Tale is the simple story of Oscar (Will Smith), a small fish with big dreams. A slacker at the local Whale Wash, Oscar is one of those dreamers that think the world should be handed to him on a silver platter. On the other side of the reef, live the sharks. They are a collection of mobster type stereotypes lead by Don Lino (Robert DeNiro) who is looking to turn his family over two his two sons, Frankie (Sopranos' Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black). Typical of what you would expect if the actors were playing live action characters, Frankie is the relentless true heir  a mean, in-the-mold-of-his-father type, while Lenny is the vegetarian who can't bring himself to cause harm to another creature. When the two brothers meet Oscar, a freak accident leaves Frankie dead, Don Lino enraged and Oscar holding the key to the city after taking credit as a shark slayer. Lenny sees this as an exploitive opportunity himself  a chance to hide from his violent family responsibilities, and in a very humorously choreographed battle where Lenny pretends to be slewed by the inferior sized Oscar. The movie then plays out in true comedic style as Oscar builds a fortune out of his newfound fame, Lenny ties to hide living a life as a dolphin and Don Lino becomes increasingly incensed on the notion that a predator of sharks exists. <br/><br/>But where the story might be 'simple' the execution is anything but. Computer generated films have spoiled us with sight gags that would be too costly with live action, and with adult-minded humor and references that makes the experience exciting for the grownups in the crowd. Shark Tale does not falter on these points. The opening sequence was captivating as we were taken for a swim through the underwater city. The ingeniousness of the creators and writers were found in every air bubble of the busy Whale Wash where turtles give turtle waxes, in every starfish laying in the celebrity walk of fame and in a sushi chef who wonders if he is in the appropriate market for his business. Each new turn within the city's infrastructure brought to life ideas that the audience cheered, laughed or marveled at the sheer brilliance of the thought process. <br/><br/>Adding to the lure for the adult crowds, Shark Tale had as many film references as one could throw into a film without infringing on the original storyline. Godfather and Jaws references aside, you will may have to see the movie more than once to pick up quotes from films like Jerry McGuire and Ali. The little kiddies in the audience probably wondered what the adults were laughing and grinning at, but Shark Tale rivals Shrek 2 for film references.<br/><br/>Even with all the adult pop-culture references, children will have no problem enjoying the aquatic world that Dreamworks has created. Add a love triangle between Angie (Renée Zellweger), Oscar and Lola (Angelina Jolie) and you have a filmgoing experience that has something for the whole family no matter what their age. <br/><br/>But maybe the cherry on the top was the itself. Each character from Will's Oscar to Peter Falk's Don Brizzi is animated with wonderful detail and color with each creation having similar facial characteristics as their voiced impersonator. Jolie's lips, Scorsese's eyebrows and even DeNiro's mole are all present in their cartoon form. It's as if the actual actor was reincarnated as the fish that best suited their characters and mannerisms. Couple that with the incredible vibrant colors and attention to detail by the animators and you have what could very well become an instant classic amongst this still blossoming format.<br/><br/>It's hard to knock a film like Shark Tale, but then, why would I? Scorsese and DeNiro seem to be having a ball bantering back and forth with one another, Smith has the reins off so he can act his inner child, and Doug E. Doug needed the perfect outlet for his humor that will make him as lovable and memorable as Eddie Murphy's donkey in Shrek. So hey, if they are having a good time, why should I complain. <br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","i just saw this movie at the toronto international film festival. It was just as good as the Shrek movies and Finding Nemo. The animation is amazing and will smith, renee zellwegger, martin scorcese, jack black, robert de niro, and angelina jolie do a very good job with their voices. adults will like it because of the many godfather/sopranos spoofs. there are a lot of funny lines and the music is great. although it is a bit cheesy at times it is still a movie everyone should see. There are many pop culture references like an underwater times square with ads for ""coral cola"", ""gup"", and Hollywood walk of fame signs for ppl like cod stewart, jessica shrimpson and mussell crowe. <br/><br/>***1/2 (out of 5)"
