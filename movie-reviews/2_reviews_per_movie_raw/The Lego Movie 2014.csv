","Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, ""Are you kidding me?!"" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.<br/><br/>The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and ""master builder"", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the ""special"" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for ""the piece of resistance"" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.<br/><br/>It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! <br/><br/>The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as ""(leading) lives of quite desperation."" <br/><br/>Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around ""master builders"" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built ""according to the directions."" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am."
"BrentHankins","9","138","172","7 February 2014"," An absolute must-see, consistently entertaining from start to finish.
","Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our  childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the  unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little  resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved  so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap,  hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a  bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor  acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra).  So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego  Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than  a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy  store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets  of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most  original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has  quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014.  Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out  his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to  all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an  obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex  Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more  mustache-twirling insanity.  A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads  Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of  only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their  impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him  before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius  (Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and  WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most  hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a  plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise  fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all   provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad  Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman.  From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless  array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil  Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert  grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that  every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's  best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles,  and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules  established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen  must be possible to construct in the real world.  There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act  that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily  derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect  execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount  of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego  Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a  brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great  foundation to build on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously,  The Lego Movie is fantastic.  -- Brent Hankins"
"cameraslie","10","188","239","6 February 2014"," A reminder of how fun Lego can be.
","The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.<br/><br/>A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. <br/><br/>The voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy. <br/><br/>The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's ""resistance piece"". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels."
"tuomas_gimli","9","103","133","11 March 2014"," Everything is indeed awesome
","I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out ""chose one"" clichés and also rather poignant and touching. <br/><br/>The first thing one has to mention is the animation. Not only does it look like an amateur stop-motion film with a $500 million budget, but the amount of detail and creativity put into the visuals is just staggering. At times there's so much going on the screen it's almost overwhelming, yet if you look closely you can see that every single thing is comprised of recognizable Lego parts. The various ways the world shifts, breaks, is constructed again, falls apart and moves around is simply a joy to watch. The implementation of real-world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon ""Kragle"". The result is a film that looks unlike anything we've seen before.<br/><br/>The script is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious gag after another. The jokes come at you so fast you can't catch them all in one viewing, and blink-and-you'll-miss-it side gags clutter the screen. No running gag wears out its welcome, no joke is overplayed or overemphasised. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own. Batman especially is a riotous parody of the grim, dark versions of the Caped Crusader we've been stuck with for nearly a decade. And due to Lego having rights for nearly every IP imaginable, you won't be able to guess which mega-franchise is going to turn up next. <br/><br/>Despite all this high praise, there are a couple of minor issues. During its third act the tone of the film starts moving to a more serious and emotional direction, which to me didn't work as well as the rapid fire comedy of the rest of the film. The voicework is great for the most part, but amidst all the others it becomes rather apparent that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are live, not voice actors. It's not that their performances are bad, they just seem rather flat and lifeless in comparison to the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>The Lego movie is a downright masterpiece, there's no two ways about it. Incredible visuals and animation combined with a hilarious script, dazzling creativity and good characters make it one of the best and most original animated films in a long time. Some minor hindrances can do very little to drag it down, and the end result is fantastic."

","I was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can say is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely satisfying film for all ages- that is, if you have ever played with Legos. Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy this awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.<br/><br/>(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop singing the ""Everything is awesome"" song played in the movie. Too catchy!)<br/><br/>The creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about Legos and making a new movie packed with humor.<br/><br/>The voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed doing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic as the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this movie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business. He gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh, smile, and want more Lego awesomeness.<br/><br/>I give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best picture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all Lego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome, just like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film."

","I went into The Lego Movie expecting drivel, I thought it'd be alike the DC ones but without the DC element to appease me.

"ahan-234","10","111","178","7 February 2014"," A wonderful piece of art.
","This is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other IMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a mistake to see this movie because it's just a ""toy"" movie. But that's what makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters throughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character development.<br/><br/>Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris Pratt) who steals the show. <br/><br/>It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming from beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less said, the better."
"PassPopcorn","8","79","125","6 February 2014"," Pass the Popcorn! review
","To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it.  The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders.  Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities.  The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.  Rating: 8/10"
"goktug11","8","59","93","10 February 2014"," Fun and nostalgic all the way through...
","Went to see it with my brother. With the age difference between us we both loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It's amazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and interact with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and even some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever. You'd be surprised to see how relevant this movie will feel. <br/><br/>I think all people from all ages can find something in this movie that will warm their heart. A timeless classic for sure."

","I go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like it. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems like a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came home and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.<br/><br/>In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the action scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no interesting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of Batman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.<br/><br/>To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.<br/><br/>People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people can see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie already very overrated."
"sunergos","6","37","71","2 April 2014"," Somewhat overrated
","I usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy Story being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me. There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the 'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children commented on this."
"sdguero","5","29","55","7 July 2014"," Frenetic start, slow in the middle, very predictable and not funny
","I'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing all the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with the film...<br/><br/>-The pacing in this film was very off putting for me. Frenetic start! Character development was weak and things happened very fast for the first 15-20 minutes. It sort of made my head hurt. Then things slowed way down and I found the movie to be pretty boring right until the end.<br/><br/>-The plot line, where a father is taking away his kids legos, kind of irked me and it was obvious from the start he was going to come around by the end of the movie. As a Dad, I also thought it had the potential to undermine my authority with my kid a little. <br/><br/>-The punch lines just weren't that funny. I chuckled a few times but that was it, and all the best jokes were already in the trailers. <br/><br/>-Too much product placement. Lets be honest, the entire move is big ad for Lego. But then they throw in all the other products, and it really made the whole film feel like a giant ""get your parents to buy this!"" commercial to kids. <br/><br/>So, there it is.

","A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.<br/><br/>Never since TOY STORY 3, I had so much fun in an animated film. Also, this film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a kid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this film, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the film itself.<br/><br/>The film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a hero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film that has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the writing, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out loud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle. <br/><br/>The animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D film with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the animation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of animation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful for the cinema world over. <br/><br/>The music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed ""everything is awesome"". Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the animation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the 3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too. <br/><br/>I am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters with more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the kid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids."
"Danusha_Goska","2","79","170","23 February 2014"," Irritatingly Frenetic and Ugly to Look At
","""The Lego Movie"" is irritatingly frenetic, smug, and so ugly to look at it hurt my eyes. Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but borrowings of borrowings. ""Jokes"" come fast and furious. They come so fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not. Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few seconds of ""Danny Boy."" This is supposed to be funny because Liam Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the chute. <br/><br/>There's something really smug and divorced from the audience about all this joking. I can just see the writers slapping themselves on the back, congratulating themselves, ""Gosh, aren't we clever?""<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, whom I used to like but who has become predictably ubiquitous in his unending God roles, plays the part of God, or close enough in this secular/Pagan/superhero super derivative mash-up. He tells Emmet (truth in Hebrew; not sure if there is any intended connection) that he, Emmet, is the Messiah. Only the film uses the word ""Special."" Same thing. Eventually the moral of the film is revealed: if you believe in yourself, you are the Messiah, the most intelligent, powerful, interesting person on the planet. Wow, that will make for healthy and happy kids. Not. Luckily the film is incoherent enough that many kids won't even realize that that is the film's message. <br/><br/>In this heavy-handed movie, there's a heavy-handed, live action coda that breaks with all that has gone before. The message of the coda: suit-wearing, rules-following, heterosexual white American businessmen are the biggest menace to the planet, and we should all be more anarchic, creative and narcissistic. Wow, that's a message that Hollywood has never sent before. <br/><br/>Nothing that happens in the action on screen matters. It's one long chase, with Lego characters turning themselves into whatever they want at will, and flying freely. Since they can do this – turn themselves into weapons or escape vehicles – it doesn't really seem to matter that they are occasionally captured by a character named ""Bad Cop"" – problems with authority much? – tortured, and threatened with genocide. Yes, really. There are torture scenes in a movie meant for preschoolers. I found the torture scenes hard to watch, not because they were moving, but because they were weird and out of place. I sat there thinking, what kind of mind puts torture scenes like this in a movie for little kids? <br/><br/>I found the movie so ugly it was hard to look at. You are, after all, looking at computer-generated pieces of plastic. There is no sun, no light, no texture, no authentic color. Just – pieces of plastic. The perfect metaphor for this film."

Because if the LEGO movie doesn't make you chuckle at least once in the hundred minutes of on screen time then I cannot say I know what will. <br/><br/>The fresh faced witty humour of the characters was refreshing and led to shrieks of amusement from the prepubescent's that filled the cinema and the belly laughed guffaws of parents alike. Unlike many children's films to date, the film featured none of the thinly veiled innuendos and stereotypes (commonplace in Disney films). Deviating from the norm, the 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and unprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main lessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to be someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do so. Instead of portraying heroism as something designed for the 'elite' and privileged few who have been 'destined' for greatness since birth, the recurring theme within the movie is that anyone can be a hero.<br/><br/>Full review http://thatgirlreadallaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the- lego-movie_24.html"
"bob the moo","Null","9","14","30 December 2014"," Doesn't quite have the heart the message needed, but it is still energetic, clever and funny
","It was approaching the end of the year when I finally joined everyone else and enjoyed seeing the Lego Movie, a few seasons after it was released. Although I try not to pay attention to hype and critical response, it did seem like a positive that the same people sneering at Transformers for being a pumped-up toy commercial, were perfectly in love with the Lego Movie even though it is entirely reasonable to point out that it will do that product absolutely no harm to be literally the building blocks of a bright, colorful film where one of the messages is to be creative and mess around with things. The plot is quite light – a perfectly ordinary construction worker who spends his life following instructions and order, suddenly finds himself declared the Special One by a group called the Master Builders, who are racing to prevent Lord Business from destroying the world as they know it.<br/><br/>It is a bare bones plot but the flesh put onto it is actually pretty good. With access to a range of characters and franchises, the film has a lot of fun playing with the Lego brand but also the many other brands and characters that it can draw in; this produces a busy film with lots of opportunities for pop culture references and jokes – a lot of which it takes. This is accompanied by lots of frantic action, which is well animated but perhaps just too busy to be fun all the time (often I struggled to really see what was happening amid all the rapid colorful movement – again the type of comment thrown at Transformers but less-so at this). All of this makes it entertaining and the novelty of the Lego is well used to add to the comedy.<br/><br/>Towards the end there is a nice development which I thought was pretty clever and well done; it also opens the door to bring heart into the film by virtue of making it more than cat poster messages and snappy one-liners. It has a reasonable try at this but it was a case of leaving it too late, and it hadn't manage to get this aspect to work through the film in the way that it really needed to have done to sell it totally. Still liked it for trying, but it is an extra at the end, not part of the overall being of the film. This feeling of it being very about the moment, slick and polished is ironically not helped by reading the cast list, since it is a great list of names all sharing the time. The positive of this is that off the page, they are all very good in the film itself, even if many of them are basically doing what we know they can/will do. So Pratt is fun and personable but basically is just doing Andy as a Lego figure. Ferrell, Neeson, Banks, Arnett and others are all good while I enjoyed the many smaller turns ranging from Day and Hill through to Daniels and Billy Dee Williams.<br/><br/>All told it is lively fun, with plenty of crafted dialogue and delivery, but it is the area of heart where it doesn't totally hit home; leaving it entertaining but perhaps not quite worthy of the hype."
"james-fowler-925-832450","1","46","97","16 February 2014"," An unrelenting piece of crap
","This film was like watching a 1h40 advert for Lego. I think the fundamental problem is that Lego is a great medium for telling other people's stories, to which the plethora of characters in the film allude (Star Wars, Batman, pirates) but is not really an interesting subject for a story in itself. <br/><br/>Although, to say that it's completely lacking in story may be a little harsh as this is largely a copy of The Matrix for 8 year olds. In this case, however, despite the principal character's initial self doubt and the ensuing voyage of personal discovery, it turns out that there actually is nothing special about him. Instead we have a film that panders to the latent insecurity of its audience of yuppy parents whose deepest fear is that their child might not be that special after all. Don't worry though, it turns out that everyone's special with Lego.<br/><br/>Additionally, whilst he doesn't appear until towards the end of the film, Will Ferrell's presence can be felt throughout - this film thinks it's hilarious when actually it's just boring, with a boring plot and boring characters polished with some fancy animation.<br/><br/>I read a review (in The Guardian) that suggested an underlying message of citizen empowerment, where anyone has the ability to mould and influence the society in which they live. I think that's reading too much into it, it was about buying Lego. This was the first time that I have felt compelled to write a review on IMDb because of the poor quality of a film. Don't waste your money or your time; you could be building Lego instead."

","In the Lego Movie, and evil minifig named Lord Business has decided that he is tired of all of the creative people messing around with his stuff. He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The masterbuilders can only count on the ""Special,"" a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or capitalist system, in order to ""expose"" it.<br/><br/>In the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain is ""Lord Business."" After all, there are barely any better capitalist ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a boring infomercial for Legos.<br/><br/>The problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the way to the bank."

"MediaPanther","Null","25","51","6 February 2014"," A Killer Sense Of Humor
","Boasting a killer sense of humor and a surprising amount of heart, The Lego Movie is a film that is not just made for kids. It's made with the those small, colored building blocks in mind, easily bringing memories to life for the adult who played with Legos growing up.<br/><br/>It's the underdog tale of Emit Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a standard mini-figure construction worker. Emit, like everyone in his city, lives his life based on instructions drawn up by Lord Business's (Will Ferrell) all encompassing corporation in the sky. When it's discovered that Emit is a prophesied savior of the world, called ""The Special,"" he must prepare to become a ""Master Builder"" to defeat Lord Business before he freezes the whole world. Along the way, Emit gets help from a tough as nails female mini figure, WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise but blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and Batman (Will Arnett), along with scores of other familiar characters and faces.<br/><br/>The film has a super fast pace, with many layers of humor that will keep you laughing and engaged the whole time. Pratt (Her) breathes life into Emit as a manic ""Everyman"" character that you root for, as well as relate to. Arnett's Batman is an uber Alfa male, and every line he utters is quotable and hilarious. As the villain, Ferrell is fun, and with a surprising twist in the story, his performance becomes the heart and soul of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's a lack of female influences in the characters of The Lego Movie. Banks (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) does a fine job bringing WyldStyle to life, and she represents everything a strong independent woman should be. Alison Brie (Community) plays a My Little Pony hybrid creature named Unikitty who is sugar and spice and everything nice, but she does not truly represent another female character, as ultimately she is more of an abstract idea of a character. There are a few brief moments with Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders), however she is overshadowed by the machismo and gruff of Batman. It would have been lovely to see Wonder Woman work side by side with the male heroes to save the world, but she is regulated to cameo status.<br/><br/>A combination of stop motion and CGI animation, the film is visually brilliant. The detail that has been taken to create this universe is astounding. You watch as entire worlds are destroyed in a flash with red, orange, and white Lego brick flames, only to see them built up again. The film is worth the 3D ticket as it enhances the experience and gives the visuals more depth.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is a pure delight. It's everything a humorous movie should be- visual, funny, and touching. It's been made for all audiences to enjoy. Bring the kids,but don't be surprised if you end up loving it more.<br/><br/>-stina@mediumraretv.org www.mediumraretv.org"

","I absolutely hated this movie. Having paid for my family around £10 each to watch what is basically an advert for Lego, I just feel cheated. I didn't find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films funny, I didn't find the script funny. It was too loud, too slow, too ... rubbish for me to watch. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not but I have no idea what the ending was about, the whole Will Ferrell thing with it's preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being able to be creative - complete tosh. My family felt the same by the way. No amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide the fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype."
"filmfanperspective","5","6","9","5 May 2015"," Well-intentioned, but over-caffeinated and not funny enough.
","It is likely that at some point you have put together a LEGO set, or at least sat in a doctor's office as a child and fiddled with ""Duplo"" blocks. The innovate building toy has been around for over 60 years in various incarnations, and over time has become ingrained in our culture- so much so that the licensed lines are commonplace. With licensing came comics, innovative and fun video games, and alas, short and full-length films. A feature-length film is really a culmination of years of success coming to a head. While not an entirely empty excuse to rake in more cash, ""The LEGO Movie"" falls short. At best it brings forth a few guffaws, and at worst it's pun overkill, forced emotion, and boredom.<br/><br/>Please, allow me to 'build' my case 'brick by brick' (see, I can do pun humor too!). Until the first ""LEGO Star Wars"" video game arrived in 2004, I was blasé about the brand. The gameplay was immensely enjoyable, and the cut scenes interspersed between levels were light and humorous. Additional ""LEGO"" games were made, each seemingly more unique than the previous one. This led to the creation of short films, beginning in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and they've been excellent- made with the right balance of pun humor and quirky fun for adults and children. Like any good farcical comedy, the creators turned the subject on its' head, poking fun at the material whilst revering it. The entire LEGO media experience has been rewarding for myself and my child until now. Everything was awesome (see the film to understand that statement).<br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, you'd think it would be a drop in the bag that I'd enjoy this immensely, but that's not the case. I can't help but compare ""The LEGO Movie"" to everything else the company has put out thus far, and in comparison, it doesn't hold up. The story is pretty straightforward- Emmet (Pratt) is a 'regular guy' who literally falls into an interesting situation. Adventurous Wyldstyle/Lucy (Banks) sees him as the 'special'- the one meant to overthrow malicious ""Lord Business"" (Ferrell) and keep him from permanently gluing everything together. Of course, that's just the WORST for LEGO figures, as they love to build. There's also a blind shaman/wizard (Freeman) guiding Emmet, and somehow he teams with Batman (Arnett) and a host of other random mini-figures (including Han Solo and crew?) to stop the 'lord' from doing his 'business'. See what I did there again?<br/><br/>None of this is silly through the eyes of a child, however. The viewing I saw was chock full of cheering little ones. The frenetic nature of the film may be a big draw to those kids, but it just wore me out, to the point of restlessness. Maybe it had something to do with the 'stop-motion' style of animation. Maybe it was just the hyperactivity of the plot, or the way that certain characters spoke. Maybe I'm getting old enough that these kinds of things finally hit me, and I've turned the corner. It would be easier if I could say the film was dull, that I didn't laugh at all, or that it was an empty enterprise.<br/><br/>None of that is true, and one can tell the care the creators put into the film. Consider this- most animated films of later years have done their best to make the film enjoyable for kids and adults alike, and thus its made for everyone. That's a benefit to everyone- the audience doesn't have to fake it and snore through 90 minutes, and the kids actually remember it afterwards.<br/><br/>""The LEGO Movie"" may have been aiming to please everyone, but what made LEGO media work before is missing here. Tack on a confusing, sappy real-life scene at the end between father and son and it shifted into overkill for this reviewer. It performed so well that we can expect a sequel. My suggestion? Hire those responsible for the earlier fare, and recapture the original spirit that didn't need such clamor to work."

I decided to re-watch it later when I was more refreshed. Looked at a different perspective the film was better and less annoying.<br/><br/>I could never fathom how they made an animated film about Lego. The whole idea sounds bizarre on paper. Its actually lo-fi CGI with added inventiveness. So a clone worker is suddenly mixing it up with Batman, Gandalf and Han Solo (all legoised) as well as fighting the evil Lord Business.<br/><br/>The film then switches track with its underlying message that kids just want to have fun with toys and play with them rather than dad having a prized collection, all neat and tidy.

But the ones I did get... weren't funny at all. Now I will admit I enjoyed the character Unikitty (I know, a cat/unicorn. Stay with me). She was pretty funny with the whole happiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff (it's called irony). Plus the ending got boring. Around the time the people appeared on screen, the line cues got slower and slower (and more boring). Most people have been saying that the ending sucked (it did), but I like it because the movie finally ended. Anyway, this movie is bad! The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the animation actually was awesome. That was one of the few good things about this movie.

I, for one, feel sorry for the children who get subjected to this cultural insanity in the theater and then go to school laced with Ritalin because they are hyperactive. feels like our culture is in a sad place and usurped by stupid commercialism. made me miss Jim Henson before he sold out. boo hiss."

The jokes are tedious, predictable and seemingly unending, and the action is mind-numbingly frenetic.

Toy Story and Up and so many other movies actually HAVE emotional depth and real feeling, and the contrast highlights that this facsimile is using pure manipulation.

","I have seen this movie a couple times now and I just do not get it. Really? This is what people are calling the best animated film of 2014?<br/><br/>It's passable, even cute sometimes. But for the most part it's hyperactive and noisy to the point where I was exhausted after seeing it. The animation style is cool at first, but really starts to give me a headache once the action starts. The only remotely interesting character was Batman, who was more clever parody than real character. The live action ending is nice until you realize that the Lego company literally releases sets that come with instructions on how to build with them, leaving little room for imagination. On top of all of this, the film is going to be dated by next year. The style and humor and writing and casting screams 2014 and in the worst possible way. People are even praising its ""message""? What message? Some flimsy commentary on conformity and how everyone is special? Get in line, Lego Movie. That's been done to death.<br/><br/>And I guess all of this would be okay if it weren't for the awards season coming up. This film is being heralded by many as the obvious choice for Best Animated Picture and that's really sad considering the films it will be up against. Movies like Big Hero 6 and How to Train Your Dragon 2, with their strong emotional cores and gorgeous animation, will be overlooked in favor of this mindless garbage.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if I wanted to watch a Lego commercial, I would've tuned into a kids TV channel and waited for one to come on.

","I have to say, this is one rare animation film that could satisfy audience of all ages, but I didn't find it as great as the critics suggest. There all lots of positives, yes, but I find several aspects less than satisfactory, including the soundtrack, and perhaps surprisingly, the twist.<br/><br/>Let me start with the positives first. I have to say I was genuinely pleased by the humour that was presented, some of which are easily laughable, even for adults. They range from the weird & foolish actions that would please little kids, to the plain responses & simple jokes that would trigger a laugh on mature audiences as well. This is a smart & rare quality possessed as an animation film.<br/><br/>The characters are very much likable and the excellent voice casts simply makes them just that more charming. Emmet is a fun main character as he is simple, ordinary & easily relatable. His funny responses are among those that appeal to adults as well. And pretty much all the characters are easily understandable, and this makes for a great connection between them and the audiences.<br/><br/>I thought the overall plot was decent though, and makes for quite an emotional ride with the characters. The twist, however, is a bit more interesting. I have to say it was probably a good twist, in that it makes perfect sense and explains the things that happened before. But to be perfectly honest, for me it wasn't of satisfactory, in fact I was quite disappointed it had to go that way. It kind of eliminates what emotions I have felt of the characters so far. Not a bad twist in terms of quality, but not a likable one, at least for me.<br/><br/>In terms of technicality, the visuals were okay, but the soundtrack didn't really appeal. I may have stated in previous reviews that soundtracks make for more intense and interesting scenes. And here, the opposite is true. The soundtrack doesn't seem to accurately convey the emotions, and so the tension of the drama & action was slightly reduced. Other than that, though, this is simply one rare animation movie, in which the whole family can really enjoy, as it caters for all range of audiences.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>Good: Excellent range of humour, Likable characters, Decent plot<br/><br/>Bad: Unexpected twist, Weak soundtrack<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5<br/><br/>(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)"

There is a tremendous amount of destruction in this film to the point where it felt like I was watching the last 30 minutes of Man of Steel in a loop. Normally I would have laughed much more at the same jokes that were in this film but I just could not engage with the characters so they just seem to pass me by.<br/><br/>Whilst watching it I thought maybe this film is more for kids but in the cinema I was in I could sense the film was just not keeping children's attention as much as say Toy Story has and does, which really is based on the same formula; toys coming to life and living out an adventure.

People suddenly starts to over-hype the film and calling it a ""masterpiece"" and ""the greatest animation"" and such. I see a trailer of the movie in the theatre and think it looks weird but interesting. I decide not to watch it in theatres, and after watching it online it appears I was pretty much right in not wasting my money on this film. Now I'm gonna say this: I liked the film, as I'm a Lego-fan since childhood and thought it was really funny and promoted a good message.

I'm not really the type that cares a lot about online ratings, but SERIOUSLY?! (the reviewers at Rotten Tomatoes REALLY needs a slap to the face as a wake-up call) Honestly, I'm thinking like a lot of other people, this film is just famous for the moment and will be practically forgotten by the end of the year. It's really startling to think people would actually see this film more than one or two times and call it better than the greatest animated film (aswell as THE greatest film ever) made; the Oscar-winning masterpiece Frozen. No, ""The Lego Movie"" does not live up to its hype at all. ""Everything is awesome"", yeah (kinda catchy tune by the way, but it's no ""Let It Go""), but there's no chance this film is anything like a ""masterpiece"". But I guess, being a kids-movie, I guess the film's success/praise should be treated from this perspective. Bottom line, it's a good, funny, and entertaining movie (not great), I enjoyed it, but it's very, very overrated, and I'm expecting this to end very soon. By the way: ""SPACESHIP! SPACESHIP!!

Even with the stop action filming it was pretty good but would have been much better with computer animation like the other Lego movies.

There is simply too much happening on screen and they have tried to pack far too much into the movie. The result is an absolute mess whenever the action picks up beyond walking pace. Pieces are flying about and changing at such speed that it is impossible to take it in. I heard that the animators put 52-years' of combined hours into the film, which means that I assume the work is amazing. If only it had been moving at a speed where it could be appreciated. I would have loved to have seen the beautiful and clever work they did, instead it just felt like they had 4 hours of construction ideas and 90 minutes to squash them in to.<br/><br/>2) Does Lego really know it's audience? The basis of the film is Lego City, which is aimed at 6 to 12 year olds. However, Lego must know that most boys and girls stop playing with Duplo at about 5 and their interest in Lego as a fascination (ie. something they would want to see a movie about) rather than an occasional plaything wanes at about 8. The entire cinema was full of kids aged below 9, that much is for sure; and yet the story itself is too complex for that age group. Sure, my children felt that enjoyed the film, simply because they are wild about Lego, but when I asked them comprehension questions afterwards, they had no idea at all what the deeper storyline was or of the moral contained therein. They certainly were not able to comprehend the switch between the Lego world and Will Ferrell and his son in the basement. That may have been the stand-out theatrical switch for adults and older children viewing, but it was totally lost on my children and every other uner-8 who filled the cinema. Sure, they left saying ""Emmet was cool"" but they could not understand in a month of Sundays that Emmet and Finn were one and the same person.<br/><br/>I'm sure people will rave about this movie and it will be a huge success in spite of the fact that it is actually poorly thought out and was a real missed opportunity to create something beautiful. It seems that Lego can simply do no wrong but they should certainly stick to making blocks instead of films. However, I seem to be in a minority in thinking this film was a wasted opportunity to make something slower and more thoughtful than the hotchpotch of ideas it was. And that is what the real beauty of Lego is, not that it has infinite possibilities but that it is one of the few things that parents can still do with their children at a thoughtful and slow pace. My son has dozens of toys that are all about making noise and running about at a hundred miles an hour. When we play Lego together we sit and chat quietly and build beautiful things at a relaxed pace which enhances the quality of the time we spent together. It just seemed to me that the makers of the film have totally missed who their audience really are and also missed why parents keep turning to Lego as a great toy for their kids. It is not the action we want, it is the quality time."

","Lego should leave the filmmaking business alone. This movie was awful. Simple as that. I really wanted to like this and stayed all the way till it ended just in case, but i wanted to leave in the first 15 minutes and it only got worst<br/><br/>They tried too hard to make jokes and make it funny and it just didn't work. You don't care about the characters one bit and Batman its only funny the first time. All the good jokes were in the trailer so that doesn't help either. <br/><br/>Its just trying too hard, without much plot or character development. <br/><br/>I watched at least five people leave the theater early and my little cousin say that we should have stayed home instead. <br/><br/>It relays on other movie classic characters too much but I'm sorry, the cameo of Han Solo and C3PO is not enough. <br/><br/>My recommendation: don't be fooled by the ratings and avoid this movie. <br/><br/>Maybe Lego bought the critics as a marketing strategy. <br/><br/>So disappointing."

For the most part, until 66% or maybe even 75% of the movie, I really thought this was one of the best animated features I had ever seen. It looks great, the story is good (even if the message is a bit lame and blunt), and there are some genuinely funny moments with old characters in new situations (Lando and Batman, for example).<br/><br/>But here is where they lost me: the introduction of human, live action characters. When the already obvious message of being against conformity and growing up suddenly gets even more obvious by showing the interaction of father and son, it loses me. Why do we have to go there? And why do we have to have the Lego universe exist in a kid's imagination and not some real place?"

As a Lego fan growing up, I was eager to see it after the great reviews, and it surely didn't disappoint. All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from Batman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away the plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a message everyone can relate to.

","I've stated that this contains spoilers, but I'll do my best not to make them too spoiler-y!<br/><br/>I saw the trailer for the Lego Movie a couple of months ago and it looked like it might be pretty good - a nice blend of humour, action and nostalgia. I eventually convinced one of my kids to come and see it with me, so off we went.<br/><br/>My first impression was that they'd done what I hoped they wouldn't do: They'd burned almost all of the best lines in the trailer. I hate it when that happens. That said, there was still some nicely crafted humour in there (mostly aimed at adults), but it was all a bit manic and a little hard for me to keep up with. But it was all still reasonably enjoyable, right up until the de facto ""Hollywood Morality Syrup"" got poured all over it, at which point it went all sugary and spoiled it a bit for me. I should stress, I'm not averse to a bit of sentimentality, but this film really didn't need to be drowned in it. As a father, all it did was make me feel guilty, even though none of my kids even showed the slightest inkling to play with Lego, meaning I never needed the threat of Kragle. Or Supgle, as I suspect we'd call it here in the UK.<br/><br/>It's by no means a bad film, but having my expectations raised by the trailer left me feeling a bit let down by it."

There are a few cute scenes, but that's about it.

","Look at the risk of sounding like some type of Grinch everything is not awesome with The Lego Movie, perhaps the first ever movie to be 100 minutes of pure product placement marketing at its finest and a movie that gives all new meaning to the word ADD.<br/><br/>Visually fantastic and designed in an absolutely flawless way there is no doubting that The Lego Movie is a feast for the eyes and in many senses a throwback to the age in which I am sure we can all remember, the Lego years. Tapping into what might just dwell in all of us the movie does bring out a feeling of nostalgia when it comes to the many pieces of yellow bricks we have all spent time with and it's a credit to directing duo Miller and Lord that they worked so hard with the team at Animal Logic in Sydney Australia (yay go Australia!) to produce such a detailed and thriving world but with that you get the feeling someone forgot to make an engaging or in any forms original story.<br/><br/>Filling the film with a formidable voice cast which includes the man of the moment Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell amongst many others it's sad to say that the actual characters here are not that endearing. What makes an animated movie like Toy Story or The Lion King such a joy for ages young and old is its ability to tell a meaningful story with a bunch of characters that go beyond their existence as animated beings and The Lego Movie doesn't do this. Emmett is a lame excuse for the antihero and other characters are all cookie cutter caricatures from better movies. With the characters hard to fall in love with the story also fails at producing the goods with it way too confusing for any child under the age of 10 and with a motto that seems to be throw as many jokes at the screen in as short a time as possible the film suffers from a desire to be funny far too often.<br/><br/>No doubt appealing to many people the world over (reviews and box office clearly attest to this) and as a kid I can imagine this being a pure visual joy, The Lego Movie is also a sad reminder than it many ways the simplicity of animated tales has been hijacked in favour of a sugar riddled tale that sadly works for children of the modern age whose attention spans are shorter than a goldfish's and want everything faster and sooner than ever before. Great work by the marketing gurus at Lego and Animal Logic, they must be laughing all the way to the yellow bricked bank.<br/><br/>2 and a half bricks of Lego out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","I used to enjoy a lot of Lego time when I was a child. I used to enjoy most of what was used from pop culture and references in this movie, so this one was basically a gathering of all that was important to me growing up. <br/><br/>Pity that it was kinda generic as a movie... the plot is so convoluted it makes you scratch your head sometimes. Too much references and no time to develop them properly. It was very promising in the trailer, kinda like a mix between Toy Story and Wreck it Ralph, but... those last two, sorry WB, they said it way, way, waaaaaay better the same message you're trying to give us.<br/><br/>As a bunch of isolated references from the 80's, it kinda works in that nostalgic sort of sense, as an adult, I got entertained with all the references and I'm pretty sure that kids will have fun beyond belief, too. As a movie, it turns out to be a convoluted mess. I know that they tried to make like (SPOILERS AHEAD!) the imagination of a little kid, but back then, Andy was so much more creative and more addressing! <br/><br/>Sorry WB, good try, but you're way better with your DC Animated Universe, so stick with that. If you're trying to overcome Pixar, well... better luck next time. Bottom line, it's worth the price of admission once, but just once, like a fireworks show, one viewing it's real fun, a second viewing though, is out of question."

Maybe the theater messed it up, I don't know, but for the first two or three minutes, I didn't know if the movie had actually started.<br/><br/>Second, how can you build any suspense when there are no rules to reality? The characters apparently can't die. Whenever a character gets into a fix, they just grab some Legos and build something to get out of it. Driving down a road and meet a police roadblock? Then just morph into an airplane. Enter a room surrounded by bad guys? Just beat them all up and tear them to pieces.<br/><br/>The movie moves at such a fast pace, you don't have time to stop and catch your breath.

","For more than 60 years, Lego has entertained kids all over the world with their famous colourful interlocking plastic bricks. Now thanks to directors duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, 21 JUMP STREET), we finally get to watch the long-awaited LEGO MOVIE in the big screen for the first time ever!<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary Lego mini-figure who works at the construction site. He lives his routine life by following ""instruction manuals"", until one day he is mistakenly identified as the Special -- Master Builder, to be exact -- by a tough young woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). Soon he meets an old blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and joins a fellowship of strangers including Batman (Will Arnett), Metalbeard (Nick Offerman), Uni-Kitty (Alison Brie) and Benny the ""1980-something space guy"" (Charlie Day), on an epic journey to stop the evil tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from destroying the Lego universe on Taco Tuesday by gluing it altogether.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>For decades, Lego is widely known to kids as a toy that allows them to unleash their creativity. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller clearly understands what makes Lego such a long-lasting toy phenomenon till now, and successfully translating that very idea into a spectacular animated feature. Thanks to the effects team from Animal Logic, the seamless mix of stop-motion animation and CGI are very eye-catching. The action are imaginatively staged to maximum impact it's almost like riding a roller coaster. Lord and Miller also have fun times parodying plenty of Hollywood famous blockbusters and other creative properties including DC comic characters (e.g. Batman, Superman and Green Lantern); Gandalf from THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT trilogy; STAR WARS, NBA All-Stars (which includes Shaquille O'Neal himself) and even William Shakespeare, to hilarious result.<br/><br/>All the voice cast here delivers first-rate performances. Chris Pratt is wonderful as Emmet, while Elizabeth Banks brings superb tough-girl attitude as Wyldstyle. Then there's Will Arnett, who perfectly brings the trademark husky voice of Batman character and Morgan Freeman delivers an entertaining parody of himself as Vitruvius. As for the two particular villains, Will Ferrell is well-cast as Lord Business and the normally tense Liam Neeson lets loose as Bad Cop/Good Cop.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>The ""twist"" finale. Well, it's not something out-of-this-world kind of experience, but it is the poignant moment that gives me the true meaning of Lego existence.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>It's quite a pity that Phil Lord's and Christopher Miller's overall screenplay feels formulaic. You know, it's like when you stumble upon a plot about ""a chosen person who is destined to save the world"", they are basically more-of-the-same clichés.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>THE LEGO MOVIE is far from perfect, but with enough fun to be had here, it's a great cinematic experience for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"

","My boy loves all the Lego cartoons on TV so, obviously, I thought he'd enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the powers that be behind this, opted instead to try to blend The Matrix with Kevin Smith-esque constant nods to American pop culture to appeal to ""fanboys"" who played with the little bricks and yellow people as kids, pumping it all up with a (disjointed) plot to fully expose the brand's toy range and maximise the action (chaos) on screen, regardless of how pointless it was. The result - with incredibly fast action sequences even I had trouble keeping up with - was something that both bored and bemused my boy... who luckily, had a big bag of sweets to keep him entertained.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the ending... which was so ""deep"", ""metaphorical"" and ""clever"" that parents all around me were consoling their children with the promise that it was almost over...<br/><br/>Ultimately, what let the film down was an unclear target audience: in an attempt to cater for parents and 20-something nerds, it left parents frustrated by the fact that their 6 year olds just didn't get what was going on for the most part and lost interest as soon as their popcorn ran out.<br/><br/>Others may complain that this film was nothing but an advertisement for Lego toys, but come on, wasn't that the whole point?"
"Robert_duder","6","6","12","19 June 2014"," Everything is not quite awesome but it was okay
","I suppose it was inevitable I would be waiting for something astronomically mind blowing in animation and fun when it came to The Lego Movie. The hype around this has been unfathomable. Full blown adults told me ""the best movie they've ever seen."" I heard nothing but how hilarious and it was and the cheeky nods to other films so I was eager to watch it. I don't think I was ""hyped"" but I certainly had expectations. Now don't get me wrong, The Lego Movie is fun and cute but I had some definitive issues with it and I am completely convinced now that this one of those movies that sort of mass-hypnotizes audiences and everyone sheep life jumps on to the bandwagon. I'm sure I've been guilty of it too but not for this one. I just didn't see the glorious animated feat that everyone else did. I honestly think the film has a distinctive dark, sarcastic undertone and I felt like they were often actually making fun of naivety and the pure quality of childhood toys. It felt a little jaded in that way and maybe that's what adults liked so much about it in some weird way? I guess I like my animation to be cuddly cute with sweet morals and this wasn't it. It has a moral but is it showing it in a sarcastic way? The humour is okay...couple of good chuckles but roll in the aisles? Far from it. I thought the script felt a little generic and nothing really fresh in the idea.<br/><br/>The cast is a whose who of Hollywood comedians led by Chris Pratt as our unexpected hero Emmett. Pratt is very good and absolutely captures the right tone for Emmett. If they did one thing right it was creating Emmett to be the focus of the story because he feels like an iconic animated hero. Will Arnett, Elizabeth Banks, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all stood out for me in their vocal performances of various sizes throughout the film. There are a host of other Hollywood stars doing voices and they all do very good. There are a ton of characters in the movie, this is both a pro and a con for the film. It often feels too packed and because there are so many characters you get flashes of real iconic characters for only a moment and they're hardly used or used poorly (Superman and Green Lantern for instance.) How many ambiguous gay jokes can you pack into a couple of short scenes. The film is a mish-mash of characters that most people absolutely love. I found it just a tad too mish mashed for my liking. Still its very well casted and clear that everyone had a good time doing it. Its also nice to see studios put aside their differences to feature characters from Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, DC Universe, Star Wars and so on.<br/><br/>Co-Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have a decent history in animation having worked on Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. You will also notice though that most of their experience is in adult features including their animation having worked on Clone High. So their style of direction would be definitely geared more towards adults. I don't mean to say The Lego Movie isn't appropriate for the young generation because it is!! Its an incredibly fast paced, visual thrill ride but without a ton of substance which is fine. The best scene in the film to me was actually when they leave the animated Lego world and turn to the real human world in order to save their people. Even though I had to see Will Ferrell's face (I'm not a fan) it was easily the best, unique and most well developed turn in the story. Kids will and do love the insanely frantic action and the nods to Lego building (which I honestly was sort of tired of early on in the film.) Its a decent story, a fun movie but I don't really feel like most do that it is some sort of amazing, best film of the year material. As much I despise the gimmick of 3D I would have liked to have seen this in 3D because visually it is a masterpiece!! Unfortunately for me the story lacked development, felt a little dark and jaded and didn't truly floor me the way I expected from others' reaction. However, all this being said I assure you that ""Everything is Awesome"" song will be rolling around in your head...for weeks. 6.5/10"

","My 5 yr old son saw the trailer and thought it looked fantastic. Loads of humour and visual jokes. When we went to cinema we were disappointed to find the trailer showed the best bits and the film was just plumped out in between. Having the different characters from different Lego sets was a good idea too as he was able to recognise them especially batman. He got restless towards the end in the basement scenes. The song was catchy and fun and the way everything was made from Lego was of course great. But the filmmakers really struggle with kids films. They either nail it like Shrek and Toy Story or fail like Gnomeo&Juliet and Brave. The Lego movie falls into the latter category. It may be OK for adults and older children that play a lot of Lego but for the younger ones I would avoid it."

","We took our 6 yr old and 12 yr old today to see this. I liked some of the writing but overall was disappointed with the movie. I am glad I used passes or I would have been harsher if I spent good money on it. Compared to Clutch Powers The Lego movie was not as polished and the heroes I wanted to see that were in the commercials were only in the feature for a few seconds. The ol' bait and switch like Wreck It Ralph pulled IMO. I also felt dizzy watching some of the action scenes and lost track of what was going on. Thanks goodness I skipped 3D or it would have been worse. I would recommend waiting to see this on video instead of at the theatre. This kids liked going out to a movie but enjoyed talked about the one we saw on Netflix more at the end of the day."

","What I found was that my mouth was dropping open fairly regularly as I marveled at the ingenuity on display here. If I were saddled with trying to use Legos to make a movie, I think I'd cry uncle in the first minute. The creators of this little exercise in excess not only met the challenge, they knocked it out of the park.<br/><br/>Still, this movie was a little too quick and frenzied for my taste. I would have wallowed in the wacky world created a little more, simplified the plot a bit, even if it meant going with a shorter run time. My first thought getting out of the theater was, I'm glad there isn't another hour of it. And that's a shame because this movie was truly inspired.<br/><br/>I particularly liked its anti-fascist politics. It was doubly enjoyable knowing some conservatives consider this film an attempt to indoctrinate their children. To me that's just icing on the cake, I couldn't agree more with its cause, but I don't really believe this movie is likely to influence many kids at all. Its position on freeing people's creativity isn't very radical, and the opposite position of making everyone follow rigid rules was not that well developed. But, then, how could it be without inducing a giant buzz kill?<br/><br/>I would not advise skipping this movie but don't expect too much and you'll be better prepared. Just about everything in it is awesome!"

Although a couple of scenes felt longer, that is simple due to how fast and funny the other scenes are.<br/><br/>The animation and voice work are both brilliant. Will Arnett is great as Batman, and Liam Neeson as BadCop/GoodCop was just epic. Also Charlie Day as Benny was brilliant and is the star of one of my favourite scenes in the movie (you'll know it when you see it). The rest of the cast are fantastic as well.<br/><br/>Lots of awesome cameos, including some unexpected (but still as awesome) ones.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but that doesn't mean the movie is any less entertaining.<br/><br/>One of my favourite movies of all time and is still enjoyable on multiple viewings."

","I don't understand the high ratings this film is getting. Sure I loved Legos as a kid but the movie was horrible. It was jumpy and erratic and didn't make any sense. Sure it had a good message; that you should always be yourself and not fit the societal mold, but besides that it was pretty much unbearable. <br/><br/>I didn't laugh not once though out the entire film and my kids didn't know any better. As if that wasn't bad enough, they had to mix the Lego block figurines with humans and Will Farrel made an appearance. I usually really enjoy the kiddie movies when I take my kids but this I must say is the worst I have experienced thus far. I gave it one star and another for the positive message."
"billygoat1071","8","6","13","11 February 2014"," Too Much Fun
","The Lego Movie sounds like a sneaky excuse for Hollywood's lack of new ideas, and so they have to pick a random popular material to adapt it on screen as an easy cash-in. I mean there is so little reason for this to exist since the product has been so popular in years, thus a full-length advertisement won't be that necessary. Fortunately, it hires the right people to bring it to life and the right choice of animation to make it look more appealing than the typical CGI animation. Overall it's all quite fun, probably too fun it sometimes forget to think through its plotting, but no one in the world will ever care about it because if a movie is having a good time, so will the audience.<br/><br/>The plot gives relevance to the toys: it's a fight between how they use them, it's either for playing to build more creativity or just displaying them as models. It's a clever way to justify the source material and it's obvious that the people behind it are really enjoying playing around. At some point the action becomes too fast and unstoppable which makes it difficult to concentrate at the exact storyline. But things get fixed when it finally introduces the central theme because right there it gives a whole lot of sense in this crazy world of blocks.<br/><br/>The animation is the landmark here. Though they're not actual toys being animated into stop-motion, but the amazing computer effects make it look like it is (a little like Flushed Away but with more life-like graphics). In spite that the action runs almost forever, they're just limitless fun. It takes you from place to place without betraying the aesthetics of the traditional stop-motion and it looks quite magnificent. The entire cast is full of delight. Chris Pratt is very likable as Emmet and that friendliness is what the character needs. Morgan Freeman brings an obvious gravity to his role. Liam Neeson and Will Ferrell are both pretty fun as the villains. And Charlie Day is just hilarious in his, although single but memorable, punchline.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie might be just a long advertisement and we know product placement at the large extent is the creepiest thing we might encounter at cinema's very existence, but the quality it provides is a huge pardon from that fact, because it brings a genuine heart and sincere affections to the source material which keeps it from being nothing more than a cynical cash-in blockbuster. It sometimes needs to calm down a bit, but again, no one would even bother. The Lego Movie is just filled with excitement, nostalgia, and wonderful animation that is impossible for one to dislike."

","Well, first of all, when you hear about a Lego Movie you think to yourself ""this will be fun""! In the end, it was not. Nicely done for small children I guess, although sometimes the humor was more ""adult"". <br/><br/>I enjoyed only a handful of scenes that were nicely done but nothing more than that. The script was nice but needless to say that I just watched one hour and then switched the TV off. Nice messages and approach for the society we live in, but in some way it just was not good enough. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time on it. I am really baffled by the really high score of the movie.

She is a master builder and it is she that repeatedly saves the day and pulls the hapless hero through the story. This character is sadly drawn. She has identity issues, picks her men unwisely and is disappointed in not being the chosen one.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, when all else is reconciled, her agency is removed as she becomes 'the girlfriend.' That agency is insultingly replaced by the boy's little sister. I think we need to see her again, and see her master her situation."

","I heard good things about this movie and saw the ratings so I decided to see it. It was like a child's LSD trip. Old cartoons used to master the art of double meanings; an adult could find humor in old Pink Panther cartoons that children would not see for example while the kid laughed too at the animations. I did not really see that accomplished in the Leggo movie although I could tell it tried. Suffice to say there was not one scene in this movie that amounted to more laughing that you could get from typical newspaper funny pages. And the cheesy adventure story line of the movie would appeal mostly to people with short term memory disorder as attempting to tie the individual ""subplots"" and scenes together might give one a headache.

","""The Lego Movie"" carries with its name an association to instant likability. In fact, I have never played with the toys myself, but they look like fun, and I can't imagine a kid not falling in love with the possibility of building whatever they wish. The film, unfortunately, falls short because once again it does what Hollywood does best, lots of flash, with very little essence, soul or heart, though it wasn't for lack of trying.<br/><br/>Here is an everyman put in the position of saving the Lego universe from the Mr. Business, I guess we're playing with extended metaphors and sarcasm here. I have seen situations and plot devices like these before, but the magic falls short here, quite quickly, after the introduction of the main characters. There is very little to captivate the audience with the very simple facial expressions of the characters. There is some magic in the shots that involve streets, freeways, and distant perspectives, but it is hard to engage our interest when we have close ups.<br/><br/>So, after the first 15 minutes or so, you can start feeling how simple the whole enterprise appears, and it an almost palpable feelings how the different members in the audience are trying very hard to like the film. The little tykes are probably more interested in looking at the possibilities of what they can put together at home with the pieces they see in the screen. From this perspective, the movie is no more than a very long advertisement. The adults are glad the kids are quiet, but one can only laugh so much at the ""funny"" lines.<br/><br/>I was mostly impressed by the interesting conclusion, which could have easily turned off everyone in the audience, but it is a reflection of some of the most magical and/or sweetest moments in TV and cinema, the revelation that it's all a dream, but that it doesn't really matter. Things are pretty clever at that moment, and Will Ferrell, an actor that I find wooden and tiresome, doesn't do a bad job here. Maybe he is more effective when he is restrained.<br/><br/>There are some creative moments, from the voice casting, to the catchy tune that is bound to sell a zillion copies to the unsuspecting audiences, and most incredibly, the cliffhanger for the unstoppable sequel. It was actually kind of cute. Hope the people behind this production do a better job giving us a warmer, better film. After all the eyes in CGI have come a long way from the dazed looks of ""The Polar Express"", and they can do wonders with stop motion. Just look at the amazing work of Tim Burton and his films. There's hope after all."
"Gresh854","7","4","8","18 June 2014"," The Greatest Animated Movie in Over a Decade
","How to start of this review? Hmmmmmm. How about ""Everything Was Awesome!"" I know, pretty overused at this point. But the LEGO Movie is awesome and I'm not just saying that, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Plot - The Story is about a ordinary guy named Emmet who is said to be the special. He eventually goes on this Journey with some Master Builders from stopping Lord Business from doing the evil stuff that he is supposed to do. Surprisingly the plot is really smooth. It takes a while to get adjusted during the beginning but towards the middle, you are totally adjusted to the plot. And the plot seems to work out just perfect not too much not too little.<br/><br/>Characters - The cast of this movie is like, to be honest, one of the best casts in an animated film ever put to film. We've got Christ Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnet, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, even Morgan Freeman put in the films main roles. Each actor portrays the emotions of the character so well. The voices just work with each individual figure. So the characters are portrayed very carefully and well during the film each one at the right time.<br/><br/>Animation - The Animation in this movie is so good. You literally feel like you are inside a LEGO world. The animation looks like Stop-Motion, but it's actually computer animated which actually makes everything look a it better. You literally could imagine this happening on your kids or your LEGO's. It's like you are watching little tiny Minifigures going on an adventure. Also when things are blown up or smoke is coming out of vehicles, it's all LEGO bricks manipulating everywhere. It is genius animation, just it just fits with the LEGO movie.<br/><br/>What to Except - Pure satisfaction and maybe even more. This is one of those kids films were parents enjoy it just as much as their kids EQUALLY. There is a ton of Pop culture references in the film that everybody today can relate to so much. There is literally non-stop funny humor throughout the film. And a some of it is adult humor to keep the adults very entertained and into the film. What mainly to expect is ""Getting Super Surprised"" When you here about a movie about LEGOs, your just thinking ""it's going to be a huge advertisement for sure."" But it felt like it wasn't advertising anything at all. There were so many life lessons in the movie that are not hard to catch especially to the parents. Family lessons that aren't just any silly all life lesson, but something deeper and more. All these lessons and heart-warming moments are fit into one whole 100 minute movie very smoothly surprisingly. In the end is what will really get you but I can't spoil it because that would ruin the whole movie. So parents, children prepare for a surprising film, trust me.<br/><br/>Overall - Overall the LEGO movie is a enjoyment for the whole movie but not just like any old good animated movie. This is something more. Something more, something movies these days should have. It's been more than a decade until we've had amazing movies like this. Disney still has there A-Game on, but I think Warner Bros. Is starting to step up their game. So should you buy it on. Blu-Ray or Watch it? Both. You can watch this so many times and always keep on being entertained. The LEGO movie is one of the, or just maybe, the greatest animated film ever played on the big screen. (A+)"
"lf-nyc","7","4","8","10 March 2014"," It was good
","Wish it could have had more substance, but from the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles, and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen must be possible to construct in the real world. It's a good mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great foundation to build on."

","Legos is one great international company that has redefined itself so successfully in the American marketplace. I guess I can't join what looks to be the large majority of IMDb members in saluting their venture into the movie industry. Sorry, I just didn't get this one. We have this sort of ordinary fungible dweeb in corporate world who becomes the chosen one to save all the fungible dweebs in corporate world from the evil corporate overlord who has his own bizarre plot to freeze all the dweebs for unclear reasons. Along the way we see familiar characters from other fantasy movies, in their own Lego fashion, along with some unique to this movie. The world they present is hardly new (see Cloudy II) and really very unpleasant for kids and dads alike. There are moments of sort of odd and goofy humor and the twist towards the end is sort of interesting but again it doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. I'm glad for all of the people who enjoyed this, but me and my 8 year old don't share their opinion."
"dwpollar","3","6","14","24 March 2014"," Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie...
","1st watched 3/22/2014 --- 3 out of 10(Dir-Phil Lord & Christopher Miller): Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie based on a created Lego world with interesting animation trying to simulate what it would be like if Lego creations were alive. The story is about a normal guy being given the title of savior of a soon to be destroyed world(which is a much used theme). This Lego person named Emmett is a construction worker in a very formalized society who basically has to now think for himself as the savior and new master builder. This is not an easy transition for him and the movie uses this for comedic effect. Will Ferrell provides a voice over of the evil character in the story who wants things to stay the way that they are. Ferrell also has a brief real-life cameo and provides the best thing, in my opinion, in the movie â€“ a song that rolls during the credits about darkness that he ad-libs as he goes. When a credits song is the best thing in the movie than you know it has problems, and this basically is my resolve(it is one big problem). An idea for a movie, complicated and without humor then becomes an overly expensive mess. My question is why was this movie even made ?? I really don't even think kids will get thru the movie without becoming bored. The animation may hold them for a little while but the complications in the plot will drop them from caring very quickly. Avoid this one."
"byson5186","4","5","11","27 January 2015"," Some Movies You Don't Like Are Very Popular
","I've seen this movie twice, one time I rented it from Redox and another time I watched it with my parents at home. I have to say, my nephews love this movie it is like their favorite movie. That's good for them that they liked it, but this movie didn't entertain me too much. I mean it had a good moral to the story, it had nice special effects but there were some things wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>First off, I played with Lego's as a kid. I used to play Lego's with a couple of friends when I was a kid. I played with Legos up until I was like in 8th Grade. Rather then do the building I mostly just came up with my own stories with a friend and we would play with the Lego's with our own stories, having our own fictional worlds from our imaginations. Yeah, this is what the movie mostly looked like. It looked like an imaginative kids story. I mean there didn't seem to be much of a plot to it, I mean there is a plot but it does not seem like a memorable or good plot. The movie seems more about the special effects and Lego universe. Legos have been a popular kids toy for a very long time. They finally made a movie out of it. The movie also left us with a great message which might seem like a typical movie message for kids films, but still a great message. The characters in this movie seemed one dimensional. Now, that they finally came up with a Lego movie, it reminds me of a Lego game I played as a kid a couple of times called Lego Island. I didn't play that game that often, but it seemed to have more of a plot, and relatable world than this movie.<br/><br/>So, I'll say that there are a couple of movies that you like, or people with your taste will like them, but they aren't very popular. An example of that, is like my favorite movie is Earth To Echo which I also left a review on, and about half the reviews for that movie are positive. Luckily, that movie didn't flop as it had a low budget but it didn't make a lot of money and I feel like it's way underrated. There are also movies you don't like that are very popular an example of that is a movie that was pretty popular especially 10 years ago with all this franchise and people quoting the movie, Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't seen that movie in a long time, and don't really care for it, or find it entertaining. But, so many other people thought of that slow pace movie as entertaining. Now, to share an example of a TV show, There was one TV show I loved which aired in 2009 called The Othersiders on Cartoon Network CN Real, but that show got cancelled after four months because of the low ratings, and you can find very little information about that show.<br/><br/>I'm not here to talk about other movies or TV shows. But, to me The Lego Movie seems like too kiddish of a movie for me, like a film more so for the younger audience and not as much for the older audience because of the lack of plot and being a little cheesy making the Lego characters not seem realistic, but fictional and one dimensional. I'll give this movie a 4/10 because it was clever, it did have good effects and a message. It's incredible to think adults could imagine this, I mean my Dad thought it was incredible to think of people imagining this. But, if you have my taste then you're much better off watching a film like Earth To Echo. I wouldn't recommend this film, but I'd strongly recommend that film. I also will say that this movie would probably entertain most kids under 12."
"jadepietro","4","5","11","21 November 2014"," Blockheads
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>Loud, hyperactive, and occasionally amusing, The LEGO Movie was surprisingly highly lauded by many critics and became a huge hit. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film tackles grandiose ideas of fascism, conformity, and corporate greed for the pre-school set, but the humor is mainly aimed for their parents with so many pop references and nostalgic touches. <br/><br/>With nice voice-over work by Chris Pratt, Will Farrell, and especially Will Arnett as the gravel- voiced Batman, The LEGO Movie has some satirical things to say, that is, whenever it calms down to say them. There is so many frenzied chase scenes and shoot-um-up sequences that they overpower the slim story. <br/><br/>We are dropped into Lego World where our hero, Emmet, a dim-witted but contented construction worker type runs into an evil dictator named President Business who wants to control this world. He unites the other Lego figures to fight with him against this tyrant.<br/><br/>The crude animation is a disappointment. One sees far more clever results on cable television's Cartoon Network or Matt Groeing's far superior Futurama or The Simpsons programs. While the computer generated / live action film stays within the confines of the Lego block design, this option also limits the creative spark. Movement is clunky and awkward like the short, stocky, and generally unappealing Lego figures themselves. The film seems rather schizophrenic, like one of its characters, a two faced Good Cop / Bad Cop figure. It wants to condemn big business and consumerism while willfully selling its product to anyone in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>The film resembles the noisy Transformers franchise, both in its overall look, sound design, and hectic movements, with its main goal being its tie-ins and product endorsements. In fact, The LEGO Movie appears to be one long commercial of Legos, by Legos, and for Legos, with a new shipment of characters arriving at the nearest toy store and a new sequel already in progress.

Instead, ""The Lego Movie"" manages to be a smartly subversive satire about the drawbacks of conformity and following the rules while celebrating the power of imagination and individuality. It still might be a 100-minute commercial, but at least it's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one with in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed.<br/><br/>I had no interest in seeing this film; however, all my friends that saw it said it was a great movie, and I decided to give it a watch. This is the best film of the year and, as far as I'm concerned, the best film I've seen if a couple of years. It is also the most subversive, pro-liberty film since (I kid you not) ""V for Vendetta"" with smart, well-deserved swipes at the head of the government. Bring your adult friends if you don't have children of your own.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful movie, I had the same reaction to it as I had seeing ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story 3"". If you do not have your own child, now is the time to offer to babysit a niece or nephew. It's nice to see that imagination can still show up and surprise you in the best way possible.

But one Sunday after lunch I catched it on TV and man I was amazed! I really loved it from beginning to end and I also appreciated the style of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Emmett, a Lego construction worker (voiced by Chris Pratt) that has an ordinary life in the Lego universe. He is soon approached by Lucy and Vitruvius the prophet and they pester Emmett saying that he is the chosen one of the Lego people and the only one that could save them. In fact, there is danger in the air: President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) wants to create the most powerful glue ever made because he wants to glue the entire Lego universe making it static. So it's up to Emmett, Lucy, Vitruvius and many other characters made in Legos (including Batman, C-3PO, Green Lantern, Han Solo and Superman just for naming a few) to stop President Business' evil plan.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie was its sense of style and CGI animation, with colors so vivid and fresh, like a Lego construction coming to life. All the actors do their best, and let me say it: with a voice cast that includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, Channing Tatum, Shaquille O'Neal as himself and even Liam Neeson, how can you go wrong? It was also a surprise the part where we see in the attic Ferrell and his son moving the Legos and changing the story just how they wanted to change it. And the songs are very cute.<br/><br/>If you never saw this movie before and you happen to catch it on TV, watch it! It's one of those rare family movies of these days that manages to delight and entertain properly both children and adults."

","""The LEGO Movie"" is a children's film in the category of toys that come to life, and may interact with their owners. Such films include the H. C. Andersen ""Brave Tin Soldier"" segment from Fantasia 2000, accompanied by Shostakhovich's 2nd piano concerto, or Pixar's classic ""Toy Story."" How does ""LEGO"" stack up (pun intended) against ""Toy Story""? I gave the latter an 8/10, and I would say ""The LEGO Movie"" is at least 2 notches down. 6/10.<br/><br/>Of course the best part is the LEGO landscapes. The director intermingles plenty of product lines, from Star Wars to Pirates to Duplo to Cityscape. It all would have been really impressive if it had been done with real blocks by stopped motion animation, like some of the fan shorts. Alas, it's just CGI, but at least they stuck to LEGO brick rules all the way through, as far as I could tell.<br/><br/>The story is humdrum: an evil and not-so-special LEGO figure wants to glue everything together with superglue. In the real world, dad wants to do the same with his big basement LEGO project, so his son can't mess it up. To the rescue comes an ordinary LEGO worker figure who shows that anyone can be ""special,"" and convinces the evil mastermind to stand down. A bit of pop culture reference is thrown in here or there, a bit of satire now and then, but none of it rises above the level of a 14 year-old bionicle user who may be watching, never mind a grizzled old moviegoer who wants to see something new.<br/><br/>So the movie is what it is: harmless, fluffy kid's fare, lacking the charm of stop-motion animation LEGO shorts, with a ""theme song"" that runs out of melody and lyrics in about 10 seconds. It's sure to spawn sequels to please the 6-10 year old crowd. And it should, they could be watching worse.<br/><br/>The biggest irony: the only novel idea in the film was the double-decker couch!"

But, and here comes the big BUT: it's not ideal for a small child (which of course would be the ideal audience for LEGO).<br/><br/>The movie has SO MUCH going on, it's - as a reviewer mentioned before - overwhelming. They've put so much stuff (besides love for detail) in this movie, it's just packed with stuff. And this is the sad thing, apart from the very high speed with which all is going down. Every joke is living for just about 1 or 2 seconds max. Way too much to process for a child - and even I as an adult and movie buff had difficulties taking it all in.<br/><br/>Of course, not alle references and jokes are intendend for the children but their parents, but it's just all too much. Maybe they thought that they only will get this one chance for a movie and HAD to squeeze it all in... But they should have stretched it to two movies and toned the speed way more down. It would have meant more fun and especially more time to take the lovingly made details all in.<br/><br/>And they are plentiful. Let alone the LEGO-made water in the sea, it's so well made and hilarious to look at. And nearly everything else is just plain awesomeness. It looks, as mentioned by another reviewer, like a brickfilm on a big budget - they made it look absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>So sad that children below, let's say, 8 or 10 will have a hard time watching it.
Otherwise: hat tip to the makers, it's very nice.<br/><br/>Of course, Will Ferrell is a big bonus :-)"

It's not only what I think to be Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second best film (second to Spider-Verse) but there's just something about it that is so sweetly and charmingly nostalgic about it to me, not just the fact that it's Lego (although that is a main reason why this film resonates with me and many others). Maybe it's the outstanding animation, the self-aware and clever humour, or the messages about Lego and different builders being unique, or maybe just all of them together. But most of all, this film just makes me happy. There is never a dull moment in this film and it definitely deserves every single bit of praise it has gotten over the years."
"jackfull","10","1","1","1 October 2018"," The Lego film that needed to happen
","Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long."
"saphira-28454","9","1","1","16 June 2018"," Great for all ages

It has a vision about being special that I don't often see and not only about that. I loved the villain's weapon and the McGuffin, I loved and understood all the characters (especially Unikitty), I loved the jokes. Half of the twists are unexpected while having a story easy to follow.
I can't give it a 10 though because it has a boring scene towards the end. It's not long, but it can make the perspective about the entire film confusing. Also the movie didn't took great risks, it's a pretty standard story, even with the twists and parts of originality.

","""The Lego Movie"" plays like a loud Sunday morning cartoon, but which just so happens to have the odd reference to an old movie or life situation an adult might be able to cotton on to thrown in for good measure. It is, like so many of those cartoons, an exhausting assault of colour; noise; movement and energy - experiencing it is, indeed, very much like sitting and watching two (or more) frenetic kids playing with a vast array of Lego paraphernalia - something which, it turns out, isn't too far away from what is actually happening anyway... <br/><br/>Despite this, there is buried within ""The Lego Movie"" somewhere the message that there is no substitute for creativity and imagination, which is admirable enough, yet rather ironically the film needed to be reigned in much more for it all to work. The story is also incredibly conventional, in its depiction of heroes; villains; mentors and love interests battling away in a place where a plot to end the world has been hatched. <br/><br/>This wasn't something you could say about something like ""Toy Story"", which decided to eschew some of these tropes; brought to life an alternate universe within our own and also depicted an impressive two-fold character study. Meanwhile, a better example of an animated post-modernist explosion which combined rapid pacing and cultural gentrification might be 2012's ""Wreck it Ralph"". <br/><br/>American actor Chris Pratt voices Emmett, a lowly construction worker living in a city made entirely out of Lego that is run by President Business (Will Ferrell). Business is a crypto-fascist who controls the population with cheesy pop songs and awful television shows. It is, as Neil Postman once wrote, ""...in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate."" So slavish to this situation are the inhabitants of Emmett's world that everybody 'greets' the world each morning as one. <br/><br/>Emmett is ripped out of his world of subconscious conformity when, one day after work, he spots an intruder on the construction site and, upon confronting them, accidentally winds up deep underground prior to experiencing an out-of-body experience which renders him unconscious. Before he knows anything, he is eye-deep in a plot to do with Business' private Gestapo and the foiling of a prophecy once made by Business' sworn enemy Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to do with how, one day, a hero will lead the people to victory over the world of orthodoxy and order. <br/><br/>Narrative is perfunctory for most of the film; that is until, perhaps cleverly, it wraps its story into what is REALLY happening beyond the confines of the film's universe. ""The Lego Movie"", for the most part, is too preoccupied with dragging you head first through a bush - then through another bush into the Wild West; then through another into a realm of knights and dragons before settling on something else entirely, but not before it has taken you to Cloud Cuckoo Land (don't ask) as Emmett and a collection of allies strive to defeat the bad guy. <br/><br/>How one reacts to any of this will be dependent on one's tolerance threshold for sheer nonsense, but nonsense that is harmless fun and which does possess half a dozen genuine laughs (Vitruvius' secret knock, anyone?), while being helped along by the fact everything is made of Lego. Had it been something else other than Lego, such as 'regular' characters going about a 'regular' adventure, would anyone have really provided the film with much more than a passing grade? <br/><br/>The makers of the film, Christopher Miller & Phil Lord, cover so much ground and flit from one to so many other places that they allow themselves licence to do anything and reference anything from any walk of life or genre. It isn't often you get Shaquille O'Neal joking about how the enemy were ""...ready for that(!)"" within minutes of Professor Dumbledore arguing with someone over the pronunciation of his name. This is actually fairly lazy, and is best epitomised when they take their characters to the aforementioned Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is, put literally, merely a locale of complete gibberish wherein anything goes. <br/><br/>Rooted at the epicentre of the piece is a stiff, egalitarian message to do with how individualism and diversity must triumph over conformity and a refusal to accept amalgamation and hybridity, which is here depicted as pure evil. Again, how one reacts to the film will depend on your own outlooks in life - are pirates and soldiers best suited to battling one another on desert islands and across vast oceans? Or do they all need to come together with the astronauts; cowboys; spaceships; half the cast of ""Harry Potter"" and Robin Hood to have one giant adventure for any of it to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Despite this, the film occasionally branches off for more admirable messages to do with self-confidence and thinking for oneself - using your imagination and being creative, best demonstrated in Vitruvius' line to Emmett that he must ""embrace what is special about you."" But more tantalising is the fact there are so many objects from OUR world in the villain's possession. And why do we hear a human boy remark ""it's your turn to be the hero..."" as Emmett has his early out-of-body experience?<br/><br/>By the time the film had ended the first time I saw it (I watched it twice), I had a headache. I was able to appreciate it a little more after the second viewing because I had a better idea of where the chaos was heading, but remain relatively dumb-founded as to why so much praise had been previously heaped on it. Many-a nice thing has been written and said about ""The Lego Movie"", but it struck me as generally a bit of a mess."
"Samiam3","5","1","1","6 June 2017"," Well conceived, poorly assembled plaything
","The story involves the search for an object that can stop the 'Kragle'; a dangerous weapon threatening all of lego-mankind.<br/><br/>With its mechanical meta awareness, franchise jokes, and a daring third act that shatters (not just breaks) the fourth wall, there is no question that the Lego Movie is clever. The problem is that the self mockery is too heavy. That and a jumbled story line, visually incoherent action scenes, and shallow emotional content make for a mediocre movie.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is a modern version of the construction worker character from Lego's first packages. He is as amusingly mundane as the movie tells us he is, but remains mundane in those few moments when he is supposed to amount to something more. He goes from being a spoof on the hapless hero to being just another version of one.<br/><br/>The most memorable piece of the movie is the ear worm song 'Everything is Awesome' which is as cheesy as it is addicting. Other highlights are Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop, and a happy go lucky unicorn with a demonic alter ego lurking just under the happy face. Lego Batman has enough moments to have made him easily worthy of his own movie (which he now has). We also have all the other DC and Marvel heroes who are there just so the makers can check their names off the list.<br/><br/>The ending takes us out of Legoland and into the three dimensional world. Here we get the punchline, the revelation of what exactly the 'Kragle' is. They has a cute idea, but it comes with notes of forced sentiment that fall rather flat.<br/><br/>By focusing to much on mocking the gimmick of the toy, as well all the franchise characters, the movie itself ends up feeling like a gimmick. There is no heart, soul or narrative shape, and the scattered laughs don't make it worth the time."

Those who are still child in curiosity will in some way or the other end up watching this movie. From the makers of The Lego, the classic plastic toy known for it's brick type models for children fun fair, the story is a mere fairy tale. The movie starts with a bossy, arrogant politician President Business who snatches away the Kragle from Vitrivius, the foreseer. Kragle, the most powerful device capable of destroying the entire universe is taken away. Vitrivius says a prophet and falls down from a cliff that a simple man will come and take the Power of Resistance from underground and protect all evil. Later after 8 and 1/2 years Emmet, a simple constructer worker who turns out to be a super hero is all about the movie. He is portrayed in the form a normal man who is not envied or amused by his colleagues or neighbours, living in loneliness. He ends up capturing the Power of Resistance from underground earth accidentally onto his back as he tumbles at his work place. He is adored by Girl friend of Batman but she ends in dismay about the lack of spirit in Emmet. All but the following events of ridicule and exaggeration of people and super stars like, Batman, He Man, Super Man, Ninja, Power Rangers, Transformers and many more, who are keen about saving the universe are devastated with Emmet to be believed as a saviour. In the ending Emmet's life takes a major turn as he saves the entire universe from destruction by sacrificing his own life by disconnecting a detonator primed on the Power of Resistance which is stuck on his body, by jumping down through a time warp. The movie gradually jumps to a wake up scene of Emmet who sees real life humans in the surroundings. He sees a table on which the entire set up of his world is there made purely out of Lego Toys and that he is also a toy. The toy role of Emmet is an imaginary character played by a boy who is 10 year old probably and is using the business place of his dad, who seems to be working as a construction business man or something. The dad asks his son to stop playing everything right away and picks Emmet from the home table and puts him on another table thereby making him unable to save his friends at misery with President Business who is freezing all the world with the help of bad police as his force of destruction. The movie is shown on a perspective of the boy who explains dad that he must not destroy what he made. His dad talks to his son. In the movie this dialogue is between President and Emmet. Now that President is Dad and Emmet is the boy. With a very pleasing end, the movie comes to a nice closing of how much humans sabotage for mere greed. <br/><br/>The movie is definitely worth watch. For it is not for kids fun alone, but carries a rich message for grown ups and society.<br/><br/>The connection between the imagination of the boy playing Lego and the Lego world in which we travel is really well knit.<br/><br/>With a little bit of boring sensations in the middle, the movie is far amazing to watch till climax. It is overall a treat for fun and entertainment. Go Lego! I give you a 8.5 out of 10. Amazing!! <br/><br/>Love and Care,<br/><br/>Naren Pillai,<br/><br/>15/03/2014."

","There was the initial worry to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, as results have been mixed on that front, but the trailer did look amusing and the reviews and ratings were great and I as a huge animation fan saw it anyway. The good news is that it does work, yes it is a little rushed at times, especially towards the end, and the last half hour got a touch complicated (if the pacing had slowed down then it would have helped). But what was so brilliant about The Lego Movie was how it took this merchandise and managed to make such a colourful, clever, imaginative and enormously entertaining film out of it when it could have easily been the opposite. The animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, wasn't that ""Awesome"" song catchy or what? The Lego Movie's chief selling point is that it is an outstandingly well-written film with snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark, by far the funniest film I've seen in a while. The action is also block-busting in the very best of ways. It's not all hilarious though, because there is a lot of heart in The Lego Movie and the message will be an inspiration to anybody. The characters have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well, the most colourful being the villain President Business. And what a fine voice cast too, with Will Ferrell stealing the show, he is a hoot, but Morgan Freeman's dignified blind seer and Will Arnett's splendidly dour Batman are worthy of note too. Chris Pratt is a likable, chirpy protagonist but not quite as memorable as the supporting roles. To conclude, a brilliant and near-perfect film, animated or otherwise, that people of all ages and the whole family can enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Yes, this flick was designed for the child equipped with a bottomless pit of energy and in dire need of a nap. Hi energy scene after hi energy scene left me exhausted and physically drained. Talk about zapping the energy out you. At the end of this carnival of spasmodic plastic rattling and the ceaseless repetition of, 'Everything is Awesome', I thought my soul had been sucked out of my eyeballs and felt bodily fluids oozing from my ears. Granted, the theme is a common premise, but it is easy to overlook. What theme you ask? Crying out loud - it's echoed throughout most 'blockbusters' recently produced. You do know the theme, right? Here it is as a reminder, ""Big Brother is pushy and overbearing, and brainwashing the masses. The only way to overcome the 'The Collective's Control' is through the brave, selfless act of an individual. (kind of cuts against the grain of Hollywood – I like that)."" The cool thing about this movie is that good beats evil using happy-happy-joy-joy methods (and LEGO Batman – of course) and not arrows shot from burning girls or some powerful, magical female divergent idol. One sad note though. Even though I did see the movie I forgot what it was all about. Now remember I do know the movie was a lot of fun, the story left very little impression. Let me see, how would I put this movie in a nutshell? Let's say you had to save the entire world.

So I was a bit stressed when I sat down. The fact that the opening of the movie was very fast paced and there were so much happening at once did not help my mood. However, the humour kicked in quickly and each one made me at least chuckle. The story eventually slowed down (a little) and I was finally able to fully enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>It's indeed worthy of its praise: the pop-culture references are of good taste, the humour is excellent, the visuals (though hard to keep track of) are amazing. Even if the movie is fast paced, this is LEGO after all. Having the characters build something slowly than what you see in the commercials would not be LEGO.

I think of the animation the jokes then the little subtle jokes that younger kids wouldn't get and then the beautiful animation and the voice work by Chris Pratt and others i cannot find a single fault with this film i don't have one maybe the song was annoying but i ended up buying the album off iTunes (Everything is awesome) i hated it at first and i now love it i cannot think of a fault with this movie. Its kinda like a social commentary with following instructions and all that and president business voiced brilliantly by Will Ferrell. I found that kids might not respect this movie as much as adults cause there are jokes they will not get I'm honest i heard more GROWN MEN laugh than some of the children. OK the voice acting is outstanding all round my personal favourite is Bad cop voiced by Liam Neeson the voices are great all round. The last 15 minutes are really heart felt and i couldn't believe that they did that. I will be honest some of the jokes did fall flat and where funny but just didn't lift off like some the others did but thats minor compared to the other jokes and this is a laugh out loud movie and i love this film to death i will go far as to say i enjoyed this a little more than Monsters inc (my favourite animated film in my top 20 at 19) and i would say this has just taken my number 18 spot i love this film i recommend it for all ages and family's."

","When I was a kid I used to love building with legos. I suppose back then I might have liked this movie a bit better, but today I really think it's lousy. A movie about legos is a great idea, but much of the film is rather awkward and confusing. It's hard to keep track of what's what. For a little while I was actually having a hard time staying awake. What makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts transitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world. I can see why some people may like this, but I find it to be basically just a weird interruption. If the movie had started out in the real world before going into the main story, it would've made a little more sense."
"ponystationnerd","4","3","6","19 January 2015"," Far from being a perfect movie. Far from it
","I'll admit that The Lego Movie has been a wonderful movie for the many of the people (assuming they've been on a massive sugar rush, of course) like Frozen. But the movie shows no appeal to me whatsoever. And no, its not that I've never played with Lego toys before; it has no interest in me, as I've played action figures, toy cars, even video games. Even if I did played with Lego toys before, I'd get pretty bored quickly and move to elsewhere.<br/><br/>To put it simply, while The Lego Movie is indeed an excellent movie, its far from being perfect. And seeing it gain 96% on Rotten Tomatoes proves that its not only baffling, but also shows that the people has had one sugar-induced candy treats too many and their extreme levels of hyperactivity are showing. Its just too fast-paced and predictable, and the characters are... well, questionable in terms of humor (not explicit ones, bear this in mind). I only saw the trailer, but had no intention of watching it at all, and the same goes for the sequel.<br/><br/>So again, while the movie is great, its far from perfection and its far too predictable. Go ahead and say that I have no imagination, but sadly, that's just me who's more interested in other things than simply stacking up toys and just play around for 1-3 minutes before being bored and move on to other things. As for the sequel? I'm sure people will just become over-reactive as always, but me? Pass. I'll just wait for better movies that can rival this one and the upcoming sequel that doesn't include extreme cases of sugar-induced hyper-activeness."
"VHSdynamite","6","3","6","15 April 2014"," Actually not that good. Toy Story is still king.
","I can see why people like this. It's loaded with references to popular movies as Batman, Superman, Star Wars etc. And LEGO. But behind all that it's got a weak structure. It had some good social satire going for it in the beginning (Octan making voting machines and all that), but that just disappeared when Guy meets Girl.<br/><br/>The film rely too heavily on bad gags, like the 1980-something space guy yelling ""Spaceship!"" frequently. I had high expectations for the 1980-something space guy, but they weren't met. He would have been a better character if he weren't voiced.<br/><br/>Speaking of bad voicing: Will Arnett as Batman? Meh. He tries to be funny, but actually he isn't that good. I knew they needed an antihero to match the Good Guy, but ... Will Arnett ruins it by doing his thing. Chris Pratt is king, though.<br/><br/>The animation, however, was stunning. The bricks' wear, the LEGO water ... I loved it. But towards the middle, I grew tired of it all. Too much action all the time.<br/><br/>The ending surprised me though! It really got me think about my own view on toys. But they stretched it too long and it became kind of corny and preachy.<br/><br/>Nah, Toy Story is still my favorite toy-comes-to-life kind of film. It too had pop cultural references, but they did it subtle, not in-your-face like the LEGO movie."
"TyTanner","6","3","6","9 April 2014"," A Heavily Involved Film - Both Good and Bad
","The 1949 popular line of construction toys – Lego – has made it on to the big screen. It only took 65 years. Actually, that's not true: Lego-based series such as Bionicle, Hero Factory, Lego Star Wars, the short animation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego, and the film Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite, have all preceded The Lego Movie, so the concept is not exactly fresh. It is however, the first big Hollywood blockbuster – only a matter of time – and it won't be the last (The Lego Movie 2 has been approved for release in 2017).<br/><br/>There are few iconic films these days born from original ideas – most are recycled ideas given new angles. So because the recycled style of film is what audiences have come to expect, we are instinctively impressed when an idea has been effectively reconditioned. The Lego Movie falls in to that 'automatically stimulated' category for many viewers, because yes, it's directed, produced and written well, but it's not new. Here's why it warrants three stars out of five (or 6/10 for IMDb).<br/><br/>No animated film is without a villain, conflict, and some degree of fighting, but The Lego Movie's violence stood out – most noticeably the scene where Vitruvius is decapitated, along with the arrest of several civilians who are electrocuted, shouting in pain, not to mention the whole 'destruction of the city' theme, and the plan to destroy everyone with permanent glue.<br/><br/>While all violence is 'Lego violence' intended to be taken ever so lightly, and is predictably, the imagination of Finn - a real person (Jadon Sand) - it's the fact it is the imagination of a child which is of concern. Will Ferrell's eight-year-old kid, crafts the whole 'President Business is destroying the world' premise based on his father's (President Business's) actions. Ferrell is stifling his kid's (the Lego people's) imagination, and is adamant to maintain control over his world. This is unnerving on a couple of levels – the fact a father is so steadfast in not allowing his son to play with toys designed for children (and adults), and also that Finn concocts such a vehement storyline as a result of this.<br/><br/>So was the transition to the live action scenes necessary?<br/><br/>For younger viewers, the parallel of the two story-lines is something they wouldn't understand to great effect. But for young adults and anyone older, a message about the degree of which adulthood imposes itself over childhood – initially as a discouragingly and damagingly force – is an issue which gives us something to contemplate.<br/><br/>Emmet, the film's protagonist, journeys from an ordinary character to a 'special' individual - much like a child with a clear mind which becomes filled with the experiences of a maturing adult. And Lego itself does possess that unique quality of breaking the confines of age.<br/><br/>But the overpowering idea of the majority of the film about the negative imposition of parents over their children (a.k.a. the Big Brother supremacy over its people) is certainly noteworthy, maybe even alarming. And although we have our mainstream and compulsory happy conclusion, emphasising individual thought and family values above all, almost the entire movie gives us a somewhat disconcerting view of the adult values in a child's upbringing – but maybe this is a good issue to bring to the forefront?<br/><br/>That being said, the foreseeable switch to the live action was a let down, anyway. Maybe this part was too involved for its own good.<br/><br/>The film does do a good job however, of giving rise to other involved ideas. Lord Business is the epitome of current day capitalism and commercialism, and at the same time the entire concept places firm roots in George Orwell's classic 1984 novel – a dystopian world of enduring war; pervasive government surveillance; and public manipulation; controlled by an elite political group which oppresses independent thinking.<br/><br/>Looking at distinctive scenes in the film, such as punishment for not following instructions, and cutting ties between parent and child (when Bad Cop freezes his folks), there are many more specific parallels to be drawn between this movie and 1984. So here, the film does exceptionally well in recapturing Orwell's timeless, not-so-fictional- novel, for a new generation of viewers.<br/><br/>Adult-specific cultural references and jokes made within the film are constructed well too, as are the parodies of other movies.<br/><br/>How about 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' - one of the realms featured in the movie - a land with no rules and reached by travelling up a rainbow. Maybe a cultural reference to the concept of heaven? A reference that could imply such notions invented through various religious groups are in fact cuckoo? Or am I drawing a long bow here? <br/><br/>The concluding triumph of individual creations and breaking free from vanilla instructions over a Nanny state is also in direct contrast to what the actual Lego product is all about – a company which wants you to build structures according to very specific guidelines.<br/><br/>So does this movie, which at first brings up the serious issue of the degree to which adulthood enforces its values on childhood experiences, then comes to a resolution of individual thought, actually follow its own advice and think for itself? Not so much. Although its recycled ideas certainly do work to an extent.<br/><br/>From a pure child's perspective, if those few acts of hostility were left out, as well as the switch to the real people, it could have been better, but that would have changed the dimensions of some of the adult references.<br/><br/>Having said that, The Lego Movie had opening weekend figures in Australia over $5.7 million, a figure second only to Captain American: The Winter Soldier. And it will no doubt do wonders for the sales of those colourful building blocks... I forget what they're called."

I belonged to an era when entertainment was started being plagued by Ads and it kept on becoming more annoying as I grew older to the extent that we were forced to watch our beloved programmes in between Ads. But this movie has set new standard in this evolution by dragging an entire movie well inside the boundaries of Ad affectively making it one long and never ending Ad. The movie is nothing but a deliberate attempt to market and sell Lego products. Pity for a movie of such good story, cool, crisp direction and voice performances, but I couldn't watch it completely as I hate Ads and I want my entrainment to be interrupt free. ."

","Maybe 3/10 is a bit harsh. I realize The Lego Movie is just for kids. But if so many adults can praise it, then I suppose an adult should be able to criticize it. I really disliked its style of humor. It's just pop culture references and random stuff. The jokes come too fast, which gave me the impression that the writer's lacked confidence. A confident writer would take time to setting up a joke and delivering the payoff. Watching this movie, I thought the writers weren't too sure which jokes would work and threw everything they could on the screen. And with all due respect to the animators, who I'm sure worked very hard on the movie, it looked rather garish to me."
"mikle95","8","3","7","1 May 2014"," Important messages that most people didn't pick up
","I went to watch the Lego Movie yesterday and before watching it I had heard pretty good things about it. Good ratings and the trailer made it look pretty entertaining. Not that I'm a fan of Trailers. Anyway after watching the movie i can see why it has such high ratings as it is satisfying to most demographics. It was both clever and entertaining to kids and adults, but what really made it so great for me was the messages that would usually fly over the heads of the average mindless movie goer.<br/><br/>The Lego is built so everyone is the same, everything is awesome and no one complains. No one comes up with any original ideas because the society is fed a cycle of mindless daily routines to keep the society exactly the same. ""Honey where are my pants?"" is the only thing that is on TV. ""Everything is awesome"" is played on repeat all day long, and the one thing everyone looks forward to is free tacos on""Taco Tuesday"". The president ( Mr business) and the ""Man upstairs"" (who are more or less the same person) are basically the evil ones putting all this in place. Their aim is to keep everything the same, eventually by literally using glue to cement people into one place. Even more so then they were before.<br/><br/>If you think about it a lot of this isn't actually much different from our society. Think about all the mindless television out there in comparison to the actual thought provoking ones. And I'm sure most people would agree that the radio stations play the same stuff every day. It makes sense that a government wants to keep the status quo. Right now most people have very mindless jobs in office blocks and working on roads and fixing pipes. So it is in the governments interest to maintain this by seeing to it that the people are fed mindless television and repetitive music as opposed to something that cold educate the people into making them realise that they are worth more.<br/><br/>So the the average person, (Emmet) who is the average citizen who works on a construction site and hasn't thought of a single idea in his life. Is capable of so much more if they think outside the box and put forth their ideas.<br/><br/>There is so much more to how they portrayed this theme throughout the whole movie that I just cant explain without showing you the movie. The message was really strong for me, Conformity makes for a happy government. <br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is definitely worth seeing. It has some really thought provoking messages which really take it to the next level for me"
"badajoz-1","6","3","7","5 March 2014"," An Enjoyable Delight - but a little over-hyped
","A very refreshing and enjoyable film with lots of clever use of animation and humour for both young and old. But I am of the generation that never built Lego - only bought it for the next two generations. It is cleverly done as a movie, and the twist twenty minutes from the end puts the rest of Hollywood's wunderkind to shame! The characters are very predictable, but put themselves down with a distinct lack of ego (but then plastic models can, can't they?). The plot is yet another riff on George Lucas with a 'Metropolis' like society needing a Chosen One to release them to freedom - only the one chosen is not really of heroic stature. But the journey takes him to his destiny - freeing everyone to build their own models and not just what the packet tells them to! It runs out of steam after an hour before the big finish kicks in - plastic model cartoons can only go so far! And the animation can only go so far before iteration (like live action Hollywood!), but the biggest product placement in movies works well enough for long enough long enough to give a great deal of pleasure."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","1 March 2014"," The Animation is Certainly the Highlight
","The Lego Movie (2014) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Entertaining, if a bit overrated, animated feature about an average LEGO man who is mistaken for a MasterBuilder and is selected to lead a charge against an evil man wanting to put glue all over the city. THE LEGO MOVIE has become a huge hit with people and I must admit that I'm a little shocked. Yes, everyone knows what a LEGO is but when I first saw the trailer for this film I never thought it would connect like it has. With that said, I found the movie to be slightly entertaining but in my opinion it has been overpraised and over-hyped by some. Tastes certainly will vary but perhaps my dislike of playing LEGOs when I was younger had something to do with me not connecting with the picture more. However, even my four-year-old didn't seem to be caught up with the film like he has been with some previous pictures including FROZEN. I thought the animation was clearly the greatest thing about the picture as you can't help but sit there and watch this made-up world and be amazed at how realistic they were able to make it look. Everything is made to look like a real LEGO and the way they pulled this off was simply amazing. I also thought the vocal performances were very good with Will Arnett, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell really standing out. I'm not going to reveal the twist at the end of the picture but I thought it worked extremely well. There were some issues that I had with the film including the rather bland leading character and the fact that we're given yet another story that was just way too predictable and standard for its own good. Still, THE LEGO MOVIE has enough going for it to make it worth viewing."
"nnguyen0297","9","3","7","22 February 2014"," A perfect example of putting the blocks on top of each other one at a time
","I can't believe how impressive this movie was. When I first saw it, it just blew my mind away. Every about it was lovable. The story, the animation, the cast, the characters, the humor, it was a thrill ride. It's definitely a good film to kick of 2014, and is one that you definitely don't want to miss. You could tell that they went all out on this. It's one thing to make stop motion in general, but doing with Lego and making it that good is just impressive. And let's not forget the strong cast which includes Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrel, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, and numerous cameos including Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Shaq among many others. But probably the best thing about the movie was it's sense of humor. Though the first 10 minutes was quite boring and seemed like a typical animated film, the film spiraled high after wards and will keep you laughing all the way through. All of the cast members like Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman who you would never expect to do something comedic gave it there all here, and that only made it 10x funnier. But if there's' some thing I didn't like about the movie, it would have to be the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there's this little twist in the end that was quite un-expecting, but a bit unnecessary. With all honesty though, the ending wasn't that bad, and some of you may even like it. Overall, The Lego Movie"" is a great movie that' sun for all ages."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","7","20 February 2014"," The building blocks, Lego movie fit in the right places. Like the song says, everything is awesome.
","Legos is probably the most successful toy line in the World. It has its own theme park, series of video games and now its own film. Directed by Phil Lord & Chris Miller, the Lego Movie is surprising pretty good creative, it builds well on its Lego concept. The movie is about Emmett Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an ordinary construction worker who doesn't really stand out from the crowd. He comes across, an out of this world relic call 'the Piece of Resistance"". He learns from the Wizard Vitruvious (Morgan Freeman) & a mysterious woman named Wild Style (Elizabeth Banks) that the Piece of Resistance is the only way, to stop the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchman, Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) from using a super weapon call the Kragle that can freeze the universe perfectly in place. Emmett join the Vitruvious's group 'The Master Builders', people that are capable of building anything they need, both with great speed and without instruction manuals as their prophecy chosen one call the 'Special', whom will bring balance to the all the worlds of Legos. It's really has this odd, Michael Crichton's Westworld, the Wachowski's Matrix series, and Michael Bay's Transformers series going on with it. I love how the characters jump into different worlds. The movie is pretty smart, using not only pop culture themes worlds, but also ancient stories like Cloud Cuckoo Land taken from the book 'The Birds' by Aristophanes, about an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The variety of some of this theme worlds are honestly real toy line set such as the Old West & Pirate World. They even mention Fabuland, Duplo, and Bionicle toy franchise. The computer animation is amazing. It has that glitch-prone characteristic of what a Lego movie might look like. While, it's not stop-motion, at all. It's really does look like a really good old fashion homemade Youtube Brickfilm movie. Even some of the running themes, remind me of earlier Brick films such as Lindsay Fleay's 1980's hit, 'the Magic Portal'. I give mad props to the filmmakers would decide to change the frame rate to 15 FPS for the smoothest motion, which give the movie, its style. Everything in the movie was designed to look as if built out of Lego pieces. This even includes effects like water, fire, laser bolts, explosions and smoke. Without spoiling too much, a lot of various Lego characters, either original or from licensed properties, make cameos or play bit parts. These include characters from, Star Wars, DC Universe, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, NBA, and many. The voice cast was excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer. The second had to be Will Arnell as Batman. He really got that down. The worst in my opinion had to be Will Ferrell. I had to say, he could had done better as the man upstairs. He could had shown more emotional in that hug. Other minor faults of the film is that the movie kinda go against Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Christiansen's policy of not war & violence wanting to make seem like child's play. It was nothing too violent for the kids. Some parents might find some scenes disturbing like a Lego figure getting beheaded or getting frozen. Still, it was made in a light hearted matter. The combination of both stop motion and CGI is a bit hard to follow during a few action scenes. There was way too much things on the screen, going so fast that it's hard to figure out, who or what is going on. It's harder if in 3D. The humor is full of one-liners, inside jokes, and subtle allusions that depending how much you know, would tell if it's funny or not. A lot of the humor kinda goes over the head of some of the smaller children, and certain people. The satire and parody elements stand out, often downright mocking other similar films. Unfortunately, this falls into a very common criticize of the film not being more original. The movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic if you think about it. It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. It has the same ""chosen one who would save the world"" concept we've seen a few times before, but the way it's executed in the movie is very clever and the twist that occurs during the third act explain why the theme was so clichés. Even so, it's still formulaic as hell. The pacing is very brisk and moves the story along very nicely. The good things about the film is its unrepentant critique of social conformity themes. Much of the conflict revolves around organization art vs chaotic art. The movie's villains is George Orwell's 1984, trigger-happy cops, a corporate oligarch as president, rampant government surveillance and an oppressive system of compliance and mindless acceptance. The film's pop tune, ""Everything Is Awesome,"" by Tegan & Sara is as catchy, but also frightening. Songs chosen by the government keep the masses pacified. The lyrics aren't just a generic call for teamwork and positive thinking, call for also conformity and consumerism, nothing short of a reminder of the fascist regimes of the 20th century like Hitler's Strength through Joy program or North Korea's K-Pop program. The happily and unquestioningly pays $37 for a cup of coffee as a good consumer should do. It's like paying for an over expensive movie ticket and popcorn. At less, the movie didn't take our beloved childhood memories of Legos, and use it a cheap, hollow cash-in or bloated, special effects. The Lego Movie reminds us that the power of imagination and teamwork can go together in the process of building and creation. Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are."

We also used to tie onions on our belts because that was the style at the time, but I'll leave that story for Grampa Simpson to tell. Anyway, the voicework is great. I especially liked Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius. The story is surprisingly pretty good. I was expecting something kind of dumb but it's actually a fun movie and smarter than I thought it would be.

","NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW<br/><br/>I have not written a review before but I find the other reviews misleading. I am 57 and have found that the reviews by people over 45 are most helpful for me because when you get to be our age you have seen it all so a movie had to be well written to be worth seeing. When I saw the reviews of 7.7 from men my age, I talked my family into going. <br/><br/>The movie was very good. I won't give any spoilers but it is funny, has somewhat sophisticated humor in some cases, and some slapstick that is funny. Characters, voice acting, story line are all pretty good. For me the first 20 minutes were a little slow and other parts were slow, but the good parts made it overall worth seeing. The problem I have is people gave it such a high review. To me a review of 7.7 is only for a movie that I will watch a second time when it comes on TV. This was good but not that good. I would give it a 6.8 but you can't do that so I put 7. <br/><br/>Reading the reviews I think I figured out why they were so high. People who played with Legos as a kid gave it a high rating. I never played with Lego (at least not that I remember) and so that was not special for me. The problem with reading the reviews is I was expecting a fantastic movie and ended up with a good one. If I had expected a good movie I would have enjoyed it more. <br/><br/>Full disclosure my wife and 18 year old daughter HATED the movie and were VERY bored. My 21 year old daughter and I liked it. I think the key here is if you tend to like movies with subtle, sophisticated, ironic and satirical humor, this is for you. If you prefer action movies and romantic comedies this might seem boring to you."

","It looks like 2014 is going to be a very full year for movies, starting it early too with a huge family movie and a star-studded caper. Only one more week until The Grand Budapest Hotel which could possibly stand to be my Best Picture throughout the whole year, who knows. However, so far, the year is starting on mild disappointments. Though perhaps I just had my hopes up a little too high. The Lego Movie is good, but it's just getting way more acclaim than it deserves. It's being treated as the new Toy Story for a generation. Quite an overstatement for a film that's likable and quirky but doesn't have the gravitas in its emotion for quite a bold statement. It really could have been a disaster though, they pulled off the marketing perfectly. Completely nailed the idea that this is a film with breezy awesome attitude.<br/><br/>The beauty is in the little personal touches as each lego peace has their natural imperfections. Chris Pratt is the perfect casting choice for the lead, I'm very glad he's starting to blow up because his personality shouldn't be limited to Parks and Recreation. He's ideal as a Spongebob-esque naive blank-slate protagonist. The Lego Movie is kind of like The Matrix plus Wreck-It Ralph but unfortunately I just found the film far too manic to register what was going on. Impressive animation especially how it adds so much depth in 3D but too often it just felt all over the place. Not that I couldn't follow the story, I just couldn't catch the details. I never felt jeopardy or tension and it was too messy in its stakes to care deeply. Just a good time. It's a film that deliberately wears its themes on sleeve being very on-the-nose about individualism and so forth.<br/><br/>It wants to be a satire but it doesn't commit enough to its observations. While it breaks the fourth wall sometimes in attempts at dissecting its screenplay formulas they just seem like winks rather than deconstructions. It's just a way around using clichÃ©s rather than truly criticising them and using them inventively. But perhaps I'm taking a light film a little too seriously, at least its wonderful optimism makes up for what it lacks in conviction. It has several clever ideas and integrations into the real world that make it connect a little more though I do feel like the meta story takes stuff away rather than adds, especially with the melodramatic execution. However, as fun as the film is, I still don't think it can quite get passed the fact that it's a 100 minute advertisement for a toy. It is marketing the spirit of the toy with a touch of nostalgia, but seriously, go buy the toy.<br/><br/>6/10"

Master Builder is a term that is actually used by LEGO and it refers to people who make all of the instructions for the company's toys. Being captured by Lord Business is a metaphor for LEGO hiring people who grew up loving LEGO and then being taken in to the company. Lord Business represents a consumer/collector that always wants more sets to add to their collection. I think this was a very bold movie for LEGO to make, because it questions both the company and the community itself. I truly love this movie for so many reasons but mainly because it makes me appreciate what The LEGO Group has done."

","Right out of the gates, you know this animated film is self aware. The Lego designs are exactly like some from my childhood, and the characters interact with the world just like we would. On paper this might've sounded like another tiresome toy manufacturers attempt to target another medium, but that's definitely not the case. The filmmakers are the key here and they continue a successful streak of comedy films. Their humour is very sharp and they push this self aware nature through the storyline. Strong cast and vast supply of cameo voices throughout. Interesting film and deserved a sequel."

","A brilliant ride from beginning to end with so many creative characters and an interesting story to tell, starring Chris Pratt as Emmet, he discovers he is ""The Special"" and that it's up to him to take on Lord Business played by Will Ferrel. He meets a cast of crazy interesting characters such as Wildstyle as well as Batman who really does make the movie even cooler than it needs to be. The animation is crazy detailed and really made to look like stop motion with moving lego pieces which is all extremely vibrant, lively and expressive.<br/><br/>The song ""Everyting is Awesome"" is catchy and will stay stuck in your head for days after viewing. The humor is great and all the character are very smartly and sharply written and loaded with spark and personality.

","This animated feature follows an ordinary-living construction worker who is accidentally pulled into a group of people that includes superheroes. Their goal is to stop the evil President Business from destroying the world. The animation takes place in a massive Lego construct.<br/><br/>The early part of the film has a clever pace though it seems to depend too much on cartoon violent slapstick for cheap laughs. While there are better humourous moments elsewhere in the film, it seems to miss opportunities to satirize our modern world. It seems to get close to doing so but then stops short.<br/><br/>One such example is the rightly named character President Business. He is so mean-spirited, narrow-minded, vicious, and bullying that he could easily have been modeled after certain political leaders of today. There were missed chances to show how such a character is destroying Earth's environment. Instead, the film seems more to follow a far-out science-fiction fantasy premise.<br/><br/>I know I'm of the dissenting opinions here as the film is very popular with high critical acclaim. Still, I could only like ""The Lego Movie"" to a point. In any case, I did appreciate its message that ""ordinary"" people might be smarter than what most people would think."

"tuomo_karvonen","7","0","0","20 February 2019"," Great movie to watch one time
","So first of all I liked this movie a lot with my first watch. It's funny, pretty wicked and has a more serious ending. The strength of this movie is eventually it's plot. The movie starts light heartedly and seems like very innocent movie. The first time watch is great so I wan't to discuss about the plot here so spoilers incoming.<br/><br/>But before the major plot I want to tell about the things that aren't so great in my opinion. I was some what disappointed when I learned that this movie was CGI animated. It's no a huge problem because it does look good but I still have a problem with the overall look of the movie. It's not necessarily the CGI itself but editing and the speed of everything. There is too much happening on the screen for the most of the time. I think these great looking animations and effects are wasted because most of them last just like 2 seconds. There is not enough time to appreciate what you see on the screen and most of the time there is also too much stuff on the screen at the same time. It looks and is very cool that basically all the things are made of Lego, like water is transparent blue little parts, the sea is made out of Lego and smoke is made out of grey bricks. But on some action scenes there are like hundred different projectile parts on the screen flying around and the screen is just full of stuff and explosions. Then these different camera angles are on for just 2 or less seconds and action is essentially just too fast little moments.<br/><br/>Characters are just little too shallow in my opinion. The Hero is supposed to be this no one like in so many movies, that's ok. But supporting cast has some minor problems. The love interest is ok but it's little bit too hasty with her decisions. I know she is meant to be very fiery personality but some things don't make sense. First she is very dubious about the chosen one. But still she doesn't take the attitude to just drag him with her and do things by herself. Instead she still expects him to do things even though she doesn't believe in him at all. I think her character would be more convincing if she just told him to sit around and say ""let me handle this"". That would make it better when the chosen one finally starts to fulfill it's destiny.<br/><br/>Plot is great with it's mysterious connections to the ""real"" world and the lego universe. But after the first watch it's not a mystery anymore and that lowers it's rewatch value some what. I really like how the movie shows how child's imagination differs from the systematic and serious attitude towards playing with Lego and it's heart warming when this is discovered by the dad."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","0","0","8 February 2019"," I liked it before it was cool.
","I mean, it's just great. 'The Lego Movie (2014)' is a smart, unexpected and, frankly, hilarious animation that's actually much more than the sum of its parts - not to mention being much, much better than pretty much anyone anticipated, especially considering that it's essentially an extended advert of sorts (perhaps the best, most product-aware advert I've ever seen). The hit-rate of its humour is incredibly high. It's genuinely funny on more than one occasion, providing several big belly-laughs. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', there's something amusing or clever that keeps an ear-to-ear smile on your face, essentially, every few seconds. The piece is also remarkably heartfelt. It manages to keenly deliver a few important and considered messages, round off all its core characters in satisfying ways and conflate its masterful but somewhat 'out there' twist with its already established world, all while delivering a fast-paced, mile-a-minute, almost visually-psychedelic adventure. Seriously, there's a moment near the end that comes really close to making me tear up. That's not bad for a picture about talking plastic bricks. Speaking of which, the animation itself is stunning. Everything is made of individual digital Lego pieces, most of which have fingerprints and scratches on them. This, combined with the stop-motion style and dedication to only using replicas of real-world pieces (there's no cheating here), makes for an impressively tangible but delightfully playful feast-for-the-eyes, one that packs so much stuff into each and every plausibly (if nigh on impossibly) real-life recreatable frame. It's just great. It's easily one of the best animated features that I've ever seen. If one were to be cynical and say it were just an extended advert and not a proper film, then I'd fire back and say that, as I mentioned, it's straight-up the best advert I've ever seen, by a wide margin, that's better than a lot of 'proper', non product-placement containing pictures. It's an advert that I'd be happy to watch again and again. Well played, Lord and Miller. Well played, indeed. 9/10"

And i am happy i did since it's a fun and enjoyable movie after all.<br/><br/>You got a protagonist that is ordinary in every way, like the most ordinary person you can find! So he is pretty relatable for most people. Everyone will probably like the fact that they would find some element they enjoy in the movie since it's a mashup of things and anyone could be a fan of most of them. You got heroes, nostalgic toys from your childhood and realistic everyday life in the form of a boy's struggle to play with his dads collectibles.<br/><br/>The movie includes some solid action, decent comedy and a variety of characters voiced by great actors that fit the part. It reminds me a lot of Toy Story but this time the toys live their life in a way of spiritual form instead of moving in the real world, with some small exceptions of course. It comes down to a kid's fantasy and his wish to play with his toys and maybe find a playing partner in his serious dad.<br/><br/>The representation of everyone involved and the plot unfolded nicely and i think the Legos are a very nice watch and delivers solid fun to its audience. 8/10"

","There are few things that I dislike about this movie. I'll just get the only big one out of the way immediatly: the real world framing device. I already don't like framing devices as a whole, particularly when it implies that the story we actually care about isn't really happening in-universe. This one in particular also contains both the worst writing and the worst acting in the movie, and like most framing devices really isn't really necessary. The only thing I liked about it was the Duplo joke at the end. That being said, everything else about the movie was great! The characters were lovable, the jokes were hilarious, I love the conflict between being creative and having a strict plan with neither one being stated as better than the other, the animation is AMAZING, and the idea that ""The Special"" is not Emmet, but actually it's anyone who wants to be was great!

They found one extremely satisfying way to make ""the"" LEGO movie and tell a beautiful story (watch until the end!). Had they done something like ""G.I. Joe"", ""Battleship"" or the likes, they would have failed. 2) The way they're using LEGO bricks for EVERYTHING, including and not limited to fire, water, foam, smoke, explosions, laser beams, LED bargraphs, clouds, force fields, motion blur (!) and more, is just mind-boggling and alone warrants watching the film.

","'The Lego Movie' is exactly what you expect, but also at the same time, something unexpected. It's a bright, fast-paced, well-intentioned kids' film, but it also has quite a few genuine laughs and touching moments - not that they're out of place, just that they add some levity to the story, which sometimes does get a little too ""meta"" for it's own good.<br/><br/>The storyline is quite straightforward - ordinary guy gets thrust into an adventure to save the Universe, defeat the bad guy (Ferrell) and find love, even though he's ""normal"" - obviously, it turns out everyone's ""Special""/unique, not just those that are prominent. What makes it stand out is how they've taken something we all know & love - I doubt anyone born in the last 40 years hasn't played with Lego as a kid - and translated it to a living world. We get to see this through Emmet (Pratt)'s eyes and it's pretty funny how they integrate corporate America - coffee, music & TV shows - into this Lego world. And it's great how the Lego looks real and only animated to move facial effects - and the animated water is great. My favourite bit was seeing Ben the 'generic 80's astronaut' (Charlie Day) - and his enthusiasm for building spaceships - who even had an authentic helmet crack where the chin strap always broke! I remember building weird spaceships for him.<br/><br/>One of my main issues is that they've gone to such great effort to animate this world, but then they fly through most of it so quickly that you don't actually get a chance to appreciate it all! Thanks to being a Warner Brothers film, we get the benefit of seeing DC characters - Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern (a great sub-plot with these two!), and especially, Batman. The casting of Will Arnett as Batman is genius - his gravelly voice perfectly suited, as well as his comic timing. The ending - combining live action with the animation actually works - is pretty good and wraps everything up nicely, while also making you care for some of these characters, even if they're little yellow blocks!"
"feyipuk","7","0","0","26 July 2014"," Out of the ordinary, but ultimately premoulded
","Drawing a lot from other films - Matrix, LOTR, Batman, Star Wars, etc - the story lines of the film are like using the Lego blocks themselves; seemingly driven by imagination and creativity, the producers have a whole bucket of possibilities to play with. They can go two ways; use their skills to replicate the world around them in miniature, or let their imaginations run wild and build things that would be impractical to create using anything else. The most notable thing about the film is the animation. It is so cleverly done to replicate the Lego feel there are times it could be stop motion animation. The way the blocks fit together, the way they move and other idiosyncrasies. There's no hair swishing here or head nodding. It's just like you're playing with your Lego at home, only without having to take the roof off to move the figures inside.<br/><br/>The voice acting is top notch. Morgan Freeman is once again - as always - helping to solve white (yellow) mans problems, this time as Vitruvius, a sort of Gandalf meets Dumbledore sage. Liam Neeson steals the show as Bad Cop, a great portrayal of both his normal, angry, gruff action persona, but also a happier, smilier character who resembles Wayne Knight's ""Officer Don"" from Third Rock From The Sun. Even Will Ferrell keeps the crazy in check to play the megalomaniac Lord Business at the right tempo, so he becomes a pastiche of evil, rather than parody all the traits you would expect. It's funny, but I don't know whether the producers intentionally used Jonah Hill in the way they did, but the way his character is treated does sum up the way I think about him in every movie he's in!<br/><br/>Yes, it's an animation, but it's actually quite dark and violent in places. My toddler son plays with Lego, but there are a few scenes he wouldn't get. It is rated a PG after all. There are also lots more references to the older sets (I did have to pause one scene and go through how many of the characters I'd had as a kid) and the use of individual blocks, compared to the modern sets with there premoulded pieces, which would seem to appeal more to the older audience. And this is the greatest irony of the film - though not surprising - in that Lego has actually released sets to make the creations from the film using premoulded pieces. It's not good enough just to use your own imagination to try and recreate what you've seen in a similar form, you can remake their vision. And this, sadly lets the film down; it's too formulaic. With all the freedom Lego allows, they do stick to the usual film tropes like glue. It's a good film, with a very catchy song, but it could have been built slightly differently."

","This is a curious movie. I had not heard much about it, but knew it was highly regarded. My wife and I started watching it last night, but shut it off after about 45 minutes. It didn't seem interesting at all.<br/><br/>But today I gave it another chance, finished it, and now understand. While it never will be one of my favorite animated movies, it was fun to watch especially during the last 10 to 15 minutes.<br/><br/>I tried to find out about how they made it by re-watching it with the DVD's cast commentary, but let me tell you that is one of the most annoying commentaries I've ever witnessed. Fortunately someone asked if most of the movie is computer animated or actual shots of Lego pieces, sort of in a claymation style of animation. As it turns out almost all of it uses computer-generated images, but they did it in a way that it looks like real Lego pieces were used. <br/><br/>I would guess that a person who grew up with Legos (not me) would get a bigger kick out of it. There's some funny stuff, like being afraid of the 'Kragle', which we see is 'Krazy Glue' with the letters 'z-y-u' scratched out from use. But it mainly seems to want to give the message that each of us has the ability to accomplish great things, and 'everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a group.'<br/><br/>SPOILERS: For most of the movie we see Lego figures and Lego machines in various settings, buildings, streets, etc. Their small world is animated, it is as if they are alive, and I suppose in a sense they are. But then we see it is a giant Lego set built in a basement, and the dad (Will Ferrell) comes down the stairs to see his young son has made some alterations to what Dad had built. At first dad was angry, but then he realized that his son had to exercise his creativity too."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","4","12","7 February 2014"," A fun well executed family movie
","The Lego company is a toy company that has truly stood the test of time. Not only by staying ahead of its competition, but by also being able to adapt and stretch itself across the entire board of the toy-making domain. Think about it, how many franchises are out there that the Lego company has fed off of and co-produced a series of toys after? Numerous, too many to count. Anyone who's a Lego fan will enjoy this movie. There are lots to find entertaining from its design, creative story, action and characters.<br/><br/>The story is about the everyday Lego man named Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt). A construction worker who lives his life by the book. Literally, a Lego construction book. And like any other day, his day goes just fine until he makes a discovery that turns his life upside down. The discovery involves a special fragment that could save the Lego universe. Little does Emmet realize is that the world he lives in is a set-up (no pun intended), where a ruler called President Business (Will Ferrell) is a chronic perfectionist who longs to hold a structured order to the Lego universe. And the story only gets more creative from there, partially because of the characters involved. Accompanying Emmet in his journeys is Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who makes sure Emmet doesn't lose his head and saves him whenever possible. Then there's also the head master known as Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) who gives some very funny scenes. <br/><br/>But the one character who steals the screen the most is Batman (Will Arnett). There are just too many scenes to count where Batman has a line that makes every intended funny scene even more genuinely funny. There's even a Lego spaceman that I can only imagine any person who played with Legos must have had at one point in their life. But that's not all, there are even more cameos than one could count, most of which viewers saw in the upcoming trailers to this movie. They all have their own special parts. Even the bad guys are memorable. President Business had good scenes and his henchman labeled as Bad Cop / Good Cop (Liam Neeson) is one heck of a character. In a way, the character reminded me of Man- E-Faces from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983).<br/><br/>What really helps make this movie funny though is the mix of a clever, imaginative story that blends in great with its respective animation. The story was created by Kevin and Dan Hagemen who also worked as writers for the Lego TV series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011) and Hotel Transylvania (2012) which also was a very entertaining animated family feature. But the reason why their writing works so well is because of the animation. Kudos to the animation department because they did an amazing job by sticking to what Ray Harryhausen would do - stop motion animation. By using the physical Lego pieces and not CGI, helped limit the characters movements making them funnier to watch. Yes it is apparent when the CGI kicks in but boy oh boy do the animators get creative with how the Lego pieces make up every single thing you could imagine of. Plus, isn't that kind of the whole thing behind Legos? It's also the moral to the story, where Legos were created for people to get creative with.<br/><br/>Finally let's not forget action and music, it is one sweet ride. Much of the action scenes are fast paced, include quick wit dialog and some intense scenes as well. Helping that of course is composer Mark Mothersbaugh's score. It has every single kind of the emotion you would want. Hopefully it will be released for the film score collectors to enjoy too. There's even a theme for the movie even though it's not from the score, that is the song ""Everything Is Awesome"". It's a very catchy and bumpy song that'll want to make one get up and dance. I did not see one thing to pick about which is rare.<br/><br/>This is one epic Lego film. Every element to the film works great, thanks to its well written screenplay, comic relief given by its voice actors, entertaining action sequences, memorable characters and old fashioned animation."

For a fact... if you have never ever played with LEGO toys, there are tonnes of better stuff out there...which I personally would say you should watch...with a little bit of Google assistance."

","My 8 year old son and I love Legos. We have been waiting for this movie since it was announced. I was very happy to receive passes to the screening of this movie because I just didn't think we could bear to wait another week until the release.<br/><br/>The movie had so much going on that I think we will need to see it again in order to ""catch"" everything. There were tons of references to other movies and of course the movie featured a wide range of Lego series products.<br/><br/>My son and I enjoy the Lego shows like Chima and Ninjago and we own several of the movies and games Lego Star Wars, Lego Batman, etc. I loved how this movie broke boundaries it really looked like a child's playroom where Ninja Turtles and Star Wars are co-exist.<br/><br/>The story line was action packed, humorous, and a little surprising. There were some serious messages in this movie, believing in yourself, uniqueness, being creative, but there was also a lesson there for parents: Don't build your child and yourself into a box; be creative be imaginative.<br/><br/>I really do hope there will be another movie soon until then we will be heading back to the movies opening weekend to see this one again."

"ed-421","9","3","9","8 February 2014"," Surprisingly dark and subversive, under the surface
","In The Birds by Aristophanes (414BC), Mr. Trusting and Mr. Hopeful erect a perfect city in the clouds, to be named Cloud Cuckoo Land -- an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The Birds (414BC) is described by critics as a ""perfectly realized fantasy remarkable for the gaiety of its songs"".<br/><br/>Scratch the surface, and there is darkness underneath. <br/><br/>This is also an underlying theme of The Lego Movie. In the opening, main character Emmitt sees a TV show where the president lets on that the world will end in three days. And then everyone goes back to being happy, as the costs of everything go up, and all the jokes and songs are repeated. Everyone follows instructions.<br/><br/>Later, Emmitt is interrogated by ""Bad Cop"" -- and occasionally reassured by ""Good Cop"". While the Good Cop makes everything seem okay and perfect, the Bad Cop is never far away.<br/><br/>Later, they go to Cloud Cuckoo Land (!), ""a land up in the clouds where there are no rules, no limits, no bushy mustaches and no bedtimes."" There they meet Princess Unikitty, who has no negative thoughts. Wyldstyle remarks on how often she says ""No"" in the place with no rules.<br/><br/>Later still, there is a wonderful place, but with signs saying ""Do Not Touch"" and ""Off Limits"" everywhere.<br/><br/>--- and I'll stop Lego Movie = Greek Comedy there ---<br/><br/>This is one of those movies with a lot of layers. I wondered how I would describe the movie. Action Thriller? Superhero? Love Story? Horror? Comedy? Tragedy? Sci-Fi? Fantasy? Western? Cataclysm? I thought about how I could argue the case for any of these. <br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed the zippy, intense, manic drive of the movie, and liked many of the jokes -- but also frequently saw the underlying darkness that was being hinted at. Well, perhaps not hinted -- many of the references were blatant, but maybe they expect that most people will be distracted by the action and not try to process something important, just like Emmitt at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>Fun and exciting, but underneath, it's like Batman, where everything is dark."

","I always loved Lego since I was a child and I even dreamt about going to legoland for a holiday which didn't happen lol.<br/><br/>Anyways I didn't find the movie creative or exciting, it was just too obvious for me like I always knew what happened next in each scene. Believe me, I knew well Emmet was gonna get the girl he found on a construction site at the very end. <br/><br/>It was badly done also. For example, like the old man Vitruvius in his ghost form, you can see his mouth wasn't moving or you can see the string that helps him to move as if he's flying! Well done Warner Brothers, that was an epic fail especially on a Lego based movie for god sakes!<br/><br/>I didn't think Will Ferrell does a good job at playing as a bad guy, he sounded too much of a good guy.

"ravimukkavilli","10","2","5","13 April 2014"," Awesome movie with something for everyone!
","The Lego Movie is a story about characters and objects from the famous Lego construction toy line. The number of successful toy-based theatrically released films can be counted on one hand (the Toy Story movies are really the only ones that come to mind instantly). The problem most of these movies face is that they are forced to follow a set storyline laid out by the toy line, which does not always translate well to film. The Toy Story films' stories worked because the toys (which were from different toy companies) were not bound to any single storyline. All the characters from The Lego Movie are from the same toy line, but the beauty of Legos is that they have never been bound to a set storyline. All the different themes, characters, and vehicles are interchangeable and can be used to reenact existing stories or to create something entirely new. The Lego Movie functions in the exact same way. The characters live in a seemingly utopian metropolis which is eventually shown to be based on a form of brainwashing and values defined by an oligarch. The situation is reflective of daily life in some countries with totalitarian regimes, and at times the oligarch is a SNL-esque parody of totalitarian heads of state. In fact, the movie's theme of individuality is reflective of Western ideals. After the villain's intentions are established, the rest of the movie shows the attempted thwarting of his plans, eventually leading to a completely unexpected plot twist that nobody will have seen coming. <br/><br/>The animation is excellent and the world of Legos is vibrant. Lego video games are very popular and their impact on this film is best seen in the animation, which uses some of their physics and mechanics. The story is never dull at any point, playing out like the Lego related adventures of people's childhoods. The writing continuously creates humor through both wit and whimsy. The voice acting is especially impressive, with voices for characters like Batman and Gandalf coming from unexpected yet effective sources. Will Ferrell does an especially good job of applying his Mugatu persona from Zoolander to his portrayal of Lord/President Business. <br/><br/>This movie is truly one that has something for everyone. Both children and adults will be excited by the sight of the characters they once played with/still played with moving of their own volition on the big screen. There is a very catchy song (""Everything is Awesome"") that will be stuck in the listeners' head for days after watching the movie and sell well on iTunes. There are many cultural references that cover the wide range of Lego themes as well as some slightly more political jabs. Fans of the business aspect of film-making will rejoice at this excellent example of a company successfully incorporating elements from all of its product ranges in one film. Anti-establishment moviegoers can cheer on the little man trying to overcome the evil corporation while appreciating the irony that they will (most likely) be doing so at a multiplex owned by a large corporation. I highly recommend watching this movie, no matter how you do so, because it can teach something to every viewer while providing entertainment for all."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","9","2","5","12 April 2014"," The Lego Movie Review
","My Thoughts: I really enjoyed this movie. And I think E-Roc, an avid Lego collector/fan and member of The Awesome Movie Podcast, seemed to enjoy himself greatly. I am sure the next time we record for The Awesome Movie Podcast, he will let us know what he thought of the movie so, be sure to check it out.<br/><br/>What are you getting when you go to see this movie? We start off seeing Lord Business (Will Ferrell) taking on Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and stealing the artifact Kragle (I will let you guys figure out what that is). We then flash forward to 8 1/2 years later and we follow Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt), a construction worker that is just a normal guy, following the instructions set forth by President Business. And yes, he is the same guy as Lord Business now, just running the show with his robot Legos and cameras everywhere.<br/><br/>Emmet stumbles upon Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for the one relic that can stop Lord Business and his evil plans to use the Kragle. Emmet is mistaken to be the Special and is taken on an adventure with Wyldstyle, learning that there is life outside of the instructions that he follows. Along the way, he teaches the ""Master Builders"" that there is more to life then just thinking outside the box and coming together to help take down Lord Business and stop his evil plans.<br/><br/>This movie has a deeper meaning to it as well, but I am not going to delve to much into it because it will give away some big reveals towards the end of the movie, and I think people should be surprised and learn what it is on their own. Needless to say, though, this movie will speak to both the kids and the parents or adults that go see this movie.<br/><br/>To say there are a lot of big named actors doing voice overs is an understatement. This movie is chocked full of A-list Actors lending their voices to the characters, and they are all awesome! I didn't once glance down at my watch wondering when this movie would end. There is plenty of humor and entertainment for kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>I am always worried going into these types of movies, not knowing how kids are going to behave or whether the parents are going to control them if they start to get rowdy. I have to say, this movie seems to have captured their attention and hold it for the hour and forty-minute run time. There weren't any crying kids, nor distracted kids; they all seemed to pay attention to the movie and really enjoy it. So if you are wondering if you should take your kid to see this movie, I say yes, go for it.<br/><br/>And let me tell you before I go, there are tons of little Easter eggs throughout this movie, and you probably won't catch them all going through the first time.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: I think this is a great movie for the family. There is plenty for the adults, and it will keep kids entertained. If you are a big Lego fan, I think you should see this movie as well."
"benjaminaberle","9","2","5","11 April 2014"," Brilliantly Assembled.
","'The Lego Movie' is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and stars Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Alison Brie, Liam Neeson and many more.<br/><br/>This film follows Emmet, an ordinary guy who lives his life completely by the book (or ""by the instructions"", if you will). This all changes when he becomes the center of an ancient prophecy that claims he is destined to save the world and become a 'Master Builder'.<br/><br/>The first thing I'd like to point out is just how much attention is payed to detail in this film, I mean everything looks and feels magnificent. The creators obviously had a clear vision of how they wanted things to come together and I think everything came together brilliantly, this astonishing land of plastic bricks made me want to believe it was real.<br/><br/>Almost every character in this film is lovable in their own way and they're brought to life by the near flawless cast that was assembled, every actor's voice fits their respective character perfectly, especially Will Ferrell as President Business and Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop, who, in my opinion, gave the strongest performances of the whole cast.<br/><br/>The humour in this film is spot on, pulling off the task of being funny for all ages without being completely stupid. Animated movies should be an exquisite blend of funny dialogue and visual humour and thankfully, 'The Lego Movie' is just that. The plot is solid for the first two acts, but the third act contains a touching twist that will make you realise that this story is actually completely different than what you first thought it was and honestly, it's a twist that pays off greatly and adds some much needed emotional depth to the film. (Let's be honest, Emmet and Wildstyle falling for each other was a tacky plot device to add a slight element of romance to the film and we all know it.)<br/><br/>I have practically nothing but good things to say about 'The Lego Movie'. It's a charming, witty, visually stunning film that proves you can make awesome movies out of just about anything, even Lego blocks. The characters are the most enjoyable bunch that I have watched in recent years and the overall message that it sends to audience members is a great one. I give 'The Lego Movie' a 9 out of 10."

","Wow, just wow! Having grown up with Lego through the 70's & 80's and liking nerdy things (Star Wars, Super Heroes and fantasy/Dundeons & Dragons), this movie was just pure awesomeness . Along with the nerd-fest, the CGI (computer graphics) actually looks more like old school stop-start motion animation. To be honest, I have grown to hate CGI. It is over used and has a certain cheap look to it. The animation based company that did the animations in this film have achieved perfection here by making the movie look like stop-start motion animation and creating a sense that the Lego is real. A big thumbs up to the Australian CGI company that was hired for this job. Oh yeah, the Star Wars scene was awesome."

","The Lego Movie finally arrived in Australian cinemas last week, so I took the chance to see it since having so much high-anticipation since reading IMDb user reviews and the hype it had! I can admit that this was indeed a fun movie to see!<br/><br/>The storyline here is obviously children aimed, but I was surprised that so many adults my age and older were interested in this, it felt like too it was aimed at both children and adults. It had humor, imagination, moral and even heart in its tale, delivering a strong feel good feeling of who who we are and what we are capable of. <br/><br/>Animation is a major feature in The Lego Movie and I can admit that it was astoundingly achieved by Australian visual effects company Animal Logic (the creative team behind Happy Feet 1 and 2). So much detail and thought was given into the Lego universes featured in the film, it gives a strong sense of what the imagination from the mind can do! The 3D itself gave an amazing sight to behold this amazing Lego world, sure hope in future that Animal Logic wins awards for their hard-earned work (and maybe even Best Animated Film in the 2015 Academy Awards).<br/><br/>Overall, an exciting move that takes fun to a whole new level in terms of story, film-making and even genre. Can't wait for the Blu Ray release later this year and the already confirmed sequel in the future."
"The-Sarkologist","8","2","5","6 April 2014"," Finally, a movie based around my favourite childhood toy
","What surprises me about this movie (other than the Hollywood Dichotomy, which I will mention below) is not so much that they made a movie based around the very popular Lego  product, but rather that they took an incredibly long time to actually make it. It is not as if they did not have the capabilities of doing such a movie a while back – in fact I remember watching a stop-motion Lego Star Wars film back in the early nineties, which was passed around on video cassette (unlike these days where I am sure you can get access to many Lego films on Youtube.<br/><br/>As for the film, it is a typical film about a bunch of heroes going out and defeating a bad guy. Also, being a film aimed primarily at children (and also designed as a not so subtle advertisement of the Lego  product), it also has the hero of the story as an ordinary person who goes out and does extraordinary things, which is our culture's way of saying that it does not matter who you are, or what your station in life is like, you do have the capability of doing extraordinary things, all you have to do is believe in yourself.<br/><br/>However, there is another interesting thing that I call the Hollywood Dichotomy. I noticed it first in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and I have noticed it replicated again here, and that is that this film seems to go against what is expected of a loyal and patriotic citizen of the United States of America. First of all we have the antagonist, Lord Business/President Business – clearly he represents the upper 1%, the executive director of the multi-national corporation, and he is portrayed not only as the bad guy, but as the guy whose power we are to resist. This seems to fly in the face of the idea that the CEO is a leader, a person to aspire to and respect, which is something that is essential in the capitalist society. However, I guess the reason that he is portrayed as the antagonist is not so much because he is bad, but rather because he is standing in the way of your success, and you are not going to become successful until he is out of the way.<br/><br/>The other aspect in this film is the idea of following the instructions. What the film is suggesting is that following the instructions is a bad thing and that we are to reject that an embrace our freedom. This, in a sense is what is happening in the United States today, with the creation of a quasi-police state (and we see it here in Australia as well) where those of us who do not follow the rules are considered to be miscreants and trouble makers. In a sense we are to accept the decisions of our superiors, whether we agree with them or not, and to exercise our right to protest and to seek change is discouraged because what that does is that upsets the status quo."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","2","5","2 April 2014"," It's relieving to say that it brims with visual charm and creativity
","One of the safest ways in which Hollywood preserves its bankability is not by investing in new ideas but by creating relationships between the on screen images and tangible commodities like toys. Toys have become the target of Hollywood because they have the incentive of drawing in younger audiences, along with their parents, as they recognise the items or images on the screen. Transformers, Battleship and G.I. Joe are some of the toys that have been made into huge blockbusters but the ploy is older than that. Cinema merchandising can be traced back to the early blockbuster films of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in the mid Seventies. Video games have also been adapted into films for two decades because there is already an established fanbase and are deemed safer and more profitable than developing new ideas. Comic book films and action movies are becoming gradually imitative of the physics and design of video games, particularly in their elaborate action sequences. It is now a question as to whether cinema, particularly among young viewers, will ever be given the imagination and originality that it deserves, instead of relying on existing products for inspiration. Similarly, do films adapting toys remove children from the joys of having a tangible object or toy in their hands and encouraging them to develop their own imagination? <br/><br/>The transition from toys to films belongs to a broader timeline and capitalist trajectory. The Lego Group was established by Ole Kirk Christianen, a Danish carpenter who started making wooden children's toys in the early 1930s because he had lost his job in the Great Depression. The name Lego is taken from the Dutch phrase ""leg godt"" which means ""play well"". Lego has developed from simple wooden designs to plastic materials and now into a sixty million dollar blockbuster. While this computer generated feature from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) is indisputably made to sell more of Christianen's toys, it's relieving to say that it brims with visual charm and creativity. Cleverly, the film has been shot using regular CGI animation, courtesy of the Australian animation studio Animal Logic, but it has been made to look as though it has a stop motion aesthetic. Stop motion animation is time consuming because it relies on photographing an image or model, adjusting it and photographing it again. There have been Lego stop motion videos on sites such as Youtube that have used this process, which is where this film takes inspiration for its design. Along with using CGI, the little Lego figures were also examined to see how they look, feel and move and then incorporated into the film. Aside from the forgettable 3D, it is a film that is simply drowning in clever visual details and sight gags. This is where the film generates a lot of its charm, humour and nostalgia. It's great fun to see those Lego figures back from your childhood, but with even more personality and expression, along with some of the classic old sets, like the Western world. <br/><br/>However, the greatest challenge for any film based on a toy, let alone one playing with Lego, is what to do with the narrative. The film's script by the directors is very funny at times and witty, particularly with the way that it employs gentle nudges and self-depreciating humour towards pop culture icons like Lego Batman and Green Lantern. Yet the narrative leaves a lot to be desired. The plot is thin, relying heavily on standard MacGuffin devices and pleasant liberal messages about finding your personal gifts and using your imagination when the rest of the world is conforming. It's sweet but hardly testing and it's also padded extensively by action scenes that are only different from the ones they're parodying because they're in Lego form. At least the voice cast (Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson among others are delightful) is highly colourful and distinctive and each character has their own moment of personal glory. I would have liked a few more of these character moments to put the film on a level closer to a Pixar film but small children are still going to love the visual spark alone. It moves faster than your old Lego set and without the pain of collecting any of the tiny pieces left behind. Despite its good intentions and its positive messages, do people want to see their children being told they can be imaginative while watching a film or discovering that same creativity as they build and craft Lego worlds for themselves?"
"jeharrell","9","2","5","1 April 2014"," Superb Movie
","The Lego Movie was a spectacular movie for my wife and kids, they enjoyed it thoroughly. The voice talent was also comedic and not over the top type of comedy. Emit and Wildstyle were the most lovable characters by far. We only wished the film was a bit longer because my three kids couldn't get enough of it but I suppose that was for the better as it leaves room for more in the future. The Lego Movie is a bit reminiscent of a childhood cartoon I used to watch called ""GoBots"" where my favorite character or hero was sort of the weak link of the bunch. In all, Lego Movie was fun for ages 5 to 80 and the marketing has been off the wall! I give this movie a 9 out of 10 simply because the ""Awesome"" song was sung in the car all the way home."

","Lego Movie is almost in a genre of its own, appealing to kids but I suspect adults will like it more.

","Lego Movie in my opinion could go down as one the biggest surprises ever in cinema history. I know the Lego franchise has gone waayy beyond expectations with the toys, models and gaming industry (Lego Harry Potter, Lego Star Wars etc etc), but a Lego film I never thought would work, and if one was released, it would be so childish I would never lay eyes on it...... How wrong could I be, as this film could easily have just made it in AT LEAST my top 50 of all time.<br/><br/>First of all, this film will probably only appeal to so many friends, unless you're all super perfectly in sync with another. I saw this tonight with 3 other people, and only 1, as well as myself were laughing throughout, the other 2, didn't get any of the humour at all. The humour is witty, very immature in places, but perfectly timed. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUOTE THE FILM FOREVER FILMS!<br/><br/>However as funny as this film is, and as much as I have already quoted Batman in the past 2 hours since seeing the film, it's not the humour that has pushed this film waaaaay beyond expectations. Without giving too much away, this film has a really deep back story, and a massive surprise towards the end with the story entering a world that I never thought would exist in the film, and it really did help explain why the film was as random as it was, and just brought everything together. Kudos Lego Movie, Kudos.<br/><br/>Can not wait to add this to my blu ray collection (the film is stunning)."

","How far would you take your wildest imagination and breathe some life into it? I think someone asked this similar question to the creators of Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller. And The Lego Movie was their answer.<br/><br/>I had humongous doubts when I came to know a film as such was being made. First of all, I had no idea or experiences with Lego construction toys. To me, it appeared to be boring and the hype that has always surrounded it was very overrated. When it was hard to even consider it as a toy, I was very sure the directors have lost their minds upon the decision to generate a full fledged movie featuring a world made out of Lego.<br/><br/>First few seconds of the film was a bit hard to digest as the animation was new and there weren't many scopes for free movements as we are looking at toy bricks. What began this way unfolded into a terrific comedy action entertainer that I honestly didn't anticipate at all.<br/><br/>Emmet, an underdog who is a construction worker, leads a normal life. He is destined to save the world from evil President Business who plans to destroy it. His travel, the people he meets and the way he saves the world forms the movie's crux. I have just narrated a story line which has been told in over thousands of movies. But all the differences were made by the Lego and admirable screen writing. Based on the real life construction toys solely, Phil and Chris has meticulously formed a world that resembled ours. It looked easy to create man-like toys as the film's characters. But I bet building clouds, fire, smoke and sea using Lego sets weren't a painless execution. To build it is one thing, to perfect it is another thing. And to make it work and tell us a story speaks of a rare success.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure. The Lego Movie will never allow you to yawn, thanks to the tight and gripping screenplay by the directors. Once you enter the film, you will be out of it before you know it. Even if you were keen to detect mistakes, the screenplay doesn't give you time. Characters such as Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman), Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) and Uni-Kitty (voiced by Alison Brie) were amazing additions which without the film wouldn't have been as appealing as it was. Cameos by Superman, Green Lantern, Gandalf The Grey, Kung Fu Panda, Shakespeare, Wonder Woman and so on are surely creative and leaves you wanting more for their screen space.<br/><br/>Similar to many Disney animation films, there are several motivational dialogues that pops up to encourage everyday people. With random characters thrown in the film, backed up by a different story-telling, towards the end, you would think that you already know The Lego Movie is just another Disney-inspired film. Prepare to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>From the outside, The Lego Movie might appear as an animation feature. But one has to look from the inside to realize that the animation was just a part of the true story - a kid's imagination in the real world. When a kid has things to say and wasn't given a chance to do so, he or she uses a different platform to express it out. In this case, it was Lego. We all had toys once in our life and this is totally relatable. When the real world was shown with Will Ferrell as a strict dad who prohibits his son from messing up the set of Lego toys, that is when the entire movie made sense. Emmet is a representation of the kid and the villain represented the father. Emmet has always required instructions to do (build) things in his life, like everyone else. And the entire movie was about the protagonist learning to be different from the rest of the world and comprehending that success would come to him if he never stops believing. The analogical simultaneous ending is something to watch out for.<br/><br/>Today, animation genre has been brought to another topnotch stage. There is always great support and feedback for healthy cinema, and as for The Lego Movie, it is currently tasting a remarkable success. What can I say? Keep it coming as everything is awesome!"

","I will say that when I saw the preview for this movie I wasn't too excited about it. I was never a fan of Lego's even as a kid and never really played with them. Only through the great reviews and word of mouth did I decide why not give this a shot and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>I didn't see it in 3D and it might have made it more entertaining with the way the special effects were used. It was a clever piece of work with the way they portrayed water, fire, smoke, and a whole bunch of different things.<br/><br/>Even though most kids will want to see this, its the adults that will probably be heard most in the theater laughing. The jokes are more for the adults but because its Lego's the kids will have a fun time too. There is a bit of a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>Overall, its simply just a fun time at the movies that both the kids and adults will equally enjoy."
"nvlawman","Null","2","5","23 February 2014"," Excellent movie and plot!!!
","Great story, I don't why the other reviewers don't see it (must not be the special). The story is about how government and business control (micromanage) every aspect of your lives and (micromanagers) are government agencies. That means that unless you are (a master builder), you are not free. Even the Will Farell in reality is a reference to how the story itself is reality, love it!!! However, unlike the ending to this movie, I don't see business and government ever realizing that by letting the people do what they choose out of free will, it will benefit them and it could. Anyway, excellent movie and if you don't see the above in it, watch it again."
"hprashantarora","Null","2","5","17 February 2014"," Everything NOT so awesome!
","Boy, what a letdown. I am a big fan of LEGO's; played with them throughout my childhood and my daughters have tons of them, so naturally I was very excited to see it with the family. A rating of 8.6 on IMDb (now 8.5) was encouraging but it turned out to be a big bore. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong dear fans. The movie must have looked great on paper, in story boards and during CGI processing. Clearly, lot of effort went into the making of this movie and the artists should be thanked for that butthere's always a ""but."" And in this case there are lot's of buts. <br/><br/>First of all the running time is way too long. Two hours for an animated film that goes at a break neck speed? Give me a break. No, really I needed a break while viewing it. This film is chock full of imagery that is radiant with every possible color, hue, tint, and shape that morph into other shapes in the blink of an eye. So you never really know what's going on at any given time. And I am saying this from a kid's perspective. 30 minutes into the movie and my daughter wanted to go home.<br/><br/>Clearly, this movie was not made for kids but for adults like me who grew up playing with LEGO but I hated it. Every single scene has a dozen characters in it and they are all loud. You don't need that to happen in nearly every scene. The jokes are average too. It seems as if the film makers just couldn't decide which joke to throw out and decided to keep everything just in case. They should have consulted guys from Pixar on the proper use of restraint and effective deliverance of a message. <br/><br/>I know this film will do well with the ADHD crowd (no offense to the real patients) that thrives on YouTube videos. I came out of the theater with a mild headache and in my misery asked my kids what they leaned from the movie. First they gave me a blank stare and then all of a sudden started shouting the title song while flailing their arms,"" Everything is awessssssome."" Yeah, right!"

"sohansurag","7","2","6","19 April 2014"," Went in Skeptical, Came out Awesome!
","Remember those times when you were a kid and used to make dramatic, action packed movies playing with your action figures and toys? Lego movie does just that, just much better than an 8 year old though. I'll put this right there, I am not a fan of Lego! I had a wannabe Lego set when I was young (Thank you, China!) and later on I did have my own authentic legos as well but I just couldn't get what all the hype was about. They started making video games on every other franchise out there and I never touched one and when the news came that these guys were upto making a full length animated Lego movie, I was rolling my eyes. So when it finally released, I thought to give it a shot. Well I couldn't possibly ignore the rave reviews, could I?<br/><br/>From directors, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller who previously gave us the uproarious 21 Jump Street comes Lego Movie. I was in as soon as I heard these two names were attached with the Lego project. You also have to count Cloudy with a Chance of meatballs which was some pure entertainment for kids and adults alike. Lego Movie tells the story of Emmett who's a hapless construction worker, a nobody, who's taken on the ride of his lifetime when he stumbles on an artifact. Joining his adventure is the ravishing Wyldstyle and the wizard Vitruvius and spanning across a wide range of Lego universes. From DC Universe and Star Wars to Lord of The Rings and TMNT and then some more.<br/><br/>Brilliant animation which is actually computer animated but made to look like its stop motion and has been maintained till end. I started searching if there were anything not made out of legos and I was surprised to find none, even the water, fire and smoke was made out of legos (There were of course some 'relics' which was obviously real world things). The 3rd act was what surprised me. And I liked the inclusion of.you know what? I'll let you have that surprise. It might not work for some but I am glad it did for me. And that inclusion made all the difference, it was that stroke of sheer genius that made Lego movie from being good to 'awesome'.<br/><br/>Brilliantly voiced characters enlivens the screen and some big names are attached as well. From Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, to Will Farrel and Elizabeth Banks. You of course get Chris Pratts amazingly voiced lead Emmett and makes the character adorable and endearing. But the real show stealer? Batman. I laughed hard every other gag the Batman was involved, and all thanks to Will Arnett's perfect voice over.<br/><br/>My only qualm about the movie was that it would have been perfect in 2D, the me-too 3D feature kinda trampled the experience to some degree. In the end I am still am not a fan of the toys but I've convinced myself to become a fan of the franchise, both the games and movies. With splendidly written characters, fast paced and humorous narrative, and excellent voice overs, The Lego Movie promises truckloads of fun. It could have all been a 100 minute promotion for Lego, a huge ad for Lego considering the movie has squeezed in everything they could and what results is not a convoluted piece of junk but a good movie which offers true entertainment."

","Well, that was unexpected. When i first found out about this film, I thought it was a cheap cash-in on a popular kids' toy, made specifically to sell more kids' toys. And do you know what? It made me want to go out and do just that.<br/><br/>The film follows Emmett, (Chris Pratt) a construction worker who fits in perfectly with the LEGO world around him - he fits in so well, in fact, that he is never noticed by anyone, until one day he accidentally stumbles upon an ancient artifact, naming him 'The Special.' We then follow Emmett into a web of conspiracy and strange characters such as Wyldstyle, (Elizabeth Banks) Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and Benny (Charlie Day) as he teaches the world to be creative, and with a fantastic third act that will definitely catch some viewers off-guard, and others will see coming a few 2x4 red bricks away.<br/><br/>The pacing is very fast, which is a little annoying for the first 10-20 minutes, but after that you really get into the groove, and it feels awesome. The voicing is also a little quiet against the background music, but i can cope. Morgan Freeman made it all okay.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the better 'kids' films I've seen in the past few months - and not just kids will like it, the parents will love it too. GO. SEE.

This is good genuine comedy and that's definitely hard to come by these days. Especially with legos being in my childhood, this was a killer combo of nostalgia and good laughs. I was constantly being amazed with the fantastic animation and production that this film possessed. Also what a wonderful cast of voices for the characters! It seemed like they all had a blast playing their roles. And what a fantastic job by the writers too. The story line was very much reflective of the society we live in, in America.

","Thus far this is tied with Her as my favourites for 2014. There is a lot to like about this movie especially having seen it in 3D which enhances just how entertaining this is. A obvious comment - this is Lego brought to life! I loved how well thought through this movie was. Whilst it references popular culture both through characters of other stories but also Internet memes such as Batman's capacity to achieve anything. It has aptly timed humour that was refreshingly unexpected. But most of all I really enjoyed how to the story unfolded with the presence of real world items; the end result being an acknowledgement of the creativity found in a child's mind and how adults can inhibit this. Brilliant.<br/><br/>On that note I really appreciated the deeper meaning in this film and how well rounded the message is: creativity shouldn't be limited to those who think freely and originally. Anyone is capable of creativity whether it be complete new, a slight different, or a revised of something already present. But beyond that independent creativity thought should be applauded communal creative thought should be too. As well as creative thought derived from instructions.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 was the last animation film I saw which was explored childhood and what it meanings, including growing up. It was a masterpiece which hasn't been topped. Lego Movie is not as good and is different but what it does share is an equally relevant showcase of experiences children have.<br/><br/>I trust you, like me, walked away from this movie wanting to play with Lego, play Mindcraft or do something creative.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","6","22 February 2014"," Hilarious and endlessly imaginative film for LEGO die-hards and and their parents/kids
","Whatever stigma exists about movies based on toys both in general and in your mind, ""The LEGO Movie"" will dismantle it — brick by glorious brick. The writer/director combo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"" ""21 Jump Street"") prove themselves yet again as masterful comic storytellers with an endless stream of wit and imagination, turning a movie adults were quick to dismiss into one they will be overjoyed to watch with or without children.<br/><br/>The world of ""The LEGO Movie"" is made entirely of LEGO pieces and though it was created using digital animation, contains the photorealism of stop-motion films, which is the first of many spot-on artistic choices Lord and Miller make. Even water, smoke and explosions are all made of bricks. So the way the film looks and operates remains unpredictable throughout the film, keeping the visuals engaging from start to finish.<br/><br/>In terms of the story, Lord and Miller (along with Dan and Kevin Hageman) follow the instructions as far as family films go, but there are plenty of twists and the film's message is both unique and true to the experience of those who love LEGO. Emmet (Chris Pratt), a LEGO construction worker living in Bricksburg, where everything is awesome (as the city's number one hit song goes) because everyone follows the instructions, conforms, works together and is happy all the time. Turns out that's because Lord/President Business (Will Ferrell) wants it that way. Many years before, he stole a weapon called the Kragle from the master builder Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and now he plans to use it as a doomsday device, as it will stick pieces together and keep everything as it should be. When Emmet comes upon the Piece of Resistance, the one thing that can stop the Kragle, he starts to fulfill a prophecy, and with a team of LEGO friends, tries to stop Lord Business.<br/><br/>All eras and styles of LEGO get some spotlight as the adventure grows in scope and imagination. There's the highly skilled action heroine, Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett), Benny the '80s spaceman (Charlie Day), Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and a host of other cameos from the DC Comics universe, ""Harry Potter,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and more. References to Octan, the brand featured on many LEGO products of old, proves just how aware Lord and Miller are of their audience.<br/><br/>But it's the brilliance and hilarity of Emmet that makes ""The LEGO Movie"" work so well in terms of the story. The childlike wonder that launched Pratt's career on ""Parks and Recreation"" plays perfectly into the movie's humor. He's a constant laugh reel and a strong main character; his ineptitude is the butt of the other characters' jokes, making him the unlikely hero who has to prove everyone wrong.<br/><br/>Perhaps not so coincidentally, Ferrell is also perfect casting as the dastardly President Business. Both he and Pratt have that man-child silliness in their comedy, and let's face it — LEGO fans are quite often man-children. This is something the film never loses sight of, as an unusual reveal late into the film puts LEGO within a context that its fans will truly appreciate.<br/><br/>The reason the Danish building blocks have been around so long is their ability to capture imagination, and that's the primary thing ""The LEGO Movie"" does so well. The characters are constantly building new eye-popping creations to problem-solve their way through the conflict. Although the film is hilarious, so much of the humor comes from its creativity. There are even clever uses of non-LEGO items that play major roles throughout the film. <br/><br/>Audiences who fell in love with Disney's ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" which takes place in the world of video games, will find ""The LEGO Movie"" to be a kindred spirit. So many different styles and genres converge in a diverse cinematic landscape fueled by the endless creative minds of animators and filmmakers. Both also take time to build emotion connections, not just creative worlds. ""The LEGO Movie"" will really speak to people who have spent countless hours building with LEGO, but its message will resonate with all ages and LEGO ""experience"" levels. In other words, Lord, Miller, the Hagemans and the entire creative team have dug down to find what makes LEGO a universally beloved brand and brought out the best of it in a wildly funny, creative and meaningful story.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","There is a major third-act twist in this movie <br/><br/>****SPOILERS****<br/><br/>in which it is revealed that 95% of the movie's running time takes place within one ten-year-old kid's imagination. I have no trouble believing that. In fact, the best way I can describe The Lego Movie is that it is exactly like being inside the imagination of a child. <br/><br/>This movie is teeming with life in every frame. Colorful characters, insane shifts in scenery, and one wild idea after the next. It frequently throws so much STUFF at us that it becomes overwhelming, and honestly the movie would be kind of a mess if it weren't so charmingly executed. We can forgive its excesses because we're actually invested in the story, we care about the characters, and the movie is constantly amusing us with smart jokes and delightful visuals. Each role is well-played. Everyone will come out with a different favorite character: my favorite was the 1980's spaceman played by Charlie Day.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, we find out in the last ten minutes that this is actually the story of an inventive son and his overly controlling father. It's a nice twist and I like the introduction of reality into the story, but it does confuse the overall message: is the movie about believing in yourself no matter what, or is it about having freedom to build what you want with your life, or -- even more confusingly -- are we actually supposed to follow the instructions? Or is it about learning to let go of control? There are a lot of ideas going on in this story, and like I said, it's like watching the imagination of a child: scattered, free-wheeling, painting on a huge canvas, fuzzy on the details. <br/><br/>There are so many cameos that we can't feel the punch of most of them (though Jonah Hill had a great role as the Green Lantern to Channing Tatum's Superman.) But most of the material lands anyway, and you can't help but enjoy yourself while watching it. I have to throw this in there too: what was so wrong with Batman that Wildstyle left him? He seemed like a decent guy, honestly. Everybody was just OK with that whole switch, and it felt wrong to me.<br/><br/>Overall though, this movie is quite creative, BUILDS well on its concept (couldn't resist) and is constantly fun to watch. If you have kids, I guarantee you they'll love it."

","I have always hated the term ""Hollywood has run out of ideas"".

""I was actually surprised by The Lego Movie"" and I'll explain why.<br/><br/>The film takes places in a world made out of Lego filled with many mini figures. In the big city, a normal construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) lives in an average every day normal life following the instructions to a good life. One day though, he accidentally stumbles across the legendary Piece of Resistance, one of the elements of a prophecy that would be used to take down the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). He then is thrown into a giant war after he is rescued from custody by Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who he accidentally believes to be the prophecy's chosen one. Traveling through many worlds in the Lego universe, its up to Emmet, Wildstyle, the prophesier Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and even Batman (Will Arnett) to defeat Lord Business and his lieutenant Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) before they unleash the ultimate weapon to destroy the world, the Kragle (which is really krazy glue with a worn out label). I can't say anymore, you just have to see it.<br/><br/>The strength in this film is definitely the writing. Both Phil Lord and Chris Miller clearly understood the fun of Legos and were able to craft up a world with original characters and comedy that even pokes fun of clichés seen in the past. One notable example is the villain telling his minions to cue his dramatic entrance using smoke and a door slamming open. Writing like this is what makes ""The Lego Movie"" stand out. The animation is fantastic. What really surprised me about it was the fact that it was actually not stop motion like I initially thought, but computer animation. The film was animated by Animal Logic, the company that crafted the realistic movies like ""Happy Feet"" and ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"". The fact that they went from making animals looking very lifelike to simple toys is a pretty big leap and an impressive leap at that. The characters were a whole bunch of fun. Each had at least one to funny line to say, and had at least one unique trait to make them stand out. They also were perfectly cast as well. Chris Pratt brought a real lovable presence to Emmet while Will Arnett cracked me up with his cocky and s egotistical performance as Batman. Will Ferrell even channeled his early performance of ""Megamind"" in his performance of Lord Business. If I had one problem with the movie and it's pretty much a nitpick is some of the humor was a little off. Most of it hit the mark, but some I just didn't catch or it was funny. However, it's really a nitpick.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is probably one of the most surprising movies I have seen. With a funny story, fantastic animation and memorable characters, I was left in a very happy mood, something I never thought I would say about ""The Lego Movie"". I hope that movie studios will take notes on how to make movies based on properties really good, because this movie set the bar very high which can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing. I think that it's a good thing."
"Brazilian_Pharaoh","9","1","2","26 May 2017"," A must see animation
","What happens when you mix parody and product placement for a toy brand into one film? you get yourself The Lego Movie, one of the greatest animations of the 2010's. Plus there is also the great voice acting specially from Liam Neeson who plays bad cop/good cop. The film follows the history of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary and generic lego construction worker who found the Piece of Resistance and is prophesied to be the ""Special One"", the hero who will save the universe from lord Business (voiced by Will Farrel). As I said this movie is a parody of chosen one histories where Emmet is ""the most interesting, important and talented person of the world"" but when he is just a generic lego toy. The irony about this film is that it somewhat criticizes capitalism (the monopoly of big companies , being alienated by these companies, etc.) but it's one of the biggest product placement of all time to be presented in a movie."
"andrewnmiller","10","1","2","23 May 2017"," One of the most creative and refreshing movies of the decade.
","When I first saw the trailers for the Lego Movie, I scoffed at it, thinking that it would be nothing more than a gigantic toy commercial for Legos, but much to my surprise, when I sat down to watch it earlier this year, what I got was a thoroughly creative and fun movie that seemed to resonate more with adults than with kids.<br/><br/>In a world populated by Lego figurines, the malicious Lord Business discovers a weapon known as the ""Kragle"", but the wizard Vitruvius tries to stop him only to be left vision-less by Business's robots; he foretells of a being called ""the Special"" will acquire a block known as the Piece of Resistance and stop the Kragle. Some years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brockowski encounters a woman named Wyldstyle at his job and while trying to follow her, falls into a pit and locates the Piece of Resistance, proceeds to touch it then wakes up with the piece fixed to his back, in the captivity of Bad Cop. Wyldstyle then saves Emmett, certain that he is the Special, takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Now, Emmett, Wyldstyle and the rest of the master builder community must untie in order to stop Lord Business from executing his plans.<br/><br/>Given that the story does follow the Matrix in a lot of ways, it would seem like it would be retreading the plot of the 99' movie a bit too much, yet when you see the Lego world, everything in it feels original and hot off the press, something I wish more kids movies would do rather than rehash the same ideas over and over again and it seems that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the two guys who gave us ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and the Jump Street films, and the writers really knocked out of the ballpark with this one.<br/><br/>When it comes to the animation, The Lego Movie has some of the best seen in the last few years and is great enough to rival Disney or Pixar. Not only does it have the look of a beginners stop-motion movie with a high budget, but the magnitude of the detail and the imagination put into the animation is nothing short of amazing rather than just using some cheap CGI. At some points throughout the movie, there's simply so much going on that it's pushing overwhelming limits, yet if one is a careful observer, they might see that every single little item from the people to the sky are built in Lego pieces. The numerous ways the Lego world moves, crumbles, is built again, crumbles apart and changes is just a delight to see. The usage of items from the real world being used in the Lego universe is guaranteed to get a massive chuckle out of anyone watching the film, and the aftereffect is a movie that looks so unlike any other movie we've seen before.<br/><br/>The script is a non-stop thrill ride of one sidesplitting gag after another not to mention the jokes often come at you so quickly that it's impossible to get them all the first time you watch the movie, and blink and you'll-overlook-it quips that litter the screen. No joke ever seems to overstay it's welcome or is overdone or overstated with some of the best jokes come from Emmett and well as from other characters throughout the film. One thing that the movies so expertly well is how it pokes fun at the whole prophecy story line that has been such a mainstay in big Hollywood movies and the way that they handle it is both hilarious and yet feels new. There are also quite a few pop culture references ranging from Star Wars to The Terminator and The Dark Knight sprinkled thought-out the movie too.<br/><br/>The characters of the Lego Movie are a lot of fun to watch and the assemble cast is one of the best in an animated film since Toy Story: Chris Pratt is the prefect choice for Emmett, playing the eager and innocent sides of the character with ease, manages to be in incredibly funny often getting some of the movie's best jokes and also shows quite a lot of character growth as he learns how to think for himself rather then conform. While I'm not a big fan of Elizabeth Banks, she is awesome in this movie as Wyldstyle, hurling out plenty of sharp quips and kicking ass when she needs to, but she is also so much more than that by being more of a symbol of individually which is an interesting take on a female lead in this kind of movie and certainly better than having her hook up with Emmitt at the end. Morgan Freeman is always excellent is anything he's in and here, he brings the same wise-man vigor as Vitruvius while almost making fun of the other mentor roles he's played in other movies and is truly a delight to watch. Will Ferrell is completely devilish and threatening as Lord Business and yet is a complete laugh riot, channeling his Mugatu character from Zoolander with ease. Charlie Day is a joy as the Lego spaceman Benny, Nick Offerman is great as Metalbeard, Alison Brie is enchanting as Unikitty, Liam Neeson is down right hilarious as Good Cop/Bad Cop, but it's Will Arnett as Batman who steals the movie as there are simply too many times in the movie where he has a line of dialog that makes every intentional funny scene even more laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>I really don't have any negative things to say about the Lego movie, it's just superb with great characters, top-notch animation and voice acting, wonderful jokes, and one hell of a catchy song. Definitely a movie worth checking out."
"brchthethird","7","1","2","14 November 2014"," Fun for adults and kids alike, but it still hammers the audience over the head with its message
","THE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather poignant film that will appeal to kids and adults. The story is about a nondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally happens upon a mythical ""Piece of Resistance."" Aided by the Master Builders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by Lord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes its way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was aware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and audiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The story is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for most of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and pop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did make me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman, Superman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble voice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord Business), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were practically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn which I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The end makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't quite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those things is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam. In the end, it is something that both kids and adults can get enjoyment out of, even if it's more fluff than substance"
"stephenlovelette","7","1","2","28 June 2014"," It's only 'Very Good.'
","I don't like to brag but...<br/><br/>I'm a bit of an animation aficionado.<br/><br/>2013 was a spectacular year for animated films.<br/><br/>Shame on Oscar and the Globes for not nominating all five of these: Frozen, The Croods, Monsters University, Turbo and Despicable Me 2.<br/><br/>But, smart as it is, The Lego Movie falls short of this pantheon.<br/><br/>I enjoy TLM (although I don't appreciate the title), and you probably will too. Perhaps a bit more than I did.<br/><br/>For all the fun character cameos, the original smart writing and Lego fight fireworks; the pacing slackens in the middle.<br/><br/>It's a good family movie that's mildly humorous, with the creative cuts and camera transitions that come along with animation. The style's laid on thick, but it works, and the story is a good one.<br/><br/>Lego's got a solid voice cast to back it up, lead by Chris Pratt, and my girl, Elizabeth Banks.<br/><br/>But seriously, the fights are sick, and there's a lot of death in this film (if you think about it.) I know that sounds creepy, but I'd argue it's imperative to an animated film nowadays. Otherwise how's an adult audience going to feel there's anything at stake?<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't want to see any spoilers, cease reading now.<br/><br/>Here's my existential quandary: I simply don't know how to properly review a film like this. The effort and correct ingredients went into the movie-making cauldron and all that came out was a less than spectacular film.<br/><br/>My major problem with it is the pacing. It slows down immensely, once the cloud world is destroyed and they escape in a submarine. They hit the water and I'm wondering how many minutes remain.<br/><br/>As I said before, the humor is mild at best. There are a couple good laughs, but there are also some jokes that fall flat.<br/><br/>One of the funnier parts of the movie is the relationship between Superman and Green Lantern, voiced by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. These two are becoming quite the comedic team.<br/><br/>Will Arnett as Batman is also very funny.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, as the prophet Vitruvius, is one of my favorite parts. Not only is he particularly chucklesome, but his character distorts the structure of traditional narrative storytelling. For example, he 'makes up' the prophecy.<br/><br/>I read Harrison Ford was too busy to record the lines for Lego Han Solo, but they managed to get Billy Dee Williams (as Lando Calrissian) and Anthony Daniels (as C-3PO). I hate to be overly critical, but I'm pretty sure it takes two hours in a recording studio for small voice parts like Lego Han Solo's.<br/><br/>Harrison, what gives buddy?<br/><br/>And finally, how could I forget Liam Neeson? He did two separate voices as Good Cop/Bad Cop. I like that Liam fellow, he's got talent.<br/><br/>Now, there are two parts of this movie that are particularly smart. The reveal of the live action context (in which the Lego universe exists) rounds off the ending in a more than satisfactory way. I'll add this is the second time that Will Ferrell's physical appearance is revealed in a movie (the first is Wedding Crashers.)<br/><br/>Themes like conformity and creativity, the imaginary and concrete, physical skill and intellectual knowledge, etc. resound throughout the film.<br/><br/>The basic point of The Lego Movie is that life can work both ways. You can follow every instruction manual to the letter, or be the total opposite, a complete freethinker who just powers ahead and doesn't get caught up in the minutia of perfectionism. Life will probably work out regardless, but perhaps we shouldn't grow too rigid, and remained shackled (or 'Kragled') to our own ways of navigating the world.<br/><br/>I like The Lego Movie.<br/><br/>I just wish the pacing and humor could keep up with the storytelling."

","I'm not sure whether it is good or bad, but there were no kids at all in the theater when I watched the Lego movie - It was the last screening of the day and there weren't too many adults around either. I saw the 2d version of the film, but suspect the visuals may have been even more impressive in 3d. <br/><br/>The Lego movie tells the story of Emmet who is a very ordinary lego figure mistaken for the chosen one who will save lego. He has to escape the attentions of the evil Lord Business who wants to end the universe and the good cop/bad cop who is tasked with finding him by Lord Business. He is helped along the way by Wyldstyle who recognises that he is the chosen one. <br/><br/>The movie is fast paced with loads of action and cameos by numerous faces from popular culture. I will not spoil the surprise by listing these, but the film is great fun from start to finish. I suspect the humour will appeal more to adults than children, but don;t have anything to back up this gut feel. Good fun!!"

The colors, the animation, the sheer effort is just incredible. I'm really happy the visuals were always interesting, because everything else was pretty boring for me.<br/><br/>The humor was seriously lacking.

"imdbtruth","1","6","31","13 December 2014"," One of the most SATANIC movies I've ever seen ! !
","On the surface, I thought the movie was pretty good for an animated movie aimed at children. But the real story being told, made my blood boil!<br/><br/>I can not believe that nobody else is seeing this! Immediately after viewing this movie, I went online and searched ""Lego Satanic"", expecting to find hundreds of reviews and articles pointing out the underlying satanic symbolism, but I found nothing. To me, the symbolism was very in your face, so I was shocked to see Christian websites endorsing this movie.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I actually watched the movie, so I have forgotten some things regarding the overall symbolism, but the nuts and bolts of it are pretty obvious. Here goes...<br/><br/>First, the movie takes place in the Book of Revelation, at the biblical apocalypse, or the ""end of the world"" if you prefer... <br/><br/>The ""Dad"", or as the movie itself refers to him ""the man upstairs"", is played by the doofus Will Ferrell, who you'll note also plays the part of ""Lord Business""... The Dad in the movie represents God, they have no respect for God, which is why he is played by the idiot Ferrell. Also note that the Dad is the bad guy, he only wants everyone to look perfect, he wants to glue us in place, and not let us have any fun...<br/><br/>Which is also why he plays the part of ""Lord Business"", who is supposed to represent Jesus Christ. Ferrell playing both parts is also to mock the Holy Trinity. Note that Lord Business has his office way up in the sky, also note that he is just a lego character, this represents the directors belief that though Jesus is exalted up to the heavens (like his office), he was still just a man.<br/><br/>By now you can probably guess that the ""Instruction Book"", represents the Holy Bible.<br/><br/>So who is Emmet? Emmet represents the Antichrist... In the movie, Emmet always follows the book before being led astray by Vitruvius. This reflects the filmmakers belief that the Anti-Christ will be a man who was formerly a devout Christian, possibly even clergy. <br/><br/>Emmet was also led astray by ""Wild-Style"", who most likely represents the symbolic ""Whore of Babylon"".<br/><br/>""Vitruvius"" the ""prophet / wizard"" with glowing eyes of course represents the false prophet of the bible. The name ""Vitruvius"" is also a big clue that the movie was made by a Freemason, as he is idolized within their cult. Vitruvius also represents Freemasonry in the movie, and their suggested role in the end times, which is cultivating the Antichrist. (Marcus Vitruvius Pollio born c.80–70 BC, died after c. 15 BC, was a Roman author, architect, and civil engineer during the 1st century BC, known for his multi-volume work entitled De Architectura.)<br/><br/>And of course the ""Son"" in the movie, who rebels against his father's orders and starts making changes, he represents Lucifer (aka Satan).<br/><br/>""Taco Tuesday"" is the rapture. The ""glue"" represents being bound by the ""rules"" of the Bible, and all who are raptured on ""Taco Tuesday"" will be forever stuck. Being ""glued"" on""Taco Tuesday"" represents how when a soul is taken by Jesus, all sin is removed, and there is no longer any desire for evil or worldliness. Mind, body, and soul are returned to the state that God intended prior to Lucifer introducing sin to humanity. This is seen as a bad thing by Luciferians like the Freemason cult. Their dogma is the same regarding creation (Genesis). It is their view that Lucifer was the ""good guy"" in the Garden of Eden, that Satan set humanity free from the bondage placed on us by the cruel God of the Bible (YHWH).<br/><br/>The end of the movie is the wishful thinking of a high-ranking Freemason. The ""Dad"" (God), doesn't punish the ""son"" (Satan) for disobeying him, instead he decides that the ""son"" is right, and maybe ""change"" (sin), isn't such a bad thing. Hogwash, Satan is going to hell, and so will anybody that doesn't know Jesus! This movie is the basic dogma of Freemasonry, as told by Albert Pike. Also the dogma of the ""New Age"", as told by Alice Bailey. And the dogma of ""theosophy"" and ""kabbalism"", as told by HP Blavatsky. That's the truth!<br/><br/>The owner of the Lego Company and the richest man in Denmark, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, is commonly known to be a member in the most elite Masonic order in Denmark, the Dannebrog Order, which is reserved almost exclusively for royalty. The directing team of Lord and Miller are either high-ranking members of the Freemasonry cult, or they're Kabbalists. Either way, they're obviously Luciferians. <br/><br/>The sorrows have only just begun......... Jesus shall bring his sword!"
"Rickting","10","2","7","21 November 2014"," Everything is awesome!
","Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie. Everything. Genuinely everything. Every single little thing is awesome. The ultimate product placement movie instead becomes the ultimate 2014 blockbuster, as a likable but unremarkable construction Lego mini figure tries to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. The only 2014 movie I have seen more than once at the time of writing, TLM held up remarkably well. Some may find it annoying possibly, but for most you'll have to remove that grin from your face with a crowbar. It looks great and could have been stop motion Lego. The CGI is barely noticeable. It's also got an astonishingly good cast all giving fine performances. Even Morgan Freeman is in there. The action, humour and emotion is all spot on. The film is full of white knuckle action, gut bursting jokes and surprisingly thoughtful story lines which make it overall a very entertaining and rich animated offering for everyone. You don't even have to like Lego.<br/><br/>The key to movie success is the script. The script is brilliantly written here and absolutely crackles with wit and charm. It's also got some very thrilling moments and pop culture references galore. It's surely one of the funniest movies of the year and although the jokes are simple they're always devastatingly effective. The characters are very diverse and likable as well, and enhance the film's likability factor which is already off the scale. As it has some very nice messages in there too, it's a surprisingly touching film and the ending is unpredictable and moving. Another key element of the film's success is creating a compelling fictional universe for the film which is full of entertaining details. As for the Everything Is Awesome song, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. TLM is a great blockbuster overall which should have been terrible but is instead a total knockout. Outshining everything DreamWorks has ever done by a mile this might be the most fun you have at the movies in 2014.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I just saw this movie for the second time and it was still hilarious. I still laughed at all the jokes. Actually, there are so many jokes, you are laughing so much, you miss half of them. So I was able to hear a lot of jokes I did hear before. It's also one of the most colorful just neat looking movies I've ever seen. Amazing animation and everything is Lego and I mean everything from the ocean to smoke. I can imagine warehouses of Legos needed to make this movie. It just had incredibly witty clever script and I like the message is delivered. Know when to use your imagination and when to follow the rules and finding a common ground between the two. The old plane Legos vs. the new Legos with instructions. Emit is a construction worker who just wants to be accepted. He accidentally becomes ""The Special"" and is tasked to save the word. Timeless reluctant under-dog hero story like The Matrix and almost every super hero movie. See this movie and later buy the Blue Ray because I bet there will be some neat extras and I can't wait to see them."
"jhigginbotham151","9","2","7","3 May 2014"," The Lego Movie Is Awesome!
","The Lego Movie is so much fun. Anyone who grew up building things out of legos, you will love this. The film is exactly what its like when you play with legos as a kid, you put the batman in with the construction set and star wars into Gotham City, you went crazy and put everything into your own little world of awesome. Then of course, there's the kid who always tried to have everything in order, everything in its place and have everything be... not awesome.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie captures all of the same feelings from your childhood and bundles in up in to a very enjoyable, easily digested 100 minutes. Emmet is the main character and hero of the story, he's a very relatable character in the sense that he's upbeat about everything, even though his life is stale and he blends in with everyone else. This makes him a good role model for kids (always be yourself and always try and stand out from the crowd) and makes him an interesting character to root for. Lucy is the hipster-like love interest for Emmet and she brings some girl power into the film that gives the girls someone to relate to as well. Batman and the other characters are all there to give the story its grand scope and also to provide some of the funniest moments in the whole film. Its also nice to see that it doesn't feel that only characters the filmmakers could get the rights too are included, it really does feel like any lego character you could think of is there in the film.<br/><br/>The film also has some astonishingly clever social commentary and pop culture references for what is primarily a kids film. The films main theme song 'Everything Is Awesome' is a parody of today's modern pop radio and is considered by Lucy to be a song only people who blend in listen to. However, Lucy then goes on to say that Batmans emo,screamo- like song is what 'real music' is. Its a loving little nudge at what we as a society deem as popular and unpopular, what's real entertainment and what isn't. References practically seem to write themselves here, given the amount of characters they included, although my favorite has to be Green Lantern being a massive fanboy of Superman. <br/><br/>The animation looks so close to the same stop motion animation you would see on YouTube, giving it a very real, homemade feeling, but of course with a much bigger budget and it does look very nice. Water, fire and everything else are rendered in its lego format and props to the animators because everything on screen is CG. Then there's one scene which I was so happy to see include, I wont spoil it but it's the scene that summed up the entire film for me.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lego Movie is a superb film for all ages. Its bright, funny and inspiring for the kids and has enough under the hood to make it enjoyable for adults as well."

","The LEGO movie is nothing short of a delight to watch from start to finish. It's an example of a great idea for a film executed extraordinarily with great animation, hilarious writing and cameo after cameo after cameo.<br/><br/>The story follows as a random builder who is believed to be the special who is needed to take down Lord Business and bring freedom to the world once more. The story reflects how LEGO is always played. You'll have those who want to make everything their way and then you'll have those who just want to have fun and build in the world of LEGO. The story really goes to show this adding some really interesting drama alongside the comedy that you'll be able to relate to no matter how old you are.<br/><br/>The animation is just the right style mixing both stop motion with a lot of computer animation giving the film not only a distinct look but also well suited for the Lego franchise reminding me a little of the old Lego Star Wars games and how they move so quickly and comedic. Besides that it also creates some great designs that will make you feel like a kid again with the beautiful worlds ranging from the wild west to an epic space adventure, something which Lego is all so perfect to do.<br/><br/>Then there's the main thing that separates this film apart from just about every other film in that it gratifies our fantasies by having some of the greatest characters come together. We get to see Superman, Michaelangelo, Batman, Abe Lincoln and so many more random brilliant characters on screen together. There are so many great cameo characters in this film that it makes Wreck it Ralph seem like a generic reference. So many cameos within the film keep you entertained non stop, with each one more entertaining than the last. The only fault with them being that you love them so much that you want to see even more, but when the only fault is that you want more of what's there, that's no real fault.<br/><br/>The best way to phrase it is that it's an incredible idea that has been executed brilliantly. The premise is a tough one to pull off right, but clearly it's been done right here creating one of the funniest, most heart warming and fantastic animated films with a style that stands out and separates it from all the other animation franchises. They've already announced a sequel and I am already looking forward to seeing it."

The Lego Movie is the perfect blend of kids, adult, and nostalgic entertainment that will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen regardless of age. Whether it's the fun, joyful sounds and colors and visual jokes that will make the kids happy, or all the fun subtle pop culture and nostalgic jabs that will entertain adults, there is something for anyone involved. The animation was astounding and easily has some of the best meticulous visuals since Ratatouille.<br/><br/>The best kinds of stories for animated movies are those that start out simple for the tykes, but secretly contain layers of content for the more established minds. This is what made your earlier Pixar movies so appealing for a vast audience; it never talks down to the viewer but doesn't overwhelm the kiddies. In The Lego Movie, what starts out as a simple tale about a prophesy defeating a tyrannical villain from taking over the environment morphs into a beautiful story about finding your voice and being original.<br/><br/>Like previously stated, all aspects of this movie work. The voice acting was phenomenal, especially Elizabeth Banks as the lead female, Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman (he does a better Batman than Christian Bale—seriously). The musical score was on-point, the humor and action run plentiful, and there's plenty of heart and soul that will tug the heartstrings. Just wait until you arrive at the final act. Unlike practically every movie nowadays, you won't see it coming.<br/><br/>It might be hard to believe that a movie with serious marketing and product placement implications becomes the best around since this past summer with Before Midnight. It might be even harder to believe that Warner Brothers has managed to surpass the usual suspects of Pixar (notice all the movies I've referenced in the review) and Dreamworks at their very own game. Nonetheless, this shocker of a gem is the perfect family cinematic package. From top to bottom The Lego Movie delivers. If this isn't one of the best films of 2014, then we are in for a spectacular year of cinema because this movie is seriously a work of kinetic brilliance.<br/><br/>Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are."

","I have heard it many times, and said so myself; ""it's all in the execution."" Well, most of times. This is a rare case where a great idea meets AMAZING execution. And no, I am not talking about the animation. I am talking about writing, directing, and dialogue.<br/><br/>You probably seen the trailer. You know the premise: an ordinary ______ will have to become extraordinary and become ZE HERO. How many times have we seen that? More than zero. But what the first impression will not tell you is where the story goes from that basic premise. The theme used the premise as a springboard to dive into the luxurious pool of writing, filled with Swiss chocolate of dialogue.<br/><br/>Not saying this movie is for everyone; no matter how good something is, you may not like the genre or art style.

","I went into The Lego Movie with eager expectations. It had the Lego brand. I expected humor, wit, and striking animation. What I didn't expect was how well executed and surprising it would actually be in all departments; the Lego movie truly knocked my socks off. Not only does it cater to the target audience, it pleases adults as well with its beautiful animation, solid voice cast and array of obnoxious humor. The storyline is engaging and its characters pop off the screen (literally) with emotion and spunk. If that's not enough, there are plenty of surprises throughout that are sure to keep you happy.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt voices Emmet; an ordinary construction working Lego minifigure that goes by everyday in his life thinking ""everything is awesome"" when in reality it is not. Little does he know he is actually part of something much bigger than himself, and Lord Business (Will Ferrell) is here to destroy it all. Emmet's adventure to become a Masterbuilder picks up quickly and we're thrown into the fray with memorable supporting characters such as the mysterious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Batman himself (Will Arnett.) While the same generic 'PG' formula is present, the humor flies at you as fast as the plastic lasers on the screen, and the action sequences are drawn out to epic proportions that mimic Transformers. Lord Business reminds me of a classic Disney villain with his overbearing confidence and shiny robot minions, and there is an eye opening 'twist' at the end that even your parents won't see coming.<br/><br/>The Lego movie isn't a completely original film; it's based off of a toy line that has been around since the seventies. But the Lego movie is about as creative as it gets with what it has to offer; and that's the point, right? Legos are meant to be used to create and build. If you don't want to get that deep, all you have to know is the Lego movie is nothing but a good time and in my opinion, the best animated film to be released since Wreck it Ralph. (Sorry Frozen!)"

","""The Lego Movie"" is an animated adventure/comedy film that tells the story of Emmet, an ordinary LEGO minifigure thought to be the long-awaited ""Special"" that is supposed to save the entire LEGO universe from the evil plans of Lord Business. Emmet is recruited by the Master Builders to bring peace to the world by using the ""Piece of Resistance"" and some creativity.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and features the voices of Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. The original screenplay is written by Lord and Miller.<br/><br/>Directors Lord and Miller made an excellent job in the direction of the movie by replicating what playing with LEGO's feels like, capturing the essence of imagination and bringing it to life in a very creative and unique way through the movie. Lord and Miller made an awesome job in the script too, by creating an original story full of comedic moments and pop-culture references that has as well a heart and sends a message, that if you believe in yourself, work as a team and have a little creativity, you can do everything. Everything is possible, and awesome.<br/><br/>The live-action part of the film was very well connected with the animated part. It was really great how the filmmakers managed to relate the relationship of Emmet and Lord Business with the relationship of Finn and his father, ""The Man Upstairs"". The cameos by familiar figures from licensed LEGO franchises, pop-culture and history that range from Batman, Han Solo and Dumbledore to Shakespeare, Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neil are very well received, seeing them in LEGO form was awesome.<br/><br/>The cast did a great job in voicing the characters, each member of the cast added a little of their personality to their respective character. Animal Logic, the studio in charge of the animation, did an awesome job too. The studio tried to replicate the feel of stop-motion films and they achieved it in a way that's both funny and charming.<br/><br/>All this elements make ""The Lego Movie"" a great film that provides lots of fun for the whole family, and like the movie's main song says, ""Everything Is Awesome!!!"""

","When I first saw the trailer for The Lego Movie, I thought that it would be one of the greatest ideas for a film. Sure, it sounds like a cash grab, but I definitely was hoping it would be something special, although I never really thought it would be. Then the reviews came, and my expectations were high. All in all, this is a wildly glorious ride. The thrill are non-stop, the dialogue is endlessly funny and witty, the animation wonderful. The voice performances are also really, each of these actors providing something different to their voices and making such a great ensemble of characters.

Innovative animation mixing stop-motion and CGI (where it stops and starts I don't know, that's the charm and wonder of the technique, like Robot Chicken if it had a budget, which one of the guys who does the show worked on the film so that makes sense), and almost non-stop comedy - even when it's not all huge laugh-out-loud laughs, there's endless cleverness but always with a goofy wink and slapstick. It's the Looney Tunes for our times. The ending isn't perfect - the message of everyone being ""special"" I think gets muddled with ""everyone be creative"", which aren't the same things though the directors try for both ways. But that's a nit-pick really; this is on the level of popular-innovative entertainment as Toy Story."
"moviexclusive","Null","2","8","8 February 2014"," The movie tells an awesomely heartfelt story, and is awesomely perfect for both adults and kids
","If there was a postage system that can send letters to the past, this writer would pen a letter to his younger self - say, to the primary school kid he knew 25 years ago. And this is how the letter would read.<br/><br/>Dear John (from the past),<br/><br/>This is your future self writing to you. It's the year 2014 and much has changed. The Internet is amazingly fast, and almost everyone I see on the street is busy looking at some sort of electronic gadget. Most importantly, I have seen The Lego Movie, and this is the reason why I feel the need to tell you about it.<br/><br/>The 100 minute directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller is one you had dreamed of ever since you owned your first Lego construction set. That toy wasn't an elaborate castle of city set, but it sure brought you endless wondrous hours of imaginative fun. The police car (and the minifigure that comes with it) was a reward for your spelling test, and boy, was it a reward well earned.<br/><br/>Ever since then, you'd imagine an entire movie starring Lego minifigures, embarking on adventures in the different Lego backdrops. I have seen that movies 30 years on, and here are five reasons why I think you should look forward to it every single day of your life – till you're 33.<br/><br/>Reason 1: The movie is a fine example of good ol' storytelling. The protagonist is an ordinary Lego minifigure (yup, one of those yellow faced common folks you'd lose if you had a humongous city set) who mistakenly gets recruited to stop an evil tyrant from destroying the Lego universe. The story by Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, and the two directors is encouraging, inspiring and a feel good tale about how every individual has the potential to go a long way. Trust me, you may hear a lot about this in school now, but some 20 years on, the cynicism of the world will get to you. The plot of this movie, however, will steer you in the right direction to do good things about your life.<br/><br/>Reason 2: The movie is hilariously clever. The jokes are fast and furious, and while you may not understand the puns spouted by the minifigures now (if the movie was playing in 1989), it would make your teacher chuckle. Clever references to pop culture and the Lego brand are aplenty, and it is one movie you'd want to revisit repeatedly.<br/><br/>Reason 3: The movie is a technical achievement. I'm not sure whether you're familiar with the concept of stop motion, but go ask your teacher and you will be amazed by the amount of work needed to produce a stop motion clip. This movie infuses computer technology (I won't go into details of how scarily advanced this has become in 2014) with stop motion and the end result is an enjoyable visual treat.<br/><br/>Reason 4: The movie is chockfull of cameo appearances. As the years go by, you'd hear how everyone wants to see Superman and Batman in the same movie. This animated feature is the first to make that happen. On top of that, other well known characters appear as well. The names probably won't make sense to you now, but when you grow older, you'll understand why certain wizards from a popular movie franchise are a big deal. Oh, there are also characters from a certain galaxy far, far away; and a fellow yellow faced personality who make this movie a must watch for all nerds and geeks (I meant that in a cool way, of course).<br/><br/>Reason 5: The movie has got heart, lots of it. Some movies may be too obsessed with showing off its technical prowess, and forget about how it touches the human soul. This one is different. The revelation is one affecting turn of events, and trust me, it's one of the most relevant and heartfelt plots you'd ever see. <br/><br/>Before signing off, my advice to you is to hang on to that Lego police car set, continue to let your imagination take you to places, and all things will be good.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>John (from the future)"
"stephenabell","4","1","3","22 June 2017"," All Pretty Hype - No Substance.
","This is an atrociously boringly unfunny and predictable movie, though it's beautifully shot. All the faults lie with writers and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.<br/><br/>The synopsis of the movie is pretty decent and should have resulted in a good movie. A regular Lego construction worker, Emmet, finds out that he's the master builder of an ancient prophecy that states he'll save the world from the craggle and Lord Business.<br/><br/>Where the story falls short is the overused and clichéd jokes and characters and they were telegraphed so early you knew they were coming. For example, Emmet has only had one original design idea - a double- decker sofa; so when asked to build something when they are trying to escape from Bad-Cop and his minions, he builds (you guessed it) his double-decker sofa while everybody else builds the submarine; then when the sub is destroyed by Bad-Cop guess what survives... yep, you're right the sofa. I was groaning and shaking my head. All too predictable.<br/><br/>Next major fault is the direction, there are lots of scenes that are dragged out too long, in particular, the scene where Bad-Cop / Good-Cop (which was a very inventive idea) is interrogating Emmet. Bad-Cop gets angry and goes mental and kicks a chair around the room. It's not that funny a scene and it becomes boring quite quickly as the directors stretch the sequence out and actually diminishes the scene.<br/><br/>Another thing the films suffers with is the vocal talents. With the exception of Will Arnet as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, and Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, the rest of the voices just don't quite fit their character. I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell though I have to admit he's not too bad here as he reigns in some of his outlandishness. However, he should have been more intimidating, mean, and menacingly voiced for his character of Lord Business. I felt embarrassed for Morgan Freeman as he sounded tired, for the most part, in his rendition of Vitruvius. Then there was the grating and annoying tones of Unikitty, played by Amanda Brie, who had me reaching for the remote and the off button. I did like the way that they incorporated original voices into the cast as C3P0 was voiced by Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando - shame they couldn't do it with the rest of the ""Known"" cast.<br/><br/>The only good thing this film had going for it was the Lego itself and it's CGI generation. Had the rest of the film been as good these scenes it would have been a masterpiece of filmmaking. However special effects cannot carry a film alone.<br/><br/>To be honest I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. There are a lot of much better kids films out there... So go treat yourself and watch one of them. I wouldn't even push this for the Batman element, even though he's one of the main good elements he's still not enough... and he even starts to wear thin as the movie progresses... I'm now a little worried for The Lego Batman Movie."

","Originally, I was expecting this movie to suck, because of the Lego TV shows on Cartoon Network, or maybe it's also because of the straight to video Lego movies, but it didn't suck. It was an absolutely hilarious and awesome movie. They actually poke fun at the clichés, and it works perfectly. It has now also became of my favorite franchises ever. I have always liked the character Emmet after watching this movie, because he's pretty much just like me. I wasn't very creative when it comes to building Legos, and was always following the instructions. Batman was awesome in this movie as well. I have even seen the Lego Batman Movie recently last month, and it too was awesome. I hope the same thing will happen to the Lego Ninjago Movie six more months later. Now, THIS movie feels like if it was influenced by Yellow Submarine. I know this movie was actually inspired by stop-motion Lego brickfilms, but this movie also feels like Yellow Submarine. And yes, Legos are made to move like stop-motion, unless in video games, maybe. But either way, I love the Lego Movie."
"Tweekums","9","1","3","22 February 2017"," Everything is Awesome well almost everything
","Lego construction worker Emmet is a bit of a drone; he watches the most popular TV show, he listens to the most popular song and most importantly he always follows the instructions. Then one day he loses his instructions; he searches the construction site for it and stumbles upon the 'Piece of Resistance'. Also there is a girl named Wyldstyle who was looking for the piece. She explains to him that is a near mythical item that will enable the 'Special' to defeat the evil President Business. She assumes that Emmet is the Special but the more she sees of him the less sure she is. Far from being the Master Builder she expected he has just about zero imagination. Before they can conform Business they will team up with Wylestyle's boyfriend, Batman; recruit other Master Builders and keep one step ahead of Business's henchman, Bad Cop.<br/><br/>When I played with Lego as a child I never imagined that one day there would be a Lego movie and if I had I doubt I'd have imagined that it would be enjoyed by anybody apart from young children but here I am, almost fifty, and I must say I really enjoyed this film. It is chock full of references to other films in a way that older viewers will love without boring younger viewers who don't get the references. The characters are a lot of fun; Emmet and Wyldestyle are great leads but it is Batman who steals the show, it is no wonder that he just got his own movie. The story is simple enough for younger viewers and the execution is imaginative in a way that should entertain all ages. If there is a weakness it is when the action moves to the real world and we see a boy playing with his father's Lego; here we get the message of the movie and it is about as subtle as a brick (not a Lego brick); it also pulls the viewer out of the story just as it reaches its peak; still it isn't enough to spoil this entertaining film. The animation is great; it is especially impressive when we see Lego creations being made in front of our eyes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fan of animated movies; it is fun from start to finish."

","The Lego Movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a paper thin narrative. Most of the film is an unhinged series of very busy visuals with lots and lots of noise - stimulation overkill. I could imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching before bedtime, possibly something along the lines of the child ingesting Strychnine and a bottle of No-Doze. The Lego Movie can be an exhausting film to watch, but more often than not, the film is charming enough without pandering to children. It does transcend its corporate shackles, in what could have easily been a feature length toy commercial in lesser hands, but Phil Lord and Christopher Miller give enough soul to this material. The film is a lot easier to enjoy on a visceral level, as these silly lego characters don't really engage and the voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit. While not exactly deep subversive satire, The Lego Movie does have just enough substance beneath all the noise."

Superman and Green Lantern are a great comedy duo. The only small minor complaint is that the visual style is very ADD. The Lego part of the movie could have some more scenes without movement.

","A recent hit has been ""The Lego Movie"" and so far it's made a ton of money ($224,000,000 in only a month--and that's only in the USA!). Well, I don't find this the least bit surprising. The film already has a nostalgic element that might draw many adults to the movie. Additionally it has something many kids' films don't--it's very, very watchable for the adults who have been drug along to see it! It's often very funny and never takes itself seriously.<br/><br/>The film is about a meanie in the Lego world named President Business (the voice of Will Ferrell). He's determined to destroy their world by using his ultimate weapon--a tube of Crazy Glue! But the inhabitants of the world are mostly clueless and think he's a great guy. Later, this turns out to have parallels in the real human world.<br/><br/>As I said above, the film often was very funny as it often made nice cultural references or made fun of Lego. It also had the silliest soundtrack I've ever heard--with songs whose lyrics almost sound as if they were written by 7 year-olds! And, interestingly, you'll find yourself humming along with these catchy tunes! Clever and worth seeing, my only worry is that they'll bring out some sort of sequel--and although I really liked the film, I'd hate to see them ruin the franchise as the film seemed very complete and doesn't need followups."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","1","4","8 January 2015"," Barrage of manic frenzy of cultural jokes
","The Lego Movie is an animated film that's like Legoland theme park vomited and then tried to cram as many pop culture references as possible.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie was one of those films that I had no desire to watch because it looked beyond stupid – and I'm adult enough to admit I was hugely mistaken.<br/><br/>Emmet is a completely ordinary construction worker in Lego city who gets mixed up in an epic journey to save the free Lego-world. Somehow he gets mistaken for the prophesied Special and is recruited as the one true savior from an evil mastermind's plot for Lego universe domination.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is proof that commitment to and passion for your craft.just kidding! Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have mastered the quirky referential comedy down to a science with the same unexpected vigor experienced from 21 & 22 Jump Street. The Lego Movie is fresh, smart and new rather than following the standard expected by family oriented films set to capitalize on a franchise and rake in the dough. It satiates entertaining children and adults equally the with seamless duality that can only come from true dedication to storytelling.<br/><br/>At first glance, The Lego Movie is a fun family-friendly adventure film. It is also a cheeky satire to those intellectuals able to catch the never-ending barrage and chronic lampooning in the form of cultural references. Every single sentence within the dialogue of this film is an exploited opportunity to parody anything and everything.<br/><br/>With such an underwhelming year for animated films, The Lego Movie is the stand-out winner. It may be a bit too manic for some viewers, but that's okay because everything is awesome! Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full."

","From watching the trailer from this movie, I thought it was going to be a action-only lego war-ish movie that had no story. I was incredibly wrong.

The citizens there follow instructions on how to live life made by ""President"" Business. When Emmet meets a master builder named Wyldstyle who claims he is the ""special"", the one who is the most interesting, extraordinary, amazing person in the universe, and tells him about ""Tako Tuesday"", a day where ""Lord Business"" (President Businesses other title) has plans to unleash a super weapon called the Kraggle (which is actually glue) on all worlds in the universe. So it is up to Emmet to put the ""peace of resistance"" (which is the Kraggle's cap) on the Kraggle to save the universe.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS OVER*<br/><br/>This movie was very creative and funny, enjoyable for all ages.

","I must admit, I wasn't expecting much walking into this movie. I mean, it's a movie about Lego characters, with an actual Lego Batman and everything. How good could it honestly be?

It's mindblowing how much detail they've managed to squeeze in and how painstakingly accurate they try to remain. Enormous extra points just for that.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is excellent movie for children and adults alike.

"tomgillespie2002","8","1","4","19 June 2014"," Surprisingly profound
","For anyone who spent a lot of their childhood banging lumps of plastic together, creating outlandish plots and dialogue for them to act out, and pretending that all that lurked beyond the edges of the bed is a sea of molten lava, then you'll get The Lego Movie. It's hyperactive, fit- inducingly-colourful, and very, very funny, but it's the message behind the movie that makes it so wonderful. It tells a silly prophetic story about a simple construction worker thought to be 'the Special' - a plot deliberately made to sound like it's the product of an imaginative child - but his world of instructions manuals, mass consumerism, moronic pop songs and diabolical sitcoms is our world: the adult world. The Lego Movie makes you want to find your inner child again, and go back to those days where you could transport yourself to another world in your bedroom by using your own brain.<br/><br/>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a naive and simple everyman, routinely watching popular sitcom ""Where Are My Pants?"", singing along to ""Everything is Awesome!"", and using an instruction manual for every aspect of his life. Left behind on a construction site one night, he comes across the mysterious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who seems to be searching for something. After accidentally spooking her, he investigates himself, and comes across the 'Piece of Resistance', a glowing object that gives him visions and knocks him unconscious when he touches it. When he awakens, he's being interrogated by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), and finds the Piece has attached itself to his back. Believing him to be 'the Special' from a prophecy, Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to the Gandalf-alike Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), who teaches Emmet the way to becoming a master builder.<br/><br/>What could have been a mindless 90-minute advertisement for a global product, The Lego Movie dodges the bullet by actually attacking mass- consumerism, placing the importance on creativity and individuality. The big bad buy is Lord Business (Will Ferrell), a helmet-wearing, caped corporate devil who wishes to control everyone by gluing them in place with 'the Krakle' (a mispronunciation of Krazy Glue), oppressing the freedom to travel between Lego worlds (including The Old West, Middle- Zealand and Cloud Cuckoo Land). This is also a stab at collectors, those strange types who like to keep their toys in boxes and display them, rather than getting them out and using them for what they were designed for. Toys may have become ornaments, ways to make easy money on eBay.<br/><br/>It could be argued that such satire has no place in a kids movie. But these are the same kids who now have their own iPhones, bombarded with in-game advertisements and growing up in a world of reality TV, with programmes consistently celebrating wealth, stupidity and branding. Wyldstyle, concerned that Emmet may have never had an original thought in his entire life, asks him what his favourite restaurant is. ""Any chain restaurant!"" he gleefully replies. This is the man who is supposed to save the world, the greatest master builder to have ever lived, only to be a master builder, you need to have an imagination to create something amazing out of nothing. The best that Emmet has come up at this point is a two-level couch. It maybe useless, illogical and absolutely pointless, but it's something.<br/><br/>But The Lego Movie isn't all metaphors, it's also beautifully animated (it occasionally replicates stop-motion, as if the movie is actually made of Lego bricks, although it is entirely CGI), exceptionally witty, and features an outstanding vocal cast, who make up an entourage of Lego characters based on other mediums. We have Batman (Will Arnett) as Wyldstyle's arrogant yet lovable boyfriend, and the likes of Han Solo, C-3PO, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Michelangelo the Renaissance artist and Michelangelo the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. It's an absolute joy, as if looking into a child's toy boy to find a bunch of random and unconnected figures from years of collecting. And that sums up the film - like looking into the past and realising that that same person, who could lose hours putting on silly voices and concocting ridiculous stories, is still in there somewhere.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"rlandmann","8","1","4","9 June 2014"," Mixed feelings
","I really liked The Lego Movie. I loved its minute attention to detail, its acknowledgement of Lego's own history and lore, its willingness to construct a narrative on multiple layers, and most of all, its heart. In many ways, it reminded me of a Muppet film in its aims and tone.<br/><br/>Along the way, it touches on peculiarly Lego concerns. For example, building by the instructions versus using the bricks to build whatever you want (no matter how goofy) is a central theme of the film. The film goes even further, to explore the competing natures of Lego as a child's toy and as a serious hobby for adults (AFOL -- Adult Fans of Lego). These are quintessentially Lego framings of the timeless opposition of order and conformity versus spontaneity and creativity.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is spectacular. Although computer-rendered, the world of the film is composed entirely of standard Lego parts and -- with more time and expense -- could have been made completely with stop-motion animation. The creativity exhibited is astounding.<br/><br/>Only two things disappointed me about this film: its level of violence and its gender issues. Lego is itself surely a metaphor for creation and collaboration. Yet instead of a story where characters had to work together to create something wonderful, overcoming various obstacles along the way, the Lego movie is a standard action-movie plot where heroes must stop a megalomaniac bent on destroying the world. There is an incredible amount of gunfire depicted in this film. I wish the vehicle of a Lego movie had been used for a more--ahem--constructive narrative.<br/><br/>As for gender, there are only two female characters of any significance: Wyldstyle and Princess Unikitty. Wyldstyle is relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist (male construction worker Emmett) and Princess Unikitty's stereotypical ultra-femininity is presented as vaguely ridiculous up until one climactic action sequence in which she becomes powerful only by shedding the markers of her femininity (compare Lady Macbeth's plea that the spirits ""unsex me here"" to make her powerful). This is not a movie that passes the Bechdel test except on the very loosest, flimsiest definition of ""conversation"" imaginable. It gets worse. Wyldstyle expresses her disinterest in men's advances by saying that she has a boyfriend, and underscores this by emphasising that the relationship is ""serious"". Finally the live action sequences that depict the ""real world"" outside the Lego world revolve entirely around a father and son. This could have been so much better.<br/><br/>So, although I really liked the movie, it had the potential to be so much more. At the very least, its makers have promised to make more of their female characters in the forthcoming sequel. I hope this is the case, and that the film is less violent too."

"AmandaSage","10","1","4","14 April 2014"," The Lego Movie is a perfect fit
","A few years ago, back when I had only two nephews, I was on a quest for real Lego—those loose pieces that come in all sorts of shapes, colours and sizes, the kind you could build into whatever you wanted, the kind that didn't come with a set of instructions and a specific purpose in mind. I wanted to give my first nephews, Jon and Isaac, the kind of Lego I grew up playing with. But all I could find in my local toy stores were Lego kits, designed more for crafting predetermined ships or boats or planes than to stimulate the imagination. It wasn't until I stopped in at Toys ""R"" Us in Times Square that I was able to find a box of the prized pieces.<br/><br/>Today, I've got three nephews playing with that New York City Lego (young David joined the gang about six years ago). I'm proud to say that all of them prefer making their own Lego creations to sticking with the instructions. They love the kits, too—they're a new generation, after all—but once they've finished following directions, they take the finished product apart and start inventing their own versions.<br/><br/>As much as my nephews and I love Lego, we weren't on board right away with the idea of a Lego movie. When Isaac and I discovered the movie's poster during his recent visit to Ottawa (the boys live in another province), we were left wondering what on earth the plot would be about for such an obvious marketing piece.<br/><br/>Jon had the same doubts, although they were quickly turned around once he saw the movie last weekend. ""When I started watching it, I was thinking, 'How can a movie about Lego have a plot?'"" he says. ""And then after, I realized it was pretty cool how they took Lego and made it into a huge movie."" It's a huge movie, indeed. The Lego Movie comes from the genius writer/director team behind Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Here, they've created a brilliant, self-reflexive animated flick that, in the words of fellow Lego junkie Thomas J Bradley, ""perfectly captures the ideas of Lego."" So what is the plot? I won't reveal the overarching premise, but the main story follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), a regular Joe Lego man presumed to be the ""Special"" destined to save the world from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell), who rules over all things Lego and insists that everyone always follow the instructions. Emmet joins forces with a fantastic group of rebel figurines, including Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Spaceman Benny (Charlie Day) and the wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Standing in the way, alongside Lord Business, is Liam Neeson's conflicted Bad Cop.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie holds together with shrewd observations about the real world and very clever plays on sayings, words and product names. It turns ideas on their heads and offers hilarious insights into the way children interpret their surroundings — all without alienating the parents in the audience.<br/><br/>Sean, my brother-in-law, dutifully took the boys to the movie, but he was pleasantly surprised by how much he himself enjoyed it. ""There were a lot of adults laughing their heads off in the movie,"" he says. ""It was well done."" Sean also commented on the ""nostalgia factor"" the movie tapped into. For example, Spaceman's faded logo, or his broken chin strap. ""That was what would always break first on those things."" There's no question that The Lego Movie is an unabashed marketing campaign. The filmmakers deliver a fabulous one-two punch, targeting grown-up kids who were raised on Lego, just as much as the kids who play with it today. But they've also built a smart, inventive flick that shows what's at stake when imagination is squelched for the sake of compliance, and concludes perfectly by driving home the idea that one person's happy ending isn't necessarily the same as everyone else's.<br/><br/>More to the point, The Lego Movie is piles of fun. It's hilarious and visually awesome, and it makes it very clear that playing with Lego (or at least being creative, taking risks and believing in yourself) forms the building blocks of a happy childhood and an accepting, inspired adulthood.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the surprise by rattling off too many examples of what's so funny and clever about the movie. So I'll keep it to just a few of the best bits, according to my nephews and me.<br/><br/>David: ""Everything is AWESOME!!! I liked the Lego lava at the beginning. It's so cool when it boils, Lego hot stuff goes flying up in the air. They used a lot of Lego pieces for that. Except it's not so realistic Lego. I love how that spaceship guy was screaming 'SPACESHIP!' the whole entire time he was flying; it was so funny. How does that work, Lego people talking? I guess people were dressing up as Lego blocks."" Isaac: ""I liked the rocket ship guy. And the Millennium Falcon. I thought it was funny. The ending was really funny. I don't know what my favourite part is; I just like building Lego. I just finished building a Lego castle, it's like six little rooms, each side of it has a roof and then a base on top. It has walls and a sniper tower. And I added more to the Lego ISS."" Jonathan: ""I really liked the part where the bad cop keeps changing into a good cop. I liked the plays on terms. And the ending was pretty funny. I read a lot about it in Isaac's Lego magazine so I kind of knew what was coming. It was really good."" Me: ""I loved Batman's song, Untitled Self Portrait: (To the barking beat of the Batmobile's subwoofers) DARKNESS. NO PARENTS. SUPER RICH. KINDA MAKES IT BETTER."""

","If you search on YouTube for Death Star, Eddie Izzard and Lego, as you do. You will find a Izzard voiced skit that some smart Alec has painstakingly animated frame by frame using Lego toys. The words are funny already but combined with the visuals, this is a match made in heaven.<br/><br/>If someone can pull this off in their bedroom, imagine what you could do with full brand licensing in your pocket, A-List acting talent, millions of studio dollars and ability to rummage in the back catalogue of popular super hero and sci-fi pop culture.<br/><br/>Of course placing all these elements together could still foreshadow a disaster. No matter you have Morgan Freeman voicing a Gandalf style self aware wizard and a post Christopher Nolan styled Lego Batman, this is still animated Lego with a lick of CGI wizardry.<br/><br/>Fox studios need not have worried, the film has been a massive hit not only for the younger audience but the film has that most elusive element, crossover appeal, guaranteed to generate big box office returns.<br/><br/>Following a prelude with ""Vitruvius"" (Morgan Freeman - Voice), attempting to protect a super weapon ""Kragle"" from Lord Business (Will Ferrell - Voice), we are introduced to Emmett Joe Brickowski (Will Arnett - Voice). Emmett is an ordinary construction worker with no special skills, he gets on OK with his crew but remains largely anonymous.<br/><br/>Following the completion of a ""most catchy tune ever"" montage, our nascent hero spots his dream girl ""Wildstyle""(Elizabeth Banks - Voice), apparently even Lego figure have desires to attend to. Literally falling for the girl, Emmett finds ""the piece of resistance"" leading to his anointment as a ""Master Builder"" and brings him to the attention of ""Good/Bad Cop"" (Liam Neeson - Voice) the trusty lieutenant of ""Lord Business"".<br/><br/>Can Emmett save the world, is the plot an excuse to have huge amounts of self aware fun with many action set pieces and great throwaway jokes, certainly we answer affirmative to the latter.<br/><br/>Clealy the film makers have been given carte blanche to utilise many sacred brand names, Batman, Wonder-woman, Star Wars, Green Lantern to name just a few and they make the most of the opportunity.<br/><br/>As Batman states in in his post ironic Christian Bale style drawl ""I only build in Black and sometimes, very, very dark grey"" This works on many levels, the kids will love the action, the bright colours and the ability to re-enact the movie post credit scrawl, once parents have been bankrupted buying all the toys.<br/><br/>To be fair, it would have been easy for the filmmakers just to make a movie length Lego promo with blatant product tie-ins but the film has been constructed with care, love, a lot of thought and attention to detail. The end is certainly not where you expect to find yourself when the film starts and again is a risk that pays huge dividends, revealing the film has a beating sentimental heart.<br/><br/>Difficult to criticise as there is not much to dislike, the whole energy of the film is quite infectious occasionally the spell is broken and you realise you are watching animated Lego, but as someone once said, everything looks better in Lego Hugely enjoyable caper movie made entirely of Lego with clever use of words, cameos and situations, both breaking out of the confines of the genre yet satisfying those who just want a fun film for the kids to watch.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A no brainer must see and with a sequel already in the works, one could say without doubt that ""everything is awesome"""
"michael_the_nermal","8","1","4","7 April 2014"," A Fun Movie, but With an Ambiguous Message
","From a visual perspective, ""The Lego Movie"" is spectacular. The computer animation seems flawless, and the depiction of the Lego World was amazing. This film's second positive attribute is its clever writing and humor. I loved that the Lego people placed supernatural power on everyday household items that wandered into their world. This film could have been absolutely terrible. It, like ""The Transformers"" of the '80s, or its predecessor ""Gobots: Battle for the Rock Lords,"" could have been panned by anyone over 13 as just a cash-in to sell more Legos. This film does have adult sensibilities, and the screenwriters envisioned a movie that had an actual message worth saying. For cynical parents, this movie is *not* merely a cash-in that will have your children screaming tantrums for an Emmett and Lord Business Playset; this movie has fully-fleshed-out and funny characters. Chances are you, the grownups, will be laughing and even empathizing with Emmett and his other plastic friends.<br/><br/>Now on to this film's themes, which may leave some parents puzzled. On the surface, this movie is about the conflict between creativity and strict obedience to sets of rules, mostly in the realm of art (I suppose you could say this conflict applies to all aspects of life, but ""art"" is the subject that came to mind first). Strangely, I think this film is morally ambitious as to its message, though that does not seem the case at allat least, not at first. The villain is, for lack of a better word, an ""aesthete"": he has a vision of perfection and beauty for the world that others may see as too strict and rigid; he literally wants to glue his subjects in place so that everything in the Lego World will be ""perfect"" as he sees itor ""awesome"", as the film's main song suggests. He is opposed by a group of subjects who refuse to ascribe to his vision of ""perfection"" and instead emphasize free thought and wild creativity over *any* order. On the surface, the film may be a parable about the struggle between democracy over fascism, but I don't quite see the film's message as being on that large of a scale. The message is about how best to create works of art; and, odd as it seems, I can see Legos as a medium through which artistic expression can come alive. This film has two extremes: there's the fascistic world of LegoTown, where everything is to be done according to specific sets of written rules; and there's the colorful, psychedelic Cloud Cuckoo Land, where there is no order at all: cynics would say the Cloud Cuckoo Landers live a life of anarchy and chaos, and it would be a wonder that things get done at all. The rebel Legos' devotion to extreme creativity has its limits, and this is shown in the film. It's up to Emmett, the protagonist, to find a compromise between extreme order and specificity and extreme creativity. He is, indeed ""The Special""; the bridge that leads to a path of moderation between two extreme views of expression.<br/><br/>This film gives the grownup viewer a lot to wrap his or her mind around. The ambiguous tone will also confound those who think they have this movie's message pegged down. It's not just a kid's movie: it's a clever manifesto about the nature of the creative process! And it offers no easy answers! This message is wrapped around clever humor, silly characters, and excellent animation. By all means, take your kids to watch this film; but don't offer them easy answers about the film's moral, either."
"JohnWelles","8","1","4","4 April 2014"," The Building Blocks of Animation Greatness
","""The Lego Movie"", directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.<br/><br/>This would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.<br/><br/>Still, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by ""The Matrix"" (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.<br/><br/>Yet this is never enough to sour ""The Lego Movie"", which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be."

But after hearing all the good things about it and learning that even the pickiest movie critics liked it, I decided to head to the theater and see the highly anticipated Lego Movie. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>First, the story was original and is probably one of the best story lines I've seen in a kid's film. The characters were memorable (Morgan Freeman's character was just hilarious and Will Arnette as Batman was classic). The humor was clever and well thought out and the animation kinda screwed with your mind. You couldn't tell if it was computer animated or stop motion. And what really surprised me, was that near the end of the movie, there's something that actually symbolizes the main protagonist and the main antagonist. And let me tell you, I didn't expect to find symbolism in a film called, The Lego Movie. This is surprisingly one of the best animated films I've ever seen. The only things I didn't like about it was the rushed ending and the overuse of the Everything is Awesome song. (I swear if I hear that song one more time, I'm gonna saw off my own ears) But both of those criticisms are blown away by this fun filled action packed adventure. Even if you never played with Legos as a kid, this is still an enjoyable film. Hell, it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. Do I recommend that you see this movie? Absolutely. Be ready to have one of the most fun experiences you've ever had at the movies."

","I've always said the best kind of animated films are films that can only be done with animation. Toy Story, for example, is a film that would not work in anything but animation, while a film like Shrek could be done with live actors and makeup. The Lego Movie is more of the former. This film is just filled to the brim with interesting characters, great visuals, and a hilarious script. <br/><br/>Emmett, the Lego mini-figure this film follows, is one of the most interesting and deep ""chosen ones"" since Harry Potter, and you really do root for him throughout the film. Liam Neeson's Bad Cop is another interesting character, mostly because of how conflicted and deep his character is for a film about Legos. <br/><br/>The film, being CGI but using Legos for everything, looks amazing. The best visual scenes is where the characters are in the ocean and the blocks move around like waves, and the end where you really see how much effort went into making this film. <br/><br/>However, the film would really only be OK if it was not for the script. The Lego Movie could be the best comedy I have seen in a long time, and it almost all thanks to one character. Batman. Batman literally has some of the greatest lines of any comedic character since Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, he is that good. <br/><br/>Besides the great script, the film is just a huge love letter to being a kid at heart and playing with your toys. At the end, the film began to hit home for me and I really began to feel for the main character and the villain as well. The way our generation views Toy Story will be how this generation views The Lego Movie. One of the best animated films in a long time."

","Great movie! There are so many aspects of this movie that make it great. The first is that 'everything is awesome' about it. I just love the way they combined stop-motion animation with CGI to make the film have a 'classic stop-motion' feel to it, but also a more modern and smooth feel to it at the same time. Also, it's hilarious! The characters, the lines, the voices and the relationships between the characters just make the film so creative and funny. In all honesty, it's probably one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and I wish there was an 11-star option for the ratings it's that good.

","How do you describe the best movie you have ever seen? Picture it, and then try to put words to it. Now scrap all that, and picture a movie a billion times better, and then add Lego. Yes, this movie is that good.<br/><br/>The attention to detail put into this movie is absolutely ridiculous. I found myself almost as entertained by looking at the background, side scenes, and little jokes as I was by the main story of the movie, as it was so well thought-out and so much attention to detail was put into every little thing.<br/><br/>The story is also super fun, and keeps you completely entertained the whole way through. The movie is filled with a wonderful sense of humour the whole way through, and has managed to hit that great balance between humour for kids and adults. Truly, there is something to be said about a movie where a group of 29 and 30 year olds are laughing so hard we were crying.<br/><br/>Lastly, the voice actors all did an amazing job, and each of them were able to bring lots of personality to each of the characters, which is amazing considering they were playing plastic figurines.<br/><br/>Really, the truth is there is nothing I can write that justifies how amazing this movie is. A lot of people will dismiss it thinking it is just for kids, and not worth their time, but really, this is a movie everyone should watch."

","The animation was excellent meaning the directors and animators did a great job making it look like actual Lego bricks. The inclusion of batman gave it a wonderful storyline with clever jokes. SPOILER ALERT! Loved the live action part having will Ferrell as the father resembling lord business. Its a film for all ages to enjoy and inspire kids to buy the mini figures. THE casting was a great choice by having Morgan freeman and will arnett. My only criticism was that the other superheroes like superman and wonder woman weren't really involved in the main story. However, Batman's role was great and added the main comedy to the film alongside Emmett's clumsiness. Couldn't have asked more from the film and the message of the film was great as well."
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","4","15 March 2014"," Everything WAS Awesome!
","Well it happened. After a life time producing these wonderful little bricks dating all the way back to 1949, finally we get to see this toy giant get a movie release (Outside of their works based on popular franchises like ""Batman""). I ASSURE you movies based on toys and cartoons get released yearly, some to mixed reception and few to rave reviews. ""The Lego Movie"" is so beautifully animated and well made, that I was in awe at how personal this film will be to each individual.<br/><br/>I don't want to stress or further the message the film was trying to communicate with its audience because they'll easily get it, everyone will. What I do want to say is how much I praise the film-makers for seeing and going beyond the potential of what they could create with the source material. Being a bit older now than I probably would have liked to have seen it, I can say that it got to me not through catchy tunes or semi-funny jokes, but heavy nostalgia and sentimentality. I never had much LEGO growing up, but finally after amassing a large amount at the age of 16 I gave it all away to the son of a family friend who didn't have any. Therefore closing my loop, and looking back at those times with a smile (I still buy the occasional figure or two).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: I can't really find a negative thing to say about the movie. The voice acting was stellar, and the animation was fluent and very frenetic at times. Chris Miller and Phil Lord did a very good job incorporating themes of individuality and group mentality, but I just thought that by the end any gender of any age should be able to enjoy this. 10/10. Warner Bros. may have just found their ""Toy Story""."
"fallonfantriple7","10","1","4","9 March 2014"," Everything is Awesome!!!!!
","Best animated movie of all time, for many reasons. Chiefly, no cursing, which means that anyone can watch it. Seriously, I was in the theater with both tiny kids and elderly people alike. Second, it has a wonderful message: that imagination and individuality are much better than strict rigidity, yet it does so without being childish or overly mature either, it hits the sweet spot. It looks amazing, too. The characters looks like they are stop-motion animated and the colors are vivid and lovely. And it's amazingly funny, it never takes itself too seriously and the theme song is the catchiest ever!! There's a scene where the characters are singing it and then there's a title card that reads ""Five hours later"", it's completely accurate. You'll come out of the movie feeling so happy and singing the song at the top of your lungs. It's so good. Everything about this movie is amazing. An absolute must-see."
"kmcloone96","8","1","4","8 March 2014"," Almost reaches 'Toy Story' levels of entertainment
","Lego played a big part in my childhood. Receiving a new Lego set was the pinnacle of excitement for me as a child, whether it be Star Wars or Harry Potter, I played with it for hours upon hours. So when I heard that The Lego Movie was being made, I hoped that it would assert the same nostalgia as Toy Story evokes nowadays. Thankfully, it does. <br/><br/>The Lego Movie revolves around a stereotypical builder by the name of Emmet (Chris Pratt), who one day breaks the monotony of his life by discovering the 'piece of resistance'; an object which will defeat the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrel). All of this is foretold by a godly figure called Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), who gathers a team compiled of many heroes such as Batman (Will Arnett), an adventurous girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) & a 1970s astronaut figure (Charlie Day). Constantly on the tail of the group is a bi-polar police officer played by Liam Neeson, who is wholly loyal to Lord Business. <br/><br/>In case it isn't clear, there's a lot of celebrities featured in The Lego Movie, all of whom present their characters in an incredibly entertaining fashion. It's often argued that animation movies should hire 'real' voice-actors to play roles, but I genuinely think that The Lego Movie would be considerably worsened if people like Morgan Freeman didn't participate. From start-to-finish, the cast make the on-screen action all the more enjoyable to watch, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is also just a fun movie to watch. Although it's highly likely that the majority, if not everything was produced through CGI, within the world of the movie it is all Lego. Even the ocean is made with thousands of individual pieces of Lego, which just makes it a very fun film to take in, and draws you in even more. I'd imagine the fight- scenes within the film took a very long time to produce, as every explosion and gunshot is created entirely out of the globally-recognised pieces of plastic. <br/><br/>Similar to the many great films Pixar have produced over the years, the humour in The Lego Movie appeals to both children and adults. I found myself laughing consistently throughout, some times far more than in any comedy I have watched recently. There's not as many jokes which appeal exclusively to adults which may be found in movies like Toy Story, but the humour definitely isn't dumbed-down for the sake of the main audience. I'd easily recommend it to anybody and be surprised if they didn't find something to like. <br/><br/>The only major issue I held with The Lego Movie was the twist towards the end. Without spoiling anything, it will either undermine the movie for you or make it even more enjoyable. I personally found it to do a bit of both, and actually result in a slightly emotional scene, but some may argue that it detracts from the film as a whole."
"alindsay-al","9","1","4","21 February 2014"," A Legendary bag of laughs
","I got to be honest when I heard that a Lego movie was coming out I had no interest in seeing it. To be honest I only went to go see it because of word of mouth form critics and people I knew and am I glad that I spent 2 hours of my life watching this film. This film is not just for young kids this film has so much humour in it that kids, teenagers and adults alike will love. The voice acting of Liam Neeson, Chris Pratt and Will Arnett in particular is my favourite with all the voice acting absolutely fantastic. With properties such as Batman, Superman and Star Wars this film is so much fun and is easily one of the best times I have had in a cinema in a while. It also has one of the most catchy theme songs ever which adds to the overall greatness of this film and makes it absolutely legendary. The narrative is fairly simple with the character of Emmet (Pratt) given the daunting task of being the chosen one with allies such as Batman (Arnett) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to defeat the evil President business (Will Ferrell). This narrative also helps with some of the great jokes and overall fun of the film."

","I had high expectations going into The Lego Movie due to the star-studded cast. However, I was extremely disappointed. Although overall I still did enjoy the movie, I struggled when the live-action came into play. This is not because I do not enjoy the mixing of worlds; I loved the use of the ""man upstairs"" and was willing to suspend my beliefs enough to enjoy the little boy using his imagination and making these characters come to life. However, I struggled with the fact that even when the boy was no longer playing, the Legos were still in action. It gave us a dilemma in which nothing was happening either way - the Legos weren't real because it was all in the son's imagination, but at the same time, the son's imagination was not driving the plot any more. It felt as if I had wasted my time becoming invested in these characters that mean nothing. By the end of the movie, it was just about Will's character (the dad) overcoming his OCD."

","First of all, they are not Legos, they are Lego bricks. The word Lego never has an s after it. OK, onwards and upwards.<br/><br/>Lego construction worker Emmett is a forgettable everyman: surprisingly, he turns out to be The Special, fated to lead a resistance movement to save the Lego world against the evil plan of Lord Business by using the Piece of resistance to prevent the use of the Kragle to destroy everything.<br/><br/>Let me say at the start, that this film is fun. It references pretty nearly everything I enjoy, takes potshots at all sorts, and works well as a bright, colourful kids' fantasy but with enough nods, winks and knowing gags to satisfy your average adult (just look at some of the voice credits - Anthony Daniels delivers one line as a Lego C3PO, for instance). The voice talent in general is great, and I particularly enjoyed Liam Neeson's willingness to send himself up.<br/><br/>Having been positive overall, it seems a little ill-natured to be critical, but I must mention two things which didn't sit that well with me. One was that, for a film which needed to be simple, it got awfully complicated at times, and the other was that the animation style and the sheer quantity of what was happening meant that, at times, I really couldn't follow what was going on in front of me.<br/><br/>But I repeat - this film is fun, and worth watching on that basis alone."

","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. It was a nice change of pace from the dramas we've been watching lately as this one is mostly animated Legos with voices from various celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Will Ferrell. Since Warner Bros. is the distributor, it shouldn't be a surprise that characters owned by them like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are depicted here though we shouldn't take them for the real thing since they're Lego-based ones. To tell the truth, I didn't find the whole thing hilarious but I was pretty amused throughout and the constant motion of the characters and many moving backgrounds was enough to entertain me and my friend. In summary, I liked The Lego Movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in this sort of thing."

","""Let's take extra care to follow the instructions or you'll be put to sleep, and don't forget Taco Tuesday's coming next week.""<br/><br/>The directors behind this very creative and imaginative animated film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street), deliver a highly entertaining and hilarious movie thanks to a sharp script which is packed with extremely funny lines and hundreds of pop culture references. It also benefits from a talented cast who do excellent voice work here. Despite being a film that promotes its very own Lego empire, it still works because it has lots of heart and reaches to kids and adults alike. Kids who are fans of the TV series Ninjago will have a great time with this film, while adults will love the witty script beside the fact that it will touch their nostalgic senses. The Lego movie took me back to my childhood days and reminded me of when I played with these building blocks and invented adventures as I played with them. In a way this film felt like I was watching a very smart and creative kid playing with his Lego figures. I can think of no other movie where you get so many pop cultural references as this one. In what other film do you get to see an NBA star like Shaq share a scene with a Ninja Turtle, Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Wonder Woman all together? These character cameos keep on coming throughout the film with silly but hilarious and witty one-liners. <br/><br/>Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary Lego mini-figure who is content with his life following orders from Lord Business (Will Ferrell) as well as most of the other citizens. What they don't know is that Lord Business is planning on gluing their universe together. When Emmet stumbles across a mysterious block he is mistakenly identified as the chosen one and considered to be one of the MasterBuilders called to save the world. He is drafted by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and is introduced to the different Lego universes that Lord Business has been keeping separated. He teams up with other MasterBuilders like Batman (Will Arnett), Unikitty (Alison Brie), Metal Beard (Nick Offerman), and several others all led by the old wise man Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Together they begin a quest to stop Lord Business from destroying their worlds, but they have to face fierce opposition from Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and the rest of the police force who serve Lord Business. A task which Emmet isn't really prepared for as he is simply an ordinary mini figure, but who everyone is depending on to save the world. <br/><br/>The plot is a little over the top and silly, but it works thanks to some great gags and witty dialogues. The script writers, Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, Lord, and Miller know their pop culture references and use it to their advantage. It took me a while to get used to the animation style as it was done by using Lego figures in stop motion and combing it with CGI effects. They did paint a colorful and imaginative world and soon I was won over by the style of the film. It's a fast paced movie and one that you will probably have no problem in wanting to go back and rewatching it considering the jokes are so fast paced that you might have missed lots of them."
"paulbae10","8","1","4","7 February 2014"," Although The Lego Movie was surely a commercial to sell Legos, it was a damn good one.
","Seeing the incredibly high reviews that ""The Lego Movie"" was receiving it persuaded me to check this film out; originally I wouldn't have given this movie the time of day as I've seen from the trailers it seemed to be a film that purely relied on cheap jokes such as referential humor and fart jokes; thank God it wasn't that. I went in the Lego Movie with moderately high expectations since the review scores were so high, and I left feeling it truly deserved those scores. The film had absolutely breath-taking amount of detail when it came to making the computer animated graphics look as though it was filmed entirely in Legos bricks, also the wide variety of characters in the film from a punk chick that's dating Batman, to a hippie mystical wizard gave the film a sense of worlds colliding as well as charm; but what was the most surprising thing about this film was how much depth the story had with its commentary on modern America. How an everyman listens to only poplar vapid music, to drinking overly priced coffee, and to have absolutely nothing that makes them special in anyway. Also the main villain being called Lord Business owning a huge corporation that runs charities, taco night Tuesdays, as well as ballot boxes, huh you never see a kids film put that much emphasis on the corrupt business. But the message the movie tries to convey at roughly the last 15 minutes in the film truly turns a hilarious comedy into a touching ending that rivals ending like Toy Story 3. The Lego Movie brought me back to the days were I used to play with Legos every day, and although it one huge commercial for Legos it worked as I wanted to buy some Legos and relive my childhood again. 8.5/10"

A great story, an EPIC and i mean EPIC cameo from a company that isn't supposed to be in the movie because its owned buy Disney now which at first i was like i wonder if this is going to be in here because they have Legos out of this massive movie universe franchise but i don't want to spoil it but you may get my hint if you put the pieces together (PUN intended). Speaking of PUN Batman makes a joke that is hilarious about Pun's to himself. Batman just kills it in this movie and a couple of other Justice League members are in there hopefully that will give me some type of hold over until 2016 and 2017 with Batman vs Superman and hopefully a secretive Justice League Movie. But this movie made me laugh the entire time because of the adult humor in it which it really is a kids movie respectfully but its like a movie for when kids grow up and they see it they understand it more. Just like movies in my childhood. But everything is Awesome with this unflawed movie and you'll understand why i say everything is Awesome in this movie once you see it. It has some great characters and a great positive message in it at the end of it that really hit close to the heart because this movie has heart and lost of it. I will say this ""LEGO MOVIE"" is the new coming Toy Story and i say that as a good thing and i love Toy Story with all my heart but this has the potential to be just a Epic as Toy Story.

","The Lego Movie is in the same vein as a Pixar production, this animated movie will therefore appeal to the younger audience as well as the older viewers thanks to the richness of the references and the characters density, its offbeat humour and cynicism. The cinematography and animations are beautiful but since it was made via CGCIs it's a bit hard to understand why they would want to make it look like it's stop-motion. As for the scenario, the story is well thought-out but goes maybe a bit all over the place — especially at the end —, you barely could have handled even 15 minutes more. All in all, great success for this first opus about the Lego world."
"MsPersonGuyMan","10","1","5","1 November 2014"," ★★★★
","The Lego Movie is something of a miracle. It rushes along at breakneck speed, zipping through gag after gag as if its creative and smart visuals would tire the eyes. The movie builds upon itself unceasingly, aware of its nature as what is essentially a feature- length commercial for Lego and blasting through that bar in a burst of color and wit. It will bring parents delighted relief, children unbridled joy at watching their imaginations interpreted and expanded onto the big screen. It makes regular use of the far- reaching trademarks of its brand for good and consistent reason. And wouldn't you know, there lies a touch of heart within its blocky exterior. It's better than Wreck-It Ralph; it's lighter on its feet than Toy Story. Everything is indeed quite Awesome. You will see what I mean.<br/><br/>The film is a majestic hybrid of two distinct comic presences: the directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller had previously churned out the manic Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, while co-director Chris McKay is known for the animated sketch comedy show Robot Chicken. Assemblies of different presences helming a single project have oft been the cause of a film's shortcomings, as voices struggle to meld harmoniously while making themselves heard over the others' rabble. Judging from the way this movie glides through the entirety of its running time, the three could be an a cappella group.<br/><br/>The story sets its sights on one particular character in its collection: a construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt), who is so unremarkable that a wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) prophesied that he would one day become the Special and save all of Legokind from the clutches of Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his superweapon, the Kragle. This is to be accomplished by obtaining the Piece of Resistance through a quest that spans so many different Lego worlds and setpieces it would make children's overclocked imaginations whirl. Stop me if all this sounds a little like one of those adventures you would have with your Lego set, giving things fantastical names and generating countless scenarios through a process transcending convenience.<br/><br/>I'm getting ahead of myself. You see, Lord Business has seized control of the world and monotonized and streamlined the lives of his adoring citizens without their noticing his despotic presence all about their cities, from their strictly unvarying 9 to 5 (each person comes with an instruction manual on How To Live Your Life) to the absurdly overcharged coffee. Out of all the children's movies to have nailed the social commentary on commercialism (and conformity) so expertly, it's one that indulges in it under the table. The snag is that it works; Hollywood could take notes from this, ""the best way to sell is to make a good product.""<br/><br/>To probe further is to get in too deep, and really, I've revealed all the necessities. The Special is to be aided in his quest by a legion of Master Builders, some of whom are a spunky female fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a magical hybrid animal named UniKitty (Alison Brie), a 1980s space astronaut referred to as ""1980s space guy"" (Charlie Day), Superman (Channing Tatum), MetalBeard the pirate (Nick Offerman), and Batman (Will Arnett). Batman steals pretty much every scene he is in, which is faint praise in this case considering that this movie is a continuous frenzy of characters stealing scenes from everyone else.<br/><br/>This also goes for Business's top henchman, a two-faced cop that's played by Liam Neeson with an Irish snarl that's impossible not to appreciate. Apart from the accent, his particular feature is- oh, I've already said.<br/><br/>What haven't I said already. The animation is damn impressive, as everything on-screen is convincingly modeled after Lego pieces – to the point that it never lets out where the CGI ends and where traditional hand-based animation, if employed, starts. There must have been parts involving actual Lego pieces crafted by hand; the attention to detail is too great, and the movie is too meticulous. At any rate, it makes for action sequences that leave you breathless from absurd momentum. There are parts that resemble the segments in those commercials where children construct Lego models through jacked frame rates. The hands are absent, but the tempo remains.<br/><br/>If you are seeing this with children, God be with you. I am writing this a week after having seen it in a packed theater of young and old, and I am still vibrating from the residual energy the movie has left me with. It is an enduring experience. I feel as if I have taken a glimpse into the future of merchandising cinema. And I have no complaints."

","The Lego Movie is an obvious allegory for American totalitarian Capitalist dictatorship socialist anarchofascism. The corporation in the movie, much like corporations in America, want to take over the world with their affluence and arrogant strength over the unsuspecting consumers. What's another word for consumers? Americans. The ""kragle"" is merely clever product placement, as you can instantly recognize that it was ""krazy glue"", the popular instant adhesive. It triggered the consumerism that was instilled during birth/immigration to America and subliminally told us to buy ""krazy glue"". ""Krazy glue"" is an obvious allegory to the founding fathers and their oligarchy, instituted to oppress the masses and continue to hoard wealth. The ideological view of the founding fathers can be found in Will Ferrel's character, who, ""krazily"" enough, wanted to oppress the masses and continue to hoard wealth. But that is the beauty of this movie. It makes the allegory so intensely accurate, yet somehow seems to mask it so well to where it seems like a kid's movie.

","The Lego movie is a film that delivers what you'd generally expect, a generically synthesised kinder based movie with all the frills and gloss you'd expect from Hollywood.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is sound, it conveys how we aren't defined by what others define us to be, but the film doesn't push much beyond that concept; and if it did it was either unnecessary or painfully cringeworthy.<br/><br/>The plot of the film doesn't go far to exact monotone from something we've all seen before, being the blandness of taking something somewhere to 'save the world' but I understand that it's more of a basis foundation for the overlaying inception of the morally subliminal message.<br/><br/>The visuals of this film are coherent with the novelty of Lego, I felt as though it served an authentic, nostalgic tinge, the use of typical Lego paraphernalia added to the mix of synchronicity with the chaos that Lego brings to the contrast of fragmentation to singularity (In the sense of building), the meticulous intricacies that adorned each model were also a refreshing increment.<br/><br/>I liked the character of Emmet, he seemed genuine and pleasantly simplistic (As intended) As for the other characters, I think that there needed to be a tad more variation in the range of figurines, the movie could have incorporated more familiar faces such as Indiana Jones or Darth Vader etc, I felt as though it was an asset that hadn't been utilised to suffice. The Love triangle in the film was somewhat pointless, Batman, Emmet and Lucy could have easily ventured without the implications of a relationship, but as they say, love adds 10 million to the box office.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a pleasant debut for the Lego movies, and if there is a sequel I'm sure improvements will be clarified and implemented as necessary; the producers just need to 'build' upon this current establishment to move it onwards and upwards. But bravo for the efforts made this time round, they paid testament to a franchise that enlightened my childhood. 7.4/10"

","I am a college student and The Lego Movie came to our in residence hall theater so I was delighted to finally get a chance to see this movie. I loved the beginning and the lovely CGI that appeared to be stop motion. Also the star power gave this movie an added bonus because it was fun to try and figure out the actor behind the animated Lego character. The social commentary was excellent and now you may be wondering why I am not giving this movie a 10. This is because I went in already assuming this movie was going to be great therefore when it was stunning I was left without some of the aw that I thought I would have. Also it felt like the whole theater seemed to force themselves to laugh at the jokes just wanting the movie to be as great as they hoped which toke something from the film. Overall the messages were great and it was quite funny, the end dragged out a bit to long for my sake but still a great film which I recommend."

","Hollywood has a protracted history of taking adored treasures of yesteryears and adapting them into feature films. Suffice to say, results have varied. Instances include the much-maligned Transformers series and the G.I. Joe movies amongst various others.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is the latest attempt to bring a beloved relic to the screen. Its immediate success lies in not succumbing to the dangerous precedent of being blatant product placement. Featuring an original story, The Lego Movie is surprisingly heartfelt and authentic, as opposed to an exercise in brand expansion (looking at you, Transformers).<br/><br/>The latest offering from Phil Lord and Chris Miller, directors of the imaginative albeit poorly titled Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the wildly rambunctious 21 Jump Street, follows the journey of Emmet (Chris Pratt), a construction worker who faces the unenviable task of saving the lego citizens from the evil ploy of the autocratic President Business (Will Ferrell). It becomes crystal clear that the directing duo has a great handle on comedy, as all the pieces fall into place (apologies for the pun).<br/><br/>An essential element of any animated feature is undoubtedly the voice work. Herein lies the movies' triumph. An impressive list of actors with expertise in the genre has lent their voices to the project. Among the standout performers are Will Arnett as the uber-awesome Batman and Liam Neeson as a schizophrenic police chief. The latter is not usually associated with comedy but delivers a pleasant performance nonetheless. Chris Pratt also excels as a reluctant hero thrust into the limelight.<br/><br/>Furthermore, another profound facet of The Lego Movie is the creativity and artistry employed by the makers, who have given meticulous attention to detail. Each frame is composed solely of lego bricks. In fact, the team of graphic designers painstakingly built this world using more than fifteen million lego bricks, before using CGI to achieve the finished product. The image quality is also genuinely enhanced by the use of 3D, which is not just a marketing gimmick.<br/><br/>Yet another quality of the animated feature is that it appeals to a wide ranging audience. Since it involves several amusing gags, is laden with pop culture references and even stimulates nostalgia for lego users, particularly the old ones, it is likely to garner appreciation from adults as well.<br/><br/>In the age of sequels, spin-offs and remakes galore, The Lego Movie is a welcome antidote. It does not act solely as an elaborate toy commercial nor does it render 3D technology futile. Instead, it exudes charm and wit usually associated with Pixar.<br/><br/>Much like its catchy theme song, The Lego Movie is awesome. It proceeds like a child's imagination running wild and serves as a throwback for adults who may have dabbled with their own lego sets back in the day."

","I have to say I loved this movie it was absolutely fantastic. Funny and hilarious but I feel like it had a good storyline and I love how they delve in to Emmet's character as a nobody who became a somebody and I love how Wildstyle is at first just a hero but she actually is like Emmet but one thing I have a negative position about , how they showed real people that was like a letdown but I love how there are so many realms I wish we could see all of them. I actually feel this could become a franchise ( usually when a part 2 of a movie would come I would hate it ) but The Lego Movie is different and is really good but as I said it would be more realistic if they weren't humans involved but I am fine with them it was just a bit of a let down. They really went deep with the characters and coming from a kids movie that is a huge accomplishment. But I wish they went deeper with Gandalf, maybe they should've shown more of the multi verse but nevertheless this is a terrific movie and my real rating is 9.8 ( as they were tiny fault that I have listed ) which rounds to 10 making it a excellent movie. This movie according to IMDb top 250 is the 190# best movie ever and one of the best kid movie's ever ( I reckon this is even better then Wall-E. )"

","So, I just saw the Lego Movie. What an unexpectedly fun film. It actually had a brain in it head, a script written with such care and eloquence allowed the characters to develop themselves without anything that wasn't irrelevant to the plot. It was obvious the directors knew what story they were telling and never let it become an over sized advert. The film was totally intrinsic, there never was a scene that felt totally out of place or irrelevant to the plot, all be it there was some quite irritating plot exposition, but it worked well with the tongue and cheek style of the film none the the less. What is most interesting about 'Lego Movie' is that it isn't flat, everything felt lively, it always had something to say whether it was about today's ideals of fitting in or the implications of parenthood.It never falls into generic child fare instead transcends above that and, while comedic, gives quite poignant moments. <br/><br/>Despite all its incredibly minor flaws The Lego movie was an incredibly enjoyable, sometimes poignant, ecstatically funny, intelligently rich piece of children's cinema. Worth a view and a 9/10."
"XenomorphSB","10","1","5","8 March 2014"," Everything (about this movie) is awesome
","Just The LEGO Movie﻿. It is awesome. It was flawless in so many ways. As the characters travel through different realms of the Lego world, the film style changes. In Western Land, the mood and style reflects that of old spaghetti westerns, including sound effect references to ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"". The visual aspects are incredible and EVERYTHING is made of actual Lego pieces. Even the muzzle flashes, something that is on the screen for only a frame or two, are made of Lego pieces. That said, the sky was the limit with what the pieces did. Even stepping away from the details film enthusiasts love to catch, the film was seamless in it's delivery. It had laugh out loud comedy that shifted to heart-pounding action and back in moments, in addition to heartwarming and tearjerking moments that resonate with the audience in a personal way. And finally, the film lived up to a claim that millions advertise and fail to deliver; it is the epitome of a family movie. Unlike every summer kids movie, The Lego Movie is not a kids movie that throws in a couple of jokes to help the parents sit through it. The Lego Movie is a kid movie, an adult move, and quite frankly, an everybody movie. There was every form of clean humor in the book, slapstick, bad puns, random silliness, pop culture/ referential humor, etc. Not a person alive could sit through this movie without laughing. So if you've ever built anything with Legos in your life, and I know you all have, go see The Lego Movie.<br/><br/>Side note: Lego Batman is the best character ever, of all time."

","The worst part of the movie was when I walked out and I realized I wasn't 10 any more. The movie while watching it may seem childish and stupid (still fun and funny just nothing you haven't seen before) but say with it because there is a scene at that make it just so Awesome. The voice picks are great. Something new was that they finally got the Justus League. They did what DC should of done and just make the movie and trust the audience we know who these carters are. Of course the animation is great I fell I would need to see it 100 times to get every thing in the back round. Also the comedy is great. It's probably like the first Anchorman ya it's funny the first time but when you see it again it just gets funnier because you see things that you didn't before. The movie is very quick and you just don't want it to end. Another bad thing is the song will stay in your head for ever."

I heard a few positive things about this film before I saw it, so I was a little prepared for the awesomeness it brought, but before that I didn't think the movie would be as well written and directed as it was from just seeing the trailers. I did think it looked funny, but I thought it would be a dumbed down, throwaway made for kids film like the CGI animated Ice Age, Rio & Despicable Me films. What we got was another animated masterpiece in the vein of a WRECK-IT RALPH & the TOY STORY films, animated films made for adults that are kid friendly. If you haven't seen this yet, see it NOW!

","The Lego Movie was a very well done, and relevant children's movie that will also be very enjoyable for adults. This movie was a long time coming and they did a great job recreating a living Lego universe. This was everything I was hoping it would be and more.<br/><br/>This movie really made me feel like I was a child again. The plot was very well thought out and really felt like it brought to life what we were all thinking when we were playing with Lego's as kids. I really felt immersed in this world as I watched it.<br/><br/>All of the acting in the film was great, although cheesy at times (unpurpose). Will Ferrell really stands out for me as President/Lord Business as the main antagonist in the film. He's so ridiculous in his role that it's outstanding. It seemed he had a real interest in this project. I felt it was his best work in a few years. The real gem here though is the story. That is what makes this movie so special.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that they were able to bring in many of the modern licensed products such as Lord of the Rings, DC Superheros, Star Wars etc. into the film. My only complaint might be that some of the larger properties, particularly those owned by Disney, were not in the film and some Lego owned properties, such as Ninjago, which are larger properties weren't in it all either. This is a minor complaint as at least some of this probably wasn't something they could really control. I doubt Disney would want a competing film featuring any of their characters.<br/><br/>The animation was really fantastic. It felt like I was watching living Lego pieces rather than an animated movie. I think this movie may not have been as effective if it was attempted even 5 years ago as the animation technology had to be just right.<br/><br/>In the end, The Lego Movie lives up to your expectations and delivers a very well done movie to go along with a much loved brand. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this movie right up until the finishing touches in order to make sure the movie did Lego justice. Well done to all involved as I'm sure a new lucrative franchise that will be much loved has been born."

","This was a thrilling journey for all the family. There is some great humour in there for both adults and kids with a lot of fun gags & nods to some other titles and some great Lego in jokes. The story line was fun with some good characters and some killer cameos. I also think that this film was actually quite an intelligent movie with some good points & morals. I honestly believe that a lot can be taken from this title for everyone - young and old. It is a nice recap on your childhood as well which was an added bonus. Unlike some other good films where they can start off promising only to slightly veer off - this is certainly not the case with The Lego Movie, this film actually gets better as the film progresses building up to a great fun/action packed finale. I would fully recommend this to all the family."
"matthewssilverhammer","10","1","5","17 February 2014"," Stacks of Awesomeness!
","I could see someone having some small problems with The Lego Movie, but if you leave saying, ""I didn't like that"", you are lying. This is an immensely likable, even lovable, comedy. Full of childlike ingenuity and imagination, it manages to be a pretty blatant Lego commercial while also being a critique of the museum-like treatment of Legos in modern times and a promotion of learning to play again. But most of all, it's just plain fun. Combining elements of Toy Story, Time Bandits, Naked Gun, and ""Adventure Time"", this is by far the most vibrant and funny movie of 2014. It's the story of a construction worker learning to break from his every day, humdrum existence to bring uniqueness back to his world. In order to do this, he must join a slew of pop culture icons, which looks like comic-con threw up Legos. The spoof like humor and great non-sequiturs are the bread and butter, offering constant and consistent laughs. However, the movie succeeds in so many other ways: it's a uniquely shot action movie, makes poignant points about thinking for yourself, and has some great commentary on the difference between truth and cynicism. Even with some potentially heavy-handed schmaltz at the end, the movie manages to just plain work. Perhaps the most impressive part is the animation, which is oddly and insanely beautiful, sticking to the limitation of real Legos. On whole, TLM is a uniquely refreshing experience, laugh-out-loud funny, and stacks of pure awesomeness."

","When the movie was announced, I was excited. When the first poster was unveiled, I was more excited. When the first trailer hit, I was a rolling ball of excitement ready to split open and engulf all of reality in the spontaneous black hole that developed from all my excitement.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Lego so, needless to say, my expectations were high for this one. However, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller hit them all and then decided to go further beyond what I was expecting. To put it simply, ""The Lego Movie"" is awesome and might be the best animated film I have ever seen. I can't think of a single element of this film that didn't work. It was, for the lack of a better wordperfect.<br/><br/>First off, the voice acting is top shelf stuffworthy of the most complex Lego creation the world has ever seenI'm trying to say the actors were awesome and a perfect fit for their roles (get it? Fit?). Everyone from the characters who only show up for one line to the main stars like Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Charlie Day, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and more, really delivered in not only making the film extremely hilarious but brought their characters to life in a way that made the Lego world feel legit and right out of the imagination of a childor me when my girlfriend works late and I pull out my big box o' Lego.<br/><br/>Then there's the fantastic story that takes all the various types of humor the film contains and mixes perfectly with just enough heart and emotion to make the film resonatenot to mention the story itself is just a rich stew of unique creativity that feels like a shining jewel and a beacon of awesome in a world of movies that many are starting to think has become stale and complacent.<br/><br/>Finally, the animation is some of the most amazing I've ever seen dance upon the big screen. The way the animators seamlessly married 3D and stop-motion ended up creating a world of Legos that is every Lego fans' dream. The way they were able to make literally everything (fire, smoke, water and more) look like it was made of the greatest toy every created and an object feared by bare feet was just an awesome sight. I could throw all kinds of words to describe how cool the final product looked but words just can't do the animation justice.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is, plain and simple, awesome. The jokes, story, heart and animation come together to make a magical film that is unlike any other animated movie to ever exist. Just like toys, the movie is something that everyone can enjoy and, also like the toy, the scope of what the film delivers and is able to create feels limitless.<br/><br/>Hi! My name is Rev.

","I suck at building Lego's. I could never fully complete one without having missed a piece and then I would get frustrated and smash it.<br/><br/>Luckily, The Lego Movie did not bring flashbacks of that time in my life. Rather, it brought a new appreciation for the little plastic blocks that have been around since the 1940s.<br/><br/>It may come as a surprise that a Lego Movie has yet to be made. But unlike any other movie made off of a toy or board game, it was actually quite exceptional.<br/><br/>After Lord Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) takes the Kragle from Vitruvius (voiced by none other than Morgan Freeman) and becomes ruler of the Lego World, we are introduced to plain and ordinary Emmett, who is lovingly voiced by Chris Pratt. Emmett lives a lonely life but still finds everything ""awesome"" as the song in the movie states. He is just another construction worker in the vast city of Bricksburg, which is full of Lord Business' companies and coffee is outrageously expensive. But when Emmett stumbles upon the Piece of Resistance, it is revealed that he is the prophesied ""chosen one.""<br/><br/>And so he sets off with Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) on a crazy adventure in order to stop Lord Business from using the Kragle to glue the entire world together.<br/><br/>The adventure is a non-stop thrill ride, that does drag on a bit, but it never quite stops being entertaining and inventive. One can say this is the most innovative and original kid's movies in a long time. Everything in the world is made to look like Lego's, even the water and lava. It is an animator's paradise.<br/><br/>The movie also brings in a vast assortment of supporting characters; from Superman (Channing Tatum) to the Good/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and Star Wars characters Lando, Han, and C-3PO, the movie is chock-full of different forms of ""geekdom."" You are always anticipating who could possibly show up next, and each time you are delighted and surprised at how each of the character's has their own unique style of humor and personality for just being a little piece of plastic.<br/><br/>I can't really stop praising how this movie balanced creative humor and action with heartwarming messages about fitting in and being accepted. Pixar has a target on their back now, because this is almost a new generation of Toy Story.<br/><br/>The possibilities of sequels are endless for The Lego Movie. Much akin to Wreck-It Ralph, The Lego Movie has enough material to make dozens of sequels with the same characters or even more from the Lego Universe. It is only a matter of time now, and I will be first in line to a sequel.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a completely innovative and original movie full of humor, adventure, and a cast filled with great voice actors, go check this out, even if you are an adult.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"

","Movies like this make me reminisce about my childhood and the motion pictures that were released back then, most notably the Disney movies from the early 90's and the very first Toy Story movie. I look at the legacy those films have accrued and how good it felt to be a kid back then because of how charming these movies were for the time period, and suddenly the dots become connected: This movie fits the definition of that type of nostalgia.... only with TODAY'S generation.<br/><br/>I was absolutely captivated by this wonderful little gem of a movie. I found myself catching an afternoon showing of it, in a theatre packed to the hilt with families bringing their young children. I never felt so old as I did at that point, being a lone 24 year old male getting ready to view a widely perceived ""kid-friendly"" movie. What transpired over that next hour and a half runtime, took my breath away...............literally, from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The charm that oozed from this movie was absolutely enthralling; so much to the point that you couldn't help but smile and root for the characters. Backed by a flavourful cast of voice actors, this movie had absolutely no problems trying to delve into each character's soul and churn out such intrinsic value. Some of the most notable mentions would have to be delegated to Chris Pratt, the voice of our hero, and Morgan Freeman (as always). The soundtrack absolutely had my head bobbing, and the main theme song (which shall remain nameless in the hopes of withholding spoilers) had me bobbing my head and humming it for days after I viewed the movie.<br/><br/>It was such a fun little ride to sit through and by the time we reached the very end, a little ""twist"" came that helped drive the story into deeper emotional territory. I did not see this coming and I was instantly transfixed on how powerful this message really was. For what it's worth, if I were to have any sort of gripe with this film, it would have to be that I don't think it catered enough to the toddler demographic, a sizable portion of the auditorium's attendees. Many of the humour, subtle allusions, inside jokes, or character references utilized throughout the film could only be cued in by somebody of much higher age, wisdom and knowledge. However, this isn't to say that kids from ages 8 and up wouldn't be able to understand.. I just think that anything younger than that is too much for them to bear.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I've only seen this movie once and I can ALREADY deem it quotable because I can recite these quotes from memory. The year 2014 has gone off to a tremendous start for me, a much needed relief from the trepidation that was 2013. However, this movie has already earned two thumbs up from me! UNLEASH THE KRAGL!!"

Though I'm always skeptical of celebrity voice acting, all the actors do a great job here, especially Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>The story riffs on the oft-used ""chosen one saves the world"" plot and comes across as something a child would make up as they went along. It is this quality that transports the viewer back to his or her own childhood.

I had little to no expectations, which was perhaps for the best because I really enjoyed The LEGO Movie.<br/><br/>One of the most enjoyable things about The LEGO Movie is it's bizarreness and just how strange a lot of the plot is. It's very over the top, silly and often hilarious. Some of the jokes fall flat, and the humour becomes tiresome at a few points but the rest of the movie is so damn good that it's forgivable. Characters are very well developed, with more depth and emotion given to minifigures than I ever thought would be possible. This is a movie about LEGO that actually manages to illicit an emotional response. As unbelievable as this may sound, it's true, and the filmmakers deserve some serious applause for it. The film is very fast paced and rarely slows down, which may be a problem for some viewers but I didn't mind it. The movie manages to showcase lots of different branches of LEGO without feeling like an advert or promotion, which is a major problem that the movie could have easily fell subject to. There was a point where I became worried the film was turning into something not dissimilar to the Spongbob Squarepants movie (which I hate) but there was no need to worry, as the movie took this reason for worry and turned it into possibly the best thing about the movie.<br/><br/>The voice cast is excellent as well. Chris Pratt is continuously climbing the ladder into Hollywood stardom and The LEGO Movie will only help push him up further. He proves he has a great voice for animation and does an excellent job leading the movie. Supporting cast members including Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Charlie Day, Will Ferrel, Allison Brie and Nick Offerman are also great. Will Arnett deserves a special mention for delivering one of the most memorable Batman performances ever, and Jonah Hill does a better job as Green Lantern in a minor role than Ryan Reynolds did in a full movie.<br/><br/>Arguably the most impressive aspect of The LEGO Movie is it's animation style. A someone who has made a lot of LEGO stop motion videos in the past, I found some of the visuals in the movie absolutely mind blowing. I know that the movie is CGI mixed with stop motion, but there aren't any obvious CGI sections, it all blends together flawlessly. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller do an incredible job directing and deserve all of the praise they will inevitably receive, I wouldn't be surprised to see them receiving some huge projects in the near future. The soundtrack is excellent, and at it's core The LEGO Movie has a wonderful message, which I won't spoil but I will say this; while watching The LEGO Movie, all your worries disappear and you're taken back to your childhood, a time when everything was simpler, and everything was awesome. If that's not a good enough reason to see The LEGO Movie, then I don't know what is."

","My 9yr old is a huge Lego fan. We both love the Lego Star Wars (mini) movies and all the Lego PS3 games. There was a handful of funny parts in this movie and a lot of it was kinda boring- even to my son, he was disappointed too. The plot, dialog, and even the Lego toys associated with this film are disappointing. (Some of the best constructs in the film you only see for like 1 second - like the Ice Cream truck). It really seems like the people who wrote this were more determined to get across their (infomercial like) messages than creating a fun story line. Here are the messages: Buy Legos- all kinds of Legos, see all the different kinds we have. Don't be afraid to break things down and start over doing something new and creative. Don't be afraid to be different, be yourself. Even grown ups and girls like Legos. Some of these are great messages but they did not put them together and make them really entertaining. What a great talent pool they had of actors too, what a waste."

","I am not the biggest fan of animated films; a lot of them just pass me by and that's fine. But every now and then there is one that stands out and i feel inclined to go see it. From the trailer it was apparent that ""Lego Movie"" was going to be one of those stand out films. From the get go It showed quick witted quirky humor; catering to both the young and the older audience. It is funny, plain and simple. It mixes silly comedy with well thought out wit and the timing is at points impeccable. The story is that of a usual animated film; an underdog overcomes his mundane , mediocre life to become a hero. It's a standard plot in most animated films. But this brings a sharpness to it that others don't. The time breezes past and you can't help but enjoy it. And the visuals? Well they excellent and add to the enjoyment.<br/><br/>A great film where the only disappointment was the 2 devilish children to my right. One of which didn't seem to grasp the concept of their juice being finished and continued to suck on the straw anyway. The other feeling inclined to stomp his feet throughout....ah the joys of children eh? <br/><br/>Those two demons aside it was a very good film - 7.5/10"
"armandoin","9","1","5","11 February 2014"," One of the best animated features in many years
","Coming in to a movie called ""The Lego Movie"" made me instantly assume I was in for a full-length product placement of a toy brand that, frankly, I was not completely enamored with when I was a kid. If this is indeed an extended Lego commercial as the title suggests, then consider me bought because I have just witnessed one of the best animated features in many years.<br/><br/>From the creators of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller constructed a relentlessly funny and hyperactive animated romp with a surprising final act that is emotional, inspiring and imaginative.<br/><br/>Mixing slick animation with slapstick comedy, as well as intelligent script full of zippy zingers delivered one after the other, the movie may appeal as much to nostalgic adult male audiences reminiscing their childhood Lego blocks, as well as young viewers who will be engrossed by the spectacular visuals and a lineup of hilarious and familiar characters from DC comics, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings doing their comedic turn amongst fresh and equally entertaining original characters.<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers .....<br/><br/>The story is simple. It is about Emmet (Chris Pratt), a simple ordinary construction guy who listens to pop music (in this case ""Everything is Awesome"" a juvenile bubblegum pop that is also disturbingly catchy), pays expensive coffee and strictly follows Lego's instruction manual to live his life of daily routines.<br/><br/>The leader of this Matrix-like world is President Business (Will Ferrell). He keeps everything in place, so determined in fact he plans on literally using Kragle glue to keep everyone's feet firmly attached to the ground.<br/><br/>Enter Wyldstyles, (Elizabeth Banks), our free spirited tomboyish heroine who also happens to be dating Batman, (Will Arnett). She meets Emmet and the adventure into the fascinating world of Lego begins.<br/><br/>The movie is downright riotous and chaotic, clearly reflecting how Lego is supposedly played. One second the screen is littered with pieces of Lego blocks, then an ocean of super creative buildings, planes and fascinating background that will inspire one's creative imagination.<br/><br/>This movie should be experienced in all its 3D glory.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie reminds us that the power of imagination and teamwork can go together in the process of building and creation, a message so simple yet surprisingly uncommon not just in animated features but movies in general."

It went from really good, to great, to amazing!! The underlying message that's conveyed is a truly special one and the surprise ending put it way over the top!! This isn't just a great animation movie, the story behind it all is fantastic. It's fun, energetic, positive and 'everything is awesome'!! I fully recommend it!!

","The Lego Movie is an instant classic and original. It shares a good mix of action, adventure, and definitely COMEDY. This movie is hilarious for all ages. Half of the audience in the theater were just adults coming to see it. It has a very creative story which I didn't really expect. I honestly thought the first 5-10 minutes of the movie was just boring and not funny, but I guess they were just trying to explain the back story. Because after that I about died in laughter. The Lego Movie shares a message, maybe not a heart warming message but it still is good and true. To sum it all up, The Lego Movie is a movie like not many. It's creative, action packed, and probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. I recommend this movie, rather if your a builder or not. The Lego Movie was truly AWESOME!!"
"clementlelong","8","1","5","11 February 2014"," I used to work at Lego... kind of
","Living in Montreal, I worked for Mega Brands, Lego's #1 competitor in the world of construction toys. I spent the entire day with ""builders"" and ""designers"" who - like me - had always loved playing with Lego toys. They were brilliant people creating amazing toys with bricks, showing creativity and passion for toys and Lego.<br/><br/>So you can imagine that when I went to see the Lego Movie, my expectations were pretty high... and I was not disappointed one bit! Not only is it always fun to see iconic toys you played with being brought to life on screen, but also they actually wrote a script for the movie. I was expecting a simple use of a famous brand to make some dollars like the many catastrophes we've seen lately in theatres - Battleship, Transformers, and to some minor extent G.I. Joe. But luckily for us grown-up kids, they took good care of their bricks, our bricks, our Lego.<br/><br/>The story can be seen at different levels and refers to different layers of pop culture, literature, and art. This is why the movie is completely accessible to children, and definitely not boring for teens and adults; so you can make it a family moment, or just a you time. Up to you! And for once, Will Ferell actually serves the story in an efficient way instead of being a 90s evade from SNL who never really escaped his home TV show.<br/><br/>So yes, I would completely recommend it to viewers of all ages, from all places, and of course, to you Lego fans out there. We're a huge crowd!"

","Just took my kids (10 and 13) to see this movie tonight. They both enjoyed it very much. My son celebrated his tenth birthday at LEGOLAND California last summer, and we saw our first preview for the Lego Movie there. Definitely exceeded my expectations. I certainly thought it would be similar to the direct to DVD stuff that my son has enjoyed for years. But, as you may have heard by now, it is far more than that. I will say that the only time I truly laughed out loud (mild SPOILER ahead) was when Lando Calrissian appeared and spoke as an exaggerated (mega flirty) version of his character. Classic stuff. However, as a Trek fan I laughed when there was reference made to Abraham Lincoln's ""space chair."" Anyone remember how Lincoln first appeared in TOS episode ""The Savage Curtain?"" In a chair. In space. Yes, that's how good the Lego Movie is. You'll have to see it multiple times to catch all the jokes and references."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","5","10 February 2014"," The best animated movie of all time!
","The Lego Movie is a movie about, plainly speaking, Legos. When President Business(Will Ferell), threatens to glue the Lego universe together using an adhesive called Kragle, it is up to the 'MasterBuilder', Emmet Brickowoski(Chris Pratt) to stop him using the Piece of Resistance. Emmett is helped by other MasterBuilders like, Wyldstyle/Lucy(Elizabeth Banks), Batman(Will Arnett), Unikitty(Alison Brie), Benny(Charlie Day), Abraham Lincoln(Will Forte), Wally(Dave Franco), the all-knowing Vitrivius(Morgan Freeman), Superman(Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman(Cobie Smulders), Green Lantern(Jonah Hill), Barry(Jake Johnson), Shaq(Shaquille O'Neal), Metal Beard(Nick Offerman) & Shakespeare(Jorma Taccone). The only problem is, Emmett has never had an original idea throughout his life. Also, standing in the MasterBuilders' way is President Business, Bad Cop/Good Cop(Liam Neeson) & the president's various robotic lackeys. <br/><br/>The Lego Movie is mind numbingly outstanding! The animation is first rate, considering that all the characters & the environment in the movie look like Lego figurines & Lego building blocks. Phil Lord & Chris Miller have proved their directorial skills, once again. The duo's directing skills vary from animated movies like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs & The Lego Movie to hilarious adult comedies like 21 Jump Street(can't wait for the upcoming sequel, 22 Jump Street). The voice acting is exceptional, with an all-star voice cast. Chris Pratt is brilliant as the protagonist, Emmett Brickowoski. Will Arnett is hysterical as the Lego version of Batman. Elizabeth Banks is great as Wyldstyle/Lucy. Alison Brie is adorable as Unikitty. Charlie Day is eccentric & hilarious as 1980s something space guy, Benny. Will Ferell is diabolical & menacing as President Business. Will Forte is impressive as Abraham Lincoln. Dave Franco is effective as Wally. Morgan Freeman is mind blowing as the wise elder, Vitrivius. Todd Hansen is great as Gandalf. Channing Tatum is outstanding as Superman. Cobie Smulders is good as Wonder Woman. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Green Lantern. I would have liked to see more interaction between Superman & Batman since we have to wait till 2016 for the Batman/Superman crossover film. Jake Johnson is effective as Barry. Liam Neeson shines in his varied portrayal of Bad Cop/Good Cop/Pa Cop. Shaquille O'Neal is effective as Shaq. Nick Offerman is ovation-worthy as pirate, Metal Beard. Anthony Daniels, Keith Ferguson & Billy Dee Williams are great as Star Wars veterans, C-3PO, Han Solo & Lando respectively. The supporting characters are effective as well. The soundtrack is foot-tapping & catchy at the same time. I would like to conclude by saying, The Lego Movie is a must watch & will go down in history as one of the classics, animated or otherwise."

","*NOTE* Before I begin this review, the rating button was gone when I was typing this review. I do not know what has happened but I will continue to write reviews with my Grade and Number Rating if I never see it ever again. Now onto the review! Am I The Only One Who Thinks This is Great Political Commentary on Today's Society? No. Just ask Mark Caleb Smith in his article called ""Everything is Awesome: The Politics Of The Lego Movie"" Which says that the film takes place in a dictatorship or Totalitarianism Government and ends on a great note.<br/><br/>Why? Lets begin with the story. The Lego Movie follows Emmett who is a construction worker in Lego City. He one day falls into a hole finding a red Lego piece and blanks out. He wakes up being interrogated by Good Cop/Bad Cop and is rescued by a rebel who mistakes him as a Master Builder. He now has to get the Red Lego Piece to put on a glue stick to stop President Business from gluing everything together. On his way he meets a bunch of colorful characters and cameos.<br/><br/>I went to see a Sold out Showing at 7:45 tonight and it didn't disappoint. Everyone was laughing, cheering, and applauding till the end. The children in the auditorium were very quiet while watching this which I'm surprised by considering when I went to see Planes they were loud and noisy.<br/><br/>The casting was good. Alison Brie plays a cross between a unicorn and a cat who likes happy thoughts and love. But don't make her angry or she will turn into a monster! She was probably my favorite character in this entire film and her casting was perfect because Brie is well known for playing soft hearted cheery women.<br/><br/>As for the story, I love it! I love that clichéd story where the chosen one has to save the world! It never gets old.<br/><br/>The animation is brilliant combining stop motion and CGI technology to make one of the most breathtaking experiences in movies for this year.<br/><br/>I wont spoil the twists, but they are awesome and unpredictable.<br/><br/>As I was saying about the Political Commentary, The Film's Characters are based off real life people. President Business compares to many Dictators. Unicorn Kitty represents many Russian Leaders of The Soviet Union. So on and So On. But in the end, The Fascist Government is torn apart and individualism spreads joy around the world. I know it sounds crazy, but its true! Look at their characteristics and worlds and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>This movie is really good. They did an excellent job with everything from the witty script to the casting to the animation. Its a really good family film that will be looked back by children in years to come.<br/><br/>Definite must see movie.<br/><br/>89/100 B+"
"Andy-296","9","1","5","9 February 2014"," Surprisingly good, animated film is a triumph
","A very entertaining, wildly imaginative animated film based on a seemingly terrible material: the Danish brand of toy interlocking bricks. Emmet is an everyman construction worker who works for the Octan Corporation, the only company in the very conformist Legoland and whose president is the evil Lord Business (for a movie that includes a brand in its title, its tone is surprisingly anti corporate). When Emmet unexpectedly finds a piece called the Piece of Resistance (whom a Gandalf-like wizard called Vitruvius has prophesied would be found by the chosen one who would overthrow the tyranny of Lord Business), he is sought by the henchmen of Lord Business, while he is helped in his escape by the rebel girl Wildstyle. Funny and entertaining (the movie includes an extended part of a Lego Batman), surprisingly profound at times (the movie in some way is a paean to common man Emmet) and with nods to such films as The Truman Show and The Matrix. The dazzling computer animation and the intelligent script help a lot. Among the actors giving voice to the animated characters are Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. Towards the end, two human actors (including Ferrell) appear to give the plot a tight ending."
"zactac","10","1","5","9 February 2014"," Funny, surprising, and absolutely charming.
","I think it's safe to say that most movies based off of toys never really end well. So that brings up the question: does ""The Lego Movie"" fall into the same sad category such as the ""Transformers"" series and ""Battleship"" or does it break that problem that has plagued toy adaptations for years? The answer is, happily, the latter.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is about the journey of one tiny Lego figure named Emmet. In an ancient prophecy it was foreshadowed that a mighty hero would come and save the Lego Universe from a terrible villain who planned on gluing the entire universe together.<br/><br/>Just like the toy that inspired it, this movie was brimming with imagination from top to bottom. From the Lego city that Emmet lives in to oceans of the Lego Universe this was imaginative all the way through. And honestly, that alone is worthy of praise. Many films now are mainly just recycled ideas without any true inspiration put into them. However, this was not the case with ""The Lego Movie"". Watching this movie you can tell the filmmakers had an absolute blast going into such an imaginative world. The possibilities were endless and that is really what made the difference.<br/><br/>On top of imagination, this film is also filled with an intelligent (and even satirical) look at everyday life and a look at the role of the government (and our roles included). Just having a look at Emmet's life in the city you could tell this made fun of ordinary life, not in a mean way but an honest way. We wake up everyday and go throughout our daily lives greeting people, working at our jobs (whatever they may be), going home to relax for the next day alone or with people we care about, and getting up the next day. This sequence was exquisitely done, from the first scene of the President giving a vague, yet threatening, message to his people being undermined by the plain brainwashing of his people to the overall idea of being who we truly are. Wonderfully done.<br/><br/>A lot of this is due to the excellent work by its A-list voice cast. Chris Pratt did wonderful work as Emmet, with him portraying the poor naivety of the Lego piece and his transition to someone willing to think for himself. The same can be said of Elizabeth Banks (hilarious as Wyldstyle), Will Ferrell as the villain, and Will Arnett (as Batman who ironically enough became the funniest character in the movie). Thanks to the great cast these characters will definitely be remembered for a very long time.<br/><br/>So adults, I just want to remind you that this is a movie that you will enjoy, maybe even more than your children will. Not only is it a smart satirical look at government and everyday life but it also has a self-aware humor mixed with pop culture references that will have you rolling on the floor laughing. A prime example of this is Batman and the wonderful way they play to his cynicism. In the movies and comics we know Batman as the cynic he is but in such a colorful world there is just so much material to play off of it would've been a miscarriage of justice to ignore it. Well done Lego.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a wonderful way to start off animation for 2014. Already at a stronger place than animation was this time last year, ""The Lego Movie"" has definitely raised the bar where toy adaptations (and maybe even animated movies in general) are concerned. Wonderful storytelling mixed with great characters, beautiful visuals, plenty of humor to spare, and a great message about finding the hero in all of us; ""The Lego Movie"" has proved that there is life for toy adaptations after all."

","I've been excited for this movie ever since the first trailer emerged online. Having grown up playing with Lego for hours on end, this movie seemed like a godsend!<br/><br/>I managed to book tickets for the advanced screenings this weekend, and I couldn't have wished for a better film. Right from the opening scene where we meet our hero Emmett, til the end credits I was hooked and loving it!<br/><br/>The whole movie is an animated spectacle, stunning to behold and very 'Lego-like'. When we are introduced to Emmett we learn he's a construction worker, leading us into a fantastic tried and tested 'hero vs villain' kids movie theme. But the twist-ish ending adds a new dimension to this theme (I won't divulge that, you need to see the movie!)<br/><br/>The voice acting is just amazing. Having never really seen anything with Chris Pratt before this movie, his contribution as Emmett was just incredible. Elizabeth Banks delivers another great performance as the heroine Lucy / Wildstyle. Will Ferrell was also outstanding playing the villain Lord Business, but also appears at the end (which again, I'm not divulging!) But it's the additional characters that make the film feel extra special; Batman, 80's something spaceman and Unikitty bring some excellent comedy moments to the film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to the film is perfect, and the theme song 'Everything Is Awesome' never gets old, despite being played numerous times throughout the film. I'd even go as far as to say...it's actually a very catchy song!!!<br/><br/>If I had one gripe about the Lego Movie (and it is the only one I have) it would be that the action scenes seems a bit too fast paced, sometimes it was difficult to make out exactly what was happening during fight / chase scenes. It could be that I watched the movie in 3D and that threw me off a bit. <br/><br/>So to summarize...<br/><br/>If you're looking for an hour and a half of absolute entertainment, laughs and thrills for the whole family, the Lego Movie will deliver guaranteed."

"shawneofthedead","8","1","5","8 February 2014"," Bring on the inevitable (and already-announced) sequel!
","These days, too many movies are made with one eye on their merchandising potential. Tie-ins and merch - toys/books/Happy McMeals - are planned with as much gravity and focus as, well, the actual plot of a film. That's why The LEGO Movie should invite the greatest scepticism: it's a movie literally built out of LEGO, every kid's favourite infinitely- connectable toy bricks. It's a franchise masquerading as a film, and should be derided as such... right? Well, not quite. As it turns out, The LEGO Movie has fast become one of the best-reviewed films of the year - and for very good reason. Smart, inventive and truly hilarious, it's proof that a purely commercial enterprise can still earn genuine, heartfelt delight from audiences.<br/><br/>Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is a perfectly ordinary LEGO figure - the kind of dude who tries really hard to fit in (ha!) and follows the instruction manual to the letter. He has no idea, of course, that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) has cooked up a nefarious scheme to bring permanent order to the LEGO universe, and that Master Builders across the galaxies are banding together in wait for the foretold Special: the Master Builder who will save them all. When Emmet accidentally bumps into spunky Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), he picks up the mythical Piece Of Resistance: the fabled relic that will stop Lord Business in his tracks.<br/><br/>Cue hijinks galore as Emmet is mistaken for the Special and swiftly swept up in an underground movement spearheaded by Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a wise, elderly Master Builder with a (stereo)typically sonorous voice. Emmet must find a way to save the world - something he's not sure he's qualified to do, especially when he's in the company of such diverse superheroes as Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Abraham Lincoln (Will Forte), Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders) and... uh, sparkling, rainbow-bright Unikitty (Alison Brie).<br/><br/>The chipper, joyful tone adopted by The LEGO Movie is what makes it such an utter delight to watch. Not only does the film trundle through one huge, action-packed set-piece after another (all gloriously executed in a combination of CGI and stop-motion animation), it's also shot through with a streak of cheerful, anarchic humour. Jokes fly thick and fast across the screen, packed so tightly together that if any one fails, there are about five more turning up in quick succession. It's hard to begrudge the film anything when its version of Batman is moody, broody, and willing to deal only in sombre-coloured bricks. This cheeky blend of irreverence and humour means that adults will find themselves every bit as entertained as the kids in the audience.<br/><br/>It's even more remarkable when the plot unfolds to display in full its surprisingly meta-rich complexity. Turns out that the toy franchise's many LEGO lines - each with its own story and characters - gets to play a part as Emmet and Wyldstyle go hunting for an answer to the world's dilemma. Even more impressively, the world of LEGO is effectively deconstructed in the film's third act and placed firmly in the hands of anyone who's ever tried to make something out of these little toy bricks - from carefree kids to obsessed adults. It plays on precisely what makes the brand so appealing: the seemingly endless potential wrapped up in these LEGO worlds, limited only by one's imagination.<br/><br/>The character work in the film is sublime, augmented by a wonderful cast of voice actors. Emmet - an everyman brimming with cheer and promise - suits Pratt to a T, and Banks struts her stuff as the independent, kickass Wyldstyle. Arnett is a highlight, his trademark deep voice played up to hilarious effect in Batman mode. The cast even includes sly winks to movie franchises (reuniting 21 Jump Street's Tatum with his co-star Jonah Hill, who voices Superman's super-fan, Green Lantern) and the clever-old-codger trope (Freeman is clearly having a blast as the slightly bonkers Vitruvius), while providing Liam Neeson with more acting range than he's had in a while as Lord Business' henchman, a cop with a personality split between good and bad.<br/><br/>Not every element of The LEGO Movie works perfectly - in the tumult of surreal comedy and surprisingly emotional plot, not all the bits fit together quite as perfectly as they should. It's a mite predictable, for instance, that Emmet and Wyldstyle inevitably fall in love despite her ongoing relationship with the self-absorbed Batman. But it's impossible to get too upset about it when the final result is packed with so much silly, cheerful fun. In the words of the film's upbeat theme tune, ""Everything is AWESOME!"" And so it is - for the most part."
"japhetaguirre","9","1","5","8 February 2014"," Is this Toy Story 4?
","Now, don,t get met wrong on my summary for it is a positive one. A movie about a toy product? Some would say it would be ridiculous, but if it is, this one is ridiculously awesome!!!<br/><br/>Like the what the theme song in the trailer said, everything here is awesome: the animation, the characters, the theme, and the twist.<br/><br/>The animation here is very good. I don't really know if it's stop-motion or computer-generated, but it's pleasing to the eyes. It looks like the came zoomed in on lego toys. And you can see different locations made out of lego---the Wild West, the Middle Zealand, the city, the place in the cloud which I forgot what its name was. With everything made of Lego (even the waters are made of it, not kidding), the whole movie looks like a giant exhibit on Legoland.<br/><br/>The main character in the movie is Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt, who is just a regular guy wanting to be special. He's the scene-stealer because you really feel for him. Of course, there's also other characters voiced by famous actors like Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, and many more. But the side character I like the most is the Bad Cop (not Batman coz he's a dick in this movie). Voiced by Liam Neeson, he a cop with two sides: good and bad. He's bad but he's also good and hey, it's pleasing to hear Liam's voice in an animated movie.<br/><br/>The cameos of different lego characters is where I laughed the most. I'm not gonna spoil for it you but there's superheroes, athletes, space dude whose partner is a hairy creature, poet, president, etc.<br/><br/>What's most important in this movie is the theme. It's centered on the product and for the people who owns legos and other toys--specially the older ones. Also not gonna say it. You have to watched to movie to find out. <br/><br/>I didn't expect that this movie would have an emotional kick in the final act.

","The symbolism in this movie is outstanding. This is a very big movie on so many levels that most audiences won't understand (except on a subconscious level perhaps). Oh, and it's funny and keeps kids entertained too! My kids were laughing throughout the movie, and although they didn't understand the underlying symbolism or any of the ""adult"" oriented jokes, it was entertaining enough to keep kids, adults, and even elderly in the audience entertained at a purely superficial level. At a deeper level, there's plenty of brilliant use of words, symbols, names, and a very deep story of creation, cosmic laws and free-thinking that will leave you pondering this movie for weeks to come. A must-see for all, and I would recommend NOT waiting for this to come out on DVD as the 3-D effects and animation are incredible!"
"williampsamuel","10","1","6","12 December 2014"," Smart, funny, and refreshingly original, everything is awesome in the Lego Movie
","There's a song which plays at several points in the Lego movie called ""Everything is Awesome."" The song itself is a generic, unremarkable, annoyingly catchy piece of techno pop, which some of the main characters make a point of deriding. But it perfectly sums up the Lego Movie, because everything in this movie is awesome. There is so much action, so much humor, so many characters and settings. It would take all the money in Hollywood to make a movie with this many explosions, car chases, aerial chases, giant robot battles and magical worlds, not to mention the problems with continuity and logic. But with Lego none of that matters because a world made entirely out of interlocking plastic bricks has its own.<br/><br/>That's why a lowly construction worker can become the chosen hero by falling down a hole and touching a glowing brick, then find himself on the run from every cop in the world with a beautiful mysterious woman, all with no idea what's going on and barely more exposition than I've just given here. That's why Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Abraham Lincoln, the 2002 NBA all-stars and a cat/unicorn thing that talks like certain infamous ponies can all be characters in the same movie, and can go from a modern city to the old west, ""Middle Zealand"", the bottom of the sea and a giant office building above ""the void of nothingness"" with no complicated explanation. Heck, in a world made of Legos it doesn't even matter why the evil Lord Business and his henchman Bad Cop want to destroy the world, or why they don't have better names than ""Lord Business"" and ""Bad Cop."" None of this matters because it just doesn't and because everything is so awesome. The frequent action scenes continually outdo each other in spectacle and ridiculousness. The jokes are constant and come in every variety from simple puns, slapstick and sight gags to subtle film and historical references, witty social commentary, and in-jokes about this movie's lack of logic. Plus the movie makes full use of the alternate logic I mentioned earlier. If something catches on fire, fire shaped Lego pieces cover it. Ocean waves are shifting piles of blue studs. Polish remover can get rid of unwanted alternate. The fact that anything can be taken apart and turned into anything else isn't just a cute gimmick; it's a major plot device. And it's hard to imagine a movie that's not in Lego featuring a decapitation and keeping a G-rating.<br/><br/>And then comes the twist; the kind of twist to make a young and still talented M. Night Shyamalan jealous. A twist that not only changes everything, but explains everything: the extremely loose continuity, why the characters that aren't recognizable pop culture figures are generic clichés, even why the elderly wizard's advice sounds like a mix of worn out platitudes and recent pop culture slogans. It's a twist that's so obvious in retrospect but so works perfectly anyway. What I'm saying here is that it's a really good twist. And even better is what the filmmaker's do with it, turning a sprawling fantasy/ sci-fi epic into a charming tale about the power of childlike imagination. The first hour is pure fun and will delight children of all ages. The imagination and depth of the last fifteen minutes make the Lego Movie the best animated feature since Toy Story 3."

","This is one of my favourite movies of all time! it is a hilarious movie that will be loved by both young and old. I am a teenager and I thoroughly enjoyed it, it wouldn't be a lie if I said this was one of my favourite movies to date. I loved playing with LEGO when I was younger and I still show a great interest in it. I used to hope that they would bring LEGO to the big screen, but as the years went on I started doubting that it would happen, so I'm so happy that I got to see it when I'm still young. there is a great cast including some of my favourites - Chris Pratt (who I did not know before seeing this movie, who I love after seeing the Lego Movie. So when 'guardians of the galaxy' came out a reason I wanted to see it was because Chris was going to be in it.), Liam Neeson and Will Ferell. There are also a lot of other amazing actors involved including Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett. Overall this movie is definitely worth seeing. You should definitely, (like I did), BUY IT."

"japamo","10","1","6","26 November 2014"," Everyone Is Special
","If the Academy Awards had a category for ""Fastest-Paced Feature"", I think ""The LEGO Movie"" (hereafter ""LEGO"") would slaughter any competition (even ""Hotel Transylvania"" – see my Amazon review). ""LEGO"" has an interlocking-brick universe to show us, so it hardly pauses for breath as it attempts to show it all – from cities to oceans to clouds to outer space to even, believe it or not, our own human world. The movie demands multiple viewings just to take all the spectacular visuals in.<br/><br/>At an initial, casual glance, ""LEGO"" just seems concerned with being a movie-length commercial for the classic, versatile construction toy. And that it effectively is, but ""LEGO"" is insidiously so much more. Through a nondescript, super-ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowski's (Chris Platt's) efforts to prove worthy of his ""special"" destiny and thwart Lord (President) Business's (Will Ferrell) goal to not only conquer the LEGO universe but also make it permanently in his own image with the ""Kragle"" (which is really sticky stuff), ""LEGO"" reassures us that we all have individual AND cooperative talents that can and deserve to be used to create great things.<br/><br/>For most of ""LEGO"" though, we have our doubts about Emmet's ""specialness"". Oh, he's a pleasant and genial enough LEGO figure, but he seems to lead a severely regulated but unproductive and almost invisible life. But then by chance within the rubble of a construction site, he finds the red ""Piece De Resistance"", also sought after by Wyldstyle (real name: Lucy) (Elizabeth Banks), a nimble, technically adept ""Master Builder"" and street fighter. Because the ""Piece de Resistance"" is the only object that can neutralize the ""Kragle"", Wyldstyle thinks that Emmet is the ""Special"" or chosen one prophesized to defeat Lord Business. Before Emmett knows it, Wyldstyle brings him to meet other Master Builders led by the blind sage Vetruvius (Morgan Freeman) also determined to stop the egotistical tyrant. Despite Vetruvius's and Wyldstyle's encouragement and guidance, Emmett has a very tough time living up to the prophecy. He vainly protests that not only is he not ""special"", he's not even a Master Builder.<br/><br/>As Emmett and company careen through the LEGO universe, Emmet's ego takes more of a beating as he meets a vast cast of characters from practically every action picture, comic, and cartoon ever made (from Milhouse Van Houten to Superman) who are all talented and/or Master Builders. Most damaging to Emmet's self-esteem is his rival for Wyldstyle's affections, none other than Lego Batman himself (Will Arnett), pumped up with humorless (but funny) self-importance and sense of duty. And these guys are his allies! As for the villains, aided by the schizophrenic Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business cuts an imposing figure as he uses his ""Galactus"" helmet, his telescoping legs, and his huge law enforcement army to cement his rule. Maybe Emmet is out of his league.<br/><br/>Then things start to click as Emmet sacrifices himself to save all the Master Builders, imprisoned by Business in a Think Tank. He plunges into our dimension and into a basement occupied by 8-year old Finn (Jadon Sand), whose own dilemma mirrors Emmet's and may be even controlling Emmet and the other Lego people (no wonder ""LEGO"" seems to be directed by a child's wild flights of storytelling fancy, because it kinda is.) Finn's defiance of his father's (Will Ferrett in real life) stifling of his own imagination gives Emmett the courage to go back to ""LEGOland"" and confront Business in a surprising but calm and life-affirming climax.<br/><br/>LEGO offers boundless, wholesome (except maybe for the pantsless guy in the situation comedy, but don't worry, he's not anatomically correct.:) ) creative fun for people for all ages. But most impressively, LEGO painstakingly convinces us that we all have special talents and skills that should never be suppressed and that can contribute to the betterment of everyone's life. Yep, everyone is special. And that's just awesome!"
"thomas-w15","9","1","6","22 November 2014"," Biggest Surprise Film of the Year!!
","The Lego Movie 7.5/10- When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. I was surprised when I saw it had a 95 on rotten tomatoes. So, I decided to give this movie a chance and could not have been more impressed. Yes, it is funny but the thing that is incredible is the visual effects. It did something that few have done before but it was the first to do it successfully. <br/><br/>You do not have to be a four year old to enjoy this. The Lego Movie is something that we all can appreciate. The plot was somewhat cliché but the way it turns towards the end and gives itself a new direction is really impressive and definitely separates itself from other films of its category. T he visual effects were the thing to talk about. It takes a second to get use to but once you do, you become entranced in the world of legos. Also the way they so quickly build legos like it is a video game and putting it on the screen is stunning.<br/><br/>The decision to make all of the characters from famous lego sets as characters in the movie was very amusing and the only thing that might have did wrong is not having Harry Potter in it. The rest though such as: Batman, Abe Lincoln, Green Lantern, Superman, etc... all did great job in adding something to the plot. <br/><br/>As far as voices go for movies, the Lego Movie did exceptionally well. Then again, with Morgan Freeman being a voice in a movie, it is hard to go wrong. The rest of the cast: Chris Pratt (Emitt), Elizabeth Banks(Wild Style), and Will Arnet(Batman) all did amazing well and I believe the movie would not have been as good with them. <br/><br/>Basically, The Lego Movie is a great choice to go see at the movies and will no doubt be in the line up for the Oscars next year.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","I know some people that compare this movie to Wreck-It Ralph. Personally I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did for Wreck-It Ralph, but that isn't to say this movie wasn't entertaining. It's a creative movie with Lego pieces, quick, snappy and sometimes witty dialogues mixed in with pop-culture references. When it comes to the plot, it's actually quite simple but the journey makes this movie worthwhile. All the voice actors and actresses that actually have a name in the movie industry did a really good job. Like Wreck-It Ralph I liked how certain iconic characters gets thrown into the mix as well. And for the most part it connects well with the story. The climax part of this movie also elevated the score for this movie to 7.9/10 for me. Oh and I also liked the message behind this flick as well, which probably would have benefited me if I saw this movie during my childhood.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

","I watched this film over a month ago and the main theme song is still repeating itself through my head, but i remember this film so well and whenever i hear that song it reminds me of how awesome of a film the Lego Movie was. The jokes are aimed at kids, but some of them especially the subtle ones were hilarious. The writing suited the film and i loved how the film didn't force its serious message, you could argue the message was pointless but i found it gave the film some extra substance. What really stood out was the acting, i felt that all the correct actors had been chosen except for maybe one and that would be Will Ferrell. Now i have never been a big Will Ferrell fan, the only films i like with him in it are Zoolander and the first Anchorman film. And i almost walked out of the cinema because of him i really didn't think he was funny, there was maybe one joke that i chuckled at and it really was something silly. All in all, i felt the movie was awesome and i hope will be remembered and cherished for years to come. 8/10"
"timstarz09","10","1","6","14 May 2014"," 'The Lego Movie' is one of the best animated films of recent years
","What could've been pandering corporate sell-out schlock is instead a smart, creative and beautifully animated satire of Hollywood blockbuster clichés and a surprisingly intelligent analysis of what makes Lego so fun. Like director/screenwriter duo Chris Miller and Phil Lord's previous outings, 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and '21 Jump Street', this film is loaded to the brim with fun and clever gags - at least one per minute.<br/><br/>The film also features some sharp voice work (Chris Pratt in particular has a very naturally comedic voice), an addictive and omnipresent indie pop song serving a higher purpose than you'd think, and a Matrix-like conclusion that puts the film on a completely different level of intelligence.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Lego Movie', and it is truly a film that parents and children can enjoy for different reasons, even going outside of relying on simple, cheap nostalgia for the former group. This was an incredibly well-crafted and entertaining animated film, and I hope to see it at the Oscars this year."

First of all, going in I didn't take into account that the writers of 21 Jump Street made this movie and I loved that movie. So let's start with the story, while being a little clunky at times it's still very enjoyable and the story behind why all this is happening (and I won't spoil it) made this movie go from good to great. Too amazing. The animation in this movie is so incredibly creative. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING including smoke, water and explosions are made with LEGOS. I would've never thought to do something like that and I loved it. Enough that I saw this movie in theaters twice on the same day just cause I wanted to see all of that again. The over the top animation of the characters with the acting is hilarious. In the words of the movie's theme song, everything is awesome!"

""The Lego Movie"" is fast, fun and colorful, and is capped with a surprise twist that had almost as much of an emotional impact on me as the ending of ""Toy Story 3"" did, and in the same way.<br/><br/>My favorite moment is the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, and the alternate version of what happens to it when it's trying to escape the giant space slug in the asteroid field.

"3xHCCH","Null","1","6","11 February 2014"," Extraordinary Imagination
","""The Lego Movie"" is an animated film that uses Lego characters and sets to tell a story of how an ordinary guy can actually be extraordinary.<br/><br/>Emmett is just an ordinary construction worker who always waited for instructions to follow, never having an original thought by himself. Falling into a hole one day, he found a mysterious red block, which attached itself to Emmett's back. This turned out to be the legendary ""Piece of Resistance"". This item can only be possessed by a hero called the ""Special"" destined to save Lego Land from the nefarious President Business, who threatens everything with ""Kragle"". Threatened, Business sics Bad Cop on Emmett to capture him.<br/><br/>Emmett and his friends, the purple-haired Wyldstyle, the old sage Vitruvius and the gruff superhero Batman, escape into Cloud Cuckoo Land to gather up other ""Master Builders"". Who these Master Builders are and how the story goes after this is very complicated to describe in words. It is simply better seen on screen. Just when you think the story is at the limit of its absurdity, a twist happens which grounds everything back to reality.<br/><br/>It was fun to hear the voices of Chris Platt, Will Farrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman bring life to the main character. It was fun to see all those cameo appearances of an array of Lego characters from various special Lego sets in the past. Later, it was fun to find out who voiced them (like Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Charlie Day or Billy Dee Williams). <br/><br/>I felt this was a very imaginative way to tell a relatively common story. The twist at the final act gave it an additional dimension. There is something about Lego that evokes a special kind of nostalgia in older viewers like me. The 3D was also done very well, and was really appropriate for a animated concept like this one. I will not be surprised if this one lands among the Best Animated Feature Films of this year. 8/10."

So far this is not just the best animated movie, but the best movie of the year so far(even though its barely Febuary)<br/><br/>Plot: The plot does follow a specific formula, however it doesn't take away from the overall experience that this film provides. The jokes are fresh, funny and completely original, while also providing great cameos to boost and the 3rd act moved me to tears! YES I cried to The Lego Movie!! 10/10<br/><br/>Voice acting: The voice acting is great! Even though some people you can clearly tell is a certain character(Liam Neson and Morgan Freeman) But the people picked are perfect for their roles. 9/10<br/><br/>Animation: I thought the animation at finest was stop motion, but it was something new and innovative and i couldn't describe what animated the directors were using to make the Legos come to life. You will have to see it to believe it. Everything is so colorful and fun loving! While going dark and gloomy at the necessary moments! To me this was the main highlight of the film and it was as if the director was pulling the animating right from his head and putting it on the big screen! Well thats what movie are supposed to do anyways! The level of imagination is limitless! 10/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The Lego Movie is a fun filled adventure for the whole family! Kids and adults will love this movie! In my opinion its up there with all of the Disney and Pixar films and i don't see how any film will top this one come Oscar time!! Im calling it now, The Lego Movie will win Best Animated Film of the year and it definitely deserves multiple watches! 10/10"

It's clear the filmmakers put a lot of thought and heart into this movie. The Lego Movie is a definite blockbuster. (Yeah that's right, I said blockbuster.)

It's hard to imagine why Lego would allow for this trifle to advertise their products, that is, until you notice the $60,000,000 budget.<br/><br/>The greatest irony of all, is the fact that the film features an evil corporation with a Bond villain CEO who is trying to control the minds of the people.

And while these toys have been transmuted into art, literature, and video games, they had not yet been depicted in film (at least, not theatrically). Well, their time has come at last, and the result is a wildly imaginative and thoughtful film, with all-star voice talent and breathtaking animation. Making excellent use of the various Lego product lines (this is probably the only time you'll see Han Solo and Batman in the same movie), The Lego Move tells a charming tale of how to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, all the while providing slapstick gags and in-jokes to hilarious effect. This film's major flaws are those that are common among animated features: its silliness can get excessive at times, and some gags are used too many times to retain their comedic value. But overall, this is a wonderful movie, and one truly made for all ages."

It's not a simple childish animation, although very bright and shiny which will be the snack for your eyes. However, there are clear mature messages in the movie; rather political and social.
Of course it's a masterpiece made with legos and an incredible amount of hard work has been put into making it. I loved the new ideas they have maintained in the movie and the characters are just lovely. Don't make any mistakes. I'm not saying ""you could learn a lot from the characters' actions because they are so realistic and connecting"", but they have a lot to offer.

I watched this in preparation for its sequel, which opens later today, to see if it would be worth seeing in a theatre. It fell a little flat for me and there was nothing there to interest me in a sequel. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Adventure Animation}"

","I have started watching this movie. I could not watch it. No, really I could not. My brain was all about what am I watching at. Nothing is moving but their facial expressions and voices are to reveal what is going on. Everything else is static, not movable.<br/><br/>I mean, are you joking with me? What kind of music or additional script can compensate for that? It is indeed just some kid moving the figures around and talking to himself of what is happening? If that was actually done that way, without even facial expressions it would be better, on TV, for kids, 2 years old 5 minutes segment.<br/><br/>This is not a movie in any technical sense. There is nothing to like or dislike for me. There is nothing to watch. They say Gandalf was there. Where? One of figurine was Gandalf? Which one? You see, you have to tell me which one.<br/><br/>The major problem is actually a camera work. I mean everything is too big and then suddenly you have to pay attention to a face, one face moving which is just one small part of the screen. There is nothing that points to that particular face, but the surrounding is static and big.<br/><br/>As an experiment, fine, ok, funny, but no more than 5 minutes. A feature movie. No.<br/><br/>The trouble for me is, if this movie has this high rating, what am I going to watch in the future? Nothing. As all people will start liking poop like this one, and I will have to watch ""oldies"" forever.<br/><br/>What is the next movie then? La Linea, full 120 minutes feature. But that cannot work. These kind of cartoons are 5 minutes long for a reason.<br/><br/>As I said this is not a movie, but if somebody was actually able to parse it to 5 minutes segments, maybe it would work then. It does not work for me, except watching a very small portion of on YouTube. Once."

","I watched this movie in 2014 with my uncle in 2014 for my 19th birthday. Weird right? Well that's besides the point. I thought I was going to get a really cool epic awesome movie for kids based off a fun toy with a punch. Too bad there is no punch part. Let's get into why this is the 3rd most overrated animated film of all time. <br/><br/>-STORY-
The story of Lego Star Wars would have worked on paper. It has the set up. A world built. It's basically about a little Lego man who is too normal for his own good. So one day a Deus Ex Machina in female Lego form comes from the heavens to save the red pilled Legoman and whisk him off to become a hero. A somebody. Meanwhile, the evil President Business or whatever is plotting an evil attack to make the world normal or conformist or something by gluing all the character's feet down on Taco Tuesday. Now the protagonist must save the world by getting a team of unlikely heroes straight out of the Wizard of Oz. But not because they are pop culture references made to sell more Lego toys after the movie is over. <br/><br/>They basically save the world by being creative. The challenge here is that Steve is anything but creative. Which is funny. That is basically the only funny part for anyone over the age of 11 because the rest of the story seams to not have very funny jokes. The story basically has the characters win by default. After all if I forgot to tell you, this is a chosen one story which is a dumb cliche and is probably written ironically, (just like every piece of dialogue in this film) <br/><br/>The conflict between President Business and Steve boil down to daddy issues. I'm not even joking that the resolution happens to be that the real life son has a dead beat dad played by the hilarious HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH FUnny manchild Will Ferrell who has his own creation of Legoland or Legotopia or whatever. The dad turns out to be president Beezwax and wants to glue down the world for perfection. But the two realize they can be creative together. <br/><br/>None of the things could be explained in this film other than Legos. No science. Just pop culture references. <br/><br/>Honestly, if I watched it the second time. Maybe I'd truly love it. Because as of now I don't. I'm sorry but this movie has a mediocre story. Almost any Pixar movie is better. <br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>-CHARACTERS-
Steve is a character that is nice but too Mickey Mouse for his own good. He is blah. So he must transform and know the truth. Now which of the 2 things do you think he does? That's right he learns the truth. But he does like I said become more creative even though any other character could do better. <br/><br/>Wyldestyle- She is cool, probably the best character. She is a hot goth chick Lego. <br/><br/>Batman- The film's sweetheart. But really he isn't even that funny. He's actually trying to hard to be childish that it isn't funny by pointing out the tropes of what Batman does best. I hate the cynical irony it has. It's like 2000's making fun of the 1980's and not showing any love. He does cool stuff. That's it. He's annoying.<br/><br/>Unikitty- She's a funny little sidekick that is too cute for her own good that it's annoying.<br/><br/>Vitruvius- The oracle voiced by Morgan Freeman and it's HAHAHAHAHAHADHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Awesome le Epic. Not not really.<br/><br/>President Beezwax- He is supposed to be a menacing villian but he just like 90% of the characters comes off as childish. <br/><br/>Good Cop Bad Cop- The main antagonist of the story. He get's his good side taken away. He's pretty cool for a lego. <br/><br/>7/10 I think you'll like them<br/><br/>-ANIMATION-
In terms of art this movie is truely amazing. I've never seen a studio try to Mimic childhood stop motion animation movies through computers. It was so amazing. The lighting effects. Every location looked unique. That's all it really had going for it.<br/><br/>-SOUND-
As I said before the dialogue is trying to hard to be childish ironically. But the Sound is unrivaled. I can't stop singing that stupid song everything is awesome. <br/><br/>-FINAL VIRDICT 
I couldn't get into to the Lego Movie. Try as I might, but I feel that I'd rather play with Legos than watch a badly written film about them. <br/><br/>At least it's better than the Emoji movie."

Those wouldn't have been such a big problem if it wasn't for its finale which is too childish and disappointing.

","I wasn't sure what to expect as I sat down to watch this movie, was it to be too childish, or will it be geared towards impressing adults also? Too heavy on the Lego promotion? Was it to have a solid story or be a weak mish-mash of brainless money spinning tripe? As the credits rolled at the end of the movie I can honestly say I have not been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in a long, long time. Hands down, it is fantastic.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie has heart, it has substance and great energy. It's clever, really clever and I appreciate the level of effort and thinking that has gone into making this movie. It is laugh out loud funny, not only in a slapstick way but also through witty dialogue and intelligent, sharp humour. The universe created for The Lego Movie is one of the greatest aspects, the attention to detail is fantastic and nothing ever looks out of place with some brilliantly witty props and surroundings. With spot on casting the Lego characters are brought to life, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all play their part especially well in their supporting roles.  The story is a simple one, easy to follow but is told in an imaginative and well paced with a good array of characters, clichéd but pleasant. It's the classic unassuming hero story, good vs potential evil with friendship and loyalty the driving points being the mission. There are plenty of funny moments, some surprisingly downbeat scenes and some well choreographed action sequences.<br/><br/>My only real negative is that I feel it was geared a little too heavily towards 3d viewing and when viewing in standard 2d it can feel a little over the top and choppy at times. It's clear which parts would look great in 3d but when viewed standard some scenes can look like quite poor animation.<br/><br/>Towards the end, the movie makes a bold move, a move which could quite easily have backfired and undone all the greatness. Thankfully it was pulled off extremely well, delivering just how they wanted it to and didn't feel remotely wrong in any way.<br/><br/>The creators got it spot on. Promote Lego to the hills, kids will love so many aspects of it, adults will love it too and the money will come rolling in for sequels, this is a new Universe for the animation genre and I can see it continuing for many years to come. The Batman Lego Movie was released this year and with such an array of characters at their disposal, I expect to see plenty more movies in the future.<br/><br/>A very solid 9/10"

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","10 January 2017"," Like the Title Song says...
","Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is ""which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?"" <br/><br/>Indeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blasé, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>But this is an adjective I wouldn't use for ""The Lego Movie"" as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.<br/><br/>There's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.<br/><br/>Last time I had as much fun was with ""Rango"" and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn ""Everything is Awesome"", a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's. <br/><br/>But under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clichés but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and ""The Lego Movie"" was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's ""Imagination Land"", and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.<br/><br/>Honorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>Everything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels."
"Imdbidia","6","0","1","5 January 2017"," Lego on steroids
","The Lego movie has an imaginative original story, great characters, dialogues and message. The story mixes a bit of surrealism, absurdity and child-like stories and mixes it with a bit of super-hero stuff and a bit of social critique. The dialogues are funny and witty. The narrative is perhaps my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent, however this is not the sort of visuals I enjoy. I say this because the film is visually overwhelming, too much happening on every scene, too many figurines in each scene, too much is too much. Besides, the movie has no tempo or pace, or the pace is just run run run -- Lego on steroids. So I watched this movie with some sort of visual anxiety if that can be said. Unfortunately, it is not just a bit here and there, it is from beginning to end, so I felt it was an exhausting watching despite me liking the story overall.<br/><br/>The same story, the same Lego pieces, with a bit of more air and a different pace would have produced a rounder more enjoyable film, at least to me.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie tries to remind us all of how important is to play with toys, to develop our imagination, and how being silly is actually quite smart at times. Playing with toys has no rules, no limits, it can be as silly or senseless as you want, as long as you are having fun, all is possible."

","The LEGO Movie, on the surface, seems like a product placement for one of the world's biggest toy-brands; the truth about the movie is that it capitalizes on its heritage and satires the basic premise of capitalism through its character Emit. And The LEGO Movie has a loose but flexible plot that never gets too self-restrained: only when the script says so.<br/><br/>This film is a charming, colourful and memorable treat in animated cinema, and the computer-animation is used to emulate stop-motion and I liked how the animation didn't TRY to look like it was done on computers. While it is noticeable that it is CGI, it is done so with memorable style that hardly gets in the way of enjoying what you're watching.<br/><br/>The LEGO Movie is an advert for promoting not only toys, but imagination and thinking outside the 'instructions'.<br/><br/>Also, Batman is in this movie.

","The movie felt like a LEGO commercial, but it was so obvious, especially when showing the different worlds and themes, that it was fine, it just seemed like a satire of their own ads. <br/><br/>For me, the jokes were very good, we really see the traditional (super)heroes act differently than normally, because they are ""played"" by a kid, who puts his own thoughts in his LEGO toys. <br/><br/>What's most interesting is the idea that there's no absolute bad - at some point it stops to be the idea of following the rules, use logic vs creativity : when both are together, there is a transformation of the world, of this LEGO world, that Gabriel Tarde would describe as an emergence of values. Something new, different, is created, because of the confrontation of both entities. Unlike most movies, it's not a duality (bad vs good, tyranny vs rebellion) in which one wins against the other, it is really a transformation. <br/><br/>So the next question we could ask is if they used this method to build this movie : did they really, put the values of the producers (eg. : make money), of the actors (e.g. : be well known), of the spectators (both kids and more grown-ups), etc. in confrontation to come with a fresh, new movie that would not have been created if, for example, the values of the producers dominated the others... I like to think so, to think that this story is after all, meta-communication about the movie!"

The characters in this film who are licensed works like Batman and Superman are actually made into funny characters with their own personalities.

Complemented by strong performances from Elizabeth Banks and Liam Neeson, the cast is in good working shape.<br/><br/>Not only a perceptive satire on the insidious perils of consumerist society (which alone couldn't sustain the adult appeal), but also a nostalgic homage to, and parody of, genres such as the Western, the Cop Thriller, the Superhero Movie (primarily D.C. it seems) etc., The Lego Movie sets up a number of levels of operation and sustains them successfully without tipping too far in any one direction.<br/><br/>The real genius of this film lies in the brilliant writer/director team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller whose razor-sharp scenario whips you along at just the right pace, somewhat in the vein of Edgar Wright (it shares a great deal in tone with that of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World).<br/><br/>Overall, if you can survive being manipulated by a frustratingly clichéd 'message', and unfortunately you will be, then you will thoroughly enjoy this movie, as I did, for its many visual and conceptual treats."
"bryank-04844","9","0","1","22 August 2015"," I can easily say that 'LEGO MOVIE' is one of the best films of the year so far. Sure, it's only the first week of February, but it really is that good.
","In the past, we've seen video games and board games adapted into movies for the big screen. More often than not, these adaptations are usually panned by critics everywhere and let down the fans. Or the film is decent enough for a 'one-time' watch, then is completely forgotten. You can say the above about 'Battleship', 'Street Fighter', or 'House of the Dead'. 'Clue' might be the only board game adaptation to sustain any sort of fan following, and actually has received a lot of positive remarks since it came out 1985.<br/><br/>But nowadays, where kids born in the 70s and 80s, are having their favorite toys and games adapted into main-stream movies. LEGOS have been around for a very long time. I remember playing with them for years on end, building dinosaurs, cities, and spaceships. It seems that for several years, LEGO went off the radar, but over the past few years, they have made a comeback in an epic way. Now, there are LEGO boutique shops at almost every mall across America, not to mention a LEGO theme park called LEGOLAND. And we have been seeing more and more movies and TV shows selling their rights to LEGO, in order to sell LEGO-themed products. We've seen 'Star Wars', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'The Simpsons', to name a few, all now part of the LEGO world.<br/><br/>It was only a matter of time before there was big LEGO movie with A-List stars attached to be released. Well that time has finally come, and I'm here to say that it is everything I could have hoped for and more. Just like the song you hear in the amazing trailer, ""Everything is Awesome"", that is how you can describe the 'LEGO MOVIE'. It's rare when I have high hopes for a film, and then the film delivers on every level. I'm just glad it happened with this particular movie, as I'm sure fans of all ages will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully animated film.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the two guys who gave us 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs', the remake of '21 Jump Street', and the hilarious TV series 'Clone High', did a knock out job with the 'LEGO Movie'. The conjured up one hell of a cast that delivers on every note, along with some beautiful animation that brightens up the screen everywhere, and have given us a script that will not only make kids under the age of 10 laugh, but will also get the adults to burst out with laughter as well.<br/><br/>The film just works on every level. The story focuses on Emmet (Chris Pratt), who seems to be the happiest guy in the city. He loves his job as a construction worker and enjoys following the rule book. However, Emmet seems to normal and nobody really pays attention to him. Meanwhile, there is an evil man trying to take over all of LEGO world who calls himself Lord Business and doubles as President Business (Will Ferrell), the nicer face to the people, as to trick them into his villainous scheme. Vituvius who resembles a 'God' like figure (Morgan Freeman, of course), tells of a prophecy of a special guy who will one day realize his abilities and save the world from Lord Business. Well, this happens to be Emmet, as he pairs up a hip chick named Wyldestyle (Elizabeth Banks), to set out on an adventure to recruit a bunch of other people to destroy Lord Business.<br/><br/>They enlist the help of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, the Star Wars characters, a unicorn-kitty, and just about every other pop culture icon you think of. The results are hilarious, as each actor lending their voice does a perfect job. Will Arnett as Batman is genius casting and the Star Wars cameos made me excited once again for a 'Star Wars' movie. The different worlds in the LEGO world all bring back tons of nostalgic memories of growing up, and are all laid out perfectly here.<br/><br/>The pacing is quick, and there is never a dull moment. I couldn't stop singing the 'Everything is Awesome' song for two days after I saw the movie, and my only thought was that I had to see this movie again. I can easily say that 'LEGO MOVIE' is one of the best films of the year so far. Sure, it's only the first week of February, but it really is that good. Rush out to see this film. You'll love it."

","The Lego Movie: this movie is bloody amazing. I remember seeing the trailer for this a few months before it came out, and I was sure it was going to be awful. Like in comparison i thought the purge anarchy was going to be citizen Kane and this the room. But wow this is fun. I mean the trailer makes it look like a series of flat jokes, but it's really a special story, and the fact that it didn't win the animated Oscar, let alone get nominated, has to be one of the biggest snubs this decade. The Lego movie is a really fun movie that anyone can enjoy, the ending is unexpected but extremely cleaver, and overall just really fun. 8.3 is the number for this one, and sincerely is one of my favorites, and one of the best, of 2014.

","The nice thing about Legos is that they can be anything. They have the plastic malleability to become structures, characters, villains; you name it. Of course, just about every movie for kids is about saving the earth or the universe. This is a non-stop fountain of the primary colors that keeps going. The strength isn't so much in the plot but in the multiple way the Legos can be used to show emotions and true ""humanity."" There is some romance and some brinkmanship, but ultimately it gets down to true creativity. The universe is truly the Lego board and if you or your kids have ever played together, you know the overwhelming possibilities. There are some pretty good songs in here but, I must admit, they have become pretty tiresome."

The animation style is the real trade mark of the film as it is shot to appear as if it were a stop motion film. This works perfectly in the film with its utilization of Lego blocks and allows the film to do certain things very effectively which the traditional animation features could not.The movie also composes of a stellar voice ensemble such as Nick Pratt, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks and numerous other comedic stars which perfectly fit their characters and add flair to the film. The film boasts many laughs and a general fun experience to all ages with its intriguing direction, relatable story and comedic voice cast.

"keithlovesmovies","9","0","1","14 July 2015"," The Lego Movie Review
","In the LEGO universe, the wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) tries to protect a superweapon called the ""Kragle"" from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Once he fails to do so, he prophesies that a person known as ""the Special"" will find a way to stop the Kragle. Now Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary LEGO figure who always followed the rules unwillingly becomes the Special, a being who is the key to saving his world. He later joins forces with a group of strangers who are on a mission to stop the now evil President Business and his plan to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Emmet, he is hopelessly and hilariously unprepared for such a task, but he'll give it his all nonetheless.<br/><br/>On paper, a movie about LEGO character sounds like it wouldn't work but it surprisingly does. The story sounds like it came from a child's imagination but it fits within the world of the film. The animation, a combination of stop-film and CGI, used in this film can also hold its own with the imagination within the story. There is a great attention to detail throughout with all aspects of the world made from Legos. Kids will be entertained by such characters as a cat, a vintage astronaut, and Batman (I won't explain why), just to name a few. The story is not very original for a kid's film (hero versus villain) and I wan't expecting to laugh as much as I did thanks to the funny script. There are a lot of jokes and other things going on in this film so you have to pay attention or you may miss one. I thought the voice cast also did a great job making each character funny and likable with a few surprising performances from actors you would not expect. For a kid's film, it does contain many references that many adults will enjoy and remind them of their respective childhoods (as it did mine). The film's message is important, albeit not too surprising, is embracing and celebrating creativity as one day, we may stop being creative. It also goes on to say that whoever you are, you can still be special. Everyone can be special, can try and succeed if they want to. The film does make a slight turn, tone-wise, near the end that may turn off certain people. It does feel a little different when compared to the first two-thirds of the film and does get a little preachy but I did not mind it too much. Despite this, The Lego Movie is definitely one of my top 5 animated films of all time and the best animated film of 2014. (Disclaimer: I saw Big Hero 6 in January 2015). It should have won the Oscar for best animated feature last year (please consult earlier disclaimer). With the world they created and the imagination in which the filmmakers shown, I would most definitely enjoy coming back. Since this movie made a lot of money, this seems very likely. I wish other toy-based movies would learn from this. I'm talking to you Transformers 1-4, G.I. Joe 1-2, Battleship, Ouija, and Bratz.<br/><br/>keithlovesmovies.com"

","Far more fun than the concept really had any right to be, braving new horizons while still remaining loyal to the beating heart of the product and its passionate generations of fans. Simply enough, this is a perfect encapsulation of the kind of imagination, enthusiasm, adaptation and sheer randomness that runs like lifeblood through the spirit of a happy childhood. It jabs in delightfully unexpected directions. It bends physics without an explanation (nor a need for one). It casually hops from one licensed fantasy to another, mashing Green Lantern with Gandalf, and doesn't even slow down to consider the repercussions. At the best of times, I felt like I was a kid again myself, lost in nostalgia and the infinite potential locked away within every new block. And while the last act overreaches in an effort to really hammer the morals home, otherwise this is pretty much a direct hit. Crafty, funny writing, a dazzling array of vocal talent and a playful, distinct visual style - this is the kind of family film I can always make room for."

THEN, Will Ferrell shows up and spoils everything. Actually, the unfortunate choice to ""wire the ghost"" was the first slip-up. However, the live action scenes with Will Ferrell just laid there. Most of the problems in these scenes are likely the fault of the director or editor. In any event, they completely destroy the pacing of the movie.

","I was much impressed, what is a giant commercial for Lego is one of the most self-aware movie I have ever seen. It is not just for kids, the movie is funny and full of references that will be impossible or hard to get for kids (well, I for one did not show Terminator 2 to my children). CGI is also very, very well done.<br/><br/>Emmet is a boring lego piece living in a perfect world. He's lonely, but he lives in a lego city where pieces live in harmony, follow all the rules, consume over-priced coffee, watch stupid TV shows and listen to catchy (and stupid) songs played non-stop on the radio, under the guidance of the benevolent President Business. Nothing like our world.<br/><br/>We find out later the story is made up by a kid, Finn, in his basement, where his father, the man upstairs, a lego aficionado, created several sets representing various world (Far West, big city...). Of course, for the man upstairs, the sets are supposed to be a depiction of reality, not a playground, but Finn creates a story in which all the sets are linked together, and this is one of the best idea of the movie. When a child tells a story, realism and plausibility go out of the window, you take what you like and what you have on hand, mesh it together and voila! a plot. <br/><br/>Against the Man Upstairs/Lord Business, who intends for his creations to be final, and will glue them in place once they are perfect, Finn/Emmet wants his toys to be... well, toys. To be used as toys, not collections, and who cares if the set is supposed to be a house? Why couldn't we make a spaceship out of it?"
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","1","12 May 2015"," Everything is awesome
","The Lego Movie really can be summed up in its signature song, Everything is Awesome. It is a colourful, delightful romp that is equal parts quality viewing and mindlessly entertaining. It is a movie for all occasions and audiences. The animation is delightfully done, giving the impression of stop-motion animation to fully create what it would be like to act out this movie with real Lego.<br/><br/>Directors Lord and Miller have assembled a stellar voice cast, giving perfect characters to each of its actors - the seductive Elizabeth Banks, the cute Alison Brie, the wise Morgan Freeman, the enthusiastic Charlie Day and the tough Liam Neeson. Chris Pratt and Will Arnett (the latter being the most underrated comedic actor alive) are the film's highlights as protagonist Emmet and rival Batman.<br/><br/>The story is simply superb. Not only is it an interesting and engaging story, it captures everything we love about Lego. Anyone who has ever played with any Lego set knows the battle between imagination and instructions. Will Ferrell's President Business is the most perfect villain the film could have. The weapons and arguments used by each side are so perfect and no audience will have trouble identifying with one side or another.<br/><br/>Making a movie about Lego is something that I know tweaked a lot of noses, but it really created something incredible here. The ability to tap into almost anything - LOTR, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, the NBA and DC Comics (with voice acting from 21 Jump Street duo Tatum and Hill providing some huge laughs) - means that this movie had no boundaries, and indeed that is a huge reason why I loved it. It also provided vital jokes and story archs - see quotes like ""does anyone know what this piece is, and do you need it?"" for just one example.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie there is a revelation that truly changes the entire scope of the film, and that makes the film even more special. In any sense, The Lego Movie is one of those movies you can watch again and again and again, never getting over the laughs or the colour or the fun. I cannot recommend this highly enough."

","The Lego Movie (2014): Dir: Phil Lord, Chris Miller / Voices: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson: One of the most original and impressive animations since Toy Story.

Chris Pratt voices Emmet an average construction worker who comes across a mysterious female rebel named Wyldstyle. When he falls down a hole he is arrested and learns that he has a piece of the resistance attached to him. The villain is Lord Business whose war is against anything that disturbs his view of normality. He plans to use a substance called the Kragle, which is a tube of Krazy Glue with certain letters rubbed out. This is being used to glue the universe in place. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose previous credits include the overrated 21 Jump Street. Emmet is the portrait of the average joe and indicates that everyone is important and gifted. Emmet is not that intelligent yet has the amusing ability to come up with bizarre ideas. Elizabeth Banks voices the rebellious Wydestyle who is out to find her importance. Will Arnett steals moments voicing Batman who is Wydestyle's boyfriend. Will Ferrell voices the tyrant Lord Business as well as appear in reality as a struggling father. Liam Neeson steals moments voicing Good Cop / Bad Cop who is the henchmen of Lord Business.

","The Lego Movie has been cult well among many fans, as a great visual experience, and the film can be seen as living to its expectations. It might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks, but this 3D animated comedy has some visual inspiration behind it, even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to carry a feature-length production. The story essentially follows the misadventures of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by President Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchmen led by a two-faced cop (Liam Neeson). So Emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) and a blind man (Morgan Freeman) who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day. Overall, a very well made film which has been in production for several years back."

It's actually a brilliant deconstruction of the interchangeable pieces of the tropes of adventure stories, as always centered on a substitutable everyman who just want to fit in. His instincts are not heroic, if anything he is actually quite yellow. But the movie builds a magnificent plot out of seemingly disparate yet interlocking components making for a veritable play-set of a universe.

","An amazing animation. I've never seen a stop-motion movie before that sucks you into the visual aspect so much. The dialogues are playful yet have a deeper meaning: the children see the playfulness, the adults see the deeper meaning. The story is relatable to children and their parents. The big moral is that you should let your children create their own world through toys and how parents should give them the freedom and material to do so. The story during the animated part is meant to entertain and is about the fight between good and bad.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can mention is that at a certain point the movie changes location to the real world which kicks you out of the animated world that kept you so close to the story... The whole movie was about the fight between good and bad, freedom and brainwashing and in a sudden it's about a father that doesn't gives his child the freedom to create an own dreamworld. This kinda breaks the flow you felt during the movie. But it's not that bad that it ruins the movie and when it goes back to animation you quickly pick the story back up again."

","I found myself not engaged with the film as I was with ""The Boxtrolls"", some of the CGI character design and animation for the heroes is your standard character design and animation like Disney. And it wasn't all that special, but it was more enjoyable than The Boxtrolls on many levels. But it should've been nominated for an Academy Award because it's better than 'Big Hero 6' also, that little-teen, generic movie. I found 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' a better movie than The Boxtrolls and kept me engaged throughout despite a little brat in there. Unlike ""Big Hero 6"", it actually makes you laugh throughout the film. It also makes you feel scared of the villain, pretty much the most well-thought out character I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>I got this movie on DVD, expecting something cute and surprisingly breathtaking like ""Wreck it Ralph"" but it was somewhat boring like 'Big Hero 6' with some entertaining parts. The movie is too weird like Emmet can get annoying with his talkative self and Unikitty (I don't remember much about her).<br/><br/>The ending was an okay one, but it was just added in there as a cloying part. It was too sad, too, but then everything's okay.<br/><br/>I don't think that many people over the age of 9 will enjoy this thoroughly.<br/><br/>All in all, The Lego Movie is an overrated film that is not for everyone and I really recommend Wreck-it Ralph more. It was an engaging and hilarious film from start to finish that will be something to watch over and over again. Don't expect much special from it."

","Batman: I only work in black and sometimes very, very dark gray.<br/><br/>Initially, the most promising thing about ""The LEGO Movie"" was its enormous cast of recognizable names (and voices). Other than that, I wasn't sure if the film would have anything interesting to tell us. It sounded like a bad idea, one that would have some decent child humor but nothing beyond that. For like the 10th time in one year, I was wrong. 2014 was full of surprises, and ""The LEGO Movie"" was a big one.<br/><br/>Besides the many stars in the movie, all of the characters are interesting, mainly because we know a lot of them from other films, shows, LEGO sets, etc. but here they play a caricature of the real thing, exaggerating their characteristics. It's actually quite funny for anyone at any age. That's the main great thing about this film, its wide appeal to people of all ages. It's the definition of ""fun for the whole family"".<br/><br/>The story in ""The LEGO Movie"" is hectic and not entirely serious, but there are actually a few interesting lessons to be taught. Not of morality or life choices (obviously, it's a movie about LEGOS), but ones about freedom to play with LEGOS how you want to. Sound silly? That's because it is, and it's proud of it. So yes, the movie has a nice, interesting, visually awesome story.<br/><br/>The last thing I want to talk about is how interesting the movie is visually. EVERYTHING is made from LEGOS. Look in the backgrounds, everywhere, it's all LEGO. The creativity is massive, and the visuals and colors alone will entertain kids. Add in some really clever humor coming from the voices of stars we've come to know and love, and you've got an excellent family film that will be remembered for a long time."

The movie is as exciting as getting your first set of Lego.<br/><br/>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a Lego construction man, the run-of-the-mill ordinary one. He stumbles across a mysterious piece after his work day is over. What comes is the heroic journey where he gathers friend to overthrown the nasty antagonist.

The movie doesn't dwell too seriously on already known formula, it administers them with unusually fresh variety. It delivers an underlying message that resonates not only to children, but also all ages.<br/><br/>Cast is simply wonderful. Everyone has their own distinguish over-the-top flair. The characters are representation of pop culture, from Batman, Morgan Freeman's prophetic Vitruvius to Liam Neeson's no nonsense Bad Cop. Glued by an amazingly witty script and lightning fast pace, the movie tirelessly delivers spot-on jokes, crazy one-liner in addition to surprisingly tender moments. The humor is sharp as well as cynical, they churn out humorous banter in nearly every conversations.<br/><br/>Graphic is nicely done, nowadays film animations have their own different lively styles. However, The Lego Movie utilizes familiarity of its brand to the audience. It's compelling to see the minute details they put in, creative design such as the spaceship parts or the waves of ocean that imaginatively engaging, even if some looks simplistic. These features also contribute naturally on its many inside jokes.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie embodies the spirit of the toy, it's fun, ageless and offers delightful experience."
"Brady-Larsen-Esq","9","0","2","12 February 2015"," The Lego Movie makes playtime awesome again!
","www.carnivorouscouch.com<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is a difficult film to expound upon, but not for any reason that could be considered a failing on its part. It is not muddled in what it communicates, nor is it a film whose insights are buried so deep as to require significant unpacking. The Lego Movie may just be something completely new: a deep blockbuster animated comedy whose depth can be found right there on its energetic, glossy surface. Perhaps that makes it sound like the film is a bit didactic, presenting its insights directly and without fuss, but at the expense of subtlety. But The Lego Movie resists that charge, as it resists every other trap that a high-energy, child-friendly, innately brand-centric film about a line of toys could possibly fall into. While it occasionally slows down for old-fashioned sentimentality, the film is mostly too caught up in being breathlessly funny and playful to ever climb up on its own soap box (or soap blocks, as it were). The Lego Movie offers valuable, earnest lessons to children and adults on the importance of imagination, the benefits of organization and mental discipline, and how the two should walk hand in hand. But almost all of these lessons are delivered with the same high-wire, machine gun gusto and spry comedic timing as the barrage of consistently uproarious jokes. More often than not, the valuable messages are jokes. The pearls of wisdom are hilarious! The jokes are insightful! The schnozzberries taste like schnozzberries! <br/><br/>No, the difficulty with reviewing The Lego Movie is that it frankly does not need my review. It is a madcap social satire that charges forward with utmost ideological clarity. Any reflections I can make on its sweet, healthy ideas are nothing that the movie itself does not state even more succinctly. This is the honor it earns by being a movie for both children and adults, in the most open and honest way. The messages are forthright enough for a child to understand, and thought-provoking enough for all but the most cynical adult to appreciate. I imagine the impact of this is doubled if you are an adult who now has a child in your life. But, as difficult as it is to speak on a movie that speaks so eloquently for itself, I have had just as much trouble explaining to people why it is such a phenomenal jolt of pure comedy. It is a genuine shame that this film missed out on a Best Animated Feature Film nomination, while the likes of Big Hero 6 and How To Train Your Dragon 2 were recognized, but those movies are not its true contemporaries. While The Lego Movie is an engaging and inventive piece of animation, its peers are not be found among most animated films, even the very good ones. At the risk of hyperbole, its peers are Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Harold Ramis.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is a giddy valentine to the act of playing with things, and by extension the creative process. It is a reminder that, even as adults, we should value spontaneous creation first and then seek to mold it with our great gifts for rational thought. While the movie supports these themes through its dialogue and story beats, the greatest embodiment of its worldview is to be found in the margins, which teem with funny, clever details. In planting the flag for our inner children, the movie strives, first and foremost, to lead by example. Rather than simply sermonizing that we should engage with our sense of play, the movie plays with us. The gleeful energy on display is the movie's theme in action. And every single cast member, from Chris Pratt's Emmett, to Nick Offerman's bellowing bionic pirate, to Will Arnett's hilarious takedown of Batman, all seem to be having the time of their lives. For the definitive proof of this, look no further than Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson. Each of these talented veteran actors has tended a bit toward rote self-parody lately, with Freeman leaning on his sonorous voice to play carbon-copy wise men, and Neeson using his dignified gruffness in the service of no-nonsense authority figures who play by their own rules. After a time, even great actors like these can start to go through the motions. Who can blame them for ossifying a bit when studios give them the same old routines to repeat? The Lego Movie even casts Freeman as the wise mystic and Neeson as the gruff authority figure. Then something unexpected and altogether magical happens. Instead of playing these archetypes in the same tired key, both deliver performances that are alive, gloriously self-winking and endlessly funny. To give Lord and Miller their full credit, maybe the best thing a couple of young directors can do is invite some talented actors over and let them play with their toys again.<br/><br/>www.carnivorouscouch.com"

","The Lego Movie is an innovative, fresh take on an animated feature. I would never guess that a movie with such a terrible premise and an excuse to sell more Legos would turn out to be such an entertaining, fun film. It has an infectious nature thanks to the rapid pace, involvement of some of our favorite characters, and the hit song, ""Everything Is Awesome."" The animation is brilliant and I liked the characterizations. Not every joke worked, but the majority thankfully did. <br/><br/>Phil Lord's and Christopher Miller's film is about an ordinary citizen named Emmett who is now charged with saving the universe from the destruction of Lord Business after he is seen as the most extraordinary person in the world. <br/><br/>The film has a great voice cast filled with likable actors. Nowadays, Chris Pratt is a major star and he has this movie to thank as it's the beginning for what is to come. Will Ferrell once again delivers a funny performance as the villainous Lord Business. We also get good voice acting from the likes of Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. <br/><br/>Overall, The Lego Movie is a clever film that is way better than every right it had to be. The pace may be intense for some, but it's such a lively, entertaining movie. It'a a shame the Oscars snubbed the movie, because it at least deserves a nomination for Best Animated Feature. Instead of being a film designed for commercialization, it turned out to be top-tier entertainment. Everything is indeed awesome! I rate this film 9/10."

","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>Everything in ""The Lego Movie"" is, indeed, awesome.<br/><br/>Awesome as in the sort of silly yet wily kid-appropriate PG-rated film. In my opinion, this is the best performance by Will Ferrell that I've been waiting for ever since ""Elf"" came out more than a decade ago.<br/><br/>It is exceedingly cool that a major-studio family film refuses to simply capitalize on merchandising spin-offs by offering an oppressive 100-minute commercial. Instead, ""The Lego Movie"" manages to be a smartly subversive satire about the drawbacks of conformity and following the rules while celebrating the power of imagination and individuality. It still might be a 100-minute commercial, but at least it's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one with in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed.<br/><br/>I had no interest in seeing this film; however, all my friends that saw it said it was a great movie, and I decided to give it a watch. This is the best film of the year and, as far as I'm concerned, the best film I've seen if a couple of years. It is also the most subversive, pro-liberty film since (I kid you not) ""V for Vendetta"" with smart, well-deserved swipes at the head of the government. Bring your adult friends if you don't have children of your own.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful movie, I had the same reaction to it as I had seeing ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story 3"". If you do not have your own child, now is the time to offer to babysit a niece or nephew. It's nice to see that imagination can still show up and surprise you in the best way possible. It was way better than it needed to be, for a toy- based movie. With a message at the end that should be seen by many parents.<br/><br/>Best movie of the year, so far."

","The Lego Movie can be considered an instant classic of animation. The story takes something as simple as a Lego, and turns it into a fun and imaginative story.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely likable and all the actors fit their roles extremely well. Some of the best characters include Bad Cop/Good Cop (Played by Liam Neeson), Batman (Played by Will Arnet), and President Business (Played by Will Ferrell) However, Chris Prat and Morgan Freeman also excel really well in the leading roles. Even the supporting characters of Green Lantern (Played by Jonah Hill) and Superman (Played by Channing Tatum) had great moments in the film as well.<br/><br/>The movie's script is also a strong suit of the film. The script is fun and imaginative, and captures the imagination of playing with Legos. The script is also a great satire about conformity. The writers show that anyone can be special if you just be yourself. Along the way the script also pokes fun at Green Latern and Batman as well.<br/><br/>Overall The Lego Movie will be remembered as one of the greatest animated films of all time."

But please, if you haven't watched it yet, you are seriously missing out.<br/><br/>Like many people, I expected this to be full of child humour with no real storyline or substance, but I am 19 years old and I found myself chuckling throughout this film, along with my parents. The humour is aimed at all ages and it really does tickle you in places.<br/><br/>The main thing that impresses me about this film however, is the cleverness and creativity behind it. The idea of the characters building things out of Lego, and Lego pieces flying everywhere when there's an explosion or a car crash or something. It is really cleverly done and really entertaining.<br/><br/>It isn't a perfect movie, as some of the jokes are a bit silly, but in all honesty, it is 10x better than I ever thought it would be. A very, very good film."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","2","26 January 2015"," Not quite awesome, but fun nonetheless
","Who could imagine you could make a film about Lego? 'The Lego Movie' actually manages this, with a plot that is an inverse of that of 'Toy Story', and a rich host of jokes, some very funny, fired at a furious pace. The start of the movie could almost be seen as a satire of life in modern China; the romantic subplot (the figurine fancied by the hero turns out to already have a boyfriend - Bat-man - who takes some beating) seems truer to life than most romantic comedies. The presence of Bat-man is just one of many ways the film exploits the vast range of Lego figurines now available, from the ordinary to the iconic - and the film's ultimate message, that ordinary should not mean anonymous, is also a softened version of the naked positivity usually found in American kids' films. What the film lacks is the wonderful reflective pace of 'WALL-E'; it's perpetually noisy and busy, holding the attention of the younger half of its intended audience with a whirligig of flying bricks. For me, it was a little too frenetic to be truly awesome, and of course it's all advertising for the product, but it transcends its modest premise by some margin."

He meets a woman named Lucy/Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and she trusts him to find his skill to be a megabuilder. They go on this great adventure which along the way they meet some extraordinary characters and they all fight together to save the world my favourite part is when Good Cop/Bad Cop is played Liam Neeson and also when they go into the real world with Will Ferrell playing the little lad's father and they get along so well at the end.

","In this computer animated movie based on Lego pieces, Chris Pratt saves the universe. Again. And while the animation was original and well done while and I don't have any qualms with the actors or direction, this film is just another Hollywood film about the hapless hero who finds it in himself the power to save everybody - if he has a lot of luck - and proves to everybody that he is ""special"".<br/><br/>Like many others, when I first heard of the premise of the film I thought I would not see it, but then I heard so many people describing it as a cool movie that, in the end, I gave up and watched it. Yes, it is nicely done, yes it has a lot of nods to other movies, yes it has some funny scenes, but in the end it is just... not special.<br/><br/>And I am not saying this because I am mean or because I think a Lego movie should be deep and profound and morally ambiguous so that adults would get it, not just little kids, but because the message of the film is as cliché and conformist as they come. In a story about people removing the constraints of set rules and following instructions, the main message is ""be yourself!"". That's original.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it is a good movie, but it was so over-hyped that I couldn't enjoy its story mediocrity. Huge amounts of money were poured into this film, with good actors used for voice only, cool animation, but the bottom line is that... I've seen this before."

","At first, I was leaning towards the direction that the movie wouldn't be so great. I loved playing with Lego blocks as a kid, and that's why decided to watch the movie in the first place. Just as the movie was starting, I realized I didn't like the graphics so much. (Yes, I realize that's how it's supposed to look, but still.) I even considered discontinuing it. But as the movie progressed on, I fell more in love with the concept. How a nobody, a person who lacked self-confidence, who so desperately wanted to fit in, could do so much for the world. It goes to show that, no matter what, if you believe in yourself, you can reach great heights, heights you never thought were possible to scale. I admired the part at the end, where the movie tied in to the real world. (a bit like toy story). The father, whom his son portrayed as the villain, learns to appreciate his son and his capabilities that he was too busy to notice he had. It will be hard to make the second part better than this one, but I have faith. Summarizing, it was a great movie, loved the concept and you should definitely watch this one!"

","The Lego Movie was one of 2014's biggest blockbusters bringing over $257 million domestically, so the chances are you have seen this already. But if you were reluctant as I was, you may still be thinking about it as award season rapidly approaches.<br/><br/>As the budget for the animated movie is reported to be only about $60 million, it is no doubt that sequels, prequels, and related projects are rapidly in the works at Warner Brothers, proving once again that there is vast market for good, family-friendly movies.<br/><br/>Wait, did I say ""good?"" Well, much to my chagrin, I did wind up liking the movie more than I had expected. The animation is outstanding. The voice casting is spot on and quite diverse – Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks, the 3 Wills (Forte, Arnett and Ferrell), Tom Welling, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Morgan Freeman, among many others. The story, while not original, has enough twists to keep it interesting for young and old. But be warned, the theme song ""Everything is Awesome"" is just catchy enough that it will stick in your head more than you want or are willing to admit.<br/><br/>As with most good movies aimed mostly for the young audience, this movie keeps the grown-ups interested with a non-ending stream of insider references. You do not need to catch the director's knowing winks to the audience to understand the story, but it is enjoyable to see how many they sneak in.<br/><br/>In short, you can safely watch this with your children without fear of wasting their time or yours. You can even watch it if there are no children in the audience."
"runamokprods","9","0","2","16 January 2015"," Wild, smart, creative and great fun -- with a heart
","One of my very favorite films of 2014. <br/><br/>What I worried would be a feature length commercial is instead a very funny, and somewhat subversive film, overflowing with ideas, puns, perfect music, and wacky 'cameos' by everyone from Shaquile O'Neil, to a wonderfully warped and dark Batman (given terrific voice by Will Arnet). <br/><br/>'Lego' doesn't look quite like any film I've seen before. It has a rough, almost bizarrely low- tech look to it's Lego people -- stop motion that looks like stop motion --oddly (but very effectively) combined with mind-blowingly huge and complicated shots of the Lego universe in action. Somehow in the unlikely mix of slickness and lo-fi something wonderful is created; animation that is wildly impressive, but also clearly human, creative and DIY at the same time.<br/><br/>The film is basically a spoof of every Hollywood vision-quest movie you've ever seen. You know the films. A young character (almost always male) is called on to save the world/neighborhood/kingdom. He's over-matched, and under prepared, but with a kindly older mentor of great power to guide him, you know he will find a way to prevail. <br/><br/>Except here the ""special"" character at the center really ISN'T very special. He's a young working guy like a million others, who's not very bright or especially brave, and who just wants to live his happy, blank, endlessly repetitive safe life. And the mentor? None other than the voice of Morgan Freeman, expertly spoofing his own image as the ultimate voice of wisdom. He plays a wizard who is far less consistently brilliant and all knowing than he claims or wants to be. He's very, very funny, which is not the first thing one thinks of with Morgan Freeman. The same could be said of Liam Neeson, who also does a great voice job as the good cop/bad cop, who's personality changes depending on what side of his head is facing front. Will Ferrell is also excellent as the villain of the piece, being just silly enough to be funny, but just real enough to give the story some real tension. <br/><br/>Not everything works, and there were a few spots near the end where the energy flagged. But overall this is an exciting and creative (and wonderfully fun) piece of film-making, that manages to attack the near fascist mentality of a society obsessed with consuming, and determined not to question it's own lives (it's not for nothing that the villain's name is 'President Business')-- while still being very funny, and almost never feeling like its preaching. <br/><br/>And without giving anything away, in the last 20 minutes it changes the rules again, and asks a few profound questions about the nature of existence, without seeming like it had suddenly jumped the track as a film for kids as well as adults.<br/><br/>In the end, I walked around with the hysterical, awful (in a great way), and when you think about it kinda dark anthem ""Everything is Awesome"" banging around in my head for days."

","Sweet, sincere and hysterically funny, ""The Lego Movie"" has an inspired crew working at a whirlwind pace to create dazzling visuals and very witty gags that both honor and gently lampoon the world of Lego. The result is a propulsive gem, a near-masterpiece that immediately envelops you and is able to maintain a consistency all the way through to its unexpectedly moving live-action conclusion. There's no sense in going through the plot, which is just a set-up for a series of chases through hallucinatory settings, but the film's flaw is contained there in its unnecessary send-ups of big business and religion; the movie needs them, I suppose, to give the plot its purpose, but they're not very developed and if the writers (which include the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) were trying to make points, they're not quite there. Far more successful is the relationship between adults and children from which the story germinates. But all that is secondary: with such entertaining material and such virtuosity in animation, it's hard not to absolutely fall in love. And of course, there's the song ""Everything Is Awesome"" which will tattoo itself onto your brain the first time you hear it."

","Personally, i remember the great times I had playing with my toys when I was a child. Lego, Playmobil and action figures gave me thousands of hours of fun because I was able to create these really insane worlds where all these toys would interact. The stories I imagined were all more preposterous than the other but in my mind they were all as epic as Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings. And here we have a film that encapsulates all of that imagination in one story. The story is not important, it's bad against good but it's a fun unique out of the many story with twists and turns you would expect. The story has many action movie tropes such as a prophecy, a meeting of heroes, a ""heist"" and battles. This movie definitely was made for children in mind but adults will enjoy this film nonetheless with the many pop culture references and nostalgia linked with these imaginative toys. I still wish I had this sort of imagination and watching this film was having it back for an hour and a half."

","Many of us have played with LEGO toys in our childhood. Creating our own worlds, characters and stories, building things out of our imagination and creativity. That's where the heart of LEGO movie lies making it a really heart warming ride. Even those who aren't familiar with the LEGO toys will enjoy the stunning animation, humorous script and many of its pop-culture references.<br/><br/>The story is set in LEGO universe where everything is made of LEGO bricks. Everyone in this LEGO world follows set of instructions and rules meant for them everyday. Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary guy who follows his daily routine/rules and there doesn't seem to be anything special about him. He suddenly becomes a part of a bigger picture when a mysterious object called 'The Piece of Resistance' gets stuck to his back. And here his adventures begin. He encounters some group of peoples called 'Master Builders' and hears some prophecy about the 'Special'. Well most animation films have similar theme about a not so special person discovering his or her potential and specialty. <br/><br/>Despite having such a similar theme The LEGO Movies has original feel thanks to its beautiful stop-motion animation. Its dialogues are witty and humorous and sometimes small kids wont understand all of it while adults will enjoy. Still there are stupid gags meant for just kids yet the condition and timing make them laugh-out-loud moments for all. You will be shocked and have a big laugh when you see what 'The Piece of Resistance' actually is. There are also superheroes like batman,superman and even characters from Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. many of them among the master builders. Batman voiced by Will Arnett was ultra-cool and has made me really excited about the LEGO Batman movie coming up. Also Liam Neeson was bad-ass as an alter-ego good-bad cop.The voice-cast is splendid with likes of Morgan Freeman and Elizabeth Banks doing a fine job. Chris Pratt though steals the show with Emmet. The song 'Everything is Awesome' is really catchy. At the end it tries a bit too hard to deliver its underlying message but it is all set in surprising premise so I didn't care much. Watch it on your own I don't want to reveal anything.<br/><br/>I hope LEGO Movie wins the Oscar and other awards for best Animated feature of 2014. Its better than last years 'Frozen' for sure. Saw it second time before writing this review so as to make sure me loving it is not just some first time effect and it didn't disappoint.

The Song everything is awesome was in fact awesome. A very funny easter egg is that the krac'm is just superglue. Very funny. and that father in the lego movie, is a sort of Lord Business, because Lord Business gives Emmett a hug, The father gives his son a hug. and the father also used Superglue for lego. The Action scenes are short, but enjoyable. And the funniest thing is that the boyfriend of Wyldstyle is My favorite superhero, Batman! And what i also likes was that you see that Emmett is starting to get smarter, and finally a MasterBuilder. And the Bad Cop keeps showing up, which is funny. Fun fact: The Bad cop is played by Liam Neeson from Taken. it has so many blocks, that it makes you a little dizzy, but its cool. its also an beautiful movie. the only thing that i didn't like is that the(Fictional)TV show ''Where are my pants'' keep showing up in some parts of the movie, which made me think 'Seriously? is this supposed 2 be funny?'That 'Where are my pants' TV show is really unfunny. The ending was funny, because there are Pink Animal-Lego invaders trying to attack Legoworld. then, the movie ends. This movie makes me want to watch The Lego Movie 2 in the future, because if this movie is good, i believe that Lego Movie 2 also could be good. I don't expect that Lego Movie 2 would be better, but i certainly know that Lego Movie 2 is gotta be a good movie. This is the best movie of the first 6 months of 2014, or maybe the best Animated movie of 2014.

","When THE LEGO MOVIE first busts out the mind-melting tune of ""Everything is Awesome"" in the beginning, it's not just a means of displaying how brainwashed the Lego culture is in the movie, it's a warning of what's to come over the next 100 minutes. Because THE LEGO MOVIE is, in fact, awesome. Knowing my daughter would inevitably drag me to this movie, I was dreading its release. A kids' movie; strike one. Based on a toy property with no inherent plot; strike two. Released in the month of February, the notorious dumping ground for subpar films that would bomb any other time of year; strike three. Then the reviews started trickling out and, to my surprise, they were positive. Not just positive, but a certified fresh 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. A moviebased on basic colorful building brickswas getting better reviews than many, many others. The premise is simple (which one would expect with a movie revolving around, you know, Legos). Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is your average, run-of-the-mill construction worker in Bricksburg, living his life according to the proper instructions and enjoying all government-approved forms of entertainment. One night, he stumbles across the legendary ""piece of resistance""a magical artifact prophesized to identify the ""Special"" chosen one and the only thing capable of saving the world. Now a fugitive from the law, he's drawn into a world of Master-Builders with Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) where he will lead a team against the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) before he can end the world with his secret weapon: the Kra'gle.<br/><br/>My first clue that THE LEGO MOVIE was going to be more than a corporate cash grab aimed at vulnerable children and their weak-willed minds was that it was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. These men brought us the funniest movie of 2012 with 21 JUMP STREET and have shown they can handle themselves in comedy with a wicked sense of humor. This is one of those movies that's got plenty of goofball humor to get the kids laughing with some more subtle stuff that adults (especially those who were raised with the toys) will find fun in. Still, even the kids stuff is amusing enough that most adults (with the exception of the coldest hearts) will laugh along. There's some smart stuff here but it never sacrifices the chance for some slapstick. And the best part is the obvious love and respect for the toy itself present in every scene. Lord and Miller either major Lego fans or they're real good at faking it. This isn't a movie bent on selling toys but it'll sure make you itch for a set once it's over. It wasn't long after this came out that my daughter and I made our first visit to Legoland and I bought a few sets (as much for me as it was for her). THE LEGO MOVIE isn't here to sell a product, it's here to remind you why you loved it in the first place. And it all culminates in what is probably the only chink in the movie's armor, the climactic sequence where Emmet comes face-to-face with the ""Man Upstairs"". The message is a little heavy-handed but it's not overkill and it gets the point across.<br/><br/>Everyone's going to walk away with a favorite character from this one. Will Arnett is a treat as Batman. He's one of the central characters as Wyldstyle's angst-ridden, arrogant boyfriend and a part of Emmet's Master-Builder team. He's essentially an 80's high school movie jock and one-third of the movie's love triangle. Liam Neeson's one of the best with his Bad Cop/Good Cop, Lord Business's main enforcer with a split personality and a penchant for roughing up chairs when he gets agitated. His action film persona where he grumbles threats and opens generous cans of whooperm, buttonly make his high-pitched, super-friend cop that much funnier. Personally, I loved Benny the ""1980's-something spaceman"". He's voiced by Charlie Day and he's just as spastic as you'd expect, and all the poor guy wants is to build a spaceship. There are Lego cameos everywhere in THE LEGO MOVIE, bringing together characters from countless properties (both original Lego and licensed). Some of the funniest bits in the movie stem from random cameos and there's one about halfway into the movie that I refuse to spoil here but, just know, it's pretty cool. And the voice cast is almost as extensive. You could miss entire chunks of the movie just trying to pinpoint the voice actors, many of which only make the briefest of appearances. One I would've missed was Nick Offerman as Metal Beard; I never would've figured that one out until I paid closer attention to the end credits.<br/><br/>With so many easter eggs and blink-and-you-miss-them gags, I've found that THE LEGO MOVIE has some staying power. Every time I watch it, I'm finding something fun I'd missed before. As one of the few family movies that isn't downright painful for parents, this is an easy recommendation from me. With so much a movie like this had working against it from the start, THE LEGO MOVIE is definitely what I'd consider the surprise hit of 2014."

"kennethcarino","7","0","2","25 September 2014"," Good but not for adults
","Well, first off, sorry that I'm not going to waste time typing the synopsis on what this movie is about as one at this day and age can easily know what a movie is by reading Wikipedia or other sites to find out what the movie is about. So, I will go straight to the point and review.<br/><br/>When on the first time I heard that Hollywood was making a Lego movie I was rather skeptical that this would be good. I asked myself: ""Obviously this is for kids but would I enjoy this too as a young adult too?"" And yes I did enjoy it but I would not watch it again. This has been fun and hysterical but for the most part the jokes are focusing on humour for kids. There are humours employed which are weird, random and patronizing to kids (think of current Nickelodeon and Disney shows). One example was a double-decker couch which was not funny at all. Even the song 'Everything is Awesome' is too kiddy with its catchy and repetitive melody and lyrics. The ending, which I will not say what happened, is also kiddy and predictable. It was an ending desired by kids but mature audiences would know that it is not always true. Despite the kiddines, there are still good dialogues for more mature audiences to enjoy.<br/><br/>I also praise kudos to creative animation and action scenes. The animators and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller for capturing the essence of what Legos are all about, imagination. Even the plot embodied that ideal with the main character, Emmet, being one of the master builders who can have creative thoughts and he fights Mr. President to champion creativity over order and stability. Although ironically, this led to something of a cycle of cliché since it was painfully obvious that Emmett was the 'Chosen One' in spite of the fact that he was not creative at all. Yes we have that cliché on this one. I also liked the casting choices especially Morgan Freeman. Even as a voice actor he can still give great performance but so are other voice actors.<br/><br/>As you readers already see my rating, I gave it 7/10 because even though it was enjoyable and fun, mature audiences would not watch them again as we have already seen and heard many of the tropes and clichés that The Lego Movie used. I think smaller kids less than the age of 10 would probably re-watch the movie again but not for older audience. There was a lot of potential for The Lego Movie to be as original as it wanted it to be but if I sense correctly, the production team played it safe and stayed on familiar grounds for more profits. Of the huge high-budget animated movies I have seen, I could compare the movie to Frozen which was also made for masses but slightly better (which has clichés here and there) but the underrated Wreck-It-Ralph is way funnier and will be enjoyed by people of all ages. The latter movie is superior than Frozen or Lego Movie but because it did not get public attention, Wreck-It-Ralph will most likely be a hidden treasure for many years to come. So finish off my review, overall Lego movie was good but not excellent. The quality could have been better if it did had more imagination than presented.<br/><br/>SPOILER: One thing I really want to mention. Am I the only one who noticed Wyldstyle cheated on Batman by kissing Emmett? That's another cliché because movie seemed to want Emmett and Wyldstyle just for the sake of making kids to root for a developing romance between the main character and a lady. What message is this bringing to kids? And why did Batman just shrugged the affair off? He can get over cheating but cannot get over his parent's death? Something is really wrong with Batman."

","""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is a funny, unique and special film for everyone. Phil Lord and Chris Miller knows exactly how an Oscar-worthy animated film should be like. They are the perfect duo when it comes to directing fun and entertaining movies. A few years later, they directed ""21 Jump Street"", a hilarious and thrilling action-comedy. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are amazing when it comes to switching genres. From a friendly rated-PG animation- comedy-family flick to a rated-R action-comedy blockbuster.<br/><br/>""THE LEGO MOVIE' is like the last two movies directed by the duo.......amazing and unique. I love how the movie provides a simple and not too complicated plot which follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO minifigure who is mistakenly pulled into the world of the Masterbuilders in order to help stop an evil tyrant from his diabolical plan.<br/><br/>What can I say? Amazing direction by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. They did something similar to what they did with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, this time, with a lot more ideas and uniqueness. The voice performance of the cast was very splendid. especially Chris Pratt, who made the perfect ""chosen one'. Will Arnett and Liam Neeson did an excellent job providing the voices as ""Batman"" and Good-Cop/Bad-Cop"". Morgan Freeman was great too. The script was great too, delivering humorous jokes and a story which does not go too far.<br/><br/>All in all, The Lego Movie is the ideal blockbuster that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face."
"cleary-joshua","9","0","4","2 September 2014"," I wrote this off as another attempt to sell a product. How wrong I was...
","Two lists I want to bring to your attention on Wikipedia: Movies based on Video Games and, more relevant here, Movies based on Toys. If you look at the films on these lists and look for their Rotten Tomatoes scores, you will notice that very few are rated 'Fresh' - a startlingly low number, in fact. Why is this? I think this is because video games and toys often don't have plots that translate well to films, because they involve you doing things to them, and not characters as much. I will accept that video games are now a bit different, and that many are now far more plot based, but this was certainly the case in the past. When I first found out about ""The LEGO Movie"", I very quickly wrote it off as another attempt to sell a product within a shoddy plot framework. Thank goodness I was unbelievably wrong.<br/><br/>""The LEGO Movie"" is funny, intelligent and exciting for the entirety of its runtime, and so many elements contribute to its outstanding success. The film tells the story of standard mini-figure Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who teams up with the 'Master Builders' in order to save the universe from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). In that simple form, it's an ordinary ""chosen one"" plot line, but the writing and details ensure that it's anything but ordinary. Along the way, Emmet meets a host of different Lego characters, including the blind wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and many superheroes (Will Arnett's Batman is particularly great), and they travel through loads of different Lego landscapes on their quest.<br/><br/>You're probably still not sold on it, which is understandable - the film's plot isn't really its greatest quality. What makes this film so great is the writing and animation, both of a consistently high quality throughout. Everything in the animation is made of Lego, and is therefore animated like Lego. It's incredibly detailed, and through this you notice charming details throughout that make you appreciate just how much care has gone into the film. The visuals are great, and are the main thing that young kids will appreciate. The reason adults will see it is for the humour. I found myself laughing far more than my 6 year old cousin, and that's because it's written with the adults in mind. The song ""Everything is Awesome"", the ridiculous 'follow the rules' state that Emmet lives in, the references to Lego of the past, characters such as Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop and the noticeable cameos are all things which adults will love and appreciate. The real genius of the film is that it appeals so easily to both age groups.<br/><br/>""The LEGO Movie"" had the potential to be something so much worse. It could have been a thoughtless attempt to sell more Lego by constructing a shoddy, uninteresting plot around some bland characters (c.f. Transformers), but enough love and attention has gone into the film that you can't help but enjoy it. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, from '21 Jump Street' and 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' fame, are the perfect people to helm this film, with their irreverent and sharp sense of humour, especially visual humour. With a final quarter that is both surprising and poignant, this is undoubtedly a film that will touch adults and children alike, and leave them 100% satisfied."

"vegetarulzagain","9","0","2","30 August 2014"," The Makers of the Film were MasterBuilders!!
","!!!Massive Spiolers Ahead!!!<br/><br/>I found the experience of this film to be very different and very entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie starts in an apparent Utopian Lego society where everyone follows rules and in which creativity is hindered (Similar to the hindered creativity of the adult as compared to the creative mind of a child - that is revealed in the end). That happiness is an illusion and true happiness comes from creating something (or alternately doing something creative)<br/><br/>Then we meet our protagonist: your average, normal person who doesn't realize this. But upon the realization, strives to become the most interesting person in the world. This quest leads him to meet MasterBuilders (is this a word play? i am not sure). These MasterBuilders are highly creative yet eccentric people who are fighting against Lord Business (Another strong pun). And it is because of their eccentricity and maybe ego, that they are not able to succeed. They work individually but not as a team. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the protagonist uses his organizational skills to form a plan to ultimately defeat Lord Business. But as usual a lot of hurdles come in the way. <br/><br/>But in the end, something different happens. The villain is not defeated yet he is transformed from evil to good. <br/><br/>There are a lot of themes that are touched in this film. There are also a lot of word plays which are hilarious. The characters are awesome especially The Batman. There are also a lot of cultural reference here and there. Famous scenes, dialogues, scenarios are spoofed numerous times.<br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining film which has something for children as well as adults."
"paticula1135","9","0","2","19 August 2014"," Great Toy - Great Movie
","Before I go into this review, there are a few things you should know about me. I love Lego. As a kid I could not get enough, and today, I have to be held back in the store from buying it. I will do a lot to get my hands on Lego. Perhaps even more important, I love stop-motion animation, and naturally have an extremely soft spot for Lego-based stop-motion, or brickfilms as they are affectionately called from time to time. It seems then that it would be reasonable to think I would rather like the Lego Movie, but perhaps it is worth noting that I did not personally expect the Lego Movie to be any good, even after friends of mine insisted on its brilliance. I went into the film expecting a mediocre bag of jokes, an abundance of obvious CGI and generally nothing good.<br/><br/>But as is so often the case I was thankfully proved very wrong in my guess. I would, without hesitation, rank it among the better films I've seen in quite some time. I personally believe, for example, that it stands well over the head of the Hunger Games and a few other recent and extravagantly popular films. But never mind, I must move on into the actual review.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie, what can you say? It's a movie about Lego. Some might call it an hour long commercial, which is partly true. It's an extremely effective one as well, I might add. But even if one considers it a commercial, it can still tell a story, which the Lego Movie very much does. Emmet, the main character in this film, is very much your run-of- the-mill person. He does as much as possible not to stick out. In a sense, he sticks out, only because he is so dedicated to not trying to, but this is for later analysis. Furthermore, he embodies the spirit of so many of us. Emmet is so generic, that he can encapsulate anyone as a person. And yet, he's oddly unique for it. It presents a very intriguing characterization, one which works to a remarkably wide extent. Furthermore, Emmet, in his complacency and willingness to follow rules marks a fascinating commentary on the nature of society and in particular on how businesses and corporations seemingly dictate a large portion of our lives. The ""villain"", a word I ironically hesitate to use about Mr. Business, a man in a suit that shrieks evil, happens to represent them. A man in a suit, with plans to control everything and keep the world still and fixed in place, using the mythical Kragle to accomplish this, Mr. Business is a well-constructed antagonist. Simultaneously wicked and evil, yet understandable and sympathetic. There is a lovely sequence in the film that demonstrates this, but it would spoil far too much for me to talk about it already, so I shall save it.<br/><br/>Now, while Emmet illustrates the extreme end of conformity, we have Wild Style, a lady so packed full of energy, ability, and cool that Emmet can't help but fall for her instantly. Indeed, for a piece of plastic, they do a remarkably good job of making her seem far more human than some actors can make the living flesh seem. There's far more to her than initially meets the eye, and the eventual reveal is remarkably well executed. Furthermore, her representation of ultimate individualism almost forces the viewer to adopt a middle-ground or come to their own conclusions as to what end is better, for while it seems the Lego movie favours the latter, it makes no obvious moral decision as to which is superior; a move that I find to be a highly respectful of viewers, who ought hardly be thought of as unthinking or unable to decide upon things themselves. No, the only message that is made obviously clear comes near the end, and it works so well for what it is, that I dare hardly tell what it actually is. Suffice it to say that the Lego Movie is a brilliant celebration, not just of itself, but of culture, popular and otherwise, play and most importantly creativity. An understanding that everyone is special, everyone is unique, everyone has something to contribute, even Emmet who seems so utterly deprived of anything unique; the Lego Movie is very heart-warming.<br/><br/>I feel it is necessary to point out that the Lego Movie is visually a masterpiece, combining stop motion animation and CGI in a way I thought almost impossible, and with set and character design that fills one with inspiration and a lust to build away. The numerous references to culture, nods towards various aspects of today's circles of jokes, particularly through its celebrity casting and choice of settings as well as characters, and even quite a number of references to Lego itself, make the Lego Movie approachable to more or less anyone. There is a wonderful level of self-awareness with the Lego Movie, and a constant feeling of it being not unlike the adventures of Lego as a child one likely had. It strikes a wonderful tone that simply can't be disdained.<br/><br/>I suggest you purchase this film at your nearest opportunity, regardless of convenience and sit down to watch it."

This is especially remarkable when you consider what it is. Whoever heard of a movie based on a toy (that has no actual story associated with it) being good?<br/><br/>Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have previous on this, though. Their first movie was Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, which is as goofy a title as I can remember, and no more than a one-gag set-up to boot... and yet they imbued it with a surreal humour that attracted audiences. Then they revived 80s TV series 21 Jump Street, and the record for that kind of adaptation is very patchy at best, but they pulled that round too.<br/><br/>Lord and Miller seem to have their finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist. Supported by a genius idea for an underlying theme, The Lego Movie looks stunning too. The graphics are impressively composed entirely from Lego blocks genuinely available to the public, assembled into whole scenes and settings. The animators took the opportunity to throw in a million blink-and-miss-it sight gags, in a remarkable show of attention detail.<br/><br/>I have to say that, in contradiction to other views I have heard, I found the song 'Everything is Awesome' by Tegan and Sara, which is a prominent part of the film, to be annoying but catchy rather than actually good, although that is still a credit to T&S because that is the role of the song in the film. It is improved by the comedic rapping of The Lonely Island in the full extended version, heard over the end credits.<br/><br/>A host of star names, both playing their most famous characters and playing other characters of note, enliven the proceedings. This is appropriate, given that the Lego franchise's recent revival has been built on adapting iconic series such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman into games using the Lego block style.<br/><br/>A sequel seems inevitable, and I hope it is still this good, now that they have the weight of expectation on them.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"

","President Business (Will Ferrell) steals the Kragle, an object of unlimited power, from Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a prophet who predicts that someone called the Special , will find another object called the Piece of Resistance, that has the ability to stop the all-powerful Kragle from inflicting any harm. An average construction worker named Emmitt Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is so good at fitting in, and following all the rules, that he doesn't leave an impression on anyone.<br/><br/>Emmitt is happy listening to his favorite song, ""Everything Is Awesome"" and watching his favorite show, ""Where Are My Pants"" both produced by the Octan corporation, whose CEO is President Business. He follows the blueprints to build everything, and is perfectly content to go on living the way he lives. Emmitt is at the construction site after hours, telling someone to leave because it's against the rules. All of a sudden, he realizes that the intruder is the most beautiful girl he's ever seen. Her name is Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and she's after the Piece of Resistance. While Emmitt is transfixed by Wildstyle the Piece of Resistance becomes permanently affixed to Emmitt, and he can't take it off. Now that Emmitt has the Piece of Resistance he becomes a target of President Business and his loyal foot soldier Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) President Business is planning to use the Kragle to immobilize the citizens of his realm on Taco Tuesday, because he is a rigid dictator. Can Emmitt evade Bad Cop and get the Piece of Resistance to the top of the Octan Tower before President Business uses the Kragle on his populace? Is Emmitt the Special? Does he fulfill the prophesy?<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie. The Everyman has a chance to rise to the occasion, and become the Special. That might be a hackneyed premise, it may even be borrowed from movies like Star Wars and The Matrix, but that's what makes this movie so endearing, it doesn't take itself too seriously at all. It's even subtly subversive, OK obviously subversive, anti-corporate and wackily anti-conformist. The Lego Movie does lose its focus a bit when it becomes solely about product placement when Emmitt zooms around the different playsets, but unlike Transformers (Similar toy, worse movies) The Lego Movie finds its footing, and has a satisfying ending, which is neither cloying nor saccharine, but heartfelt. More important than all the adult themes kids learn the importance of individuality, and also working together when necessary. Those themes may seem contradictory, but they are not in this movie.<br/><br/>The voice talent is amazing in this movie. Chris Pratt plays Emmitt as a low key hero. Morgan Freeman is splendid, just hearing his golden voice as the prophet Vitruvius is worth the price of a rental. Will Ferrell redeems himself after a string of lousy movies, as the evil President Business, but there's more to his character than initially appears. Elizabeth Banks has a great voice, she conveys a sense of innocence, and yet her voice sounds sexy. Can I say she has a sexy voice in a movie aimed at kids? Well it's true. Will Arnett is hilarious as Batman, and Liam Neeson makes a nice comedic turn as Bad Cop. There are cameos by a few Star Wars stars, Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams add to the laughs, and professional voice actor Keith Ferguson does a pretty serviceable Harrison Ford impression as Han Solo. Shaquille O' Neal even shows up as himself. All the actors understood how much fun this movie was, and joined in the spirit of making a truly entertaining film.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is more like an action film than an animated film, so the 1 hour 40 minute length goes by in a flash, rent it and watch it with your kids, or watch it with your friends, it's that funny.<br/><br/>Want to build your knowledge of film?

","As many would have said by now, somewhere along the way, we played with Legos and have done some crazy things what our minds could do. This movie does that and much more.<br/><br/>A plot that is simple to understand and fun to explore to a T, characters that are very easy to latch on to, worlds that one could imagine that happen, loving to see that every moment of what could only happen on a play mat before now.<br/><br/>The Lego is one solid family film, that is going to be remember.<br/><br/>It is one of few movies that would be great is a part two comes from it, if just remembers what this movie was and could do and beyond that, than there is nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>A late reply this might have been, but one that needed to be said.

","I saw the trailer for this film months before it was released and was quivering with anticipation until I saw it on opening night. I was not disappointed. This film exceeded all my expectations.<br/><br/>Although obviously aimed at children and acting as a superb marketing gimmick (I wanted to blow the dust off my old Lego sets the moment the film was over) the film held a coherent plot line, excellent cast of voice actors, a clever mix of stop-motion and smooth animation, a great score and enough laughs and adult pitched humour to keep everybody entertained from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The creators ability to poke fun at themselves and the Lego universe in which they were operating belied the high level of planning and forethought that had been used to develop this film.<br/><br/>I have watched The Lego Movie twice already and know that in a few months it will bear watching a third time."

","I remember playing with brick toys in childhood days. We make different shapes with it, starting from a toy-bird to a building or an airplane. All the animated characters in the movie are based on these brick toys made by the company. The imagination level of this movie-maker is way up high and I couldn't resist humor in some scenes. There are number of memorable characters such as good-cop/bad-cop, wild-style, Vitruvius, Unikitty and 'special'. The batman, superman, Gandalf, Green lantern and Dumberldore were cool too. No wonder the movie got award for best innovative advertising for its cool. The movie features very mild crude jokes that may just require PG. <br/><br/>The coolest thing about the movie is the message – Having free will."
"CMTiago","8","0","2","31 July 2014"," Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie
","To quote the movie, this tale of high impact adventure and stakes is quite simply, you guessed it, awesome. Everything ranging from the animation to the story and its laugh out loud jokes, this is a must see movie for all ages. The story follows a an ordinary construction worker named Emmet, who through a series of mishaps, ends up being mistaken for an unlikely hero. Sure the plot line is obviously close to the dozens of adventure, hero driven movies being made. What sets Lego apart is its execution that will make you burst out with laughter, while also adding a dynamic dramatic edge to it.<br/><br/>Coming from the pair that brought us Cloudy WIth A Chance Of Meatballs in 2009, I knew that this project was in good hands from the start. Still what makes this one better, at least in my eyes, is the satirical look into the whole story and for that I thank Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Plus, with the multiple pop culture references there will be plenty of familiar faces to recognize, not to mention Batman takes center stage as the character who will bring in more chuckles.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, The Lego Movie may be seen as a commercial movie given its brand recognition, however, I strongly advise you to watch this movie as not only will you have the time of your life, you will make your own interpretation of the story's true meaning<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5/10"
"jdkraus","10","0","2","30 July 2014"," Everything is awesome
","K-NEX and Legos. Those were the building toys I grew up on. They were awesome. A Lego Movie did not sound awesome. It actually seemed ridiculous and just overall bad. It took a bit of persuasion from a friend to see this movie. Only 10 minutes into watching it, my verdict was immediate awesomeness. The story itself is really not that great. It's orbital protagonist is Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary guy who is considered to be ""the chosen,"" who will obtain a mystical item called the ""resistance piece"" and vanquish Lord Business (Will Ferrel), who has enslaved just about all the people in Lego World into a strict, scheduled, totalitarian government. He is aided by some other fellow lego characters and is mercilessly pursued by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). This all sounds like a clichéd plot.<br/><br/>But, what makes ""The Lego Movie"" awesome is all its other recipes. The animation, combined with both CG and stop motion, is flawless and glorious to watch. I recommend viewing it on a big TV screen (I did not see it in theater, so I can only imagine its fun magnitude). The colors and animation are beautiful. <br/><br/>The voice acting cast is perfect. Additional names include Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, and Charlie Day. Arnett and Neeson steal the show as Batman and Good Cop Bad Cop. I never would have taken Neeson for comedy. He does two interchanging voices so well that I can't take him seriously, as intended for the movie of course. Perhaps the best part is the overall fun that the movie delivers. It gives a nostalgic look back on childhood and parodies so many other games, movies, characters, and toys to the point that I was laughing non-stop. Batman, Superman, The Green Lantern, Abe Lincoln, Han Solo, Chewbecca, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Unikitty all make hysterical appearances. <br/><br/>I can't think of any rating other than a perfect score to give this movie. It's not the best movie ever made, but just like the song in the beginning of the movie, ""Everything is awesome."""
"tobydale","9","0","2","27 July 2014"," Awesome!
","What a GREAT family movie! Just watched this again as we bought the BluRay when it came out. Didn't have the impact (of course) of the big screen experience - but still great fun.<br/><br/>This film absolutely rips along at high pace - such that even those with an attention span measured in nanoseconds would find it impossible to wander off.<br/><br/>The opening scenes in the city and building site are truly eye-popping, especially when seen on the big screen. These set the tone for the visuals which truly are AWESOME. The people who made this film need the Oscar for what they have done here. The visual impact is off the scale and sets new standards.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the story with any form of description - but I will say that there is something here for everyone. Huge chunks of this are hilarious (eg, Batmans ""song""!).<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is reverential to imagination and creativity in words and film - as the makers understand that Lego enables creativity and that films and books are great sources of inspiration. I will list the homage paid to some great films/TV series and stories: The Matrix trilogy, 2001 a Space Odyssey/The Time Tunnel (falling down the portal), Alien, The Blues Brothers, Bruce Almighty (Ok - that's not such a great film), Westerns in general, Batman, Star Wars, Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin), Toy Story. There are plenty of others - these are just the ones I can think of.<br/><br/>This film is really REALLY good for all viewers - do not be put off by any presupposition that this is ""only for kids"". It may be - but watching it will certainly bring out the kid in you....<br/><br/>I'm not going to give this 10 out of 10 because that would put it in the best films of all-time category (like, Casablanca or Remains of the Day, or Toy Story). Nevertheless, this film rates a 9 and is.... AWESOME!!!"

","Well, i think there will be a lot of criticism coming from older viewers, but the film is exactly as it makes out to be. Fun, exciting and funny. The visual in general is very good. The characters all work very well, and it helps with the cast list littered with celebrities! If you want to see it for a serious inspection of an action-animation comedy, don't bother watching. If you want to have a laugh and something to cheer you up, i highly recommend the Lego movie for you. The film has serious moments at exactly the right times, and makes unnecessary jokes that surprisingly make it better. I had a good time watching it and I'm sure you will too."

","When I first saw this movie's trailer I was very conflicted inside. On one hand, this film could be very fun and visually inventive. On the other hand, however, it could have been nothing more than a giant advertisement for LEGO products. And then the reviews came in. HOLY SMOKES THIS IS A WELL-REVIEWED MOVIE! I don't think people realize just how well-received this film is. It is just as critically praised as any of the Pixar classic films. And after finally seeing this movie for the first time, I can see why. The first thing I should mention is its statements on how society works. It is simple and extremely inventive at the same time. The leaders dividing the land and taking out creativity puts a lot of purpose into the conflict and makes the conflict seem more realistic because humans have and still do divide up their land for their own purposes. The writers take this concept and roll with it, adding plenty of humor to boost. Speaking of the humor, this film is also very funny. It's one of those laugh-a-minute gag sort of movies, which is both a good and bad thing. Good because most of gags really work. Bad because these gags taking away from developing any character in the film. Like I'm pretty sure few people could explain more than two things about each character. Both the main character and villain are rather weak and not that entertaining because there is very little time to develop either of them. Speaking of that adding a clique ""You've got to believe in yourself"" isn't creative in the slightest and doesn't add to the main character's personality at all. The character I connected to the most wasn't Emmet, wasn't Wyldstyle, but that Uni-Kitty thing. The Uni-Kitty lost its entire home and did its best to always have a smile on its face. It was depressing to watch her almost lose it. This is a problem because the most relatable character was a side character with little purpose or dialogue. I can't go any further without any spoilers, so SPOILER ALERT. If you want to see this movie but haven't yet, skip the following paragraph.<br/><br/>The fact that the kid is controlling the LEGOS is very creative don't get me wrong, but it's also very confusing. The kid is controlling everything, but then whispers to Emmett ""It's up to you."" ...what?! Weren't you controlling him the whole time? Because I'm pretty sure the film made it clear that Emmett struggled moving in real life. <br/><br/>That being said, this is a visual masterpiece. The LEGO Movie is a mix of stop-motion and CGI, and it is gorgeous to watch. The film's highlights are easily the awesome action scenes where the Master Builders are building and/or rearranging legos. I know it seems like I have a lot to complain, but the thing about the parts I enjoyed is that I don't have to explain them that much. The humor is at some points hilarious and the visuals are absolutely stunning. It's just that these LEGO characters need to build up some character. So ""everything is awesome"" may be a bit of an overstatement, but the LEGO Movie certainly shows why LEGOS are still popular after all of these years."

","The Lego Movie is a 2014 animated comedy based on the famous Lego. I didn't get the chance to see this in the Cinemas so I bought it on DVD for my brother who seen it in a friends house and I ended up watching it instead cause my brother had no interest in it since I am a big fan of animated movies ever since I was a kid.<br/><br/>The story of this movie is pretty straight-forward. A Lego figurine called Emmett voiced by Chris Pratt is an ordinary figurine who finds it hard to make friends as nobody knows him at all. He of course meets another figurine called Wildstyle(aka Lucy) voiced by Elizabeth Banks and together the two go to different worlds(like in that 2013 flick Wreck It Ralph where Ralph enters different worlds by going into each game)here in this movie they go in by a vortex. Meanwhile an evil villain named Lord Business(aka President Business) voiced by Will Ferrell(who also voiced a villain in Mega Mind and is even in this movie as a father to a kid who built the Lego World,but we don't get to see that until the near end of the movie)is trying to take over the Lego world by destroying it and its up to Emmett who was known as the chosen one to build and create new things to stop the evil villain.<br/><br/>In this movie there is a ton of cameos from Batman,Wonder Woman,Superman,Green Lantern,Star Wars,Michealangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Cleopatra and many more in Lego form and there is a few adult jokes in there that the kids won't understand. Bottom line I thought this film was going to be so stupid but I was wrong in fact I think I enjoyed this more than my little brother who wouldn't content himself sitting down AT ALL watching this on DVD with me. <br/><br/>If you ever played with Lego or is familiar with Lego than this is for you.<br/><br/>If you have kids aged 5 up than this is for you.<br/><br/>Or if you are like me a big kid at heart who LOVES animated movies than check it out too.<br/><br/>Overall out of 5 its a 4 out of 5 and out of 10 im giving it a 7."
"leonblackwood","7","0","2","20 July 2014"," Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10
","Review: For some unknown reason, I really enjoyed this funny movie. It really does have something for everyone and although the storyline is completely ridiculous, it really did make me laugh. There is a great mixture of characters and the references to other movies were well written. I was shocked to see the cast list and I was amazed that Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman agreed to do this movie because it's completely out of there character. The originality of the film was refreshing and the directors done well by making all the Lego characters actually look the Lego. The annoying ""Awesome"" song made me laugh and Batman was a great addition to the many different characters. In all, I was surprised with the outcome, after hearing all of the hype behind the movie, and judging by the money that it took at the box office, I'm not the only one that thought that this was a great watch. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman have to have the two most striking voices in cinema. I couldn't really tell who Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was but it was good to see that the director used the real Billy Dee William and Shaquille O'Neal. Will Ferrell was great in person and his voice as Lord Business really did work. Don't get me wrong, the movie is extremely far fetched and the concept was crazy, but that is what makes the movie work. They have already planned a sequel, which isn't surprising after that gross, and as soon as I saw this movie, I put the Batman Lego movie straight on my rental list. I honestly think that you will see something new every time that you watch this film because there is so much going on and the pace is quite fast. I haven't been that impressed with a lot of animated movies that have come out recently but after watching this film, my faith has truly been restored.<br/><br/>Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $468million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there heroic animated movies about a everyday construction worker who has been told that he has a gift to save the world. 7/10"

","You can watch this film and enjoy the CGI effects that make it look like stop-action work with actual Lego blocks or claymation work. Even the water looks like it is constructed from Legos.<br/><br/>Or you can also enjoy the many pop culture references. Many of them are related to films. So ""The Lego Movie"" is easy to enjoy for anyone who enjoys movies. It also uses many film conventions (slo-mo action, romantic film scenarios, etc.). There are also references, visual and thematic, to such films/books as ""The Matrix"", ""Transformers"", and even ""Zaradoz"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"".<br/><br/>But from the first, this film shows itself to be so much more. It is not merely a satire of pop culture icons. It is a very pointed satire of political and social customs and conventions. Watching those little block-people in their block-world transcends the images themselves and in a graphic way the film presents glimpses into cultural truths that most of us can identify with. How much of my life is about following directions? How much of our culture is designed to make me feel good about the slot it wants to plug me into? How easily does the human brain allow its owner to fool himself, by distractions, into a false sense of individuality?<br/><br/>You can enjoy the film on any of these levels. It is extremely well done. Some of the character voices fit their characters so well they are nearly iconic. <br/><br/>This is animation, but it is not Disney. It has so much to say that children will not discern. And the action is nonstop so you may find yourself asking how 100 minutes could pass so quickly. Clever, clever, clever. If you liked ""Wreck-It Ralph"", you should like ""The Lego Movie""."

","Talk about a Lego world. First of all, you begin thinking like a kid and you wonder...how many Lego sets did it take to make this movie?! Emmet Brickowski(Chris Pratt) lives and works in a world of extraordinary and talented individuals. But ask his co-workers, neighbors and friends...Emmett is just simple, plain and practically unnoticeable. Nothing special about Emmett. He is sometimes made fun of for always following directions at work, at home and in life. One day by accident, Emmett falls and finds a coveted ""Piece of Resistance"" and this now makes him ""The Special"". With this and a little know how, the big mean President Business(Will Ferrell)can be thwarted and the world of Master Builders can be saved from ""Taco Tuesday"" and his total domination.<br/><br/>A beautiful Wyldstyle(Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend Batman(Will Arnett)and wise Vitruvis(Morgan Freeman) team up to unlock Emmett's mindset of always following directions and use some creative thinking to overpower President Business with ""The Piece of Resistance"". After all, Emmett is now ""Special"" and it is his destiny to save the Master Builders of a world made of Legos.<br/><br/>THE LEGO MOVIE is rated PG and is family fare. The kids can enjoy this without much supervision; but there is enough action to sustain even a grownup's attention. The notable Mark Mothersbaugh puts his thumb print on the music and Mark Ackland is credited as concept artist and designer. Many other recognizable actor's voices bring vitality: Will Forte, Cobie Smulders, Liam Neeson, Channing Tatum, Billy Dee Williams, Shaq O'Neal and Jonah Hill."

On the downside however there is batman, but ... OK, batman stole the 10th star. He is just mean like that.<br/><br/>If you snored through other animated movies with their boring hollywoodish scripts (I'm talking to you, pixar), then this movie will fill your synapses with rainbow powderpuff glitz.

"CinemaCocoa","9","0","2","13 July 2014"," Utter LUNACY! In a good way!
","As if progressing from such experiences as Scott Pilgrim and Wreck-It Ralph, The Lego Movie fully embraces its decision to simple exist that what we get is magical, insane, inspiring, childish and so unbelievably happy. I had a stupid, stupid grin on my face constantly.<br/><br/>Emmett is a construction worker living in a world of regimented order, social control and live literally by the book (they have instruction manuals on how to live.) But when an evil tyrant called Lord Business looks to glue their world together, he discovers that a prophecy deems him ""The Special"" and will save the world from a fate worse than death.<br/><br/>What's incredible about The Lego Movie is how even critics like it. I'll be honest, perhaps a quarter of the way through I was asking myself: ""What am I actually watching?? This is literally an insane concept! Stupid."" But those thoughts left as quickly as they came... A movie about Lego couldn't be (and shouldn't be) anything other than this!<br/><br/>This film is never on the rails; it is permanently unhinged and borderline surreal. We have wonderful animation techniques (CG stop-motion) that capture the plastic and printed nature of the toy, that looks charming up close and dissolves into absolute chaos when the bricks start flying! It becomes such a joy to watch, despite how airhead and loopy it is. You have tonnes of cameos too, Lego have rights to almost everything and here they do not pull their punches. Batman is a main character, Wonder Woman, Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Lincoln, Gandalf, even Shaquille O'Neal, all feature.<br/><br/>That should be your inner child sated, kids will love it. But if I may delve a little further, this movie's theme actually speaks about Lego as a creative medium too! What's more devastating in a child's mind than someone + gluing Lego pieces together?? That's terrible, and in terms of Lego plight that's as evil as it can be! The film goes further still, but I wouldn't want to tell you everything.<br/><br/>It is utter madness and there's a lot to be said about how it is a nonsense stitched together with a generic prophetic ""zero-to-hero"" storyline... But really, it says ""The Lego Movie"" on your ticket, this is what you should expect and, and a little bit more!"
"sunshinebeachcinema","10","0","2","13 July 2014"," Fantastic film, everything you could want from a Lego movie.
","What we've got here is a fantastic film, which could genuinely be enjoyed by anyone. That might be an obvious thing to say, but The Lego Movie might be the closest we've come to the elusive story which explores realistic, down to earth problems while being completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots. And there are plenty of robots.<br/><br/>Ironically, for a film based on a lucrative product owned by a giant corporation, The Lego Movie appears to bite the hand that feeds it and actually deconstructs (here come the puns) the corporate world. Who cares if the film will probably make a killing in tie-in Lego sets and video games? At least they decided to tell a compelling and engaging story instead of just palming us off with a heartless cash-in or an overblown explosion-fest.<br/><br/>Similarly, it feels like it's far too easy these days for film makers to knock out a bunch of cheap CGI movies every year, at the expense of the increasingly neglected but labour intensive art of stop-motion. It's understandable why this route has been taken, and there are a few gems in the cascade, but outside of Pixar, CGI films are not something I routinely seek out.<br/><br/>Apparently 90% of The Lego Movie was CGI, and a little bit of stop motion, but apart from the facial expressions and fluid movements which would seriously push the limitations of a plastic Lego man, you could easily have convinced me that it was the other way around. Everything looks like it's made from Lego, even the oceans and the explosions.<br/><br/>It's both sobering to have reached a point where the two become almost indistinguishable and satisfying to see CGI being used to make a great film which works as both a satire of modern consumerism and an exploration of that age-old Lego dilemma: should one build according to the instructions, or just smash everything into a big pile and build whatever.<br/><br/>Our main man is Emmett (Chris Pratt), your generic Lego man, right down to his classic Lego smiley face. He's a construction worker living in a huge Lego city, who has very few ideas of his own. He follows his instructions, smiles and waves to everyone he meets, pays through the nose for coffee on the way to work and does whatever the vaguely Orwellian government says is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>In a typical narrative fashion, events kick off after a chance encounter with funky punk girl Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who is a member of the resistance. Emmett is dragged along for the ride and passes through the masquerade, leaving the regulated order of the big city and discovering the crazy and colourful potential of Lego in the world of the master builders, exiled lords of creative construction who believe Emmett to be the chosen one to bring balance to the force and end the days of instruction-based oppression. The trouble is he's never had an original thought in his life.<br/><br/>The film is rounded out with a great cast of characters and some cracking cameos, both showcasing some solid vocal talent. The enemy and instigator of the repressive order is a suitably zany Will Ferrell hamming it up as the Lego universe's 'President Business' who is assisted by the conflicted split-personality of his chief enforcer Good Cop/Bad Cop. voiced by Liam Neeson at his Irish tough guy best.<br/><br/>With a wry nod to his frequent typecasting, Morgan Freeman plays a wise old sage and among the cameos are Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (from directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's other movie of the moment, 22 Jump Street).<br/><br/>The film really embodies the spirit of Lego, and as such is a huge nostalgia trip for anyone who's ever encountered the stuff. Once they leave the city, the characters traverse the length and breadth of the Lego-verse, making their way through the many themes Lego has released over the years, providing settings as diverse as western, medieval and pirate.<br/><br/>There are some tender and serious moments, but most of it is a merciless but affectionate parody of whatever transpires, be it city life, epic destiny, overblown villainy or blockbuster action. Everything's funny and a little wacky, riding easily and successfully on the inherent humour that comes with having everything made out of Lego.<br/><br/>There are even nods to unpopular, ill-conceived, or just plain random Lego themes, and references small and large to various other franchise tie-ins (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Superheroes, etc.) showcasing the kind of mad-cap crossovers you can cook up when you have the licence. By this token, Batman himself (Will Arnett) along with a character from the classic 1980s Space theme (Charlie Day) are major players in the plot.<br/><br/>The ending, which I won't spoil, does get a little schmaltzy, but it's forgivable. Otherwise, nothing disappoints, and everything one might want or expect from a Lego movie is delivered in spades. Oh yes, and I managed to get through an entire review of this film without using the word 'awesome'. Dang. Good soundtrack, though."

","4 out of 4 stars.<br/><br/>When I first saw the previews for this movie, I was skeptical. My brother and I loved Legos growing up, but a stop-motion animated feature with Legos both intrigued me and made me worry. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's ""The Lego Movie"" is a smart, quick, witty, and self-reflexive animated film that lives up to all the fun anyone can have with Legos. <br/><br/>The story is about about Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego builder, who finds the 'Special' and is chased by Lord Business (Will Ferrel) throughout the Lego realms. Emmet gets help from the master builders, which include Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), and many more. <br/><br/>What's great about ""The Lego Movie"" is that it knows what it is, accepts it, but has a lot of fun with it. Whether its Popsicle wielding Legos or the dreaded glue, ""The Lego Movie"" sets up a quirky universe that is smart and creative. It brings together superheroes, science-fiction characters, wizards, astronauts, presidents, and basketball players and let's them all have a fun say in the story.<br/><br/>It looks at the way we use Legos. There are the instruction crazed Lego builders and the builders who make up whatever they want. Personally, I was the rule following builder and my brother was the master builder. ""The Lego Movie"" captures the best of both and makes you remember the magic of building Legos. The film is an ode to creativity and building dreams.<br/><br/>You can also look at this film in philosophical ways. It's about identity and modern society. It may seem ridiculous to look at an animated film like that, but you can with this film. It balances these ideas with great fun and imagination.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is a colorful, original, and hilarious film that opens your imagination. It's well- written, has a great cast, and beautiful animation. Kids can laugh at the slap-stick humor and adults can catch all the witty dialogue and film references. I think it's one of the best animated films of this year and one of my favorite films so far this year."

","I didn't think much of this movie when I heard about it, but a friend recommended I see it and I'm glad he did. This is a fantastic film and one of the best of the year. I thought that it was very creative and the Lego style animation was really well done and unique. The highlight for me though is the voice over work by an all star cast. Chris Pratt (notably of Her, Parks and Recreation) and Elizabeth Banks (recently of The Hunger Games movies and 30 Rock) have the personality and wit to bring these characters to life. Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and Morgan Freeman also provide plenty of humour (yes, you read that right: Morgan Freeman was hilarious!).<br/><br/>I also loved that the characters in the movie were a random mish-mash from comics, major Hollywood films and current pop culture and the adventure that ensures is ridiculously silly and a lot of fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected as this was very cleverly written (I had a hard time keeping with the humour at times as I was still laughing from a previous gag). As it concluded, it also took an unexpected and touching turn and reminds us that sometimes it's good to embrace uniqueness and think outside the box. A useful lesson for young and old alike and humorously ironic given the Lego toys this is based on. Funny, witty and surprisingly entertaining, this is not to be missed and is great fun for all ages.<br/><br/>Was my review not horrible? Great!

","Creativity and ingenuity may be in short supply in live-action Hollywood films these days, but that's certainly not the case in animation, as 'The Lego Movie' proves. With wit, charm, humor and adventure to spare, it manages that rarest of feats; truly being fun for all ages.<br/><br/>The animation here is just incredible. It really is like your Legos come to life. And with the aid of its top-notch voice cast and clever script, you soon forget that you're watching a film about little plastic bricks.<br/><br/>If you want a film with the fun built in, look no further than 'The Lego movie'."
"estreet-eva","8","0","1","1 July 2014"," Inventive as plastic blocks in the hands of a hyperactive 4 yr old
","This 90 minute infomercial for the iconic children's toy presents about 20 minutes of clever but plodding world-building. At about that mark, the filmmakers find this whole other hyperactive gear and the jokes come faster than Vin Diesel in a street race. Enough Batman and Star Wars references fly at the audience to give a geek study group fodder for several nights. The movie runs through genres as often as Lego worlds (""Middle Zealand"" being a personal favorite) while teeing up cliché- bursting one-liners as rapidly as audience members can laugh at them. Just at the point of exhaustion, they trout out Will Farrell to play a weirdly-obsessed dad outside the fourth wall. That the writers can take all the plot points, the subplots and the meta-plot and wrap it up into what actually turns out to be a warm and somehow affecting ending speaks to the level of prowess missing from the ""Lost"" TV show. In short, one of the few movies actually worth buying as well as best commercial ever."

","Well what can I say about this film apart from funny. I didn't love this film yes I found it funny but to tell you the truth I think it was a bit over done. I would of given the film a 7 if it wasn't for 2 of he characters and the little Easter egg half way through the film. The first was Morgan Freeman his voice and the way his character acted was one of the best parts of this film, the second was the Lego Star Wars Easter egg. Legos biggest and one of the longest franchises is Star Wars so it is a good thing that they included it the last was Batman. In my opinion Batman saved this film as he was just the best, he was over the top and funny as hell he acted like a teenager which made me laugh a lot and he has the best jokes by far in the film. When I started watching this film I didn't get all the jokes but after about 10 minutes I started to laugh and when batman walked in I just lost it couldn't stop laughing and the film got better and better until it was blowing out of the water. That was the human part of the film in the last 15 minutes. This film was cool as the hole would was Lego you got to see Lego people build Lego things and it is very good for a film made on computers. This film has a great cast and an OK story, for a Lego movie. This film is worth a try and is a very good laugh, it is great for the kids and I would even say it is worth getting on Blu-Ray."

","2014 is that rare year where Pixar and Disney don't release a new film. While that makes me sad, I have a theory that the other studios decided, ""hey let's put out our best films"". So now we have Dragons 2 and The Lego Movie dominating our screens. In The Lego Movie, we follow Emmet, a completely plain Lego construction worker living his day to day life by the rules. That is, until he get's involved in this grand quest with a fellowship of Lego Warriors to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. We've all seen this plot before, and this movie knows it. I LOVE this film, it's so smartly written and full of laughs. It feels like watching a really great Disney movie. You never have that feeling of ""blah been there done that"" and thats because the movie has all these pop culture references, breathtaking animation, and there's plenty of humor for us grown folk. The cast is made up of some pretty well known names; Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, and Will Arnett are a few, but it was Morgan Freeman and Liam freaking Neeson that show some great voice acting skills. As I said, the animation is mind blowing but beautiful to look at honestly. Believe me when I say EVERYTHING, even the explosions are made of Legos! If you couldn't tell by now, I was pretty amazed by this movie. The ending, was what made this a great animation movie. It hit me hard and surprised me. Kids will love it, adults will have a good time too. This is definitely worth a purchase, and I didn't even get into how awesome Batman is in this one. Awesome little Star Wars collab in this one."

","What can be said about ""The Lego Movie"" that already hasn't? I think the millions upon millions of children singing the songs from the blockbuster sum everything up quite well. Warner Bros. Pictures and the Lego brand have most definitely hit pay dirt with a film that attracts not only rough and tumble boys looking to build something to knock it down, but even gentle little girls who dream of princesses and Uni- Kitties. <br/><br/>The evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plots to glue the Lego Universe together in permanent harmony. A construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) is believed to be the ""Special"" who will deliver the Lego world from the grasps of the tyrant. He teams up with feisty female Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), and other reluctant heroes to stop the oppressor and his minions.<br/><br/>The film is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. Although some might say there's some violence, it's always meant to be lighthearted and never taken seriously. After all, they ARE only Legos. The only people who will have a problem with this movie are ones who don't like the violent silliness of ""The Three Stooges.""<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is a rousing good time for the whole family. It's front-loaded with enough juvenile humor to satisfy any child and packed with a sufficient amount of pop culture references to attract older audiences and members of the geek illuminati. The only thing you have to worry about is the annoyance you'll begin to experience from having your kids run around the house singing ""Everything is Awesome"" day and night."

","Enjoyed this movie a lot. You don't have to be a kid to like it. I really enjoyed the addition of the superheroes, like Batman, etc. the humor is grownup, but not lewd. It's still appropriate for PG audience, but sophisticated enough for adults. The characters are well written and complex. I especially liked Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt. He has that same goofy innocence you associate with Chris's character on Parks and Rec. The integration of Lego shapes and pieces was wonderful. If I have any complaint, it's that it gets a little long in the final climactic battle. I however, it's not nearly as bad as tMan of Steel and the last Transformers movie.

This was great miss dialed you I remember playing with LEGOs with my brothers as a child. And really and truly you could make anything and you felt that way. And your imagination went wild. And it was so much fun competing with each other to see who could make the most interesting objects. I am so glad this movie reminded me of how much fun I used to have with Legos.

No one expected much from this movie when it was announced (myself included), so to see just how good this thing turned out is the real surprise.

"Reno-Rangan","8","0","1","17 June 2014"," Frankly, I never expected it would be this much awesome.
","3D animation is a new thing in the cinema world. Just the two decades old technology, which started with 'Toy Story'. So as it is young, filmmakers utilizing it very awesomely to create great stuffs. So far we had seen the many wonders of classical tales such as 'Tangled', 'Frozen' et cetera, as well based on the modern subjects like, 'Cars', 'Turbo' et cetera. Here it comes one more movie that specially made referring gaming object like the recent one 'Wreck-It-Ralp'.<br/><br/>I loved 'Wreck-It-Ralp', but the fact is that I was not in favour of this movie. Expected it gonna bomb at the box office, then surprised me with the result and made very curious. I knew characters in the form of Lego bricks are easy to animate, we can say just like the stop-motion animation, but it won't give smooth pleasurable flow. That truly bothered me over this movie. Once I began to watch within a few minutes I got adjusted with it so comfortable and enjoyed completely.<br/><br/>The story of an ordinary construction worker, Emmet and his unexpected journey towards saving the world. He was accompanied by the great fighters and warriors and superheroes. He has to find the secret plan of villainous leader who controls the land of Lego and must defeat him. To know that you must watch the movie.<br/><br/>It is a nice movie, though the story is not fresh. Kind of spoof which imitates recent past movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', Chris Nolan's Batman movie and many others. Especially all the famous characters from various movies had the cameos. It was so fun having them together in one place. So it is not the story, but the way of story telling was so innovative and modern and that showed this movie to the gate of success.<br/><br/>I remember I had the best time building something with these Lego bricks in my childhood. All those memories came alive after watching this just like I remembered during 'Wreck-It-Ralp'. It is such a cute movie with fun characters. A smart movie for all age group. I am very much sure it will be one the strongest contender for the next edition of the Oscar ceremony. At present I am not seeing any other equally good ones so who know it may win, but have to wait for another 6 months to know that."
"rockhollis","10","0","1","15 June 2014"," Great children's' film. Lots of layers
","I won't repeat what everyone has said. Their positive criticisms I agree with. What I would like to add is that there is another layer to this film that hardly gets mentioned. The Lego world is like ours, Mr. Business is the government, and we are getting distracted by crap that gets put on television. In the Lego world, the masses are getting subdued into normal life by making them all watch ""where is my pants?"" and making them listen to generic music like ""Everything is awesome"". Media is influencing people into continuing to live their normal and structured lives, and this is also evident in our world, especially with the Miley Cyrus garbage and reality TV shows, that softens the masses while wars and killings happen overseas, and poverty ravages third world countries. But just like the Lego world, we are influenced into just living our lives and turning a blind eye to what is really happening in our world."
"DareDevilKid","9","0","1","12 June 2014"," Unbridled Fun Interlaced with Dollops of Subtle Metaphors
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4/5 stars<br/><br/>As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who made ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", have delivered another essay in controlled madness, bombarding you with far more candy-colored detail than you can process—though, by some miracle, not too much to stomach. In short, pop culture eats itself. Everything you see, until the closing scenes, is Lego: people, landscapes, and products. Even fiery bolts of laser beam are orange plastic rods. You could try to resist or lament this marketing frenzy, but the movie is way, way ahead of you, landing joke after joke about the shiny pretensions of the Lego world.<br/><br/>The story follows Emmet (Chris Pratt) an ordinary, rules- following, perfectly average Lego miniature figure who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person and the key to saving the world. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously under-prepared. A construction worker by profession, Emmett is blissfully ignorant and content - like most of the Lego world - with the corporate and authoritative powers that monitor and dictate every aspect of his life and who have convinced him that this is his idyllic lifestyle. One day he stumbles on a magic brick that will reveal some higher truth, though the film takes ruthless comic pains to knock down the pomposity, derivation, and heavy-handedness that usually plagues such fantastical narratives.<br/><br/>Without question, the film will unabashedly entertain you from start to finish. Kids all over will love it, but like all really smart animated films, it promises a great time as well for the adults. Along with delving into deep nostalgia territory and bringing back the world of Lego building blocks in all their glory, adults will also instantly recognize the wickedly funny and well-aimed sassy darts shot at corporate branding. If you care to scratch the surface a bit, ""The Lego Movie"" also reveals copious amounts of metaphors - coated in hilariously humorous moments and dialogues - which take potshots at how corporate bigwigs are all but controlling every aspect of our monotonous existence and how we wittingly succumb to the manipulation of these powers when all we need to do is remain steadfast and resolve to live our lives on our own terms. The movie's irresistible theme song, ""Everything is Awesome"", is a delightful dig and corporate branding, capitalist manipulation, and draconian bureaucracy, which in all likelihood will go down as one of the greatest cinematic metaphors of all time. Satirical subversion in family entertainment is an unexpected treat, especially in a movie that also functions as a triumph of product placement.<br/><br/>The movie is designed with so much energy it sometimes spins out of control. But the fun is nonstop. The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the story is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it's hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession — constantly tweaking many popular culture icons. Major credit for this sublime achievement goes to Directors and co- writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the dynamic duo who earlier brought us ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" — another terrific animated romp. As mentioned earlier, ""The Lego Movie"" is a visual spectacle and the most amazing thing is how everything looks as though it's constructed out of Legos. That goes for raging fire and even the wild waves of a turbulent sea rolling under a pirate ship under full sail. The enormous team of animators and designers who first built this make-believe world out of more than 15 million Legos, before translating it all into a gorgeous, computer-generated adventure also merit the same amount of lavish praise in successfully assembling this instantaneous animated classic. If there's one minor contention with the film, it would probably boil down to it being a bit too fast-paced at times. Slowing down the tempo in certain scenes (a la Hayao Miyazaki) would have elevated it several notches higher; plausibly even give it a perfect 5 rating.<br/><br/>Top-notch voice talent is key to any successful animated film, and ""The Lego Movie"" does not disappoint. Chris Pratt is perfectly enthusiastic and naive as the reluctant hero Emmet; Elizabeth Banks throws out edgy wit voicing the action heroine Wyldstyle; Will Arnett is great as the growling, self-obsessed Batman, and Will Ferrell is on target as President Business, the order-obsessed leader of this world of Lego. On top of all that, add in the characteristic dulcet pitch of Morgan Freeman as the aged sage, Vitruvius, and and the sonorous tone of Liam Neeson as the president's hilarious Bad Cop/Good Cop sidekick, and you've got quite the crew of great acting voices.<br/><br/>""The Lego Movie"" is a terrific, fun-packed, well-crafted, thoughtful, and outstanding piece of animated cinematic magic. Just like its theme song goes, this film is truly ""awesome""."

","What do men crave for? Cars!! And what do small boys crave for? Legos! But the good thing is while there is an age for cars, Lego's has none!! When the first few scenes opened up I thought to myself ""oh this looks very strange with all these cubes as characters with sharp corners and it's definitely going to be boring"". But guess what? I was shamefully very wrong. The Lego movie was amazing. I repeat it's AMAZING.<br/><br/>In the world of Lego land the evil president Lord Business is planning to destroy everyone. And a normal construction worker Emmet is selected to avoid it as per an ancient prophesy. But soon the Lego land realizes that this construction worker is not the chosen one. And he is challenged with proving that he is the right one for the job.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is a fast phased and mesmerizingly colorful movie. In Lego land you will miss a lot if you blink. So for some it could be a bit tiresome to keeping up with the speed but once you get on board the speed train it's a super fun ride. And surprises wait at every turn. And beware every line is funny! This has some super characters including good cop mixed bad cop voiced by Liam Neeson, Vitruvious voiced by Morgan Freeman and Batman voiced by Will Arnet. And that's just a few of them. There is a bunch of superheroes, NBA players, Star Wars characters, Cowboys and so on which makes The Lego Movie an awesome mix of voice plays.<br/><br/>Coming to the eye candy animation the work done there is simply crazy. Though at the start it looks a bit weird the animators proves that animation potential is endless and anything is possible. The brilliant animation quality teamed with upbeat music tracks brings the true joy of the Lego land.<br/><br/>Big studio animations are becoming larger and larger by the year. Yet we seldom come across something ground breaking and mind blowing. The Lego Movie is one of such fantastic animation that definitely blows away the minds of the viewer. It's insanely creative with super different animation quality and comes with a fantastic story and belly tickling humor. In my book this is the best animation of a different kind after Wreck it Ralph (2012)."

","The Lego movie is a fresh take on the predictable cartoon storyline of recent years. The film displays an array of outrageous ideas capturing both the minds of adults and kids alike. The humor is combined with immense creativity just like the Lego blocks the movie depicts. Small gags and stand-up comedy is scattered throughout the entire adventure. Overall it is a solid animated movie that is fun to watch and leaves you feeling satisfied. <br/><br/>The Lego movie shows the adventures of an average citizen named Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt. Emmet begins his journey as a Lego construction worker, mindlessly following the directions and building the high-rises of the big city. After falling into a large hole by mistake, he stumbles upon a piece of red plastic the looks different from the rest of the Lego pieces. Emmet later learns that the strange object is called ""The Piece of Resistance."" Because of this, Emmet is mistakenly labeled as the ""Chosen One,"" who is supposed to save Lego City from the evil Lord Business. Like the other citizen living under the constraints of Lego city, Emmet has been brainwashed to follow an exact set of rules. The Lego citizens all watch the sitcom Where's My Pants, all have the same favorite song ""Everything is awesome,"" and are all programmed to never break the laws. Longing for a chance to feel unique, he goes on with the legend of the ""chosen one"" until people began to find out he really doesn't possess the skills needed. Not to be setback by this problem though Emmet slowly learns to craft his own unique skills into something useful. <br/><br/>The Lego move sports a set of high profile characters. As one of the heroes Batman/Bruce Wayne is voiced by Will Arnett. Morgan freeman plays Vitruvius, a blind prophet who guides Emmet on his journey. There are cameos from Superman (Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman, The Green Lantern (Jonah Hill), Dumbledore, Gandalf, and Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal). Part of the entertainment of the Lego Movie is seeing all these franchises that have been licensed by Lego over the year. Where else can you find all these similar voices and characters in a single movie?<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the screen is bursting with pop culture references and subtleties. It will take multiple times watching the movie to catch them all. The intentional stop-motion style results in scenes that actually look like they were built out of Legos. This gives the appearance that every piece was painstakingly moved for each shot, creating this jumpy feel that adds a sense of realism. The fire, water, and sands in the desert are all Lego bricks. Large waves that splash over the side of the boat disperse into Lego studs. On top of that small cracks and scrapes are etched in, like the 80s space man who has a cracked chin guard. The insane ideas and realistic looks took me back to the 10 year old me playing Legos on the carpet floor. <br/><br/>Just when you think that this train ride of adventure and comedy begins to drag on too long, the movie takes a dramatic twist and adds a whole new element into the mix, enriching the already great story by adding another dimension both physically and metaphorically. You will have to watch the movie to find out. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is jam-packed with entertaining scenes and comedy, whether you love Legos or have never touched them, this movie is 100 minutes well worth the time."

There are cameos from some of our favorite characters that I won't dare spoil for anyone. And did I mention that it was funny, because it is, it's really, really funny. This is my kind of humor, fast paced with a lot of sarcastic moments that border on anti-humor. The characters, not just the copyrighted ones, are likable, entertaining and feel developed. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family, in fact there were only a couple of things I found wrong with the film at all.<br/><br/>One involved it's pacing, which is incredibly fast. For the most part it works and it does know to slow down once in a while, however sometimes a scene that should have been dramatic or slow paced goes by so fast or has so many jokes or jokes at the wrong moment that it ruins the drama. Then there is the ending, which while funny and very heartwarming seemed really confusing and brought up a lot of questions.<br/><br/>Yet this film is a blast from start to finish and I hope they make a sequel."

The Lego is structured around Emmet (who is played by Chris Pratt) and his journey to becoming the special. The special is for told that he will be the most wonderful and special person in the universe. This idea is the main plot of the Lego movie. Through out the movie Emmet will team up with master builders. These master builders are able to make anything out of everything. This is hard for Emmet to understand as he follows the instructions. These instructions are used by the whole of the Lego movies characters that are not main characters. This takes away the imagination of what the people of the Lego movie can do. Emmet tries to think outside of the box but he can only follow the instructions. This means that it is going to be hard to come up with anything original. The main enemy of the movie is Lord Business. He is the president of the whole of this Lego universe. All that Lord Business wants is to have everything be perfect and he wants no creativity. The many universes of Lego (that revolve around the Lego sets) are divided with Lego walls that prevent anyone from seeing each other. Before the walls were everybody was making anything they wanted to make. The master builders of the movie have been band. The Master builders are then used by Lord business. The whole movie made me feel like a kid who just got a box of Lego for their birthday. The movie is fun and great for the whole family."

","Had a good time with this movie and had a few laughs. The film uses the Lego pieces in such a way it is actually a really good parody movie. The story itself was a bit simple and maybe a bit too focused at 'You can do anything with Lego as long as you imagine it' but of course the movie was meant for children and the story does well for that category.<br/><br/>The actors did a wonderful job too! Will Ferrel was good as the villain and I never thought Morgan Freeman would say such ridiculous lines. But in my opinion the best voice came from Nick Offerman as the pirate.<br/><br/>The graphics are really top notch. It looks like you're really watching a stop motion Lego movie with great lightning and nice cinematography. This movie proves animation can still be different and unique in ways of how they look!<br/><br/>All in all a good movie you can enjoy as an adult or as a kid!"

","This is the most recent animated feature I watch in a movie theatre and it is also one of the most creative film that I have ever watched. There is only one word to describe its plot, technique and art direction — phenomenal! Really, I am not kidding. Everything really is, awesome. They got me awestruck with all the pretty waters, fires, clouds and rainbows; a vibrant world constructed entirely with Legos and filled with interesting Lego Minifigures! <br/><br/>In addition to its lovely and immensely detailed world, The Lego Movie (2014) is quite entertaining to watch as there are plenty of hilarious gags, Lego humor and frank characters that always say what's on their mind without holding back. Strange but I am also enthralled with the way they portray totalitarian in Bricksburg, where instruction manuals are its people's bible which is both funny and sad at times. Nevertheless, watching it also induces nostalgia; the film reminds me of my early childhood where I used to have my own box of Legos. Maybe that's the reason why I was smiling and brimming with joy when I watch it. In short, the film spew nothing but awesomeness because it is that ""one movie that has something for everyone""."

","Brief Overview The film is set in a Lego world where the dominance of the obsessive character Mr. Business rules over his town. The hero and friends set out to end him from fulfilling his final plan.<br/><br/>Positives -The excellent CGI gives a very good idea that you are really looking at Lego sets moving and talking. You can also recognize Lego pieces from actual kits if you remember them. -The classic Lego themes gave me a bit of a flashback to the actual sets from the past, however they also play well into the theme of the story and offer entertaining closed ""worlds"". -The voice acting is very well done and feels believable. The majority of the main characters having actors who play their characters trope regularly. -The film also has many pop culture and Lego jokes for some of the older audience while still at a basic level being funny without knowledge of them. -The range of emotions strongly delivered by the film gives a entering ride through the film with you feeling strongly the happy humor and the more serious family connections and real world values. -The jokes in the film are well spaced and funny without being too over the top. <br/><br/>Negatives -I really don't have any."

","As a long time Lego lover, I had apprehensions about this movie. I, as many asked, ""Legos? How do you make a movie about that?"" To my delight, the idea was executed wonderfully, and the finished product was a great movie. <br/><br/>It was made for fans, both kids, new to Legos, and adults, who grew up with the toys. There are characters, jokes, and references to Lego themes of the past, as well as recent years.<br/><br/>The voice acting was amazing, with the likes of Will Ferrell, Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, among others. The top of the line talent definitely made a huge difference in executing the script, and gave life to plastic. <br/><br/>It was self-aware, self-referential, and shattered the fourth wall in a way that wasn't trite or clichéd, and instead added much of the heart of the story.<br/><br/>The filmmakers created a world where almost anything can happen, as long as you can imagine it, and with clever, witty, writing, the result is an amazing animated film that's bursting with color, heart, and laughs. I can't wait to watch it on mushrooms!"

","****May Contain Spoilers**** Seeing this movie trailer made me very happy when it first came out. Seeing my favorite childhood toy in a movie brought back so many good memories. Although I was a little unsure about having Will Arnett as the voice of Batman (no bash to him, I just didn't see him as a Batman figure). But alas, I was wrong. Will Arnett did a fantastic job as Batman, using the gruff voice but also knowing Will Arnett was the voice actor put in a little humor to everything he said. He gave it a special twist, especially when he talked about using black and sometimes really dark grey bricks to make things. The only downfall I saw to this was the animation. It wasn't really a big deal, but it seemed like it was just fast, stop-go motion animation. Plus I think the scene with the sea made of Lego bricks could've been done a little better. But overall I think this was a fantastic movie and would gladly see it again."

","I didn't really know what was going to happen when I saw the Lego Movie. I just imagined it would be the usual ""the chosen one saves the world"" thing.

At this point, Emmett is thought to have fallen to his death, but instead, he wakes up in... our world?<br/><br/>Yes, the Lego Movie went all ""Wayne's World"" on us and broke the Fourth Wall.

"rannynm","9","0","1","28 March 2014"," Heroes Come in Odd Packages
","This is a fast pace action, comedy, that shows that Lego's are more than just plastic bricks. The story is about Emmet (Chris Pratt) who is just an ordinary guy that always follows the instructions. However, once he finds a magical relic, he is now known as the special person who is supposed to defeat Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from launching an evil plan. So with the help of Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and more hilarious characters, he sets out to save the world.<br/><br/>I love this movie! It has a ""Toy Story"" atmosphere to it that makes it entertaining. The writers don't try to hide the fact that the Lego people are plastic figures, they just write it in the way that Lego figures would move and act. Even the characters sort of know what they are, although they don't know everything. The jokes are always thrown at you and all of them get a laugh. It has a parody element to it that is surprisingly funny for kids and adults. When a company that has been around for generations and has so much merchandise, you can't help but admire the creators for making fun of their toy. It does is heart- warming how creativity is important. The animation is marvelous - the way the characters build structures, vehicles and double-decker couches is an experience to see. Just watching this imaginative universe makes me wonder, ""What can't you make out of Legos""?!<br/><br/>My favorite character is hard to pick out of dozens of lovable characters. I would have to choose Good Cop / Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). I love this character's double personality and he cracks me up every time I see him.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Emmet talks to Lord Business about how you don't how to follow the instructions all the time. This scene shows and proves how Legos are important to people. How the simplicity of building a spaceship or anything, can spark inspiration for kids and adults to build. <br/><br/>The moral of the story is that everyone is special. Emmet does not think he has the mind or experience to fulfill his prophecy. He soon learns that if you believe in yourself you can do extraordinarily things.<br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5 to18-year-olds. This film reminds us on how Legos can change our lives. We all had Legos once in our lives, whether you follow the instructions, build or just played with them, it does not matter. Legos have been around for generations and these bricks have shown us new worlds to explore and enjoy. This film is timeless and I hope it will be know for a long time.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B. KIDS FIRST Film Critic<br/><br/>This movie is something special. This movie will make kids' dreams come true everywhere. What movie I'm talking about? Well it's ""The Lego Movie"" of course. <br/><br/>This great film has comedy, adventure, suspense, music, romance, LEGOS and a great story line. <br/><br/>The story is about an unlikely hero, who turns out to be part of a big prophesy and a lot of exciting battles and adventures. But, is this just all a part of a kid's imagination or do Legos truly come to life when we are not looking? <br/><br/>I love so many things about this movie! A very unique part is the animation. It's plastic, smooth and looks a lot like real Lego pieces. At parts it feels like its stop motion but it's not. Most of the sets where were made out of hundreds of Legos. Imagine it, five adults playing with a whole bunch of Legos for work. I am sure most kids would wish to be a part of such production. If you add to the mix the voice- overs by amazing actors such as Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett and Will Ferrell – you get an animated film that will captivate your heart for sure.<br/><br/>I have a couple of favorite scenes. First, when Batman, Emmet, Wyldstyle, the Wizard and Benny are all stuck in the ocean on a 'double decker couch.' Batman says ""It's not like a gigantic ship will show up"" and right when he says that, a ship comes out of nowhere. Then later, when they need a part and he says ""It's not like there's a spaceship or anything"" and what do you know, the Millennium Falcon drops by! <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to ages 2 to 17. Older people may not enjoy the humor as much as younger kids. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst dot org."

"TheSquiss","6","0","2","5 March 2014"," Everything is Awesome? Um... Not quite a joy but certainly a pleasure.
","I had little interest in seeing The Lego Movie until I heard Mark Kermode's verdict in his blog about Liam Neeson. Even then it wasn't enough to make me buy a ticket. It took Roocayke, the nephew who last month subjected me to Walking With Dinosaurs 3D, to force me into it. Would this be two strikes against him or could he earn a redemption?<br/><br/>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a bog standard, Lego mini-figure construction worker who smiles, sings, follows instructions and is completely unremarkable until he is mistaken for the Master Builder, the chosen one, who will fulfill an ancient prophesy, find the Piece of Resistance and thwart the evil plan of the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Accompanied by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and her egotistical, vain boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet journeys through every conceivable Lego theme in its universe on a mission to save their world from being glued together, and of personal discovery.<br/><br/>Without doubt, The Lego Movie is a fantastic merchandising film. It is one long, feature length video catalogue that you can be thankful was released in the spring rather than prior to Christmas. But whereas The Internship was just a horrible, humourless Google commercial, The Lego Movie is a clever idea that entertains first and foremost. Oh, it's far less subtle than the product placement of Toy Story but you won't emerge feeling bludgeoned by the marketing bods.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough for the youngsters to follow but there is little time for boredom as the screen is constantly filled with action and movement and the dialogue rattles along with little time to reflect on the gags as they whiz by. As you'd expect, the scenery is beautifully constructed with Lego, the model numbers of bricks and components tumbling across the screen like Sherlock's (the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch incarnation) thoughts.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie's 100 minute running time is perhaps too generous for the plot and its demographic, and there were too few children's giggles and too many shuffling bums but, if Roocayke was anything to go by, it will be a big hit with the under tens and an acceptable movie for the parents to enjoy rather the endure, as is more often the case. There are plenty of gags, references and in-jokes that sail over the youngsters' heads to entertain the adults and, though there is nothing to make us laugh out loud, The Lego Movie contains plenty to amuse.<br/><br/>The vocal talent, too, will be of little interest to the kiddies but there is an impressive roster of stars having fun including half the cast of Star Wars and, in the battle of the scene thieves, Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius) narrowly beaten by Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop. Add to that Alison Brie, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum...<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is no Fankenweenie but it is a lot of fun. Just ask Roocayke. In amongst the gabble of enthusiasm that accompanied us home were two gems: <br/><br/>""I really liked the lady (Wyldstyle) but I don't want to marry her."" <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>""Uncle Yed, I seriously want to see that again!"" <br/><br/>The Lego Movie is not quite a joy, though it's certainly a pleasure. But be warned, it contains the nastiest brainworm on the big screen so far this year. It's a marketer's dream but an accompanying uncle's nightmare! Trust me on this: the drive home is a painful experience with a six-year old singing non-stop Everything is Awesome! <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Faster then a speeding bullet fly the jokes in this delightful movie sure to entertain the current crop of attention deficit kids. The all-star voice cast is spot on, the animation is bright and colourful and the surprises are plenty. Standouts in the voice cast include Liam Neeson's multiple personality cop and Cris Pratt's Emmett though there are really no weaknesses here. Maybe most amazing for a movie based off of a successful line of toys, the story is competently told. It moves at an engaging pace and is interesting enough to keep even the adults watching. Nothing at all wrong here except a side quibble about the marketing for the movie. A lot of the movies best jokes were already divulged in the trailers for the film."
"WheelzFourReelz","7","0","1","2 March 2014"," The Lego Movie is a really fun movie that can be enjoyed by everyone.
","If you asked me about The Lego Movie back around September to October, I would've said, ""Pfft A movie about Lego's? That's dumb!"" One day, in November, I was on the front page of YouTube, and I saw that The Lego Movie trailer was up. So I decided to watch it. And I cracked up. That's what got me excited for this movie, making it an honorable mention for my Top Ten Anticipated Movies of 2014 (go ahead and read that, if you can, please). So today, I invited some friends, and went to go see the movie. And boy, did I have a good time. The movie stars you average joe Lego figure named Emmet. He's nobody special, completely blends in with the crowd; he's someone that would be completely forgotten. However, his life completely changes around when he touches the relic and discovers that he is the prophecy. He then is tasked to stop President Business from doing his evil deeds. In case you didn't know, this is some serious business (haha pun). I'm going to start out with the visuals, and let me tell you they're OK. Yeah, I'm just kidding. They're absolutely wonderful. Everything looks gorgeous and actually looks like a Lego world. Everything is made of Lego's to a realistic degree. It almost looks like stop motion. That's also another reason why I like this movie. All other Lego forms of media all had weird, almost spaghetti kind of animation. This movie actually looks like how Lego's are supposed to look. It's a joy to watch, and even quite beautiful. The voice acting is absolutely perfect. Everybody does an absolutely fantastic job in this movie. I personally thought Will Arnett, Will Ferrell, and Morgan Freeman did the best jobs. Everyone still does excellent. What I also liked about this movie is the humor. Most of the jokes at the beginning of the movie weren't very funny, but after a while, the movie takes a turn to hilarity. This movie is just fast paced, non-stop, laugh out loud moments. It has it all, from slapstick comedy, to pop culture references, to the jokes that whiz over kids' heads. It's absolutely entertaining. My true negatives have to do with the story. I think the whole concept of a movie entirely of Lego's is genius, but the story is nothing special. I mean, it's still a solid story, but there's nothing that really stands out. It's kind of predictable, and it's a storyline that you've seen multiple times in kids/family movies. The story isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it doesn't push any boundaries, and that isn't good enough for me. I also think that this movie is a little too long. There are multiple Lego worlds showcased within this movie. With this combined with the plot where a lot of things are happening kind of makes the movie drag out for too long. I feel that if they took out one of the Lego worlds, then this movie would be perfect length. This movie is about, I'd say, ten minutes too long. Overall, this movie is a blast. The animation is beautiful, the jokes are hilarious, the characters are highly entertaining. My favorite character was Batman, and his introduction was my favorite part of the movie. This movie also had a lot more heart than I was excepting, which is always a plus. This is not an animated family movie that's in the same caliber as movies like Toy Story or The Lion King, but it's a fun ride that shouldn't be overlooked. And let me finish by saying, January, thank you for being over so that the good movies can come out."

They obviously had a lot of fun whilst making it. <br/><br/>The main problem I had with the film is that some action scenes did drag on for too long. they tried to make some scenes too flashy and were obviously aiming to introduce merchandising ideas. Another problem was that some things in it were too goofy. I understand that it is a children's film but they tried too hard.<br/><br/>Some themes may be discrete but they are a good touch and relevant from a child's perspective.

","I am a huge fan of Lego since I was little kid. I was playing with that all the time and nothing else could make me more happier than these constructors from Denmark. Lego made my childhood full of happiness and I still play with them, so I was waiting for this movie since it was announced.<br/><br/>The Lego movie doesn't look like any other feature-length animated movie. It is made in different style than Disney or Pixar movies. It has its own style of storytelling and it makes this movie so good.<br/><br/>From the first scene of the movie you can understand that it would be hilarious masterpiece. And it is! I never laughed in cinema so much and so hard.

","'THE LEGO MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Blockbuster film adaptation of the popular construction toys, which began in Denmark in 1949. Lego is the third-largest toy maker in the world and in recent years has grown immensely in popularity (closing in on Hasbro for the #2 global ranking). The company has expanded it's market into video games, books, theme parks, kids' clothes, cartoon shows and straight-to-DVD animated movies and now it's conquered the theatrical film business as well with this 3D computer animated comedy/adventure flick. The movie has been number one for three weeks in a row (at the US box office) making $185,829,929 in North America and $278,329,929 worldwide! I found it to be very entertaining and my two young nephews (I saw it with) loved it as well. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an average construction worker Lego minifigure who's mistakenly prophesied to be the 'chosen one'; who will save the Lego universe from an evil businessman called Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Emmet has always been an outsider and has never been accepted by his acquaintances or co-workers. He finally feels important for the first time in his Lego life and goes on a journey to save the Lego world. Emmet receives help from a rebel fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) and others. The voice cast also includes Liam Neeson, Will Forte, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie and many other popular stars.<br/><br/>It was directed and co-written (with Dan and Kevin Hageman) by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Lord and Miller also performed the same duties on the popular animated hit 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS' and directed the film adaptation of the popular 80's TV show '21 JUMP STREET' as well (and it's upcoming sequel). The Hagemans also co-wrote 36 episodes of the Cartoon Network's animated TV series 'LEGO NINJAGO: MASTERS OF SPINJITZU' (which is based on the Lego toys of the same name). The filmmakers chosen were obviously the right guys for the job and the cast couldn't be more perfectly fitting either. The result is an animated movie masterpiece; I absolutely loved it and I can't usually get into animated films that much! It's hilarious, visually amusing and surprisingly emotional as well (especially in the end; when I actually got a little teary eyed). There is a twist that really takes the film up a notch and makes it more meaningful (and special) for kids and adults as well. I realized, by the end, that it's a lot like another telling of 'TOY STORY' and I think it's just as well made and classic too. I'm sure 'THE LEGO MOVIE' will be beloved for many years to come, by many generations (just like the toys)!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4"
"hellraiser7","Null","0","1","27 February 2014"," Lego Maniac
","Legos were always one of my favorite toys as a kid, the beauty of them is the amount of creative freedom you have, you can just build anything you imagine.<br/><br/>This film was a dream come true for me, it was one of those films that you wouldn't think would happen but it did and I'm glad for that. Like a well built Lego configuration everything works well.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic, everything is CGI but they all look real, just the amount of detail and color. I love how the Lego world/universe is created each of them are unique and different, which makes sense since there are dozens of sets. My favorite one is the one in the clouds which is the fun but weird utopia, just seeing these things showed a fantasy world/universe with endless possibilities where anything can happen. I also love how there is always a lot happening in the background, it's sort of like with the illustration art in the ""Where's Waldo"" books; it would probably take more than one watch just to see it all.<br/><br/>But to me what I really love is the movements which looks like stop motion, and it fits well let alone adds to the humor and fun. It makes sense they would move stop motion like because Lego Figurines have a limited amount of movement except for the vehicles.<br/><br/>The music is great, some of the songs are memorable, the one that really sticks out is the song ""Everything is Awesome"" indeed it is.<br/><br/>I like the story it's a simplistic fantasy plot on good guys and bad in a race to clam a certain object which could destroy the world and a chosen one can turn the tide. Yeah it's that simple but that what I love about it, it doesn't make itself too complicated for it's own good, but just sticks to being what it should be fun.<br/><br/>The voice cast is just excellent, each of them really fit like a glove for their roles. From the villain Lord Business played well by Will Ferrell, he's a fun villain that I don't feel is really evil but his head is in the wrong place. His goal is simply to create a perfect world, but he can't see clearly the corrupt nature of his actions and that perfection is possible but unknowable.<br/><br/>Supporting Characters are great, Wyldstyle played by Elizabeth Banks is great she's the typical fem fatale heroine whom is true to his name. A woman of action, super creative from how fast she can built vehicles, but also deep down she is a softy but is a bit insecure in showing it.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is just great as Good Cop/Bad Cop whom is kinda a ""Dr.Jecell and Mr.Hide"" like character. His voice acting was great I really bought both sides were two different people but also that he's actually funny. <br/><br/>However two of my favorite characters are Batman played well by Will Arnett. I'm so psyched that they made this DC superhero a characters since he's my favorite comic book hero. Anyway I really love how they make him the usual super cool can as usual kick some ass but also is dryly comical from some of what he says and his exaggerated mannerisms, he's as funny as the Adam West Batman.<br/><br/>But my favorite character is Emmitt played with hilarity and charm by Chris Pratt; which is cool since I'm a ""Parks and Recreation"" fan and Andy is my second favorite character. He kinda plays that same character Andy but on a more lighter and less cruder note. It's just funny how bright he really is despite his life not being so great he doesn't let it get him down. This also makes him a sypmpathic character because he doesn't really have friends, but that's because no one really knows him which is something I can emphasize with and all the more makes you want to bet on him. It's also funny how he's at first not the brightest bulb, and we literally see his brain has nothing in it. But he's capable of having ideas which seems like a stupid idea at first but it surprising comes into use, it shows he might be onto something. And also has a big heart, he not afraid to do what's right but also like the chemistry he has with Wyld Style both have a great back and forth which made be care about both characters more.<br/><br/>The humor is just fantastic it would take more than one watch to get it all; from the visual humor to the dialog which is just fraking hilarious it is just crackling with hilarity. There are just lots of memorable lines from not just main and supporting characters but even characters that make cameos. And there are tons of visual reference jokes and the cameo voices with them. From other DC Characters like Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lanturn (Joanah Hill), and Wonder Woman (Cobbie Smothers). But one reference that I thought was comic gold was the ""Star Wars"" reference, I'll let you see that one for yourself.<br/><br/>Even the action is great, there are some battle sequences that are well choreographed and a lot of fun. I really love the moments when they all just build vehicles or turn things into vehicles almost as fast as the Autobots and Deceptacons transform into vehicles and robots. My favorite building transformation is Emmett whom creates which I think is an awesome mecha that is a homage to the power loader in ""Aliens"".<br/><br/>But the film has heart because it has some good messages on the importance and beauty of creativity, not conforming, the proper use of order, being yourself, but also simply believing in yourself.<br/><br/>It's always the simplest idea that can create the greatest things.<br/><br/>Rating:4 stars"

","Emmet is a nobody. He is so normal and boring that even people he thinks are his friends don't remember him. He lives his life by the instructions, but one day he goes off the beaten path and finds himself deemed ""the special one"" by a rebel group hellbent on bringing an end to evil dominance in the land.<br/><br/>I had heard of good things from the film, I just didn't expect to cry from laughter. The Lego Movie is my kind of humour, fast paced, sometimes stupid, completely random and chaotic. The Lego Movie is all this wrapped in a beautifully created lego world that will have you smiling at all the little pieces that make up the brilliance of the animation. A must see film that is consistently funny and entertaining from start to finish. Bring the whole family. <br/><br/>The story involves in the old tale of an ordinary guy mistaken for some kind of hero, then he learns to trust in himself and finds the courage to become the hero the people thought he originally was. Nothing really new in terms of storytelling, but the presentation, the uniqueness of the art and the witty humour make for one tremendous ride from start to finish. The film feels like it never stops from the get go. Constantly on hyper speed, the pace never drags and the kids will never be bored. <br/><br/>Filled to the brim with voice acting, Chris Pratt leads the film with Elizabeth Banks playing the romantic interest. Supporting roles include Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Allison Brie, Nick Offerman, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and dozens of others in smaller cameo roles all fit the bill nicely. <br/><br/>The imaginative landscape is truly inspiring here. Thrust into different lego worlds we'll be in the Wild West at one point, then stuck on a Pirate Ship the next. Despite the film being entirely CGI, you'll swear to yourself that half the film must have been done with actual legos. The attention to detail is awe inspiring. <br/><br/>The Lego Movie is indeed hilarious and a must see. It's early in the new year, but I expect this to be the best animated film this year. Can't wait for the sequel."

","I went in without expecting much, just taking my 6 year old for a fun weekday treat. This movie was absolutely fantastic! I do not know if it was real stop motion, all computer, or the more likely combination of the 2 but the look is pure real lego all the way through. It is silly and fun and very well written with a great voice cast and some good self aware humor thrown in for the adults. This works both as a kid movie and an adult movie. If you like stop motion animation then this will probably be a no brainer choice to go see but for those on the fence I highly recommend it. A rare breed of lighthearted kids oriented comedy that doesn't talk down to the audience. Very well done and if you get a chance go see it in 3D, some very good use of it here. I predict this will have cult status in a few years."

","Upon the announcement of the Lego Movie I was hyped I always enjoyed the slapstick and inventive humour of the Lego games and of course like every other child, grew up with the toy that you spend more time building rather then actually playing with. What I didn't expect from the Lego Movie was the amount of imagination and the sheer fun that was in store. At first glance the film seems like a run of the mill adventure story of Emmet a likable everyday Lego figure who is mistaken for the special and is supposed to be a master builder of Lego bricks but is only a humble construction worker what follows is a madcap juvenile adventure with surprisingly a bit of social satire undercutting the story of our samey and conforming culture. The story becomes more and more original and creative as it speeds along with it's surreal humour.<br/><br/>The animation is simple yet groundbreaking in how CGI is used to replicate stop motion so much detail can be seen with the scratches and finger prints on some of the characters faces in close ups. The voice-work is also top notch I can't think of a character that didn't make me laugh they were all so wonderfully weird, and quirky.<br/><br/>The twist ending is also very thought provoking but was hinted at very early on so it was kind of a dead giveaway. I do admire the themes that were being addressed and has a great message for kids of all ages to never forget your sense of play."

","I have a confession, and it might seem shocking. I'm not exactly a fan of Chris Miller and Phil Lord's directorial work. I mean who really remembers Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? Because it went out of my mind a long time ago. I also have another confession, and it might seem even more shocking than the other. Ready? Okay. I haven't watched 21 Jump Street. I know, it's pretty bad. But don't get me wrong, I've tried to catch it. Believe me. But I seem to forget about it all the time, kinda like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Uncanny eh? Although, I have one final confession, and this one might be the most shocking of them all. Ready? Sure? Okay. I recently watched a film directed by Miller and Lord, and everything about it was awesome. I know. Did I really just come out with that? Excuse me but I couldn't help myself. The film you ask? Its The Lego Movie folks.<br/><br/>Yes, the iconic plastic pieces have finally got their own movie on the big screen. It's no real surprise is it? In fact it's about time. Lego has been apart of a children's toy box since the '40s and it was certainly apart of mine. So was I jumping around in excitement when I heard about it coming to the box office? Slightly. That was, until I heard Miller and Lord were directing it. I swear I don't hate them. But it made me think of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and that started giving me the shivers. All I was expecting was another forgetful animation, was I wrong? You bet I was.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is pure magic. This animation is a film that dares to go big and give Lego the true thank you it deserves. Miller and Lord go to extreme efforts to impress, captivate and show their love for the retro blocks while sharing the love all-round. The big softies. Who knew they had a soul? I certainly didn't. But this block madness clearly reinforces that, with the duo creating a universe that is endless and visually spectacular in all it's plastic glory. Did I mention it's also bonkers? No? Well it is. Want Abraham Lincoln flying around on a rocket- powered chair? You got it here. Want Morgan Freeman as a wizard? You got it here. Honestly, the crazy possibilities will keep on coming as if you're constructing it from your own imagination. It's just wonderful.<br/><br/>Getting amazed and swallowed into this universe was effortless. Not only is the world building captivating by Miller and Lord but the main protagonist is also. Introduction Emmet, the construction worker who is voiced by the enthusiastic Chris Pratt. Great casting right there. Not only does Pratt give Emmet a voice, but he also gives him a whole lot more. Charm, charisma and heart comes to mind right now. But Emmet only wants to be a sheep, trying to fit into the conformist ideology this film constructs early on.<br/><br/>This is soon abolished quickly and thankfully as Emmet accidentally comes across the ""Piece of Resistance"", this being the only item that can stop wicked Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from obliterating the world with his powerful Kragle. Resilient, rigid Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) immediately swoops in to identify Emmet as the Special, prophesied to be the most extraordinary person in the universe and swiftly whisks him off to join the Master Builders in a rebellion.<br/><br/>As we are introduced to a star studded cast of Master Builders it almost feels like all of Hollywood has rolled into town. We meet such characters like Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), douche bag Batman (Will Arnett), and spaceship junkie Benny (Charlie Day). Unfortunately none of them believe in Emmet including himself.<br/><br/>The film's narrative arc revolves around Emmet, following the traditional steps of a hero's journey. But, Miller and Lord manage to make it fresh by mocking the overall adventure, poking fun at it's clichés and sprinkling it all over with plenty of gags and jokes. Both these are not limited to one audience either, oh no. The duo have conjured up a screenplay that will appeal to both kids and adults. It's subversive and playful attitude echoes throughout the hour and forty minutes you are sat watching. But aside from relentless overworked segments in the third act, The Lego Movie runs rapidly with no need to slow down for one second. It's fun moving at the speed of light. Can't get any better than that can it?"

","Don't worry, this is not just a nostalgia movie catering to the retro LEGO nerd, while alienating anybody who had video games or friends growing up. ""The Lego Movie"" is shockingly entertaining, even if you're like me and the only LEGO interaction you've ever had is that one time when you accidentally stepped barefoot on one of your little brothers LEGO pieces.<br/><br/>Side Note: Yes, I am aware that there are Lego video games, but those are lame, so Containing Star Wars LEGO jokes, Harry Potter LEGO jokes, Ninja Turtle LEGO jokes and Superhero (The Justice League) LEGO jokes (with LEGO Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) portrayed accurately as a jerk, or how a billionaire playboy turned Superhero would most likely act in real life) ""The Lego Movie"" is from the minds of writer/director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the writer/directors of such child friendly films as ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and""21 Jump Street"").<br/><br/>Synopsis: An average construction worker LEGO man (voiced by Chris Pratt) is mistaken for a LEGO prophet after stumbling upon a mysterious piece of plastic known as ""The Piece of Resistance"" and then asked to save the LEGO universe from the tyrannical President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell). To tell you the truth, I was actually dreading going to see ""The Lego Movie"", after taking one glance at the trailer and believing that it was just another animated, early year, straight to DVD release that the studios were attempting to masquerade as a feature film. BUT, to my surprise, what I got was an animated feature which contained the foundation of an extremely clever script riddled with laugh-out-loud dialogue, together with quite impressive LEGO inspired visuals (LEGO-mation) that while does take a few moments to adjust to, should force this film into the awards conversation next year.<br/><br/>Caveat: Chances are ""The Lego Movie"" will be more entertaining for adults than small children, and here's why: Written by the guys who wrote and directed ""21 Jump Street"", most of the jokes caught me off guard with how comically sharp they were, but after a while I did notice numerous children, in the theater I was in, becoming visibly bored with the witty banter, while their parents continued to laugh out loud until the final credits rolled. Something to think about if you are planning on taking your little one.<br/><br/>Final Thought (Caveat # 2): As funny as ""The Lego Movie"" is, it is also hampered by an overly sentimental and tonally misguided ending, which takes most of the wind out of the sails of the final twenty minutes. This was actually the biggest problem I had with the film, even getting to the point of openly wishing it would end, just so I wouldn't have to witness one more second of Will Ferrell showing off his non-range as a dramatic actor. Still, if you are a fan of LEGO's or any offshoot of LEGO brand video games, then you will more than likely be able to outright ignore any flaws ""The Lego Movie"" has to offer."

","Movies based on pre-existing toys are often the stuff of anxiety for those that grew up with them, especially when it concerns brands that are multigenerational. Will the alliance between movie studios and toy manufacturers, always driven by mutual profit, yield a viewing experience that not only serves to push kids into nagging their parents to go get them some but also to remind the older spectators as to why they themselves enjoyed the toys so much too? So far, few toy based films have succeeded on both fronts, as most of them are pretty dreadful: compare films the likes of Transformers and Battleship. Fortunately, The LEGO Movie doesn't fall into that same category of failure at all, as it enhances the feeling of joy and excitement experienced by everyone that ever built something from scratch out of the colourful little bricks. From an ideological perspective however, the motives behind the film's plot cannot helped but be questioned by mature audiences.<br/><br/>Of course, a movie about toys can't feature the toys themselves being played with for two hours, it needs a narrative structure to suck audiences in. The LEGO Movie introduces the character of Emmet (Chris Pratt), about as generic a LEGO minifigure as they come: typical yellow head, few physical accessories, wearing the same smile all day every day. He's got reasons to be smiling, as he believes himself to live in a utopia, courtesy of President Business (Will Ferrell) who provides everyone with instructions to live their life by, ranging from morning exercises, breakfast, buying overpriced coffee and carrying an eternal sunny disposition. The catchy national anthem 'Everything is awesome' notwithstanding, it goes without saying this existence is one big lie.<br/><br/>Emmet is soon drawn into a wholly different life style when he accidentally touches an unusual item that soon sticks to his back, meets a beautiful girl who looks nothing like all the other minifigures and is promptly declared an enemy of the state, necessitating him and the girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) to go on the run. Basically a little plastic version of The Matrix, Emmet soon learns there's another realm beyond that which he always took for granted, as many dimensions, each with a theme of its own peacefully coexist alongside each other. Unless President Business destroys them all by gluing everything together permanently, according to his own rigid instructions. Fortunately, Emmet is the 'Special', a minifigure with extraordinary master builder skills, who is the only one able to stop the shady schemes at hand. And so he teams up with the blind wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a pirate composed of various random parts called Metal Beard (Nick Offerman) and the dickish Batman (Will Arnett), to save the LEGO worlds from blind, obedient universal conformity, to let creative freedom ring.<br/><br/>Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who have proved themselves to be experts in whimsical animation, The LEGO Movie proves a feast for the eyes as we behold just what you can do with the little bricks. Or at least, what you think you can do, as this film is not stop motion animated with LEGO figures, it's all computer animation designed to look like the stiff toys are moving about. Deception is key here, but we are deceived pretty well by the fabulous look, as we witness smoke made of LEGO, explosions made of LEGO, even oceans made of LEGO. It's an awe-inspiring sight for everyone who has ever tried to make LEGO look the least bit realistic and ended up being several tens of thousands of bricks too short to get anywhere. Any sense of jealousy on what the computer can create with LEGO is smothered in the film's great sense of humour, building jokes as easily as putting bricks on top of each other. Aside from the traditional number of safe but smart popcultural references, the best gags spring from our plastic heroes witty selfreflection as to being just that. Miller's and Lord's infective comedic talent, joined by the voice cast's audible delight, ensures the audience is quickly wearing a smile strikingly similar to those featured on the classic minifigures' faces.<br/><br/>That said, this is business too. The LEGO Movie takes its message of 'everyone should build whatever they like' seriously, clearly preferring random creativity over slavishly building stuff based on what the printed paper says it ought to look like. Which leads to an overly serious showdown as the actual status quo of the LEGO realms is revealed, when a cheerful kid confronts his ruthless father, to just let him run with his imagination. Being played by Ferrell too, clearly the unimaginative adult mind is in the same league as the childish destructive view of business as presented by the film's bad guy. Rather hypocritical, as the LEGO company is itself a major toy corporation that hasn't gotten to where it is by giving kids their product, but selling it to them for hard cash. Sure, kids can build whatever they want, but it's the business of the product via the parents that pay for it that provides that option for them. There's something eerily uneven between the movie's message and the actual state of affairs, as this movie certainly isn't about spreading the gospel of global creativity, but to make everyone involved in its production money. Of course, kids won't realize this and most parents will be too busy enjoying the movie to care, until their offspring start whining for more LEGO to play with. At that point it's hard to deny The LEGO Movie is something other than an insidiously effective 100 minute advertisement for the LEGO product.<br/><br/>But while watching the movie, everything is indeed awesome, as our inspiration is fueled by the grandiosely detailed design of the LEGO worlds and the sheer fun for young and old that inhabits them. And then the credits roll, and that itch to get some bricks to start building yourself is heartily felt..."

","This very amusing and imaginative film from the makers of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs absolutely delighted the children in our auditorium, to the point where one kid cried out, ""This is the best film EVER!"" I wouldn't go that far, but in the afterglow of Pixar's Golden Age, it's definitely one of the better ones.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Emmet Brickowski, an everyman (voiced by Chris Pratt) – everyfigure? – thrust into the role of ""Master Builder"", on a quest to vanquish the dastardly Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Business, president of Octan Corporation and the world, intends to glue everyone in their place. Emmet and his crew are out to stop him through the power of ideas – e.g. building and re-building stuff. It's a modern American story, initially about individualism and entrepreneurism, and later about cooperation; sort of an anti-superhero film, with a light subversive streak.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly generic, but there are numerous surreal interludes throughout the film. Mostly these are enjoyable (I loved the visual allusion to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but there are certain 'fourth wall' scenes toward the end of the film that I found a bit sinister. I mean, obviously the film is an advert for Lego, but is there really a need to make the marketing so manipulative? The ""Man Upstairs"" scenes unashamedly employ soft-focus sentimentality to associate the product directly with parental love. Obviously young kids aren't going to care much about the ideological use of marketing, but I think the otherwise perfectly laudable message of the film was enough without these overwrought scenes.<br/><br/>Now, back to the good stuff.<br/><br/>I don't know what methods were used to create the look of The Lego Movie, and now I've seen it I don't want to know. It may be all CG, but it has the look of stop-motion. It has a charming jerky grace which is unique in modern mainstream animation. The action scenes are frame-hoppingly chaotic, but I think this works nicely, capturing the way that children arrange their toys in tableaux (although they probably wouldn't use the word ""tableaux"").<br/><br/>In the main role, Pratt plays the part with dorky charm, while Ferrell channels his best Mugato as the villain. Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are on rare loose form as Vitruvius and Bad Cop/Good Cop respectively. My personal favourite is Batman, played by Will Arnett as a bitter, self-absorbed bully.<br/><br/>Product tie-ins could well be the shape of things to come, and if they can always be this smart and funny then I say bring them on. Manufacturers have made toys based on films for decades. This time it's simply being done the other way around – and it proves that the result needn't be Transformers."

Don't get me wrong, it is a great toy for stimulating children's' fantasy and enjoyed by many, but a movie, come on.<br/><br/>The fact that so many people rated so high is disturbing and tells us a lot about the expectations of the public and if they are so easily satisfied I truly wonder what awful monsters will be created in the name of the almighty dollar. <br/><br/>I sure hope that some of the old ""tinseltown"" magic will return and let the studios and production-companies come to their senses.

","As a kid who grew up in the 90s playing with Lego, I was impressed that the very toy I played (almost on a daily basis) with in grade school and junior high converted into a full-length feature. Though initially skeptic, after witnessing Lego characters old and new - including a few familiar sets of the past - incorporated into one film just blew my mind away. When I arrived on opening day, it was certainly a packed crowd of people looking like they're in their twenties and thirties, along with younger kids of the current generation.<br/><br/>The plot, which involves an ordinary Lego construction figure called Emmet (voiced by 'Parks and Recreation' star Chris Pratt) - who lives his life by his own set of instructions - finds a new purpose when coming across the female rebel WyldStyle and a group of others fulfilling a prophecy of finding the new Master Builder to stop the evil Lord Business. Emmet must learn that not everything requires a set of instructions, but a little creativity and imagination can't hurt either, or can it? <br/><br/>It had its share of laughs (notably Liam Neeson's split-personality character Good Cop/Bad Cop and Morgan Freeman's Vitruvius tending to steal the humor spotlight), well-crafted settings and animation that seemingly defines the realistic, endless, ever-expanding Lego Universe, and an elaborate set of voice talent greats that have worked with versatile directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller once before. To avoid spoilers, there's a very surprising twist near the end I did not see coming and it definitely doesn't deviate it completely from the movie's main story, but actually supplements it further with an intriguing moral lesson that sounds essentially true in real-life. My only nitpick was that some scenes can turn too frantic that it might need to be observed carefully. Nevertheless, like 'Wreck-It Ralph' and 'Toy Story' before it, this is a movie that sent me on both a nostalgia trip and run of sympathy that it will intrigue many kids and adults young at heart. Even Lego characters have a story to tell, too, even when you least expect it."

","When I first saw the trailer I was thinking this was a joke. Actually I really looked forward to this movie which remembered me the time when I played with these amazing yellow toys (not so far by the way). I came to the theater with some friends (about 15^^) and then hop100 minutes of pure laugh. I have to say the writers/directors did an amazing job. I will begin with the screenplay which is so brilliant: I expected gags, some cult lines, and of course there were plenty of those things and more. This is hard to believe but the society in which our hero Emmet lives is a kind of Orwell's 1984 place or even like in The Matrix's world. A society in which we told people to be happy and they become averages nobody, this is the world of Lord Business (alias the incredible Will Ferrell). So at the beginning of the movie, I guessed this was not a movie destined firstly to children, plus there is a great deal of references to movies of ""older"" audiences. But in fact the movie praises imagination and particularly children imagination. There is a conflict between the two sides of what legos are made for: you can follow the instruction and make ""realistic"" stuff (for example a Millennium Falcon) or you can build in your own way, build things that cannot exist, except in your mind ; and the directors succeeded in pointed this out and the movie follows these two sides. The example is, for me, the song ""Everything is Awesome"" because, at the beginning of the movie, the song is seen as a part of the brainwashing of Lord Business's society but in the end, when it accompanies the credits, we understand that what is awesome is that you can do whatever you want with these little bricks. Then, visually, this movie is astonishing. Explosions, fires, the ocean, everything is made with Lego and it is very cool. I think this movie deserves a second vision, only in the purpose of seeing more background details because it's going too fast when there are battles (if I had to point out a default, it would that).The directing is incredible in so many point because it was really not obvious too give life to these bricks and they did a great job (especially when ""Master Builders"" create cars with what they found). In conclusion, I strongly recommend this movie, even if you have 50. This movie is great for children, adults, and film-lover. Well, it is a ""masterbrick""."

Basically eight and a half years ago wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) failed to stop evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from stealing super weapon the ""Kragle"", but he warned the villain a prophecy where a person called the ""Special"" will find the Piece of Resistance which will stop the weapon. Ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) spots a woman called Wyldstyle (Slither's Elizabeth Banks) searching for something at the construction site, investigating he falls into a hole and unintentionally finds the Piece of Resistance, touches it he experiences vivid visions and wakes up with it attached to his back, he is held in custody by Lord Business's lieutenant Bad Cop (also Good Cop), he learns about the villain's plan to destroy the world with the Kragle. Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to Vitruvius who explains they are ""Master Builders"", they can build anything they need, in great speed without manuals, Lord Business disapproved of this creativity and stole the Kragle (a tube of ""Krazy Glue"") for his eventual plan to freeze the universe perfectly in place, as the ""Special"" Emmet is destined to stop him, but he has no creativity of his own. Bad Cop becomes more obedient to villain (with Good Cop rubbed away) and he is determined to track the heroes down, Wyldstyle's boyfriend Batman (Ratatouille's Will Arnett) rescues them, they all travel Cloud Cuckoo Land, where all Master Builders characters remain and can build anything they want. The characters are unimpressed with Emmet being the supposed ""chosen one"", they refuse to help fight Lord Business, then the land is attacked, everyone is captured but Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Unikitty the unicorn cat (Alison Brie), Benny the insane astronaut (Horrible Bosses' Charlie Day) and Metal Beard the robotic pirate (Nick Offerman), Emmet becomes leader and believes they should work together, so they build a plane to invade Lord Business's headquarters. They almost succeed, but are captured, Vitruvius is killed, before dying he admits the prophecy was made up, Business throws the Piece of Resistance off the edge of the universe and sets the headquarters to self-destruct, taking the Kragle and leaving Bad Cop behind, the ghost of Vitruvius tells Emmet although the prophecy was untrue he can still save the world, he takes the self-destruct device and sacrifices himself falling into the edge of the universe. The Master Builders escape and are inspired by Wyldstyle's message of Emmet's bravery, rallying together with Bad Cop, who has his Good Cop face restored with marker pen, they charge against Lord Business. In fact Emmet is not dead, he fell into the real world, the story has all been in the imagination of a little boy, Finn (Jadon Sand), and his father aka ""The Man Upstairs"" (Will Ferrell) is unhappy his son is playing with his personal Lego set, mixing characters together and jumbling new creations, the child argues Lego is for children, but the father wants things permanently glued together. Back in the Lego world Emmet realises what The Man Upstairs will do, so he forces himself to move, getting Finn's attention, the boy returns him to the set and gives him the Master Builder abilities to confront Lord Business, the father looks at Finn's creations, finds himself impressed, and notices the villain is based on him, he has a change of heart and allows his son to play with the Lego whenever he wants. In the end Lord Business is convinced that all should be free to do whatever they want, he destroys the Kragle and unfreezes all his victims, this in the real world is the father removing all super glue from the Lego set, and Batman steps down allowing Emmet and Wyldstyle, real name Lucy, to celebrate freedom and embrace, but a new threat comes to the Lego world, the father will allow Finn's little sister to play with the set as well, so Duplo alien creatures will invade and plan to destroy them. Also starring Channing Tatum as Superman, Jonah Hill as Green Lantern. Billy Dee Williams as Lando, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Keith Ferguson as Han Solo, Will Forte as Abraham Lincoln, Shaquille O'Neal as Shaq, Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman, Jorma Taccone as Shakespeare, Dave Franco, James's brother as Wally and Graham Miller as Duplo. Pratt is good as the unreliable but enthusiastic hero, Ferrell is terrific as the memorable villain and in real life as the father, Freeman is good support as the wise blind wizard, Arnett gets good puns and lines as Batman, and the other supporting voices, including the cameos, are great fun too. It is odd to think that this film is all computer animated, because it looks so much like stop motion in the way that it plays out, but that was the intention, it makes everything look more realistic, and adds to the charm and the humour, the dialogue and sight gags are all funny for all ages, and the use of the colourful bricks for everything you can imagine absolutely works, and it has a good message how imagination and freedom of expression is very positive and inspiring, an awesome computer-animated action comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Everything is Awesome"", it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for the BAFTA Kids Vote - Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Lego was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Toys, and Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"

","I can understand why some people may not view this as a great animated movie, because it definitely isn't something you see every day. But ""The Lego Movie"" is a good kind of different in my book, which deserves recognition and applause on many levels.<br/><br/>The first trailers did fool me into thinking it was all in stop motion, but it's actually a very decent blend of CGI meant to look like a stop motion animated film, that alone deserves a thumbs up. The animation in this film is absolutely phenomenal, and several moments I just pointed to the screen and thought ""That's just awesome."" (especially the explosions and the ocean). It's just a wonder to look at, and the main theme ""Everything is Awesome"" just sums up my thoughts towards this film. (and it's stuck in my head, pretty catchy) As for story, well, people say it's cliché, but I say it was definitely intended to have that feel. The film purposely parodies the unoriginality of todays modern society in film. ""The Special will arise, save us all, yadayada"", but then again, the whole entire world is coming from the mind of a young boy playing with his dad's (Will Ferrel) giant professionally built Lego sets. Thus, showing the films moral: let your mind take flight, and you can create anything... especially with Legos. And that definitely leaves you with a nostalgic feeling back in the day when you built whatever you wanted out of your giant pile of Legos at home in your room, leaving you with an accomplished feeling. Yes, it's technically a ""complex interlocking brick system"", but that doesn't mean you have to follow the instructions all the time.<br/><br/>And the characters really do carry the story along with their absolute Lego charm and likability. Emit (Chris Pratt)is just an everyday construction worker who is thrown into a crazy new world of the ""Master-builders, chosen to be the ""Special"", and while he may not know it yet, he has what it takes to save the world. Along side Wyldestyle (Elizabeth Banks(, who is a bad a$$ new kind of female main character who isn't in the damsel in distress roll, and even has Batman (Will Arnet) as her boyfriend! (btw, Batman is by far the funniest in the film, along with 1980's space man). All the characters are enjoyably unique, and have great comedic moments each, and all the cameos are very cool to see and have you rolling at times. (especially Superman (Channing Tatum) avoiding Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) All in all, I think everyone needs to take a look at this film, I don't want to spoil much more about it because it really needs to be seen to understand why it's a really ""awesome"" movie.<br/><br/>8/10 sonicfan5715 Reviews"
"Al_The_Strange","Null","0","2","20 February 2014"," Everything is awesome!
","Legos have always been my favorite toy. In fact, they still are. For as long as they've been around, it makes me wonder what took so long for somebody to make an official Lego movie.<br/><br/>Then again, what kind of movie could possibly be made out of these silly little construction blocks? The biggest fear going into this movie is that it could have just been 90 minutes of senseless fluff. Even kids thought this would be stupid.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film overall proves to be quite sharp and clever for audiences of all ages. It breezes by at a brisk pace, loaded with fast-paced comedy and visually-striking action. Even during the film's most grim and dramatic parts (of which there are a few), the tone remains light, but without being too overbearing or sappy. The comedy keeps everything consistently fun and endearing, thanks to a ton of great random lines, sight gags, pop culture jokes, and some self-parody.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work, however, is the substance. You'd think it'd be easy to write this film off as a mere marketing tool to sell more Legos (and it's probably working), but even then, The Lego Movie takes care to use Legos as the medium, more than a mere product to shove down our throats. With Legos as the film's primary canvas, the film immediately whisks us through a universe of colorful building blocks, complete with literal worldbuilding and mythos. The story treads on familiar ground; the characters inhabit familiar archetypes (I especially couldn't help but to draw comparisons between Emit and Neo from The Matrix; the wizard might as well fulfill the same role as Morpheus, and Wild Styles is much like Trinity), and the plot is molded in a formulaic epic-journey structure. What really makes this film brilliant, however, is the meta-fiction dynamic that becomes apparent as it goes on; it's a dynamic that made films like Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? novel, but The Lego Movie takes it a step further by tying in the story and themes together with (at least seemingly) earnest and heartfelt intentions.<br/><br/>At it's core, The Lego Movie emphasizes creativity as the theme. It is the basis of the story's conflict, it is the focus of the characters, and it is the idea that resounds through the script. The film firmly declares that we are all special individuals, all capable of creating new, imaginative, unique things. Legos have always been a toy to nurture that creativity, and The Lego Movie is a celebration of the creative spirit. It is a theme that's not only inspiring for children, but also for the inner child. I believe this film supports one fundamental truth I've always believed in: it is more powerful to create than to destroy.<br/><br/>This film is animated very distinctively with CGI that convincingly looks like stop-motion animation. It is all very colorful, well-rendered, well-textured, and has good-looking lighting. Movements are made to be a bit stiff on purpose, and it achieves the perfect effect of looking like a home-made feature. Voice-acting is great, and the script is pretty sharp. This production does a great job of replicating thousands and thousands of Lego pieces on-screen to create big imaginative worlds. Music can be strangely catchy too.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie is to movies what LittleBigPlanet is to video games; they both have a seminal home-made look and charm, but with a firm focus on creativity and individual expression. Legos have been an endearing medium of creativity for years, and chances are that they'll remain on toystore shelves for more years to come. Even if this movie is merely a marketing tool, it is a well-made one with a lot of heart and spirit. I think the movie - and the toy - is quality entertainment for anybody young and old.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)"
"ted-peterson","Null","0","2","20 February 2014"," Toys Make Adult Statements To Everyone's Delight
","Spoiler Alert: Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. <br/><br/>Who woulda thunk it. A lego movie? About Legos? <br/><br/>What could be so damn interesting about legos? Like clay in a sculptors hands, everything. This movie has nothing to do with Lego the little brick building toys and kits. This movie is about personal responsibility and self reliance. The movie is anti-government and anti-just about everything else. <br/><br/>In this movie, you can't trust anyone but yourself and you must question every assumption forced down your throat by media and the system behind it. <br/><br/>The antagonist is President Business and some have posited that this means the movie is a diatribe against capitalism. Such is not the case. Is it anti-greed? You bet. Does it ask people in leadership positions to have a conscious? You bet. But it doesn't preach and it doesn't lecture. What it shows is that even a seemingly insignificant worker-cog can have a major impact in places he/she never dreamed. It's ""Antz"" without Woody's incessant drone. <br/><br/>It gives its message in an almost off handed way through characters becoming aware of incongruous statements issued as part of a larger message in the McLuhan sense. <br/><br/>The ""Lego movie"" satires the prevalence of pop culture portrayed as a detriment of us all. It spears the lack of inquisitive thinking and introspection so prevalent in the young and fervently taught in schools. It ridicules political figures who spread their lies across the airwaves with seeming impunity. In the end, it's about the relationship of a father and son where the father is all business and the son. . . well a son. It's about understanding your limits and your own delusion and having the courage to step outside of your comfy preconceived ideas and explore a greater world even though there is a KEEP OFF sign posted on the access gate. <br/><br/>The cinematic work is so good that it's easy to forget that this is a movie made from kids toys and like another great satirist of the green sort called Gumby, this movie uses kid's toys to deal with adult concepts in a way that is both disarming and profound. The writing of Art Clokey, done with such wit, is equalled here in many ways. <br/><br/>The South Park duo made a movie called ""Team America: World Police"" using puppets and they also so satirized modern convention both social and political that it made a great movie. Here we don't have the sexual aspect found in ""Team America"" but the concepts are none the less adult. Kids might get it and that is a good thing. Adults have become so preoccupied with their own bs that the world passes them by while they firmly have head ensconced in rectum. <br/><br/>I hope that kids take the messages in this movie to heart and instead of becoming a drone follower, step out and make a mark in life. Sometimes its easy to forget that ""Keep of the Grass"" is just a sign. <br/><br/>M10+"
"YJLcool","8","0","2","20 February 2014"," A fun, entertaining animated film
","Based on the popular Lego line of construction toys, The LEGO movie is a fun, entertaining animated film, filled with numerous pop-culture references, together with an interesting, rather unexpected twist near the end of the film. The script was well-written, well-planned and well- executed.<br/><br/>The film's storyline is rather formulaic and been done many times before: It's a story about an ordinary nobody, who lives his own life by the book, go through the same old routine everyday, conforming to specific sets of instructions...believing that 'Everything is Awesome'. But soon, he realize that there's a big world out there, that you can become something special...if you believe you are, if you believe you can do it.<br/><br/>However, what makes this film different from the rest is the funny and laughable well-known western pop culture humors, parody, gags and puns found throughout the entire film. You just couldn't resist laughing at all. That's actually quite a remarkable feat for an animated film. The film is action-packed, in an amusing way. The CGI effects were excellent, it feels convincing that the film mostly made of Lego plastic building bricks...the vehicles, buildings, environments...even the explosions, flames, clouds, water were seemingly created entirely from Lego pieces. <br/><br/>In addition, there were many well-known comic-book, cartoon character appearances in the film: Notable ones are DC comic superheroes (Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash), Lord Of The Rings Gandalf, Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore, Star Wars' Han Solo and C3PO, Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo, Lincoln, Shakespeare and many more. They are the 'master builder', the so-called creative, intellectual ones who shapes the LEGO universe.<br/><br/>The film also makes you think: Why must we live a life that's practically similar to others? Can you live a world where you're required to be creative and innovative most of the time? Should we follow instructions, live your life by the book or be creative, imaginative, innovative, different than others? Why should we choose one? Why can't it be both? Is there a balance in between?<br/><br/>The movie's theme song ""Everything is Awesome!!"" initially feels a bit awkward, but as the film progresses, the song somehow fits the movie and turns out to be quite catchy and cool.<br/><br/>Overall, the LEGO movie will be a pleasant, satisfying watch for the kids and adults alike. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-lego-movie.html"
"OlieRendch","Null","0","2","20 February 2014"," Unique, well-animated, clever, beginning was a bit slow
","I love LEGO, I've had it since I was very little, I love building things, usually just building them and never touching them again but I also played with the sets I had. So when I learnt that there was a LEGO movie coming out I was so pumped and ready for it that when the first trailer came out I just wanted to show everybody. And just a mere few hours ago I sat and watched the full film at the cinema. What can I say about a movie entirely based on an actual brand? Is it just a giant product ad? Well I think the urge to buy/play LEGO afterwards is just an added bonus. The LEGO Movie is some of the best animation I've ever seen, these things on screen look especially real, almost to the point where you're convinced that certain parts must be stop-motion (I still think bits are). Adding to the animation is of course the voice cast, with Chris Pratt leading (2014 seems to be his year as the main guy) and also Will Arnett whose work I've only seen in voice form in animated movies and then the big one: Morgan Freeman. All these guys do terrific work and the lines and jokes they come out with are fantastic. The storyline itself can seem a little slow at times but as a whole it's pretty solid, the last 30 mins especially is the best part. Oh and by the way, for the next week you'll have an awesome song going round your head!"
"evancyl","9","0","2","20 February 2014"," Lego brought to life splendidly
","Combining excellent animation and a thoughtful story, The Lego Movie was a hugely enjoyable watch, not to mention excellent marketing for Lego. Emmet is an naive mini-figure construction worker who is happiest when he has a set of rules to follow, and takes pleasure in the most ordinary things. The spunky rebel Wyldstyle discovers and rescues Emmet when he falls into a pit at the construction site and the ""piece of resistance"" becomes attached to his back. Identified as the most extraordinary person who is key to saving the world, Emmet gets dragged on an adventure to defeat the evil Lord Business who wants to halt creativity and superglue everyone into place. Along the way, he traverses the different Lego realms and meets all our favourite heroes in Lego form (Batman, Wonderwoman, Shakespeare, Shaq O'Neal, Lando and company) who are master builders and held together by this common mission.<br/><br/>Although the defeat-the-evil-tyrant storyline is nothing fresh, this particular variation was full of humour at all the right places. I loved how these pop culture icons were woven in. And the ending was just so clever, both in terms of resolving things satisfactorily and promoting Lego. The voices were really good and the animation was truly a visual feast, bursting with colour and movement. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages."
"Joshkesic","10","0","3","19 February 2014"," Everything is Awesome!!
","The Lego Movie is a surprisingly awesome Stop-Animation/CGI film. It offers a fantastic story into the life of Emmet, a regular 'construction' worker (pun intended) whose life is turned around by the 'Piece of Resistance'. TLM is great for kids and adults alike as well as any Lego fan (off course). I enjoyed this film from start to finish and I must say the casting is fantastic, narration from the likes of Freeman; Ferrell and Neeson is certainly an added bonus. Lord and Miller have done a fantastic job at writing/directing this movie. The use of clever movie clichés adds a comedic value throughout the 100 minutes of pure entertainment. I must also hint that during the film there is a surprising twist which adds more onto the story line, however I will not go into too much depth as I wouldn't want to spoil the experience. My verdict is to definitely see this film if you like Lego, and if you don't like Lego still see the film (it is not a glorified advert after all), and it is honestly one of, if not the best animations ever created; there is a reason that it is a box-office success."
"Quietb-1","8","0","2","19 February 2014"," A Lego up on the competition
","Here's a movie based on a toy plastic building brick. Of course the early trailers looked lame and what are they thinking? Now the movie arrives and dominates the box office, because it is good. <br/><br/>Not too intense for kids and enough jokes for adults. There is a break neck pace, and a color assault on the senses. There's a catchy song and well voiced characters. There is even a fun twist that gives a sense of reality to the whole deal. <br/><br/>Here's a movie for the entire family. The 3D works and is worth the up charge. See it. <br/><br/>Based on the box office success expect more Lego movies in the future."
"sophietaylor18","6","0","2","19 February 2014"," Fun, chaotic and hilarious
","This was one of my most anticipated films for 2014 due both due to the fact that Lego was a big part of my childhood and the animation style was so unique and refreshing that, being the animation geek I am, I had to see this.<br/><br/>My tip for viewing this is to not question what the heck is going on for the first 10 minutes of the film, you just have to go with it and you will be pleasantly surprised. The plot seemed non-nonsensical and almost completely random at points and it does require some understanding of the toy and films that are referenced. Adults will also enjoy the pokes at politics and consumerism. <br/><br/>In one scene the characters go to 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' where they follow a cat with a unicorns horn into a building shaped like a dog's head in order to meet with famous Lego figures, then a robot pirate jumps through the window and tells his back story, and an argument causes Abraham Lincoln to fly on his jet powered chair through the roof. The whole 100 minutes is stuff like this. But its immensely hilarious and doesn't have a dull or unfunny moment.<br/><br/>The sentimental side introduced near the end was nostalgic and a good twist, but didn't make me all that emotional in the way that films like Up or Toy Story 3 did. I also wanted more from the side characters, pertculary Superman and Green Lantern, and more of the awesome action sequences.<br/><br/>Fun and entertaining for everyone,particularity families, and one of the funniest films I've seen in months."

"Hollywoodrulez","Null","0","4","18 February 2014"," Kid Films Domenation
","I haven't seen the film so I can't critic on it but I can share my knowledge on why I think this film has done so well for itself. It's a kids film and even though they are the most overlooked films in terms of their content they rack up huge at the box office because of audience fees. Point blank people who have kids have no choice to take them to a kids movie at the multiplex because they either typically can't see anything else or don't want to see anything else. Look at the top 50 highest grossing films of all time if you look past Avatar, Titanic and The Avengers most of the list is comprised of kids or young adult films. Movies like the lego movie are funny, spontaneous and colourful hence the reason children love them but this film also has familiar characters like Batman for instance which thanks to Christopher Nolan is majorly back on the map. However most of the time films distributed by Disney and Nickoldeon tend to be ran into the ground against more adult films because of their content which doesn't really vary from that in big hits like Frozen and The Lego Movie. I wish the filmmakers of this film all the luck and maybe just maybe this film will make the top 10."

","This movie was phenomenal. Seriously, it was smart, witty, subversive, self-aware, satirical without dipping into cynicism, absurd, and actually pretty emotional.

I know you can say this about virtually every post-2006 animated movie, but for some films it bears repeating.<br/><br/>Not since Pixar has anyone ever made a movie about toys so good."
"freemantle_uk","8","0","3","17 February 2014"," Better then a Lego Movie should be
","Before The Lego Movie was released it was easy scoff at the idea and dismiss the film before its release. But the reviews have offered near universal praise from critics and audiences, making a film that is fun and funny and more intelligence then it had any right to be. 21 Jump Street writers/directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller take the clichéd mistaken messiah storyline by making The Lego Movie more about conformity, individuality and creatively and takes a Plato's Allegory of the Cave approach as the main character lives a sheltered, limited experience and sees the world for what it really is. The Lego Movie is filled with jokes and visuals gags that both adults and children can enjoy as the directors are inventive with their set-pieces and designs. There is excellent voice from the likes of Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks. Will Arnett as Batman was comedy gold, playing on the popularity of the character."

I really liked the LEGO Star Wars cameo in it. My only problem with this film is that the screen needs to be brighter. I felt like I was watching a movie with sunglasses on! Most films have resolved this issue with brighter screens, sadly The LEGO Movie isn't one of them. Very nice movie to take your family to.

"georgeislive21","9","0","2","17 February 2014"," Surprisingly Entertaining
","Animated children's toys unite in what proves to be an entertaining and laugh inducing piece of popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>PROS: Much smarter than I anticipated, the film strives to entertain its primary audience and the adults who are paying for their tickets. The results prove a winner in the manner of the Toy Story series. There's something for everyone here.<br/><br/>CONS: Let's be honest about this: this movie exists to sell product in the same manner as the Transformers series. Actually, it's far more blatant than this, as the ""sets"" are modeled after various Lego universes. It would be like a Barbie movie that features her and Ken driving around in the pink convertible, switching fabulous outfits, etc. I'm actually surprised someone hasn't tried this (or maybe they have and I'm just unaware). If you can look past obvious shilling and enjoy the humor, you'll have a great time with your kids."

","There isn't much to saw that hasn't already been said ten times over. This is a very funny, very genuine, very heartfelt animated film. It gives you non-stop jokes (that are ACTUAL jokes, not pop culture references), a surprisingly interesting story, great characters, and an all around good message meant for all ages.<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect going into this. I just figured that it would be more or less a feature length advertisement with some funny moments. Instead I saw a decent contender for one of the best movies of 2014, depending on what else may come out. I don't foresee too many films surpassing just the over all enjoyment I had with this though.<br/><br/>The cg animation itself is also breathtaking. This is a must see in theaters, as seeing every single tiny Lego bit is mind boggling. You think it's impressive all of the way through, then you get to the ocean scenes and it's even more amazing.<br/><br/>Is it an absolutely perfect movie? Certainly not, there is no perfect film. But it is perfect in its tone and execution. I give this a 10/10 without even thinking about it, I haven't been this impressed with a film in years."

","When I was younger I never played with Lego. I thought they were boring and a waste of time. Now I see them differently. So let's start this review.<br/><br/>So The Lego Movie is about a normal Lego man called Emmet, voiced by Chris Platt who discovers that he is the special and teams up with Wyldstyle (Elisabeth Banks), Vituvius( Morgan Freeman) and Batman (Will Arnett to stop Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from destroying the world.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching this film very much. This film made me laugh, cry and smile. The laughs mainly come from Emmets stupidity and his discovery to finding out about the master builders and that he is the special. Also his chemistry with Wyldstyle kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>There are a lot of cameos in this film including Han Solo, Milhouse from The Simpsons, Michelangelo from The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Abraham Lincoln, Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Also the cast is impressive you have got Liam Neeson, Charlie Day, Cobie Smulders, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill and lots more high profile celebrities.<br/><br/>My favourite scenes in the film include when the police invade the master builders cloud base, the end battle between the Lord Businesses robots and the residents of the city and the big reveal at the ending which reveals that the Lego people are being controlled by a human Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>However my problems with the film are some moments in the film could have been funnier and more use of the 3D would have been nice.<br/><br/>Altogether The Lego Movie is an entertaining film to take the family to watch and will definitely be one of the films of 2014 and is better than the other film I saw this weekend Robocop. 8/10"

Now finally we have a big movie version with all the Lego we used to play and the movie gives a nice tribute to anything that has to do with Lego.<br/><br/>OK but I can understand that some people might see the movie only a big commercial to buy more Lego for the children, but trust me the movie is more than what you might think. The movie does deliver a good message, but it's even more explored than just one single thing to learn not only to the children but also good for adults as well. <br/><br/>I was really impressed how the directors wanted almost everything to be 100% Lego and it really is neat and funny to see. There really is a lot creativity, good entertainment and using the materials on different ways. I don't think I've ever had this fun of seeing my childhood favorite toys come to life.<br/><br/>Although I have to admit that the ""twist"" made me go ""What?"" but at least it didn't ruin my experience. I won't spoil what happens but hopefully you understand it well for what it represents.<br/><br/>Is it recommended? Heck yes! The movie wasn't for commercial, if you could just ignore that kind of thought and see it for what is then enjoy it! I would recommend it to not only the whole family but for all the ages. And be sure to look after some cameos especially in the scene in the meeting!"

","(english isn't my first language so i apologize in advance for any spelling or grammatical errors)<br/><br/>i watched this movie during the weekend hoping to laugh and simply be entertained. coming out of the theater i was certainly not disappointed. the star studded cast made the movie twice as funny as i hoped it would be and twice as fun. Morgan freeman did a hilarious job as Vitruvius and Liam neesons serious tone adds more hilarity to the movie. although some jokes might have been slightly cheesy or childish i still consider this move to be funny, in fact most of the laughter in our theater came from adults as opposed to children. what i really like about this movie generally is the fact that its suitable for all ages. the colorful graphics, silly humor and the adventure will appeal to kids while the jokes and deeper meaning behind the movie will entertain adults. however i did hope a few other characters, such as gandalf or Abraham Lincoln, to be more involved in the adventure and i would have enjoyed the movie more if there were more famous characters added ( jack sparrow, spider-man, master Yoda etc....). overall the movie was very fun to watch and its a MUST see for fans of animated movies. but whether you ever played with Lego's or not, whether you are old or young this movie will surely put a smile on your face."

And the ending (Which I am not giving away) made the clichés OK. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I've not seen a movie this full in a long time. There were a lot of people there. Even though it was CG, I was still really impressed with the ""stop motion"" animation. This was some of the most brilliant animation I've seen in a long time.

","""The Lego Movie"" is everything it was meant to be. Straight-up entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. The animation, which was a mix of CGI and stop-motion, was solid. One really cannot tell what blocks and sets are real and which ones are not. The voice acting is perfect, and all the actors give the right amount of personality to their respective characters. If there's one disappointment I had, it was the minor lack of humor. Being that this was directed by the geniuses behind ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", I was expecting to laugh out loud from beginning to end. But the humor doesn't quite shift into gear until Batman enters, and then the film gets better and even pretty clever, especially towards the climax. Bottom line, ""The Lego Movie"" is all around fun for the whole family."

","My review, with information that could be considered spoiler-ific. <br/><br/>Be prepared to enjoy an intelligent, memorable movie, that takes the theme of creation using Lego blocks, and crafting a story around it that is not just entertaining, but also a delight and a treat for the senses. However, it does not seem to be deserving of all the excessive praise being heaped on it, esp. since the kids might not be taking away as much as us adults. <br/><br/>Up, Finding Nemo and Incredibles happen to be those works that transcend age - and though this one's a lotta fun, its not in their league, not the way most critics are making it out to be. <br/><br/>The voice talent is quite varied, and eclectic even, with most of the laughs coming from the character voiced by the ever-elegant Morgan Freeman, who gamely pokes a lot of fun at his own persona; as does Liam Neeson. They're efficiently surrounded by Ferrell, Banks, Pratt, Brie, Arnett, Hill, Day and the like, and the sincerity shows in every phrase/frame. It is most difficult to wrong surprises while sticking close to the formula, and both Lord/Miller show that their rendering of 21 Jump Street was no flash in the pan (I'm in the minority of not being a big fan of 'Cloudy with...', since spite of having watched it on IMAX 3D). <br/><br/>What's dividing critics, and put me solidly on the other side of the fence, is the whole meta-aspect to the whole thing, that, IMO, was introduced unnecessarily in the 3rd act, though the final denouement (which was strong) would make no sense without that. <br/><br/>If that had been handled better, I'd be rooting for this one all the way, the way most of the masses are doing right now. <br/><br/>However, conclusively, this is quite a lot of good fun at the movies, so I'd advise for all families to make that trip to the local multiplex and have a nice time."
"griffolyon12","9","0","3","9 February 2014"," I Wish I Could Go Where Everything is Awesome
","Everything is awesome in the new film, The Lego Movie. The film is exactly as it sounds, it's a film about Legos, set in a world made entirely of Legos. It's quite simple in all honesty, but it's in the satire and the surprising depth that this film has that makes it awesome.<br/><br/>The Lego Movie follows Lego construction worker, Emmett, who is as normal as anyone can be. Emmett always follows the instructions, until one night he comes across this thing known as the relic, and the relic is the only thing that can stop the evil Lord Business from using Krazy Glue and gluing all of the Lego pieces of the world together.<br/><br/>The film is a very witty satire in the way that it pokes fun at just about every movie convention you've seen in major Hollywood blockbusters over the past 10-20 years. There are pointless prophecies, chosen ones, evil world-ending machines, even a character who is Good Cop and Bad Cop. When Good Cop-Bad Cop spins his head, the back of his head has a different face, and depending on which side he is showing, he is either good or he is bad. There is a lot of ingenious humor in the film, even if every joke doesn't always land because there are just so many packed in there. However, what really impressed me with this film was the thematic depth it has.<br/><br/>Anyone going to see The Lego Movie is expecting a comedy, and the film is that, even in its more serious moments, but there is a very clever twist in the final third of the film that really makes this a unique, one-of-a-kind animated film. It is this twist that really gives the film weight. While the traditional idea of being an individual and not always following the traditional flow seems to be the big idea that the filmmakers are wanting you to believe in at first, once this twist occurs, you realize that the film is saying something even deeper than that. I'll say no more, other than the fact that Will Ferrell, who voices Lord Business, really shines in the final act of the film, shedding his man-child persona to adopt one of seriousness.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lego Movie is about as good of a time as you can have with any movie out there. It's like a weird blend of Pixar meets Monty Python and Mel Brooks. The CG animation replicates the look of those stop motion Lego cartoons you can find on YouTube, but better. I am not gonna lie and say my jaw didn't drop a few times at the technical perfection on display here, but it's the humor and the heart that really makes The Lego Movie an awesome experience. Even when the film has a slight case of ADD, you are still charmed.<br/><br/>I give The Lego Movie a 9 out of 10!"

","Like it's title track- everything is AWESOME in The Lego Movie. Crafted with more audacity, imagination and humor than all the Transformers, GI Joes and general superhero movies put together, the Lego movie is the first 2014 blockbuster, a quick witted, heartwarming epic adventure of a nobody, who saves everybody.<br/><br/>The plot is a parody of a generic dystopian science fiction story (think 1984, Matrix, Star Wars), but in the world that is Legoland, creativity is everything. It is a world of endless ongoing construction, where the better builder you are, the more revered you are. Lord Business is an evil tyrant who wants everybody to follow the rules. Emmet is one such unexceptional block of plastic who does do as he is told, till he is identified as the ""Special""- the one person who can overthrow the dictator and save the Lego-verse from being permanently static to ever changing and inventive. Helping him is action friendly Wyldstyle ( Elizabeth Banks) and the wizard like Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Meanwhile, there is a far greater power than Lord Business, called the Man Upstairs here, whose mostly unseen hand plays God in this world.<br/><br/>We would think a movie about building blocks will be rigid and limited in expressions, but in the hands of brilliant animators, everything is possible. Everything that you see is constructed from bricks, wheels, gears, and mini figures, even rivers and an angry ocean! And in it plays every conceivable character that is licensed to Warner Brothers studio, given a cinematic twist. So we have a extremely pompous Batman (voiced superbly by Will Arnett) who only works in black or very very dark shades of gray, saving lives but wise enough to decide that when the time is right, it is every man for himself. Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are there too, in addition to Gandalf, Dumbledore, Abraham Lincoln, Shakespeare and the entire cast of Star Wars spouting hilarious lines. Then there is a transforming pirate called Metal beard, a space cadet empress called UniKitty, (Allison Brie) who is obviously, a cross between an unicorn and a kitten, and the enforcer, called Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) whose swiveling head has a frown on one side and a smile on the other. I could go on and on but then the wackiness is best seen, not read.<br/><br/>Quality animation would come to naught without good voice talent. It is here that The Lego movie furthers its excellent standards by getting an ensemble star cast that brings wit, spontaneity, emotion, and all the laughs you could ever ask for. Some of us think animated movies are for kids, but good ones carry messages that ring true for adults too. In the case of The Lego movie, the message is about thinking outside the box. Kids or adults- anyone old enough to play with toys will enjoy this movie- 10/10"

","When I first saw the trailer for The LEGO Movie, I thought it looked like a fun family movie, with maybe a couple of interesting jokes and animation, but not amazing. Boy, was I wrong! The LEGO Movie is one of the funniest films I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Our story starts out with our main protagonist, Emmet. Emmet is an ordinary, by the instructions LEGO figure. His life is predictable and normal until he meets Wyldstyle, an action girl part of the rebellion to stop the evil President/Lord Business. With the help of a wizard, a cute unicorn/cat hybrid, a retro 80s spaceman and everybody's favorite bat superhero, Emmet goes on one heck of a ride! I'm not going to spoil any major plot points or jokes (there are a lot), but I must say that I didn't find one thing wrong with this movie. Unlike most generic family films today, the film's comedy is genuinely funny, and not just a catastrophe of butt and pop culture jokes. The story, while being purposely generic, pulls off the story well using witty, self referencing humor. I cared about all the characters and their development throughout the movie, the animation and effects are surprisingly good, and it even is a bit emotional.<br/><br/>The voice acting is great, featuring actors such as Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, and Will Ferrel. Heck, it's hard to recognize some of these celebrities when here, you see them as a bunch of toy figures with heart and personality. The cameos were also funny and not randomly thrown in like a lot of other films.<br/><br/>Overall, The LEGO movie is a funny and heartwarming movie for all ages that's even better than some Oscar winning movies. This is a must watch not only for LEGO fans, but people with imaginations and a sense of humor in general."

","I don't remember where but I read that this movie will once again make you realize how cool legos are and it definitely did. I was pretty skeptical about its animation and graphics in the start but soon that was discarded and story kicked a$$. The movie is especially awesome for movie geeks and internet activists. Why? Because some of the puns are so downright awesome and intelligent that only such people enjoy a hearty laugh. Apart from the comedy sector, which is as usual awesome concerning animated movies, this movie carries some nice messages. I found that this movie utilized the magic of an underdog rising to become special. We all know how emotional and cool that is. The main character is hypocritically enjoying his robotic life and then he catches a spark of unknown spirit. As anyone would be, he is hesitant at start but ultimately lives up to the idea. The mix of so many famous characters, especially comical, makes it at least worthy of applause. Imagine a movie that has all the special people in it, now wouldn't that be awesome? Anyways, this movie just has a hint of it but great impact made. I love how it carries several messages and introduces interplay of imaginative and real life world. This was something I saw for the first time. Anyways, the movie is really cool, funny and a bundle of joy. If you found it like an extended commercial of Legos, then you sir are not awesome. I found that it introduces a teaser at the last moment so unsure if there's going to be a part two then. Haha, got to google that now. <br/><br/>Note: There is another deduction of this movie and it is that although robotic age is coming, it's the unity and quantity of simple, yet potential, people in the world that will over-rule.<br/><br/>Source: http://pratikkataria.tumblr.com/post/76032132912/"

","""The LEGO Movie"" is a happy and exhilarating ball of fun. It's a bright, colorful, quick-witted adventure that stretches the animated form as far as it can possibly go, spinning its characters into other dimensions and other realms. In short, it does exactly what animation is supposed to do. It plays around in a magical world but doesn't simply ground itself in one simple-minded idea. This is one of those rare homeruns that comes along every once in a great while. It follows ground-breakers like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Toy Story"", in that the animators open the visual canvas to create something really special and distinct.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a world completely constructed out of LEGO, beginning with a breathtaking opening shot that swoops through downtown Brickburg as the happy citizens sing the uber-infectious techno-pop ditty ""Everything is Awesome"" (a song that will be jammed in your head for the next six months). We are in the familiar world of the colorful interlock blocks so large that we get cameos by William Shakespeare, Gandalf, Superman, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Abraham Lincoln, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, C-3PO and Shaquille O'Neal. We visit a pirate world, a cowboy world, a subterranean world and many more. You know the animators have hit on a burst of genius when they employ Liam Neeson to play a character named Good Cop/Bad Cop.<br/><br/>Our focus zeros in on a nobody, a generic construction worker named Emmett Brickowski (voiced by Chris Pratt) whose world-view is that life is a party, even at work. He's happy because every single day he gets to build something new, taking things apart and making them into something else – everything in this world is made of LEGO, so everything can be changed in an instant.<br/><br/>One person who is not happy with the constant changes is President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell), a cold-hearted corporate ruler who wants the world to stay the way it is. He has a secret plan to nail down the blocks permanently. That's where Emmett comes in. Mistaken for ""the chosen one"", he is recruited by a counsel called The Master Builders to thwart Business' plan by building objects that will prevent his evil deeds. The problem: Emmett has no imagination; he can't build without an instruction book. The best he's come up with so far is a bunk bed couch.<br/><br/>So, surrounded by newfound friends like the wizard Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman), a hell-cat named Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) and Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) he learns to use his imagination. That's part of the spirit of this movie. It encourages free-form imagination rather than simply sticking to the prescribed instructions, which was always the spirit of the LEGO toy. Once you've build the intended toy, you break it apart and make something else. The LEGO world presented here is in that spirit. Every building, every character, and every backdrop is made out of LEGO and it is constantly changing.<br/><br/>The script does the same. The writers have really worked on this screenplay, allowing it not simply to follow a pre-formed pattern but to move into other realms of imagination while satirizing our real-world dependence on designer coffee, computer gadgets, mechanized music and dimwitted sitcoms (Emmett really loves a one-joke show called ""Where are My Pants?"") Emmett's world is bland and homogenized and the point of the story is how he opens his mind to except an out-of-the-box form of thinking.<br/><br/>""The LEGO movie"" is a breath of fresh air. In the past two years, animators have been satisfied to tread the safe waters of market-tested brand names and sequels. Animated films have stopped surprising us because they end up packaged as the same tired interchangeable plots that stay so grounded that they might as well have been live action. No one gets really inventive anymore. Unlike previous attempts to cash in on classic toys, like ""Battleship"", ""G.I. Joe"" and the abysmal ""Transformers"" movies, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller don't simply pay lip service to the LEGO toy, they have engineered a universe which is constantly evolving as the bricks are broken down and rebuilt into something else. They create a beautiful, colorful world of imagination and reformation that is a tribute to the endangered spirit of make-believe.<br/><br/>**** (of four)"

There was never a dull moment or a moment filled with awkwardness, as I have seen many movies that have. Overall it was an amazing movie with good inspirational things for young kids."
