","To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.<br/><br/>This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!<br/><br/>Compared to most other films ""Amelie"" (and I will stick to ""Amelie"" since ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing ""Amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""Alien 4"" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" in 1991.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry ""Amelie"" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.<br/><br/>I could go on forever about ""Amelie"". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, ""Amelie"" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.<br/><br/>I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too..."
"alastair_m","10","266","306","19 December 2001"," A hilarious, warm movie in a world all its own.
","Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo."" These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.<br/><br/>Here is a film so original, so funny, and so warm that it left me with smiling for hours and the people on the sidewalk thinking I was crazy. Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.<br/><br/>Amélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.<br/><br/>As she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.<br/><br/>Amélie's conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie's inner struggle seriously, but it's never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, ""Amélie"" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Alien: Resurrection"", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can't wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year's best picture and is not to be missed."
"emilio77","Null","501","595","3 December 2002"," It's my favorite movie of all time...
","Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain<br/><br/>For 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.<br/><br/>I consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie's mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie's apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.<br/><br/>Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director's choice, so I don't hold her responsible for that.<br/><br/>
Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie's pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key's silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn't been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie's heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old's man face, a close-up of Amélie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.<br/><br/>
Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion."
"jilske","10","278","334","24 December 2001"," This Movie can CHANGE your life :-)
","A year ago, if someone would have asked me ""What is your favorite movie ?"" , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.<br/><br/>Since June, I have but one answer: 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' !!! It is simply unique in his kind.  And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'.  It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way.  Audrey's performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.<br/><br/>This movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!<br/><br/>
Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!<br/><br/>a 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again"
"Boyo-2","10","442","538","1 March 2003"," This is rated so highly cause it deserves it
","A slice of heaven right here on earth, ""Amelie"" is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. <br/><br/>
Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character.  A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street. <br/><br/>
Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked ""Are you a congenital shmuck""?<br/><br/>But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course.<br/><br/>
Just beautiful.  10/10."
"rbverhoef","9","202","251","14 August 2004"," Finds its charm in the little things
","'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. <br/><br/>We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.<br/><br/>The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.<br/><br/>In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie."
"wisewebwoman","10","329","417","15 March 2002"," What is left to say about this glorious joy ride?
","I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.<br/><br/>The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.<br/><br/>I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood."
"ztruk2001","10","76","99","27 March 2005"," Audrey Tautou is magical
","Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. <br/><br/>""You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?""<br/><br/>Hmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day."
"yaseminturkish","10","62","85","18 February 2003"," Amelie innocently skips stones in the canal and you realize that this deserves all the hype
","Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>It's hard to put into words how much I loved `Amelie.'  I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.  I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie, seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with, and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted.  It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.<br/><br/>
I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions.  `Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.  Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou.  Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles.  Could a 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as Meryl Streep and Katharine Hepburn?  I really wasn't expecting it but Audrey Tatou revitalized my interest in film and left me wondering why her name didn't appear on Academy ballots and what possessed the Academy to favor `No Man's Land.'<br/><br/>An already perfect film couldn't get much better but along with the lovingly created cinematography and delight of rising star Tatou came the wonderful story of a true do-gooder.  `Amelie' is a film that begs  you to get happy and should give some short-term contentment to even the most depressed of individuals.  Little moments like the tragically funny early years of Amelie are very special and the best I've seen on the silver screen.  The scene where Amelie is skipping stones in the canal should be studied for years to come as the greatest technical moment in cinema.<br/><br/>Movies like this one don't come around very often.  Perhaps the creators of films that pander to dumbed-down audiences who apparently can't tell that their watching last year's film should take the hint.  The movie-going public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel. This is why `Amelie' remains #18 on the list of best films.<br/><br/>10/10"
"hades35","10","226","340","30 December 2003"," Fantastic...
","It is the best film i've ever seen.Only the French could make films as good as this.

"Chris Do","10","33","50","28 December 2001"," Psychologically insightful
","This movie is stylish beyond belief. But what strikes me most is the way it manages to capture the reality of human emotions, how internal monologues are played out in the form of TV programs, how dreams are simulated by the magical movements of inanimate objects and talking photographs! It is a charismatic portrayal of inner existence and the most natural desire to pursue happiness, both in our life and that of others."
"bigspeegs","8","111","189","11 January 2002"," A nice little film
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.<br/><br/>
Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).<br/><br/>
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.<br/><br/>After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.<br/><br/>
Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.<br/><br/>
With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wold"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world."
"Trattskalle","10","22","33","25 June 2002"," Two hours of euphoria
","I've never ever felt so good after seeing a movie, and I'm not even a romantic. I've seen it four times at the movies, and I'll buy the DVD the second it gets up on the shelves. I wasn't the slightest bit surprised to see that it's a top10 movie here."
"Miura88","1","144","276","2 April 2010"," Insufferably Annoying
","Not too long ago I was watching ""The Hustler"", and it was quite obvious that the film and practically everything about it was undeniably cool. Especially the way Jackie Gleason walked, the way he was dressed, the way he spoke, he wasn't trying to be cool, he simply was.<br/><br/>On a minorly related note, ""Amelie"" is a film that wants to be quirky, it wants to be cutesy, but it fails because it tries too hard: The exaggerated camera movements and sound effects, the ultra-luminous (yet rather nice) cinematography designed to turn Paris into a fantasy world, the odd quips of dialogue on orgasms, but the absolute biggest fault of the film is with the lead character known as Amelie.<br/><br/>Amelie is a woman-child who likes to take it upon herself to do selfless good deeds for everyone around her, and the entire storyline revolves around her attempts to fix various problems for everyone within her vicinity. The only problem is that Amelie's selflessness isn't real, she's only doing this to feed her own sense of accomplishment so she can crack that god-awful smile at the camera once that good deed is done. Not long after it becomes extremely apparent that she's a psychopath who breaks into other people's appartments to screw with them (because she, not the police or any authorities, must be the one to deal with bad people), appoints herself as an unneeded tour guide for a blind man and basically does whatever she wants, regardless of whether it actually helps anyone.<br/><br/>The film has clearly taken cues from the French New Wave (Amelie even watches ""Jules Et Jim"" at the Cinema) but it has taken those editing and storytelling tricks to the nth degree and spoiled the entire film, even Amelie is taken from Irene Jacob's character in ""Three Colours: Red"" and made even nicer and sweeter until she's just plain obnoxious It's an unbearably naive film that's filled with so much sugary fake charm that it becomes sickening rather quickly, and once the cutesy novelty wears off you realise that there's just no substance to the storyline at all. Some people have been enchanted by the magical qualities of it, but I was completely put off as the whole thing was over-the-top and rather self-indulgent. A film like ""L'Atalante"" finds the poetic beauty in the banality of life and simply displays it in all of its ordinary glory.

","I hate to be one of those negative people, but I hate this movie with an incredible fiery passion. I think it's very possibly the most overrated film of all time. I watched it a while back expecting to see something amazing but I was disappointed beyond words. The main character is very possibly the most annoying movie creation of all time. She's really cutesy and pale and she doesn't say anything. She's like a cross between Shirley Temple and a mime. By the end of the movie you just want to reach into the screen and choke her. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the movie has no point whatsoever. And just for record, I'm not just saying this because I'm an idiot American who can't appreciate French cinema--I actually love French films (my favs are The Girl On The Bridge, La Haine, and Leon: The Professional). But this one just makes me want to pull my hair out. Anyway, I'll certainly attempt to watch it again at some point and give it another chance, but so far I'm at a complete loss as to why this movie is ranked at #18.

","In 1974, in Enghien in the northern suburbs of Paris, the girl Amélie Poulain was born and raised alone by her cold hearted father and her stressed mother due to a mistake of her father's evaluation of her heart conditions. Her mother dies in a weird accident and when the shy and daydreamer Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) becomes a young woman, she moves to central Paris and works as waitress in the café Deux Moulins in Montmartre. On 30 August 1997, Amélie finds a child treasure hidden behind the wall that belonged to a dweller from the 50's, and she decides to anonymously return it to the owner. He seeks out the man and when she witnesses his happiness, she decides to become the ""godmother of the rejected"", anonymously helping people that are her acquaintances using her fantasy and little tricks. She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship. When Amélie finds the album of photos of an intriguing collector that collects rejected photos in the Photomaton of the Gare de l'Est, she seeks him out and falls in love with him. On 28 September 1997, Amélie Poulain finds love.<br/><br/>""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is certainly one of the sweetest and most original movies of cinema history. The surrealistic screenplay is stunning and it is impossible not falling in love for the character performed by the expressive Audrey Tautou. The direction and the acting are top-notch, supported by awesome camera work and the cinematography, excellent edition and magnificent soundtrack. This is a delightful romance even when you watch it for the second time, My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Fabuloso Destino de Amelie Poulain"" (""The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain"")"

I have never really been with a girl in my life. Actually never even really talked to a girl due to my severe anxiety.
Anyway, I found this movie in my long list of unwatched movies. And i asked my friend if watching a romance movie would make me feel more depressed and anxious. He said ""100% Defiantly bro""! But I couldn't resist the attraction that this movie had on me and started watching it.
I literally THANK GOD that i had the opportunity to watch this film in this turning point of my life. I cried LOUD during the last minutes of this film.I had the feeling like I was watching the story of my own life. I realized that I would nearly loose the soul of my life if I don't take my feelings and my heart serious. So I decided. I decided not to crush myself by paying attention to my negative and obsessive thoughts more than my soul and my heart calling.

","**very mild spoilers**<br/><br/>
I rented ""Amelie"" reluctantly.  I had the impression that it would be a ""girlie"" film with meandering narrative and boring angst-ridden characters.<br/><br/>I am so glad I was wrong!  What I did get was a ""magical realism"" tale of an introverted woman trying to improve the lives of the people around her. Amelie, through clever scheming and gentle intervention, facilitates delightful life experiences for her fellow characters.<br/><br/>The film does move at a slower pace, but the plot points are endearing, and it never drags. Every scene has a subtextual significance, where every shot adds a tiny sense of guilty voyeurism as we peek gentle into these people's lives.<br/><br/>The plot devices are purposely stretched to fantastical lengths at times. Laurant and Jeunet use this ""magical"" aspect of the realism to cultivate an optimism and effervescence that you won't find in any Hollywood movie today. The mood is always dreamy in this film, yet is never childish.<br/><br/>The characters will warm your heart.  Audrey Tatou is perfect as the shy-yet-smouldering Amelie, and Jamel Debbouze is perfect as the impish Lucien.<br/><br/>You will love the sub plots of Amelie convincing her father to travel, and how she seeks gentle vengeance on the wicked grocer.  The scheme to introduce herself to Nino, and the plot to do matchmaking at the cafe.  All of these little stories are bound to tweak your heartstrings!<br/><br/>In the end: Amelie will leave you with feeling that ""Pay it Forward"" should have left you with... a buoyant and optimistic affection for humanity and life!<br/><br/>
I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are an action fan, an intellectual, or a feel-good Hollywood movie buff.  There are clever plot elements and characterization that are good for all movie fans!<br/><br/>

It is romantic an absolute non-icky way, it shows a humans kindness in whole new lighting and Nino and Amelie share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film. Music goes along with the movie just great, it just right, it sets the perfect mood for the viewer.

","Let's be honest: is this film really worthy of being in the Top 250? What with all the psychotic behavior and the annoying, creepy smiles Amélie cracks from time to time while she's trying to be cryptic and heroic, this film is easily one of the worst I've seen. The worst part is when people go on trying to defend it, saying that the character is simply misunderstood and that since the film is french, it offers a different perspective. Do we have to remind people that foreign films also have the ability to suck as much as American films? And I tried to give this movie a chance but the more I tried, the easier it was to find things that I didn't like about it. So go ahead, defend it as much as you like, but it doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most annoying films of the decade."

","A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar."

Yes, the other characters are bizarre and sometimes funny. <br/><br/>But REALLY !!!! This is one of the highest rated films on imdb?  I have been a movie geek for almost 50 years, and this did NOT even remotely jump out at me as an all-time great film.  It is enjoyable fluff, nothing more.  Did it make me feel good about life?

They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.<br/><br/>However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. As the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps. There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG."" <br/><br/>In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes."

","Amélie grows up a slightly introverted child as a result of her unusual parents.  When she grows up she has her own unusual habits and quirks. When she finds a hidden box of childhood toys in her house she decides to track down the owner and return it to him.  Seeing the happiness that she brings to him she resolves to work in secret to make other people happy.  However can she be happy herself?<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I'd heard others raving on the boards about it but didn't even know the most basic of plot details about it, I didn't even know who the director was.  When the opening credits rolled and I saw that it was Jeunet as director I immediately realised that this may not be as straightforward as I had thought.  Almost immediately, the different humour comes through in lots of ways - from little things like the way the cameras moves up to the full script.  The plot doesn't totally work and some of the strands are a little unclear, but overall the film really works well as an alternative romance that is as sweet as it is quirky.<br/><br/>The influence of Jeunet is the main reason the film works as well as it does.  He tones down his usual darker style and delivers something just as different and unusual but much lighter and refreshing.  As writer he does a great job coming up with imaginative characters and situations.  The other reason it works so well is through the performance of Tautou; she is such a wide eyed innocent - sweet without being sickly and likable without taking away from her quirkiness.  The support cast are all good and features a few Jeunet regulars but really it is Tautou's film and she carries it well thanks to the great work of the director.<br/><br/>Overall this is a surprisingly sweet film that took me by surprise and was sweetly charming and lovely without falling into cliché - it was different and quirky in a refreshingly enjoyable way.  If you come to this expecting one of `the greatest films ever made' then you may be a little surprised because the film is quite unassuming and is best enjoyed when you come to it fresh."
"DapperDuck713","1","13","22","24 February 2020"," A ""Grinding Windmill"" of ""Life's Miseries""
","From the director of ""Alien: Resurrection"" comes this haunting thriller about a psychopathic woman who obsesses over other people's lives, watching their every move. After repeatedly breaking into a neighbour's house and kidnapping a blind man, this calculating maniac becomes fixated on a man who doesn't know her, leaving him a chilling message that reads ""DO. YOU. WANT. TO. MEET. ME?"" Shudder with terror as you witness the extreme measures that this lunatic goes to to ensnare her prey!
Oh sorry, apparently that's not what this film is about...<br/><br/>""Amélie"" is a movie that tries so hard to be quirky that it falls flat on its terrifying face, spending its agonising 2 hour runtime with its head up its own backside.<br/><br/>The first two minutes of ""Amélie"" sum up everything that I hated about the film. As a montage of random and inconsequential events appear on screen, followed by videos of sperms and a time-lapse of a nude woman being pregnant before seeing a baby burst out of her like a Xenomorph, I put my head in my hands and sighed. ""It's gonna be one of these movies, isn't it"" I thought. Every moment of ""Amélie"" screams in a squealy voice ""I'M CUTESIE! THAT MAKES ME THE BEST FILM EVER DOESN'T IT?!"" This made watching this film so unbearably unpleasant, because it's clear that ""Amélie"" thinks the world of itself despite its many short comings.<br/><br/>I can appreciate a film that aims high but misses it's mark on some occasions, what makes me physically ill are movies that are so aloof that they believe that they're the smartest and most provocative masterwork ever filmed!<br/><br/>People who like this abomination of cinema say that ""Amélie"" is sweet. I agree, it is sweet, so sickeningly sweet that it gave me a hysterical sugar rush and rotting teeth!<br/><br/>To address a point I made earlier, Audrey Tautou, who plays protagonist Amélie, scared me witless. I had previously seen her as Jesus's descendant in the highly underrated ""The Da Vinci Code."" In this film she gives the most unnerving stares I have seen in a movie in a long time. One of the last scenes of the movie features her lying in bed with someone, staring at the ceiling with a vacant look and popping eyes. Tautou wasn't bad in the role but her constant wide-eyed stares were genuinely creepy. Just look at the poster for ""Amélie"" online, don't deny that it freaked you out!<br/><br/>My experience with Foreign Language Films is limited to non-existent so I am not accustomed to following a movie with only subtitles to guide me. Occasionally I do turn subtitles on if I'm watching a DVD with poor sound but I still have a basic idea of what the characters are saying. Here however, I found the plot of ""Amélie"" extremely hard to follow, either because it bounces around like a decapitated chicken or because reading the subtitles from start-to-finish yanked me out of the narrative!<br/><br/>I should probably mention some of the ""characters"" in ""Amélie"", they're fine. There's Mr Bubble Wrap Stalker, Mrs Hypochondriac, Mr Mean, Mrs Sad and France's answer to Mr Glass from ""Unbreakable""; and there are some other people that I can't remember. My point is that none of the cast of supposedly colourful characters are memorable or note-worthy in any way. The acting isn't poor but there is nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>I think ""Amélie"" is supposed to be a Rom-Com, unfortunately (for the film that is), it failed as both a romantic story and a comedy. The romance between Amélie and Nino is dreadful because the audience hardly ever see the two characters on screen together so we have no investment in them. On the comedy side, aside from a mildly amusing gag following the international exploits of a gnome, none of the jokes made me laugh.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Amélie"" is a terrible, naval-gazing, arty-farty mess. With an incoherent plot and enough sugary eccentricities to induce vomit, this isn't a colourful work of art but a misjudged acid trip. I would rather shovel slurry than watch this again!"

Don Diego de la Vega could have risen to the challenge without donning his Zorro suit. I don't know when unlawful entry becomes burglary. None of the petty crimes she commits are ennobling or endearing. Amelie is a sad case, which makes the love story rather frightening.

","Amelie: 6/10: Sweet, light and sometimes a little irritating this strangely adult fable starts out very strong and sinks under the weight of it's too cute for words protagonist and her self made predicament. Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body. <br/><br/>Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime café) <br/><br/>It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little to long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it) <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in café.<br/><br/>It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose. <br/><br/>It is only in her pursuit of love that Amelie fails as both a person and a movie. Just like most twelve-year-old girls."
"vincentdesmidt","1","47","103","2 September 2008"," only movie that made me feel sick
","I watched this movie because it was a rainy day and i had nothing else to do, but God this is an awful movie. there was nothing funny, exciting,romantic or moving about it. the only reason why people think this is because of the music(which really worked on my nerves). I had to think some time about why I hate this movie so hard before it became clear to me, but this is my conclusion: The character of Amelie is so freaky,(she's a total freak)that if she would have existed nobody would want to be associated with her. Probably she would have been bullied so much in her youth that she would have psychic problems and probably be in some kind of setting for mental people(sorry if my English isn't correct). And there is no normal person who would fall in love with her,like happens in the movie. if it was a spastic thin ugly guy who never washes himself it should have been a little bit credible, but otherwise this is completely wrong. Happy feeling? I felt miserable, and angry because I had lost so many time on this movie. everything Amelie did ennoyed me, and the reactions of the people ennoyed me even more, they should have reacted like: WTF go away are you sick in the head or what? Conclusion: if she would have died a terrible death with nobody who cared about her at the and of the movie, it would have cheered me up. the only positive thing about this film is that it is spoken in french, nothing more ennoying than French people talking English in Paris. Another thing: why does she look Chineze? the family Poulin is just a bunch of marginal people who have no friends. and the way they react they are just little children who will never be able to get a good job and earn money. and if Amelie wanted to try to step out of this marginality, and start acting normal, then it would be a good movie, now it sucked, because it is much to unrealistic. I can continue this for hours but I don't want to loose more time on this ""thing""(dont want to use the word movie)but I Will stop here."
"leo_g86","9","15","28","13 February 2005"," An easily underestimated movie...
","I have loved this film for some years now and I never wrote a comment about this movie, today I have heard all kind of opinions about this film and I have heard what critics have to say about it. This film is loved by many people, but it is easily underestimated, specially by those who want films to give them deep philosophical lessons and impressive point of views of our society. A film doesn't need to be deep to be a masterpiece, if Amelie would try to be more deep than it already is it would ultimately become a worse movie, this movie is not about taking things seriously, this film is about giving people an experience, a pure cinematic experience and it does such a rare thing as having the vast maiority of people who went to see this in the theater leave the theater more happy than when they entered. It is such a powerful experience many couldn't stop smiling for a week walking around in the streets thinking about the film and looking like a fool! I am quite sure this has never happened in the same collective way to any other movie than Amelie......in movie history! That is why this film is unique, that is why this film changes the life of people like the tagline says. It is because it enters straight to the hearth of people and people begin to ask themselves about their own reality and why they can't feel the same way in our universe as in Amelie's universe. A film doesn't need deep messages about humanity to change the way we see life, love, humanity...<br/><br/>This is such a simple, universal film everyone can understand. The movie is perfect in every way and it is quite wonderful the way things worked out. Because I am quite sure the director alone couldn't make this movie, how good the direction might be I think there are 2 other factors almost as important, Audrey Tautou and Yann Tiersen. From the beginning Emily Watson was supposed to play Amelie, before she became pregnant. Watson is a great actress but never do I think it would have worked, mainly because Tautou IS Amelie in this movie and Amelie is FRENCH, Watson is not. The angelic Amelie has since become almost a symbol for France and tourists visits the cafe and makes Amelie tours around the city, the prize of the apartments in the neighborhood has sky-rocketed thanks to this movie! Yann Tiersen is also extremely important. <br/><br/>Originally Jeunet had someone else working for the movie, but one time he heard one of Yann Tiersen's songs in his car and fast he ran to buy all albums from Yann Tiersen and decided he should make the music for the film. Yann Tiersen had anyway only 15 days to make music for the film and said he didn't have time, Jeunet proposed he could include some of Yann's old songs into the movie and the result was 9 old and 9 new absolutely wonderful, heavenly beautiful tracks all completely perfect for this film. Nostalgic, happy, sad, energetic tracks who together with the cinematography set the right mood for the film.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie are the colors, always mixing between strong red and green colors which makes you feel you are in a world which only could exist in your dreams, the most beautiful ones you ever had. You could go on about everything which is perfect in this movie, the simple odd characters you so easily feel sympathy for and they are presented in a way only Jeunet could present a character. The odd Jeunet humor we have seen before in Delicatessen and City of the lost children, a humor which only exists in his universe. The simple plot is effective and right not to be more complicated than it needs to be and it has a beautiful message we don't often see in movies: generosity. There is also romance in this movie, but no relationship dramas, dialog, grand romantic scenes ala Titanic. No, this romantic trip is as beautiful and simple as our best memories about love and happiness.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie represents the best things about life, love and France. Yes, it is so french and it is so good in being french that you feel like you are french or at least wants to be sometimes when you are watching this film. Everything from Montmarte (a character in its own in the movie), Audrey Tautou to Yann Tiersen is so french, maybe I should add it is a beautiful, positive point of view of french culture without being idealistic (all people have many problems and no one has a perfect life), never becoming uninteresting or boring. I hope only those who have seen the film reads this, because I don't want people to get over-hyped about this movie, it is a simple beautiful movie with the ability to conquer the hearth of people, nothing more than that. That is why I waited long time to write about the film, I knew I couldn't stop myself from making this movie sound like the best film of all time. Because, it was the best film for me, but will it do the same for you? I hope it will, enjoy the movie!"

","It is very possible that I don't have the intellect or the ability to appreciate cinematic masterpieces.  However, free speech enables me to voice my less than enthuasitic endorsement of Jeunet's ""Amelie"".<br/><br/>Jenuet's ""Amelie"" is one of those feel-good movies that makes people dream into believing anything is possible.  Its very ""nice"" and a commendable deed indeed; however, Jenuet fails to deliver ... I would have much appreciated subtelty in depicting the everyday Parisians ... not an aggressive, preachy, in your face romanticism that seems to lack genuine warmth. <br/><br/>
I was not a huge fan of Jeunet's style - his love for hurried camerawork, frequent character zoomins and other visual imagery (the key in her pocket when she makes a duplicate) was distracting and served to just underline the lack of genuine warmth.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the movie is the obviously talented Audrey Tautou who plays the role of the outsider to the T.  Her understanding of the role prevents the movie from becoming another fuzzy role of a girl we root for as she changes the world.  <br/><br/>I am not a cynic - but I did get bored with the method employed by Jeunet. After a while, the movie just kept on dragging.  Tautou does a good job; and, I did like the colours used in each frame which gave the movie more life than it really had."

","This movie tries WAY too hard to be quirky and cute. The first ten minutes are pleasant enough, but dismay sets in when one realizes that the smirks are going to continue for almost two hours more. Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the reviews this film has received. But - people - there is no content here, only style. And the style gets old very quickly. I'm a great fan of romantic comedies, but Amelie doesn't even fit that genre well. The few plot twists (for example, the traveling gnome) are not set up well, leaving the viewer wondering what is going on, rather than being a participant in a delicious secret. Romantic comedy should involve several intertwining plots, which the viewer is aware of but the characters are not, with the plot 'intersections' generating sparks that can be both anticipated and savored by the audience. 'Sliding Doors', which I happened to see shortly after 'Amelie', was so superior in this respect that I cannot understand the higher regard in which the latter seems to be held. 'Amelie' is strictly linear; there are side-stories, but they involve no surprises and they have absolutely no impact on the main story. (I suppose the resolution of the traveling gnome mystery and the nature of the repeating photo-booth customer could be regarded as minor surprises, but they were revealed in a strictly linear way, and had no impact on the main story line). Rated at 5, and only that high because it's technically well done, and Audrey Tautou is indeed cute."

","This movie I watched for a few minutes and well, the unexpected plot, cartoon type characters, I was sort of caught off guard. From the start I found the Amelie character, in some ways criminal. Even her devious look on the cover shot I wonder, maybe she would have worked in a Bugs Bunny cartoon as the girlfriend of Wile E. Coyote. Not to be malicious just this movie was so odd. It seems so many people like this movie and for the life of me I cannot understand why. People I've read who like the movie there is a strange correlation to hash usage. To me this makes me wonder if I should stat smoking hash. Well the state I live in has very strict laws and guess that is not a viable option."

"tedg","Null","13","26","27 July 2002"," Life, A User's Manual
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I avoided this film for ever-so-long because of what I had heard about it. One would believe that this is a well-photographed simple sweet story. That somehow it has something to do with the adventures of a sweet girl-woman. Well, it is. But it is so much else, and that `something else' not only makes the sickly sweetness tolerable -- it completely undermines it. That's because every film rests on three threads that connect between it and us the viewers. The first thread is the story, which many people -- even filmmakers -- would have you believe is either all there is or at least that it is paramount. The second thread -- more visceral and immediate -- is the cinematic presentation. This filmmaker has wisely chosen to make the visual space coincide with the fondly imagined nostalgia of a simple past. All is simple, clean, abstract, sweet. Even Paris, whose primary products are dog poop and meanspirited grafitti.<br/><br/>But that third thread is the most important -- even more powerful, perhaps because of its subliminal nature. And it is here that this film is rooted, and the rooting is superb, intelligent.<br/><br/>That root is George Perec, probably France's most influential writer. Not the most known or best loved, he directly approached a problem of the French character: that they were once an important people artistically. How does one be creative in a land populated by dead, giant saints? You build metastructures of the structures already there -- you build stories about stories. The component stories can be as trite as the public demands, but the assembly -- the structure of which eludes the casual viewer -- can be as clever as you wish.<br/><br/>In 1978, Perec published a large book called `Life, a User's Manual.' It is a wonderful work which every literately educated person should encounter. It answers the question `what can a writer do after Robbes-Grille?' (which is roughly the same question as what can a French filmmaker do after the `new wave?') This film is very closely based on that book in both form and content.<br/><br/>The book is a collection of several hundred stories, many of the type `at this precise moment, Jacques was removing sand from his toenails (the location of the beach perhaps being a setting for the previous story) and recalling the sand on the photographs he took of his honeymoon in Chartres where Jeanette first saw his feet and said she fell in love with them alone...' All these stories are triggered or anchored in some physical detail, like a box left by a child in the wall, or a torn photograph on the floor of a train station., or a lamp in the form a character.  Most of these stories involve unnecessary losses, small decisions of great consequence or attempts to represent and/or assemble the other stories in a personal context.<br/><br/>The book's central organizing device was an apartment building in the same location in Paris as the film. There are so many characters and stories that the book provides diagrams.<br/><br/>Elements from the book in the movie (as I recall): images that are torn and reassembled, a painter painting the same scene over and over, a found child's treasurebox, a simpleminded son, a `glass man,' images from all over the world, a funhouse, a fine meal disguised. Minor mysteries solved (the image is of a repairman), characters who are recorders (the jealous boyfriend with his tape, the painter with his VCR, the maintainer of the photobooths, the stewardess who photographs the gnome) characters who create reality (the girl who imagines both reality and films on the TeeVee, the man who is the `designated mourner' for reconstructed images, the painter who is reinventing Amelie).<br/><br/>The wind caused two glasses to dance; the important thing here is the wind, not the glasses. If you have not seen this, please do. But see the story as deliberately facile and trite, intended to only be pieces that should be assembled by you to make a real picture. Anyone who thinks this is a just a sweet story should have their license to view films revoked.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

","OK, everyone seemed so impressed with this film that I decided to check it out.  Then after reflecting on the absolute blubbering and swooning that most people did about this film I decided to register with IMDB and just see if there might be anyone in agreement with me?  Sure the film making is wonderful.  Sure it's sort of non-banal escapism.  Sure it's ""not like anything else seen before,"" but it seems that what almost everyone reviewing this film is enamored is the ""cute factor"" and ignoring what is screamingly obvious.  The lead character, is apparently a cute, little stalker of a girl, with a plucky, yet dogged tenacity, and a sheepish grin.  Sure, no one is murdered in a particularly heinous fashion, and the musical score never once makes you bristle and feel like what she is doing is out of line, but take Audrey Tautou out of the lead and give it to someone like oh say, Roseanne Barr-Arnold, and the tenor of the film gets really dark really quickly. Or just reverse the sexes of the lead actors in the film for that matter.  It's seems odd to me that the newest criminal blight DE jour is stalking, (and not just the headline grabbing celebrity stalking,) and everyone is up in arms if an ex-lover, romantic, ""admirer"", or frequent passerby (stalker by today's standards) so much as breathes out of line in regards to their said ""target"" and they are immediately banished to the fringes of society or locked away.  But put a happy little face on it and some devilishly cute eyes and perhaps some long sexy legs and everyone is ready to forgive her stalking actions and attribute it to delightful eccentricity and / or whimsy.  This movie is definitely a mixed message. In the present political climate, it's best to take heed of what messages you take in and not to take them at face value but to look deeper and see what the real message is.  The screamingly apparent message of this movie is that if you are cute and sprite-ful, you can be a stalker, win the target of your obsession, and get away with it.  And the funniest thing is, everyone seems to have ignored the fact that that is THE major theme in this film, and because of the stylistic film making, they have just fallen head over heels in love with it and completely ignored the face value substance of the film. If stalking is cute, change the laws in your state."

","The first few minutes of the film leave you wondering where on earth it's going, but be patient, it's all worth it. Amelie is a real feel-good film, though not in the stereotypical Hollywood style. Its full of mystery, humour, and moments that make you think 'I wish I'd thought of that!' - for example, the way she sends Nico on a wild-goose-chase in the park at the Montmartre carousel. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie, a simple girl on the surface but with astonishing inventiveness, bewildering all around her.<br/><br/>As a director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a unique style. He seems to make great use of colour - some would say to unnecessary extremes, but for me it gives the film a sunshiny feel, whatever the weather in the film. He also likes to zoom about with his camera's, but again this all adds to the way the film completely draws you into its own world, just as Amelie draws Nico into her world without them actually really meeting. A few nice special effects top it off, and there are a few little details that you probably won't see the first couple of times you watch it.<br/><br/>I'm no film expert, but I loved this film, its my favourite of all time (so far, anyway), and I'm in danger of wearing out my DVD. There are some people who don't see what all the fuss is about: for them it's too sickly-sweet, or they see Amelie as a meddler or nosy-parker, but I think they've just somehow missed the essence of the film, poor things ;) Don't read too many detailed reviews before watching it, or you could spoil the surprises.

","This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it. <br/><br/>Amalie (Audrey Tautou) has the demeanor of a spoiled little girl who grew up thinking she was ever so cute. She seems to be saying, ""Look at me, can you resist me?"" And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, ""You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?"" Ugh.<br/><br/>But the thing that really bugs me about this movie is Amelie's conceit. She presumes to know what will make others happy and meddles in their lives. Among the things this adorable girl does is break and enter an apartment to do mean things to its owner's possessions, send false letters, short out people's TV's at peak moments, lie to people about who loves them, make anonymous phone calls without having the integrity to speak with the callee, and steal one of her father's prize possessions.<br/><br/>I know that we are supposed to accept the fantasy nature of this film where photos talk, statues wink, and people always answer public phones, but my patience for this kind of thing wore thin very fast. We are told, shown actually, that Amelie's mother was killed by a suicidal person jumping off of Notre Dame and landing on her. How are are we supposed to react to that? Is it supposed to be funny? Wasn't to me.<br/><br/>Then there is the agonizing game that Amelie plays with the guy she falls for. She gives him hints and, given the opportunity to make contact, shies away. You just want to shake her and tell her to just talk to the guy for heaven's sake. Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex. What kind of message is that? <br/><br/>The whole movie is filmed through some kind of orange filter that I suppose is meant to cast some sort of romantic candle-lit effect over the proceedings, but for me it was just one more barrier that prevented me from getting close to this movie."

It may be original, it may be French, it may even have been nominated for five Oscars, but at least for me, that does not mean it has to be any good. In fact, I found it extremely annoying.

","When this movie first came out, I was still living in Paris, my home town. There was a lot of positive buzz about the movie. As French critiques are usually not tender, I was expecting to see something great. I must say I was disappointed. Point taken, the movie is really pretty and cute, and happily creative. But I was expecting some more depth to it, as any REALLY good comedy should have. The problem with this movie is that it embraces an overly rosy, advertisement-like view of life. There is no question that it succeeds in this exercise, but you get out of there with the numbness of an empty mind.<br/><br/>The aesthetics of the movie is very close to what I consider to be one of the best commercials EVER, namely the 1993 CNP (a French insurance company) TV commercial by Lars von Trier (yes, the one!). That commercial represented a little boy first carrying his violin, then growing older, marrying, having kids, and the next generation, and so on. All the people in the commercial are very happy and the grain and the light and the colors of the movie are strikingly close to those used in Amelie. Also the very alert pace of the action (no time to get bored!) is common between the CNP commercial and Amelie.<br/><br/>Now, why is this comparison a critique for Amelie? As I have said, I consider that commercial to be really wonderful, but AS a commercial. I have no criticism against a commercial being really sleek and cute and happily creative. But a good movie cannot stop there! So if you see Amelie, as I see it, i.e. as a sophisticated version of a commercial, promoting Paris, the happy life and so on, you cannot possibly give it the highest value as a cinematographic work of art. It deserves at most a 7 out of 10."
"dbdumonteil","1","25","58","8 August 2002"," she didn't and she won't change my life
","This movie is at number 14 in the top 250. It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002. All around the world, Amélie Poulain elated millions of people. The question I ask myself is this one: why did this film make millions of people so happy? I saw it last year at the cinema; it's not that I didn't like it, it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly. A naive girl whose name is Amélie Poulain discovers what her destiny is: make people happy. She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man (Mathieu Kassovitz). I think it's a lacklustre and dull film. The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot. The main thema of the movie, which is for Amélie to make people happy, is more sketched out than really explored. Moreover, the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing. Above all, several sides of the film didn't please me, especially its humor. The movie wants to be funny but according to me, the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe. There is something that I don't like in the Amélie Poulain's character; I think she is dope, a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second!!!). Besides, the actors aren't very great. I mean that they aren't very well defined. We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them, their tastes or hates are only tics (like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer). On the other hand, some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie, I think about Amélie's father who loves his garden gnome, or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting ""le déjeuner des canotiers"". To sum up: Amélie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves."

My problem with this one?  1) No plot 2) what's with this chick who goes wandering around in strangers' houses seeking revenge (foot cream in the toothpaste, and what not)?  What grounds does she have to get in to these houses?  3) she's chasing after some guy -- gets him to the coffeehouse to meet her -- and then the idiot sits and plays coy.  Won't strike up a conversation, or anything.  How stupid is that?  He comes to the door of her apartment, yet she just sits at the door; won't open it.  Stupid women irritate me, and she is one of the stupidest.  4) I couldn't care less about any of the characters, either; just as there was no plot development, there was no character development either.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you want to see a GOOD French film, see a classic like ""Jules et Jim"" or ""Cousin, Cousine""."

I don't really know what the other ingredient of the mixture is, but it is annoying. <br/><br/>I must say, ""Amelie"" was one of the most unexpected disappointments in my life as a cinemaphile.<br/><br/>I love French cinema in general (as opposed to Hollywood films - even the most acclaimed ones have at least one corny moment that makes me cringe). And the basic premise of this film was so much to my taste that I couldn't wait to see it. <br/><br/>And sure enough: the photography and the overall cinematic ""style"" are gorgeous; so is the sense of humour of the first 30 minutes or so.<br/><br/>But then, halfway through the film, ""Amelie"" simply lost me.

(No offence intended - please!) If this film made someone look at their life in a different light - good for them!

"ColeSear","6","8","15","31 January 2003"," Great to a point, but slips (Spoilers)
","Unlike Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Cité de enfants perdu which never has a period, or moment of greatness, Amélie manages to be great and wonderfully inventive for about the first half hour until Bretodeau gets his box back. After that it's as if we've watched the origin story of a super hero and then watch her go about her daily routine (changing from Clark Kent to Superman, so to speak). The film then hits a structural snag, whereas, now Amelie has satisfied the desire of one man she goes off and tries to help everyone almost at once and we are told of these incidents simultaneously. The film had its greatest grip on me when we were focused on one story, there would've been nothing wrong with vignettes after all it was good enough for Truffaut in Small Change. 	Amelie begins wonderfully, with voice-over narration of her early life which the French seem to be masters at, the best example of voice-over being in Leolo a Quebecois film. Her childhood full of its strange events come across as hilarious whereas other cultures might have botched them making them distasteful, the death of her mother being a perfect example. The quirky humor is about the only thing that never leaves the film from the ticket taker who now punches holes in plants, the stuffed dog, the traveling gnome etc. When Bredoteau finds his box we flashback to what memories those items held for him in what are truly beautiful moments of the film. This is my moment of highest involvement, that sequence was a pinnacle which the narrative never achieved again. 	Part of the problem is the predictability the film later runs into. I'm terrible at guessing the ends of movie but once we were introduced to Nino and told of his past I knew that he and Amelie would end up together. So obviously, it was nerve-wracking and annoying that she was so painfully shy and prolonged the movie unnecessarily. Then there's the almost American complication in the relationship between Georgette and the bar drunk by her talking to Nino were so uncalled for. Then we also have the ""Glass Man"" and Amelie pondering Renoir's painting. While in the beginning it's commenting on Amelie is subtle it becomes more and more overt as the film moves on. The there are Jeunet's shots of Amelie smiling to extract her cuteness for some affect and frankly she's not all that cute and the shots are inorganic which is even worse. The special effects also eventually become pedantic when the key in her pocket shines, it makes me wonder what kind of film this would've turned into if Jeunet had been given a Lucas-like amount of special effect allowances in the budget. 	The cinematography in this film is quite spectacular but in certain instances the effects downplay what they have been able to do with the camera. The change in structure of this film ultimately creates a domino effect. While I can't re-write the film I wonder if I would be nit-picking so much if there hadn't been such a shift in the way the story was told. In the end Amelie is an enjoyable experience that may just have indulged its premise a bit too much-6/10."

There was all this hype about a great, funny, quirky French film that was sweeping the nation, and so that's what I expected it to be. In reality, it was painfully formulaic in places and not nearly so delightfully quirky as, say for example, making your bed while listening to music from The Matrix. It was a let down, and not a particularly engaging movie. I would never, never watch it again."

A young woman sets out to fix the problems of others as a way of ignoring the fact that she herself is damaged. One of the most memorable aspects is the wondrous central performance of Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>The most remarkable fantasy of this movie is the Paris that Jean-Pierre Jeunet conjures up. It is supposed to be modern Paris, at the time of Princess Diana's death, but could be the Paris of 50 years before.

","To call Amelie the 'Best French Film Ever!' is not an infomed comment. Why? The movie is enjoyable certainly, but it is not revolutionary or even particularly original - bar the fabulous digital shots. The story is quite pedestrian and is similar to lots of other films, notably Pleasantville. The dialogues are often laborious and the acting is not outstanding. Sure Ms Tautou is beguiling - but as a performance it is nothing memorable - hence she lost out on the Cesar (French Oscar) to Emmanuelle Devos much more deserving performance in Sur Mes Levres.<br/><br/>The films many suporters at this time will no doubt be calling me a cynic and a nit picker - but someone has to. I liked the film but I am pointing out the films short comings merely because it is not being fairly criticised on this site - there are far to many cloying reviews that say little about the actual film.<br/><br/>In the end all this is going to work against Amelie.

"Alex 26","3","11","23","17 October 2001"," Another Overrated French Film
","There is no dispute of the inventiveness in some parts of the film; the strong cinematography and beautiful music scores but as usual with the director's previous efforts, Amelie is full of freaks who seem to live in another planet, French movieland.<br/><br/>The seemless half an hour of introduction is occassionally funny and downright weird most of the time, however, the movie starts to drag on after one hour and Amelie's journey to help others and find her own happiness seems like director's excuse to throw us with too many oddball characters and pointless subplots.<br/><br/>For example, at one point, the movie moves from the lead actor's(Mathieu Kassovitz) possible lateness for the date with Amelie in the cafe to being kidnapped by terrorists. Most people will find it hilarious and inventive but I think it's just another freakish and non-sensical idea of the French director. The initially sweet romance of Dominique Pinon with the waitress turning into wild sex in the toilet is tastelessly amusing and could have been edited out altogether. The part of Amelie teaching the mean grocer a lesson by messing up the house is like scenes taken out of a regular Hollywood trashy comedy.<br/><br/>
All these strange (notice how many times, the equivalents of ""weird"" are used here and in many critics' reviews) characters and subplots make the last half hour of Amelie like an eternity. Many times, I wish the movie could just finish off before 2 hours. Mind you I'm the sucker for 2 hours over drama.<br/><br/>This movie is a love it or hate it movie. For those looking for a fun ride and something different from mainstream cinema, Amelie may be a treat. For someone like me who have to care for the characters in order to indulge in the movie, Amelie is just a cold art fare.  My rating 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>

"JMartin-2","3","10","21","29 August 2001"," A bad sign for French cinema
","I've heard numerous people go on about how ""Amelie"" represents a ""revival of French cinema."" If this is true, then the future of French film looks a lot dimmer than even the most pessimistic Francophile could have guessed.<br/><br/>Like ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children,"" ""Amelie"" is a stunningly made film, with wonderful music and some awe-inspiring visuals. But this is supposed to be a narrative-driven film, and the film falls flat here.<br/><br/>The plot could basically be described as Jane Austen's ""Emma"" meets Dreyer's ""Gertrud"" meets a theme park ride, as a succession of episodes follows Amelie's search for true love, in the process helping others in their own quests, blah blah blah. If this doesn't sound like enough to maintain a 130-minute film, you're right, and even though the actors try their best, the movie runs out of tricks after just half-an-hour and plods along for the remainder in an entirely predictable pattern you've seen a million times in hackneyed Hollywood romances.<br/><br/>This pedestrian storyline takes place against a complete fantasy world with absolutely no resemblance to the ""real"" world, but unlike ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children,"" Jeunet tries to ground it somehow in reality, setting it in both a specific location (the Montmarte district of Paris) and at a specific time (1997, around the same time as Princess Di's death, which in Jeunet's Disneyfied Montmarte is the only world event of any significance). This renders the entire ""fairy tale"" approach (complete with wistful narrator) moot -- ""once upon a time"" has no meaning when the storyteller goes to such lengths to place his tale in an actual place and time.<br/><br/>So why the colorful, gussied-up, theme-park aesthetic that dominates the film? It appears that Jeunet simply does so for the purposes of nostalgia, to harken back to the ""gay Paree"" image that in all likelihood never existed and certainly doesn't today. Whereas the real Montmarte is heavily populated by impoverished immigrants, Jeunet's is as white as a Republican Party convention, and the one token minority character, an Arab, is as French as de Gaulle. Sanitation problems don't exist in this Montmarte, nor for that matter do fast-food restaurants, chain stores, or any other symbols of modern society. Even the beggars are happy and content. Intentionally or not, there is something quite reactionary about the world view Jeunet presents us with, and the occasional pseudo-documentary flourish doesn't change one jot the fact that nothing in the film is ""real.""<br/><br/>Jeunet has dismissed this criticism, saying that his film is not about the social problems of today but about the struggles and triumphs of ""the little guy."" How can you not like that? But in the real world, ""the little guys"" are impoverished, overwhelmingly non-white workers living in abject squalor, more concerned with where their next meal is coming from than with finding ""true love."" These people don't exist for Jeunet, so his smarmy claim of sticking up for those who can't stick up for themselves is a self-serving fraud.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""Ameile"" is a visually gorgeous film with some fine performances, all of which are negated by the insipid and unoriginal purposes they're used for. If Jeunet had the guts to take the premise and set it in something at least approximating the real world, this would've been an interesting stylistic experiment, along the lines of Godard's ""neo-realist musical"" ""A Woman Is a Woman."" But Jeunet (who despises both the directors of the nouvelle vague and the neo-realist movement) seems to have prostrated himself before commerical success, and in the process produced a work little better than the mega-budget, star-driven garbage pumped out on a routine basis by Hollywood. French cinema can do better than this."

Audrey Tautou is the main appeal in this film and I wonder if it would have reached the level of media attention it did with out her.

","I now know why I hadn't heard of the film ""Amelie"", before watching it in film studies, as it was rubbish. The film was based around a girl called Amelie, who discovers a box and tries to find the owner of it, this makes her feel the need to help others round her and along the way she discovers love. One main thing that was off putting was that the film is in French which means you have to read the subtitles, which is boring. I thought the film started off good but then became uninteresting and took to long. To understand and take in the film more you would have to watch it more than once as there is a lot of detail. The best feature of the film is the use of camera work and special affects, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, director of the film, has a great variety of shots which work well in the film. I would not recommend this film to many people, unless you have the patients to read subtitles."

"Red_Identity","Null","5","9","25 October 2011"," Couldn't finish it...
","Quirky films sometimes win me over... sometimes they don't. An example of colorful ""Quirkiness"" that won me over completely is the wonderful television series Pushing Daisies. That is what I would compare this film most with in its style and tone... and yet I didn't like it.<br/><br/>NOTE- I don't like reviewing films that I do not finish watching, but I only saw the first 50 minutes of this film. My Film Teacher played it for us on a big screen. I was very excited for it. When it began I was liking it... after 10 minutes I felt it was rubbing me the wrong way. After 20 minuets the story was mildly engaging and I wanted to see where it went... As it went on I kept wondering to myself if I should leave... I even watch the worst of films. I left because I just saw no indication of the film grabbing me. Yeah,I guess it's well-made for the filmmakers intentions, yet for all of its style it never amused me. The lead performance was very good, but the film as a whole felt too calculated. Hey, I love visual films, but the visuals in this one seemed to be too artificial to me. And again, I loved Pushing Daisies. Yet this film's plot and execution wasn't grabbing me and was making me a little bored, so I left. I don't plan on watching the rest of it any time soon, and I don't think I will ever like the film. I get what the filmmakers were trying to do, but I simply didn't find it appealing. Since I didn't finish it I don't want to give it a negative score, but quite simply, I don't see the fuss about this film. I give it a 5 as it stands now. Did I mention that the dialogue was just... dull? Not a bad film per say by the standards in which it was made, just a VERY uninteresting and dull one, even with all of its colors and visuals.<br/><br/>EDIT- So I decided to watch it in its entirety, mark the date December 9th, 2011. Why do I want to mark the date? Well, because I fell in love with it. This time, I wasn't surrounded by my obnoxious film class, and I really took it differently. I mean, I love Pushing Daiises, so I knew this was a film that would benefit from watching again, and this time as a whole. This time, I was hooked in it's storyline. <br/><br/>I also want to say that this opened my mind a little bit more. It's very difficult to do fantasy, romance, and comedy in the right way that it engages me enough. It's always been harder for films of this type for me to love than the usual, gritty, well-made thrillers or dramas. Which is why this stands out in my mind. The cinematography is amazing (as expected, as Delbonnel had the best cinematography of 2009 for Harry Potter 6), as is the art direction. I also noticed the colors. Yeah, it has very vivid colors, but the color saturation as whole had a very greenish sort of look to it, which i thought was unique in itself. The first half is faster-paced and different than the second, but both work completely. I love very few romance films, but the romance here is just so delightful. This is a film that leaves you happy as can be, and I am very glad i rewatched it."
"mydumbscreename","Null","5","9","27 January 2003"," STALKER!
","OK, everyone seemed so impressed with this film that I decided to check it out.  Then after reflecting on the absolute blubbering and swooning that most people did about this film I decided to register with IMDB and just see if there might be anyone in agreement with me?  Sure the film making is wonderful.  Sure it's sort of non-banal escapism.  Sure it's ""not like anything else seen before,"" but it seems that what almost everyone reviewing this film is enamored is the ""cute factor"" and ignoring what is screamingly obvious.  The lead character, is apparently a cute, little stalker of a girl, with a plucky, yet dogged tenacity, and a sheepish grin.  Sure, no one is murdered in a particularly heinous fashion, and the musical score never once makes you bristle and feel like what she is doing is out of line, but take Audrey Tautou out of the lead and give it to someone like oh say, Roseanne Barr-Arnold, and the tenor of the film gets really dark really quickly. Or just reverse the sexes of the lead actors in the film for that matter.  It's seems odd to me that the newest criminal blight de jour is stalking, (and not just the headline grabbing celebrity stalking,) and everyone is up in arms if an ex-lover, romantic, ""admirer"", or frequent passerby (stalker by today's standards) so much as breathes out of line in regards to their said ""target"" and they are immediately banished to the fringes of society or locked away.  But put a happy little face on it and some devilishly cute eyes and perhaps some long sexy legs and everyone is ready to forgive her stalking actions and attribute it to delightful eccentricity and / or whimsy.  This movie is definitely a mixed message. In the present political climate, it's best to take heed of what messages you take in and not to take them at face value but to look deeper and see what the real message is.  The screamingly apparent message of this movie is that if you are cute and sprite-ful, you can be a stalker, win the target of your obsession, and get away with it.  And the funniest thing is, everyone seems to have ignored the fact that that is THE major theme in this film, and because of the stylistic film making, they have just fallen head over heels in love with it and completely ignored the face value substance of the film. If stalking is cute, change the laws in your state."

It is very much in line with this directors other movies, tasteless and dark. With five unacceptable scenes in the first twelve minutes it makes for something of a record for me. The very very long narrative framework is boring and shows a distinct lack of imagination. The extremely rapid fire images are not breathtaking, they indicate an inability to focus, and a strong influence of music videos. If you like cardboard characters, gross bad taste, scenes flickering by like a moviola - typical of so many modern movies - you will like this. If you prefer slower movies with depth, stories, characterisation, you probably will not enjoy this one."

From here on it changes from a comedy into a romance.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet might have gotten away with the crazy plot if the main character wasn't so annoying.

I watched this movie on the recommendation of many others and cannot cipher why they would put me through such agony? I prefer movies with a bit more depth. I watch a variety of movies and can appreciate many different styles, but it seems like the director is trying to emulate older French directors like Godard, and fails miserably. Being different for the sake of being different never makes for good TV, and in this case a good movie.

","I hated everything that I'd seen by Jeunet to this point.  I thought that Delicatessen and City of Lost Children were that annoying kind of 'art' film that had more in common with music video than cinema, preferring eye popping visuals to genuine filmmaking.  And Alien Resurrection, his foray into Hollywood sellout was the lowest point in a series long past its sell by date.  <br/><br/>Amelie, when compared to these previous films, feels like a breath of fresh air.  Jeunet still prefers camera tricks to camera style, quick cuts to mise-en scene, and digital effects to photography.  And while the plot here shows quite a bit of invention, it relies far too much on its omniscient narrarator to inform us just how charming everyone and everything here is. But for the first time, Jeunet seems to want to put people in front of the camera instead of phantasmagoric setpeices.  The photography, when it is coherent, is often stunning.  The model here seems to be classic Hollywood musicals like Singing In the Rain, and Jeunet fills the screen with a stunning array of colors, and every shot simply sparkles.<br/><br/>Of course, I still find Jeunet's visual style rather oppressive and tiring. But this very style will probably recommend it to the college students who will make this a big hit for a few years.  And it's nowhere nearly as godawful and overwrought as Oliver Stone's similarly stylized Natural Born Killers, which is what all the pretentious kids were watching when I was in school."

Amélie as a character looks really obnoxious with that self-absorbed smirk plastered on her face, and her gamine hair style is hardly apt.

It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being.

","Figuring out who we are and how we fit into the world is a shared experience among all young adults. This film takes us on a journey as we follow Amélie, Audrey Tautou, as she is coming of age. Through short, fast, intense shots we see the world through the eyes of Amelie. She spends her days focused in on details and rarely takes a step back to see life as a whole but she comes to learn that this is no way to live.<br/><br/>The story begins with Amélie as little girl. Her father believes she has a heart defect and decides to home school her and keep her secluded. She is lonely and under the strict rule of her neurotic parents. Amélie retreats to her imagination and through creative cinematography and CGI we see the world just as six-year-old Amélie does. As if Amélie's life isn't tragic enough, she also witnesses the death of her mother and is then raised by her father.<br/><br/>After this fast-paced, detailed oriented, introduction we fast-forward to Amélie is a young adult living on her own. Any hope that the film will ever slow down is diminished. One evening, Amélie discovers a hidden box that was left by a little boy who used to live in her flat.<br/><br/>This starts a life-changing journey, that night she decides she will track down the owner of the box and if he is moved by the gesture she will continue to do random acts of kindness and meddle in people's lives. Alas, he is deeply moved by being reunited with his treasure and thus begins many adventures for Amélie.<br/><br/>All the while, however, she continues to be absorbed by life's details. She processes the world in little bits and is often removed from the real world into her imagination. She imagines a film produced about her life after her death she has become a famous figure known for her random acts of kindness but still dies alone. At this time she grows up even more and realizes she wants to find love.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is so fast it is often disorienting. While this unique cinematography is clever and helps us understand Amélie and her point of view, it is information overload and too much to absorb. Often, this leaves the viewer fatigued and uninterested in keeping up. It isn't until the end when Amélie has learned and grown that she, and the film, finally slow down and enjoy life."

For being a French quirky romance story, this is a decent accomplishment with a few memorable scenes and performances (the ongoing garden gnome joke made me laugh). But somewhere along the line, Amélie transgressed the line between being this low-key Parisian comedy and became widely praised as art all over the world -- something that I find simply cringeworthy. The ""Oh, it's French and about romance and it makes no sense! Therefore it must be magical and full of deeper meaning."" -attitude totally sickens me.<br/><br/>This film is so saccharine-sweet and cutesy that I find it is too much to take in one viewing. There is little or no magic in it, other than forced attempts to be whimsical which instead end up as desperately quirky. In short, Amélie is a romance story that tries too hard. Maybe I'm easy to please, but I find more romance in unlikely, simple everyday situations than cute-overload romance crammed into a picturesque Parisian café setting. It's too cliché.<br/><br/>4/10"

","This is one of those movies that everyone says is so great, so you watch it, and then either you are captivated by the fact that this movie is one of the most incredible films on earth (as shown by the #17 ranking in the top films of all time) or you have a mind for yourself and come to realize that this is just an OK movie that happens to be a French production, and people think it's so amazing due to the fact that most other French movies are... well... bad.  <br/><br/>This movie throws in many unusual details, and I do admit that they are amusing, but they have nothing to do with the storyline and in turn are useless, only to add to the zany nature of this film.  Take away that factor and you have a movie about 90 minutes long that would fall into the ""chick flick"" section of anyone's book, soon to be forgotten.<br/><br/>I cannot say that this review will have spoilers, because you will figure out the entire (relevant) plot in less than 20 minutes of the opening act.<br/><br/>BUT THERE ARE ""SPOILERS"" FROM HERE ON:<br/><br/>It's about a French girl, who's odd, that fairly accidentally goes on a ""quest"" to make people's lives better.  This is only shown about 3 times in the movie, which happens within the half-hour of her decision to be a good samaratin.  From then on, she goes on a chase to find this guy that, for some reason, she thinks will be her true love.  After finding him and reeling him in, she keeps avoiding him and then reeling him back in for the last half hour of the movie.  By the end, you find yourself very upset (G-rated version of my emotion) at Amelie and you think ""Just talk to him already"" more of annoyance than romantic desperation. <br/><br/>
In the end, a quick climax/ending sequence occurs, and the movie is over. ""Why is this movie so special,"" I thought to myself?  Then I realized the answer.<br/><br/>""This movie is foreign.  Idiots out there love foreign stuff.  Since it's not terrible, they will think it's excellent.""<br/><br/>And having seen my thought come to life, I submit this review.  See the movie, sure.

"aw-komon-2","1","12","31","19 December 2001"," ""THERE IS NO HELL, THERE'S ONLY FRANCE.""
","Frank Zappa had it just about right with that above quote, and if you're not laughing you've obviously never been to the REAL France (and stepped in some of the ever-present dog-doo on the sidewalks over there, or dealt with some of the  'rude, snobbish & bizarrely hostile behavior' that seems as natural as breathing air to more than a few people over there), or had blinders on when you did go there, inspired by the FANTASY Paris of charming little virtuoso films like ""Amelie.""<br/><br/>Now, in all fairness to the film, it does contain some very intense and hilarious satire in its first half (though of the much-too-exaggerated 'over-the-top' semi-fantasy kind) & is obviously the work of a CINEMATIC virtuoso (which does not imply Jeunet is an ARTISTIC virtuoso also, it only means the guy is a complete master of the TECHNICAL possibilities of the medium), but the splitting of the film between satire & irreverence on the one hand & the most cliched of schmaltzified romances on the other, seriously hurts the film's effectiveness as a possibly DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT piece of ART-ifact. It starts off majestically & ends up as CHARMING-SATIRE-MINUS-FLUFF, unlike ""THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"" by the Coen Brothers, which starts off majestically dark & ends an awe-inspiring confirmation of the maxim behind every great 'realist' film: Pascal's famous ""Man's greatness is so obvious it can even be deduced from his wretchedness."" Now, I mention the Coens' film because it is the only film I've seen this year with CINEMATOGRAPHY (courtesy of Mr. Roger Deakins) matching or maybe even surpassing the INSANELY MAGNIFICENT level of the one in display in shot after shot in ""Amelie"" by BRUNO DELBONNEL. I was truly knocked out of my seat by the unerring beauty of the angles used & the antique-look-contrasting-with-modern colors within the shots. I also mention the Coens, because Jeunet is making films now that are sort of ""Raising-Arizonaish"" in their comic-book-imposed-on-reality extravagant, comic style, but will hopefully achieve the maturity of the Coens, in his deeper outlook to turn out something like ""The Man Who Wasn't There.""<br/><br/>
Getting down to more specifics, ""Amelie"" reminded me of Louis Malle's classic 1960 film ""Zazie Dans Le Metro,"" which also is split down the middle, magnificent for the first half, BORING & cliched in the second. However, Catherine Demongeot (who, bizarrely enough, Nabokov once said would've been the PERFECT LOLITA had he been allowed to pick one young enough to add the proper amount of repulsion to Kubrick's film) in ""Zazie"" is a 10 year old girl, & much less interesting to red-blooded heterosexual hairy-chested men (such as yours truly) than the supercute, 'BIG SHOED' (above as we;; as below), starlet of Jeunet's film: Audrey Tautou. On one level, the film is a love affair between Jeunet's camera & Tautou, in the time honored tradtion of Sternberg/Dietrich, Powell/Kerr, Hitchcock/Hedren, Godard/Karina, De Palma/Nancy Allen, etc., the angles he uses, the way he frames her, the endless close-ups, all of these things are the work of an artist in love with his subject (whether there's a 'love relatonship' in 'real life' is beside the point), and all the audience is thankful for it.<br/><br/>
On another level (again reminding me of ""Zazie""), the film takes you on quite a TURBOCHARGED, non-cliched 'tour' of picturesque areas of Paris, & is maybe the best advertising the old 'city of Romance' has had for years. It takes the eyes & sensibilities of masters like Jeunet & Delbonnel to get these shots with just the proper amount of irreverence incoroporated (by what they choose to show and omit), & then ruin them by overplaying sappy annoying accordion music for way too long towards the latter, weaker third of the flick.<br/><br/>All in all, 3 out of 5 stars or a 7 on a scale of 10, which means DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED, but like another technically dazzling, relatively popular French film before it Patrice Leconte's ""The Girl on the Bridge,"" a little too short on substance and TRUE ROMANCE (as opposed to the cliched, NON-EXISTENT kind displayed in the film; check out Renoir's ""Picnic on the Grass"" or Jacques Becker's ""Antoine et Antoinette"" if you want to see a similarly whimsical, semi-fantasy film nevertheless displaying the EXISTENT KIND OF 'ROMANCE' IN INNER SENSIBILITY if not in actual, same-story realistic possibility) to give the 'HELL OF FRANCE' its proper artistic due, and in consequence become as great as let's say Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player."" And did I mention that a sizeable portion of the film is, among other things, a dead-on satire of Hitchcock's overrated classic ""Rear Window""?"

","If any friend of mine ever asked me to recommend a film as an introduction to world, or 'foreign' cinema, I always went for this glorious Gallic romantic fantasy.<br/><br/>Not only is the storytelling intelligent and engaging, the artistic design is crammed full of fascinating detail, brilliantly stylised in bold colours and full of directorial flourishes.<br/><br/>To my mind, Audrey Tautou is absolutely perfect, not just as her cheeky impish match-making and good Samaritan but as also as an advert for a modern Femme du Paris. The whole project might as well have been co- produced by Tourism France as it covers what us foreigners feel we think Paris IS but in a modernised and fresh way. Nothing overtly quaint but still employing the best bits of what makes France individual, elegant and great.<br/><br/>Re-watching the DVD after some seven years I found the whole escapade still refreshing, uplifting but not in a sugar-coated way and dazzling in its effects, which I'm sure were pioneering back almost ten years ago, when it was made. The final freedom-on-a-moped escapade is absolutely and wonderfully youthful and brilliantly done. <br/><br/>What, though I feel is one of the film's strongest points is how every age group is not only represented but championed and integrated and that every character has enough 'stuff' so that not only do we care for each of them but also the whole community in which they live and thrive, as a whole. That is a major achievement. That 'Amelie' is still in IMDb's top 50, as voted by us, must make it a classic."

Amélie is an adult comedy, probably not a movie to watch with the children. <br/><br/>Not only did this film surprise me upon first viewing, but Amélie has officially become my favorite movie of all time. I cannot get enough of this charming, extraordinary film. Even after watching this film again for the first time in years, I'd watch it again and again.

"tina-lilith","10","5","10","10 September 2006"," Postmodern approach to the Postmodern life
","Anyone interested in film/literature theories would approve of this French director's view, that life is mostly composed of haphazard events and insignificant incidents. ""Amelie"" is brilliant as a film, since it dives into that aspect of life which is regularly overlooked but always pivotal: details. How people's destinies are decided by funny accidents; moreover, how the narrator of the film spies and comments on everything makes us constantly aware of the fictionality of the film. This film is a great fictional work which is ridiculously honest about its fictionality, yet feels so real... maybe exactly because of this modest yet genius approach. This is definitely a creative outlook and a refined one which suits the postmodern era we're living in."

What is good about the film is its originality, the method of filming, the lighting effects, the background music and certain items of the script.<br/><br/>What is bad is its length - the plot doesn't justify 2h10 of film. The whole thing could have easily been locked into 90 minute stint. The other thing is that Paris as portrayed in the film does not really exist as such - it is far more violent, dirty and crowded than the film would suggest.<br/><br/>The film has to be taken as a fairy tale in an imaginary city and in no way connected to present-day reality. But it will no doubt nourish the illusions of foreigners to Paris about the city !<br/><br/>Too much hype has been created over the film - true it is a visual feast and the use of dominant yellow tones ( like Oh Brother ) and a great deal of wind lend a special atmosphere but the plot is overstretched.<br/><br/>Without doubt, the same plot shot by Americans would have had far better results.

"montecristo42","7","6","13","21 February 2007"," Overrated
","Don't get me wrong--I enjoyed this movie. It was cute but a little too cute, it was funny but a little too silly, and it was moving but a little too melodramatic.<br/><br/>I don't get the incredibly high rating here and elsewhere. I believe that this film currently sits in the Top 35 on the IMDb Top 250 movies list, and I'm baffled. I LIKED this film, but I didn't love it. Here's why.<br/><br/>It's gimmicky. Yes, gimmicky is bad. Voice-over narration, considered by many to be a poor technique, made sense in this film, because it had that fairy tale/fantasy feel to it. However, the narrator discussing the random likes/dislikes of the characters was just a cheap gimmick. Showing us scenes of a fly beating its wings and telling how many times it can beat its wings, telling us about how two wine glasses danced unseen on a table--all of this was just too much of a gimmick for me, akin to artistic masturbation. Sure, you CAN do these things. But that doesn't mean you SHOULD. When a movie has to point things out like this and essentially force them down your throat with a voice-over narrator, it's a cop-out. Lazy writing. Try showing us what you want us to see without telling us and beating us over the head with them.<br/><br/>I like quirky films. But the level of quirkiness in this movie gets too out of control for me. While I understand that there is purposely less a sense of reality in this film than in others, the characters became a bit cartoonish, some altogether detached from reality. Again, overquirkiness smacks of a gimmick. A cheap ploy to get people to like your movie.<br/><br/>As I said, I enjoyed the film. It was original, and its theme refreshing in this day and age. But I don't quite think it rises to the level of one of the greatest films ever made. As always, take my comment with a grain of salt--I do not speak French so had to watch it with subtitles. I'm sure there could be something more than words lost in the translation. Perhaps I would have been less aware of the movie being a fake story if I hadn't had to read subtitles to understand what was happening. But then again, I was able to enjoy Apocalypto."

She visits her dad, who is still quirky. She has little or no interest in sex or in her peers - other than in a childish sort of outsider-looking-in way. She is a gamine, an imp, and has innocent hopes toward sainthood. For heaven's sake, she does not even carry a purse, a bag, or anything as she scampers through Paris; that is how light she is.

","Although this film is not terrible, what I did not like about it was that this was clearly a copy of an earlier film, Benny & Joon from 1993. And a shameless one I might add. I like the other movie better. If you have watched it it is so obvious that this one is trying to copy everything, but at the same time trying to hide it. That is quite upsetting. I don't know why many people do not seem to notice this. Maybe the earlier film is pretty unknown, but I can tell you, it is much better. It is just fresh in a way this one isn't. Maybe it is not such a bad idea to revise old ideas and to recycle old movies, but only when you really have something to say and to add to the story. Not this way.

"Stampsfightclub","9","4","8","13 November 2006"," Outstanding direction in an average romantic drama
","possible spoilers, may not be significant..<br/><br/>The narrative:.<br/><br/>Is fairly consistent but is often confusing and many scenes are unnecessary. I followed the story with the French subtitles and it seemed like the film was trying to be a love story of wanting and thinking about life, but the majority of the time felt uncomfortable into the genre. The acting is average. Tautou (The Da Vinci code) is engaging and presents a stereotypical view of someone missing something in life. Her character falls well into the story. However the story is always interesting. Audiences are thrust deep within Amelie's mind to introduce her thoughts and feelings. The narration by the narrator is engaging and is very simplistic. Overdone but still an interesting technique. 'This ishe likes' When the film states 'this was the day her life changed forever' I was expecting something huge when it turned out to be pretty much insignificant, it wasn't as spectacular as I assumed it would be. Regardless the mystery behind the whole plot is enough to keep audiences hooked. The film was nominated for 5 Oscars and deserved the nominations for direction and cinematography which were outstanding throughout. Many stories are encoded, and different issues but personally I couldn't really follow the film because it tried to do too much at once, perhaps after a few watches then it might be fantastic.<br/><br/>The direction.<br/><br/>The editing, camera angles and shots are outstanding in this drama. Amelie often has flashbacks or visions and the direction is breathtaking. Sometimes the film is sped up extraordinarily fast to capture a fast shocking scene where as some scenes are slowed right down to capture the different moods of the characters. There is one particular shot I found outstanding which was when Amelie was standing alone at a train station. The camera is in a bird's eye view position and is looking at length towards the central protagonist which gives such a deep meaningful sense of loneliness, a fantastic moment I the film.<br/><br/>watch it if...you like different camera shots, paced scenes and a possibley predictable love story.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin tells the story of Amélie Poulain, a girl who had a strange childhood. She didn't get any affection from her father except when he gave her a medical examination, her mother was a neurotic teacher who tutored her own daughter at home. As a child Amélie decided that she would isolate herself from the world until she was old enough to leave home forever.<br/><br/>When she's old enough to go she moves to Paris where she works in a café in Montmartre. When Princess Diana dies, she accidentally discovers a little box that has been hidden in her house for 40 years. She decides to bring it back to the rightful owner, to make him happy. If he's happy with it, she'll dedicate her life to make other people feel good. If not, she'll continue her life the way she is living it now. <br/><br/>I don't think I've seen many movies that were as touching and funny in the same time as this one. I certainly can't think of one right now. It has some kind of innocence which you'll probably only find in fairy tales. I guess that's the best way to describe this movie: a fairy tale for adults. It is not only a beautiful movie because of the cinematography, it is also beautiful because of the message it gives to the audience. It shows that the beautiful things in life can be found in small details and that you'll have to grab every chance you get to find happiness. <br/><br/>The acting, the story, the way everything was filmed... This movie is just perfect in every way. It shows that not only Hollywood knows how to make a movie. As this movie shows us, European cinema can be at least as good, even better. 10/10 is the only appropriate score if you ask me. Don't hesitate to watch it."

","Spoiler warning...<br/><br/>Films, the best films, tend to use three rules as a frame.<br/><br/>1.  The relationship between the film and the audience.  This can be as simple as ""breaking the fourth wall"" or making a social commentary, usually the more subtle or outlandish the better.  This is why 'Wizards' sits higher on my list of films than 'MASH'.<br/><br/>2.  The relationship between different ingredients (plot elements, photography, sound, etc.)  'Catch-22', 'Moulin Rouge!', and 'Eraserhead' are good examples.<br/><br/>3.  The existence of the world outside what's onscreen.  'Lola Rennt' and 'Fight Club' understood this real well.<br/><br/>This film takes the rules and puts them in a new context; not the war film, or the action film, or the comedy, but the romance.  In other words, ignore the plot.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet sits higher on my directors list than, say, mind-numbing stylists like Tony Scott.  Even 'Alien 4' is interesting when understood in the right context.  Jeunet operates by taking a story frame and expanding on it.  Not with plot, but with visuals.  Look at when Amelie is photographing the clouds.  How would Spielberg have handled that?<br/><br/>Spielberg, Howard, Zwick, and Bay are all action men.  They pride themselves on ""doing things"": telling stories.  Jeunet operates by observing.  He is Amelie watching the bar patrons squabble amongst themselves.  This observer philosophy is carried on in the movie by Amelie talking to us about going to the movies and watching other people's reactions (I do that at the theatre, it helps enrich the experience)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jeunet has his eye on other things (literally).  He and David Fincher are probably the two biggest users of what I now call the ""New Color"" method.  Dozens of films have copied it whether they're the 'Matrix' films or 'Lord of the Rings', even 'Hellboy'.  What else makes this unique and/or interesting for our culture?<br/><br/>--The ""screw Princess Di"" motif.  Who should waste their time caring for ""celebs"" anyway?<br/><br/>--Yet another brick in the wall for the glorious American evil known as the MPAA.  Consider, this was ""R"" while the empty, toxic 'Fast and Furious' was given a kiddie-friendly rating.  What's next?  Jerry Springer gets a ""G""? This is also another nice slap in the face to Cannes (especially now that redneck Michael Moore won).<br/><br/>--The gliding camera contrasting with the James Stewart-style voyeur.  Here we have the mixing of styles.  The glider is Jeunet's vision in action.  The voyeur is stagnant, much like the ""men of action"" I mentioned earlier.  How ironic...<br/><br/>--Notice how we are invested in the lives of others besides Amelie, both important to the story and not.  Just examine how the suicide jumper is revealed.  That's the world for you...<br/><br/>--The audio philosophy this time is 'Delicatessen' meets 'Eraserhead'.  The best of 2001 in my book.<br/><br/>All this film needed was more exposure, since we Americans are deprived of foreign film thanks to Hollywood, to be a complete classic.  Now, due to French relations, that may never happen.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."

Being an International cinephile, french cinema has been one of the hardest for me to get into, the whole language is not good on my ears, it has no tone, taste or modulation in it. The sounds of the language are so dry and uninteresting that it's hard to stand for a non-speaker of the language. I guess here in the movie maybe the difficulty maybe because they employ too much of a local dialect in the movies.<br/><br/>Back to this, the protagonist here is one of the worst in world cinema.

"Nairnzee","5","5","11","4 March 2004"," Long winded Romance, but with excellent technical aspects
","Director: Jean - Pierre Jeunet Amelie: Audrey Tautou Nino: Mathieu Kassovitz<br/><br/>
Amelie directed by Jean - Pierre Jeunet, is a movie catered for selected film fans. It is a romance/drama/comedy genre film, which stars Audrey Tautou as the shy Amelie. Hailed as the French version of `Looking for Alabrandi' this film tells the tale of the introvert Amelie and the life she has lead from childbirth.<br/><br/>After the very long-winded introduction we are final introduced to the main character and her family. After growing up and moving out of her house, she finds a box of old toys hidden in her apartment. She then proceeds to find the owner of the box. When the owner receives the box, the look of happiness on his face inspires Amelie to continue to try and bring a little bit of happiness into other peoples life.<br/><br/>This movie involves a-bit of imagination as in the story line. This girl Amelie now on a personal high involves herself in any-person's life to try and improve their mood. In my opinion this girl should be worried more about her life than of those of her neighbours and friends. Then<br/><br/>We are brought into the seemingly never-ending romance that drags on and on throughout the movie, until finally we reach the happy ending.<br/><br/>Even though the story line a bit unique, the director still uses many great shots throughout the move. The unbelievable shot of Amelie skipping stones on the river is simply brilliant and is only one of many as further shots of equal talent flow throughout the flick. It is also a foreign film set in France, so be prepared for the waves of sub tittles.<br/><br/>Good use of special effects with mention to the unique shot of Amelie turning into a puddle of water on the floor, invoking the feeling of that it wouldn't of matter if she was there or not.<br/><br/>Overall I give the movie 5/10, it is a movie depending on the viewer. I believe it is an ideal DVD on a cold night with a loved one, but as for seeing it at the movies, I would rather keep my money."

Now, I'm a sucker for romance and ""quirkiness"", and, yes, even cute, but this went way over the top. It reminded me of a commercial which desperately pushes every possible emotional button so that you will like it, but you just see right through it, change the channel, and decide you will never buy the product because of that commercial. Now imagine such a commercial going on for almost two hours, and you have this movie. Too bad because the lead actress was beautiful and had a lot of charm, the photography was great, some parts of it did work pretty well, and the concept had had a lot of potential.<br/><br/>I had rented the dvd, and didn't bother with the extras on the second disc, because enough was enough."

","Amelie was a beautiful movie with a quirky storyline. I saw the movie on recommendation from my father when he told me that the main character reminded him of Audrey Hepburn. He was correct; there is something sweet and innocent about Amelie that makes you like her on a level greater than the plotline, something wrapped in the details. I enjoyed that her hobby was cracking the hard, carmelized shell of creme brulee.<br/><br/>Then why give the movie only a 6? Like Amelie's character, there is something unexplainable about the movie as a whole, and that something put me to sleep in the theatre. In fact, that same something put me to sleep in two other movies by Jean-Pierre Jeunet -- Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children. Many of the characters have interesting personalities, but the interest stops there. The characters do not feel real, and I cannot be drawn into the movie. If you want to see Audrey Hepburn, I recommend the real thing, but if you want to see an average movie that will fade from you in time, I recommend Amelie. Just don't forget the caffeine."

She decides to help those around her and, along the way, discovers love."" There was a little more gratuitous nudity and sex scenes in the film than I cared for. I feel like most of these could be left out without missing anything in the movie. In spite of this, the movie was an exciting visual tale of a playful, yet extremely philosophical young woman named Amelie. Amelie spends a lot of time trying to help those around her and then scientifically trying to figure out how it all works together. In the process, she discovers something she can't figure-she can only feel. She finds love. Much of the writer seemed to make commentary about the world and how everything doesn't always amount to a black and white explanation, but instead there are so many grey areas that should be embraced for what they are and lived without being figured out. Much of the story of Amelie is about making human connection and that in the end love trumps all. The dialogue is all French with subtitles, so be prepared to read, but the story and writing are both good so it's not taxing. The acting was good, especially on Audrey Tautou's part. She really made this movie along with the artistic components. The art direction, editing, and directing are the trifecta that made this story twice as interesting. The cinematography and lighting were handled by Bruno Delbonnel who also worked on things like Across the Universe, Big Eyes, and Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.

","It is undeniable that Amelie radiates positive energy. It is one of the few movies that I smile feeling happy while watching.
The movie centers on Amelie, with a few subplots, all revolving around the theme of love and happiness. Amelie has a good heart; she cares for people's feelings and proactively helps them without their awareness. Amelie can love, and when she does, she tries her best to get the response she seeks. The plot is thus simple and easy to follow, with no twist and little suspense.
What captivates the audience is the feel-good vibe felt throughout the whole movie. This is achieved by excellent cinematography, good music, and a superb performance by Audrey Tautou. It is impossible to ignore the lovely way Amelie behaves herself, and it is quite hard to capture all her charm in words. My humble description stays at her cute look, her happy little smiles when seeing others' happiness, and her adorable uncertainty facing the love of her life.

At times the antics are a little dull and the movie prods a bit, about an asexual French girl (believe that one?) who wants to help people and finds love in the process. Amusing moments, decent script, some nice production, the film begins with a girl who is raised alone and lonely, away from other schoolchildren, and as a result enjoys her solitude although she is fascinated by the world around her. She learns to love helping others and does so in creative ways, sometimes straining credibility. Designed to pull on the heart strings, it does so somewhat effectively.

Amelie is a sneaky girl who devotes her life to helping others once she discovers one man's long-lost boyhood treasures in her flat, but after helping so many, she soon finds herself falling for a man, whom she cannot muster the courage to confront without using one of her mysterious tactics.<br/><br/>The music was light-hearted throughout the film and placed very well in the scenes. The best thing about the film has to be its actors and scenery. With so many complex characters, the potential to turn the neighborhood into a highly-functioning mental ward runs high, but who can blame them with a girl like Amelie running around causing so many positive coincidences?

","Amélie (Original French title: Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain aka The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain) is a romantic comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre. It tells the story of a shy waitress, played by Audrey Tautou, who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. The film was an International co-production between companies in France and Germany.<br/><br/>Amélie Poulain is a young woman who had grown up isolated from other children. After the death of her mother and her father's subsequent withdrawal, she developed an unusually active imagination to ward away the feelings of loneliness. Now at the age of twenty-three, Amélie is a waitress at Café des 2 Moulins, a small café in Montmartre that is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. Having spurned romantic relationships following a few disappointing efforts, she finds contentment in simple pleasures and letting her imagination roam free. She is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette, a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph, an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau, sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel, an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino, a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris.<br/><br/>The feel-good Amelie is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.The sunniest face and the greatest acclaim belong to Tautou, who is new to these shores. A delight in the title role, she's like a young Audrey Hepburn, making us laugh and feel empathy without feeling manipulated.Finally,Jeunet's film is an ambitious, rich, and rewarding experience, packed end-to-end with delightful creativity."

","Not many movies can make me look at the world an entirely different way after watching it. Amelie is one of those.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a young French waitress named Amelie (hence the title) who, after an incident involving Princess Diana, a bathroom tile and a perfume bottle cap, decides to enrich the lives of those around her.<br/><br/>The result is a hilarious and wonderful story as Amelie (brilliantly portrayed by Audrey Tautou, who made me an instant fan of hers) continues to make the lives of her colleagues and friends happier.<br/><br/>However, she becomes so busy doing this that she forgets about her own happiness. She falls in love with a strange young man called Nino, and plays small games to catch his attention, but always ends up backing out just when she has the chance to finally confront him.<br/><br/>With beautiful cinematography and an Oscar-worthy screenplay which was cruelly stolen by Gosford Park, Amelie is a must-see... as soon as you can! You will not regret watching this, and you will walk away with a big, cheesy grin on your face for the next week.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This film is loved by so many (for those of you who are nay-saying) because it is a perfect metaphor of the lives of so many. The fact that Amelie herself is so painfully shy and unsure is modeled by the lives of so many. She is strange, and we all are strange. She has her little ways, we all have our little ways. I feel there are so many little things in this movie that are overlooked by some: these overlookers, I feel, are those people who rush about their lives with too much to do and never get the chance to take time to enjoy the small things in life, like dipping your hand into a sack of grain. These people obviously don't have the time to fully enjoy such a timeless masterpiece that Amelie is. Amelie is in many ways a coming-of-age. While she is technically grown-up, she is really young. It takes time for her to learn that it is OK to love someone. That it is OK to show emotion. This is coming from a girl who had never been shown emotion. And that in itself is a precious gift. <br/><br/>Anyways, to those of you who have booed this film, put a smile on your face and take time to appreciate life!"

","I can't agree that this is the ""most charming movie ever made,"" but it is one of the most beautiful. If you watch it, pay attention to the photography. Nearly every frame is a watercolor painting come to life, even the most mundane scenes. <br/><br/>Take, for instance, the snippet where Amelie encounters the man playing the record player in the subway. Look at the colors, and how even the buttons on the man's coat echoes the peas in the painting behind him. Look, too, at the colors in the concierge's apartment and in the park -- everywhere! It is a feast for the eyes!<br/><br/>The colors and compositions are astounding, which is a good thing because I found the characters and plot somewhat empty. It's all very cute and all, with Amelie going around trying to ""fix"" up people's lives, but it drags on way too long and ultimately ends on a rather meaningless note.<br/><br/>

","(contains spoilers)<br/><br/>As a sometimes fan of French cinema I really wanted to like this film. However, I was very disappointed at the awful mess of a movie that I was confronted with. Underneath it's over-indulgent, sickly sweet stomach turning topping, lay a deeply ambiguous film. Amelie's meddling with other people's lives was perhaps the most disturbing part of the film. For example, when she constructs a letter from a character's dead husband we are meant to see this as a good act. However, this is a terribly cruel thing to do to someone, and if the falsity of this letter became apparent, it would destroy this woman for a second time. Which brings us to the question: is it better to believe a consoling lie or a difficult truth? We should be free to make such a decision for ourselves, but Amelie in effect takes this decision away from the woman.<br/><br/>Amelie's punishment of another character in the film is also difficult to swallow. Why should she take it upon herself to punish other people, where is her authority?<br/><br/>The film also suffers from a plethora of frankly unnecessary visual effects, which diminish the story still further.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Terrible, terrible, terrible film.<br/><br/>1/10 (It gets a 1 for the great soundtrack)."

","If you've ever done something good for someone else just for the fun of it, then you can easily relate to Amèlie, the main character in Amèlie. She's innocent, naïve, and shy. But she finds an old box of `treasures' hidden in her flat and decides to return it to the boy who left it there fifty years ago. The `boy' is Bretodeau (Maurice Bénichou), and Amèlie (Audrey Tautou) decides that if Bretodeau is glad, then she will continue to do good deeds for those around her. He is ecstatic, so Amèlie keeps her end of the deal.<br/><br/>Amèlie is sweetly touching, but goes for the low-key effect and really does feel like a foreign film. A lot of times, I forget during the course and it seems like the actors are saying the subtitled English words. Not this time. I'm thinking of Run Lola Run in specific. That seemed to be a quality American film (haha, right?).<br/><br/>Amèlie decides to return a photo album to Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz). She completes her deed but ends up falling in love (surprise surprise). When Amèlie was delivering the album to Nino (and other times), I was surprised on how complex her schemes were. She didn't explode with talent like that throughout the film, so it surprised me.<br/><br/>Tautou is very good as Amèlie, I love her smile. She displayed emotions very well. Kassovitz was also fabulous; people like that need to get more work that comes out here in the U.S. Everyone else involved in the picture is very gifted (including Rufus, who plays Amèlie's father) and talented. Pictures like this don't come out very often.<br/><br/>Movies like Amèlie are sure to be crowd-pleasers. Which it is. Its crowd-pleasing attitude was taken with a little arrogance, but it still managed to keep a goofy smile on your face for 122 minutes. Speaking of the runtime, I found it very hard to sit through, for some reason. I enjoyed all of it, but seemed unnecessary. If one of the subplots about Amèlie's escapades were taken out, it would have been better.<br/><br/>It also had a good amount of humor. I loved the beginning, when we learn about Amèlie's childhood, and we learn what everyone's likes and dislikes were. It seemed ridiculous yet true. Some of the humor, and the whole movie, faltered during the last hour-the rather quick pace of the first hour slowed down a lot and brought down my experience of the film.<br/><br/>Amèlie is a gentle yet entertaining non-Hollywood film that's a sure crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for sexual situations."

","Along with Moulin rouge! this movie ranks as the ultimately worst godawful piece of excrement ever to be stuffed down the throats of the movie-going public in the history of cinema world-wide. A climactically self-worshipping egotrip of - on one side - the francophone movie industry along with its regional audience, and - on the other side - the world's self-declared and -adoring art, culture and fashion societies, and the sympathisers of any or all of the above.<br/><br/>After 30 minutes of watching this film I felt an increasingly imposing need to get a lobotomy, or at the very least drive a stake through both my eyes and ears to put an end to this artsy-fartsy torture session. The movie is shot in an awfully colorful and contrasting palette which makes it look like a 2-hour soapflake commercial. The story is told in such a typically hectic manner, after a while you stop caring whether it is making sense or (more likely) not.<br/><br/>Recently with the masterpieces ""Vidocq"" and ""Le Pacte des loups"", french cinema had grown a lot to my liking. After Amélie however, someone will have to hold a gun to my head before I will even consider a french movie altogether.<br/><br/>One thing is true. ""She'll change your life"".

","Jean-Pierre Jeunet has the reputation of making very special movies as: Delicatessen (1991) or Alien:The Resurrection (1997). Here, I got the impression that he learned a lot of Truffaut and Godard and he was certainly terribly influenced by them. He took the most commercial parts of their movies and made than a mixture of his own. After all he is a Frenchman.  The over-sentimentality of this movie functions as an escape-goat for the terrible life in our big cities nowadays. Traffic-jams, noise, violence on the streets, loneliness, poverty of the clandestine immigrants living at night and giving a sense of insecurity to the towns. Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a girl that never could survive by the way she acts and interferes with the lives of other people. She lives in an artificial surrounding with resemblance of the Paris of the 1950's where everybody knew each other and when there was still a certain family-life.

I couldn't agree more, but I think he understated time by a factor of 5 or so.<br/><br/>Love and romance certainly comes into the picture as a main motif candidate, but in my opinion too late to make a difference.

","Delicatessen is a masterpiece of overwhelming imagination breathless originality and excellent humor. I love that movie for its beauty and for its characters which track me back in childhood. The first difference between apes and humans, if good´o´darwin was right and we are indeed relatives of the primates, is nothing else than imagination. I will always take my hat off in front of a creative soul and i will always worship guys who can find the proper esthetical path for their imagination. This is why i love the city of the lost children. But somehow jeunet´s conversion to light is maybe not so inspired. Of course i was seduced by all those simptomps of a grate imagination and by all those small details á la tex avery, i was amused by most of the characters and i am far from saying that i am disappointet by jeunet (as i could say about his co-national besson, but this is not the right place for that), i still fancy his studied images and his fetishism for color, but this movie gives me somehow the impresion that a highly spirited guy is trying to express himself in a language he is not quite proficient in. He is making compromises and uses supportive structures to make a message go through. The most annoying of them, i will be the devil´s advocate, is the way amelie looks in the camera, hence at us, whenever she has an idea or somehow wants to make an appeal to our comprehensive capabilities, like those extremely annoying conversation-lovers who do not waste any opportunity to act with two fingers from both of their hands, somewhere at the level of the ears, nobing with the head in the same time, all this just to express more or less, undoubtfully, that they are just using quotation marks."

","Considering that there are a bazillion reviews for this film already, I really don't think it's that important that I do an in-depth review of this film. It is already well in the top 100 films on IMDb, so it's obviously a very good film.<br/><br/>Instead of the usual view of the film, I'll talk about it from a psychological perspective. Amélie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an Avoidant Personality. This means that she's so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from them--particularly anyone who could become intimate. In other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperation--hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. So, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help others--but always at a distance and anonymously. Most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strange--but ultimately very helpful and kind. In one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passive-aggressive actions. Fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also Avoidant (his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others)...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?! <br/><br/>Aside from the psychological aspects of the film, I really appreciated the look of the film. The odd 1930s style of Amélie's clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors (with lots of sepia tones), the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks (such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life) all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget.<br/><br/>Overall, a delight. Oddly, however, despite the very high rating, I think that Audrey Tautou mas made better films, such as HE LOVES ME...HE LOVES ME NOT and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT."

"Travis69","1","10","34","15 October 2003"," Amelie review
","Amelie is a sweet film with a rather peculiar sexual subtext. There's no question that Amelie is artsy (perhaps a blatant stereotype to French Film), but that's ideal in that the main lead is an artist herself. Like many artists, a very wry and roguish Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is severed from much of the social, more intimate world she's been craving since conception. Motherless for most of her life and brought up to be isolated-due to an impending `heart problem'-Amelie constructed a magical sense to help others; but as many know it is sometimes much easier to help others than helping yourself. Not with the cameos in Amelie, however. Each one is profoundly characteristic, interconnecting their lonely features with Amelie's center ideal. Many of them are a tough catch. Amelie consoles their intriguing mishaps but can she venture solely for the companionship and closeness she craves?<br/><br/>	The narration provided through the introduction and conclusion is well suited at following Amelie's audacious upbringing, yet may drag on a tad too lengthy. This may be a good thing when wanting to seek out the perks of character development and `magical realism' we miss when perching our eyes at the bottom of the screen the first time around. For our benefit Amelie, the film and its protagonist (an ever antagonizing one at that), are beautiful. It's not hard to lose sight of some of the film's teeming quirkiness when setting into those life-size eyes. And without looking too Christmassy, the cinematography's yellow, green and red saturation is unlike any movie previous. <br/><br/>Jeunet isn't overly weighty in conveying Amelie's idealism. The recurrent pans and character zooms are shot to hurried precision-making sure this imaginative Paris world is ever-moving. It's in Jeanet's mechanical distortions, such as talking lamps, animated cats, and extremely `personal' pictures, nonetheless, that allow us to figure the pleasingly coy, synthetic mystique of Amelie on our own. <br/><br/>4.5/5 stars"

","At the time of this writing, this film is ranked on IMDb as the 31st greatest film ever made. This is a sad under-ranking. This film is not only the greatest movie ever made, it shouldn't have to compete with such films as the Lord of the Rings, which will be forgotten 10 years from now. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has painted a timeless classic for the modern era.<br/><br/>The plot is simplistic: a girl with a vivid imagination sets out to better the lives of those around her, and seeks true love. The twists come in the form of numerous asides, where we see flashes from other people's lives. While these branches and untapped subplots are unrelated, they serve as a reinforcement reminding us of Amelie's healthy imagination.<br/><br/>The acting is all wonderful, as the film has a comic element that is very French. I do not know if Americans could have made this. While watching the way the characters interact with each other, I was reminded of my younger days in college, reading Beaumarchais' ""The Marriage of Figaro"". French literature has a rich history of comic genius (from at least the days of Voltaire's ""Candide"" if not sooner) and this film translates that energy from page to screen. At the same time, there is a serious existentialist tilt to this: how do we, as insignificant people, affect the world? This point is accentuated more by the fact that Amelie stands alone in the world despite being surrounded by so many people -- much like the girl in Renoir's painting (more on this shortly).<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is particularly charming, in an alluringly beautiful way, but also innocently childlike in her grace and style. While more Americans probably know her today as the woman from ""The DaVinci Code"", this will always remain her best film (be that a blessing or a curse). One cannot help but like the character of Amelie -- she quite simply is flawless in her imperfect humanity.<br/><br/>The directing? Amazing! Angles, lighting and most of all colors (every color is pushed to the max as if the whole universal was designed by Crayola) are used to make a surreal and inviting world, where even death seems welcome and fun. The few characters who die do not do so in a way that makes us upset or sad, although the timing and manner is most tragic. The greens are the most vibrant, I think... even permeating into the other colors. But rather than blur things with its leaking, it only makes them more fluid and lifelike.<br/><br/>And even the subplots are fascinating: Amelie toys with a prospective lover, sends a garden gnome on a trip around the world, searches for a mystery man in red shoes, defends a young imbecile, makes unsuspecting patrons fall in love and helps a sheltered painter find the vision of Renoir.<br/><br/>The painter (known as Raymond Dufayel or The Glass Man and played by Serge Merlin) is a crucial central character. He is somewhat of a Sisyphean being, trying over and over again to complete the same task without fully succeeding. But he is also a mentor like Socrates (encouraging the youth to stand up against society) and a surrogate father figure. While Amelie has a father, their relationship is very spartan and business-like; her real interaction comes from Dufayel who guides her in metaphors and allusions.<br/><br/>This film also manages to do something very difficult -- make the obscene benign. While the film does have a sexual element and some off-color jokes (one pornographic and another about abortion), we never feel the film has an adult quality to it. Everything seems innocent and pure -- even in the middle of the adult toy store. That must be a very difficult thing to capture as I know of no other film which has done so.<br/><br/>I will lay my reputation on the line and say this is the most perfect film ever created by human hands. From beginning to end this film speaks a subtle truth, and shows us that everyone has good points and bad points, flaws and great attributes. I know of no other film that treats its characters as both epic and unbearably human. And this is why ""Amelie"" stands out."

","Nothing - neither the hideous-looking trailer, not the favourable reviews, nor the unfavourable reviews, nor Jeunet's past work, nor Jeunet's expressed opinions, nor what I knew of the subject matter - gave me any reason to believe that ""Amélie"" would be anything other than two hours of torture.  It turned out to be a pleasant, pretty damned good movie.  It's certainly better than ""City of Lost Children"" (if not ""Delicatessen"").  Without the contribution of Jeunet's former co-director (and inspired production designer) Marc Caro, it doesn't LOOK nearly as good as it ought: too many sets and effects are merely digital (the single worst digital effect: at one point, when Amélie is excited, we pan down to a revolting X-ray image of her beating heart), only a third of the cutaway gags have anything going for them, and every single shot has an unattractive yellow colour cast - doubtless an attempt to capture the warmth of old Technicolor prints, but all it does the film look sallow.  Still, the charm is real.<br/><br/>In its way.  Most of the time Amélie is a lovable neurotic, but Audrey Tatou has but to look at the camera - or even GLANCE for a moment in the rough direction of the camera - and the character instantly becomes arch and knowing and insufferable.  It's as if she knows she's in a film starring herself.  Amélie (like most of the others) is only worth knowing so long as we can think to ourselves, ""My god, she's really like that""; the moment we suspect she's putting it on, she's lost us.<br/><br/>Those who think this is one of the best movies ever made (or the best French movie of the past decade, or some such) can't be getting out much: it's a sweet trifle, no more, no less.  What surprises me is that nine out of ten of those who loathe the film, no less than those that adore it, do so for the wrong reasons.  Amélie's little schemes are NOT the work of an angel: they're not motivated by altruism, most cause at roughly as much misery as they do happiness, one comes to a bad end and another of them was just plain nasty.  That's the POINT.  The film's mostly happy ending is meant to come across like the happy ending to ""Emma"" - good fortune rather than good management, and more than the heroine deserved.<br/><br/>About the ""McDonalds"" criticism: Yes, no doubt the real Montmarte has McDonalds outlets in it.  That's no reason at all to put such things in the movie.  They don't make Montmarte any better and they wouldn't make the movie any better.  This is an important point.  When we find ourselves tolerating the presence of McDonalds outlets even in our fantasies, the battle against them will have been lost: what we have trained ourselves to tolerate in fantasy we cannot help but tolerate in real life."

","I scarcely even know where to begin.<br/><br/>Amelie finds Bretodeau and immediately hands over his long forgotten box of childhood relics. No, wait. That's not what happened! Instead, she decides to take the chance that he will stop to answer her call to a public payphone. Brilliant. ""You don't understand, she's shy."" Not too shy to come right up to the front door and ring the bell of the first person she hopes is Bretodeau, and to ask that gentleman to his face if he is Dominique Bretodeau. And not too shy to approach numerous people in her search for the guy. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>Amelie successfully hooks up Joseph with Georgette (through typically implausible means I should add), but despite the fact that they just banged the crap out of each other in the bathroom, they suddenly start acting like their old suspicious selves again! It makes no sense.<br/><br/>Instead of just handing Nino's photo album back to him, Amelie devises an elaborate scheme to return it (because, you know, she's shy). She has him come to a designated spot at a designated time. But instead of simply handing the album over at said spot, she calls the payphone there, instructing Nino to follow the blue arrows she apparently spray painted (!) on the public sidewalks, which lead him to someone Amelie apparently hired (despite all that shyness) to be a human statue, who points to a coin-operated viewer, which reveals Amelie returning the album to the bag on Nino's motorbike. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>""Again, you don't understand. Her upbringing turned her into a shy introvert."" Right, right...not too shy to walk into a porno shop. Not too shy to sneak into people's homes to tamper with their belongings! It makes no sense.<br/><br/>But here's the real kicker: Nino quite obviously notices and even interacts with Amelie at least twice when she passes him in the metro station. He knows who she is, at least by appearance. He is quite familiar with her face. Furthermore, he knows that's her riding through the funhouse! He looks right at her! When he climbs down onto her car, he looks straight into her face! So it makes absolutely no sense that he suddenly appears to not recognize her later at the cafe. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>Oh, and Amelie: congrats! You nabbed a psycho who spends his days crawling around on train station floors and collecting photographs of strangers when he's not feeling up carnival riders in a skull mask or working at the porno shop! But I'm sure he's fine. He's familiar with proverbs.<br/><br/>It makes no sense.<br/><br/>5/10"

","After reading so many of the rhapsodic love-story reviews for this flick (this does not deserve to be called a movie) on IMDb, I decided to give it a try, and I tried to like it. Unfortunately I had to force myself to finish the movie and ultimately I regretted every second of time I spent watching this cute but naive girl and the rest of the unbearably annoying cast.<br/><br/>Amélie sets out to change other peoples' lives, and some, if not most of her methods are questionable and would only work in a fictional setting.<br/><br/>Throughout the story we are shown her fantasies that, as far as I could tell, were supposed to be somehow unusual or bizarre, but just felt childish to me; of course, that is almost certainly intentional since she was not really given a chance to ""grow up."" Unfortunately, in the end, the whole series of events felt forced."

The main difference is that Amelie is-----ORIGINAL (and has lots of ROM & COM.) The ""star"" performer here is Audrey Tautou...who looks like she comes from another planet. She has bucket-fulls of sex appeal...and an unbelievable mischievousness that makes us love her. The cinematography here is exquisite, the use of colour very imaginative. Tatou is completely convincing as the girl who is ""away with the fairies"" in the nicest possible way. This is a piece of cinematic magic. It has to be revered, and it has to be appreciated......Simply Brilliant"
"classicsoncall","8","3","7","23 October 2011"," ""Follow the blue arrows...""
","Due to a sheltered home life and a misguided father who believed his daughter to have a heart defect, title character Amelie (Audrey Tautou) grows up lacking self confidence and an inability to express her true feelings. However she can work magic in other people's lives by doing anonymous good deeds on their behalf, and the joy she receives by these acts are an inspiration to her. What Amelie needs is a guardian angel of her own, and that's provided by the wisdom of Raymond Dufayel, the Glass Man (Serge Merlin), who has painted the same picture over and over again for two decades. He just can't get the face of one of his characters quite right, because he's attempting to capture a fulfilled and happy Amelie, and she's just not cooperating, though not for lack of trying.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a warm and joyful film, and the performance of Tautou as the main character is charming and graceful. I rather enjoyed the subtle twist provided by the early mention of how the death of Princess Diana changed the life of Amelie forever. But it's not what one expects. Her discovery of a former tenant's collection of childhood mementos leads her on a mission to reunite him with his lost treasure. Seeing his reaction has a profound effect on Amelie, and sets her on a mission that brings happiness and joy to friends and co-workers.<br/><br/>But what of Amelie herself - does she not deserve some happiness of her own? The film takes some clever turns on it's way to fulfilling Amelie's quest. The picture works I think, because so many people find themselves relating to her character, anxious on the one hand to make a move, and afraid to do so because of possible rejection. One never knows unless that risk is taken, and as Amelie shows, the risk is often worth the effort."

I've seen this movie more times than I can count and each time I do, I see something new to love. This is the only movie that I was determined to buy both the movie DVD and the soundtrack CD. I must have played and replayed the scene where Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is skipping stones while Yann Tiersen's hauntingly beautiful Comptine D'un Autre Ete: L'apres Midi plays in the background countless times as well. The first time I heard it was the first time that I realized that modern classical composers are just as good or better than those that are only revered in death.

It has become a habit of mine whenever you feel like low, depressed or anything for any cause..just watch this gem flick. I guarantee your full mood swing!!<br/><br/>1st of all, its detailing...yes, that makes the wonder. when first watched, one usually tends to its story & all..but at the 2nd,3rd viewing you can watch closely to the other detail. here, every detail of it makes this film very special.. being introvert, Amelie's each habit, her feeling for small tiny thing, & obviously her each strategy for all kind of her work is shown by flawless detailing. not only that, each person of the hotel where Amelie works, her father, her love interest(the awkward man & his photo capturing) even the glass man's work has been given same importance.<br/><br/>Also unusual starting & ending dialogue makes this film that desired effect. & there comes the visualization of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet for making this film such a beautiful experience....hands down. Remember the scene where Amelie starts to apprehend the reason why her man dint come at right time?? The 2nd reason where her imagination of incident travels throughout the whole world including afghan, Tajikistan etc & ultimately becoming a mujaheddin...ohh what kind of imagination one needs to think like that?? <br/><br/>2nd, the cinematography..I don't have to give any proof... academy authority gave that.(though it dint win!..well that's luck).... we get to see the whole world & Paris through the eyes & fantasy of Amelie...this film brings the life to the world of Amelie through the colors, excellent camera-work & some appropriate special effect.<br/><br/>3rd, the acting, no doubt Audrey Totou has been greatly applauded fr her acting in this film..... as a sweet innocent, childish girl, i cant imagine anyone but her can do justice to this role... I have no problem to confess that I almost fall in love when I first saw it.... but not only Audrey, the whole cast manages to make the most out of it such that each comes alive as much as Amelie.<br/><br/>4th, the aspect i was affected most from it- the music.....I dunno how many times I have listened to the background score since the first time...& it never gets old at all!!... my love for Amelie grows through that.. seriously the background score uplifts the film into a totally new level..without it I don't think the story telling would be that much effective.... each music is appropriate & relevant for each used portion.... just listen to this amazing score...it will last in your mind as long as the movie does..may be more..I m sure.<br/><br/>Some of you can tell that it is unrealistic film...sure it is..but the movie is not aimed for being practical... it is the feel-good movie of all time.. being very childish & imaginative young girl as Amelie, this is the exact fantasy movie which will be lasting in my heart long time...few movies affected me like that... it can make you real happy & that is the charm of this MASTERPIECE!!..........."
"rodrigogarlop","10","3","7","31 May 2011"," 10 years of Amélie
","May 31, 2011. It has been ten years since ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" was first screened in France. Being such imaginative work of writer-director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children), Amélie has become one of the most iconic films of contemporary French cinema, an obligatory reference to the magical atmosphere of Paris. The film is presented with a beautiful and dynamic visual approach (great camera work by Bruno Delbonnel and meticulous editing), reaffirming Audrey Tatou's character's French identity with an amusing score for piano and accordion by Yann Tiersen.<br/><br/>Following an optimistic and innocent-spirited script, the film follows life of Amélie, a girl who finds satisfaction in helping others without realizing that it is she who needs it the most. While the film could be described as a French romantic comedy, it is also a gorgeous depiction of Paris, its people, music, cafés, metro stations, parks, etc, a representation that gets it right by not showing the overused and worn-out emblematic views of the city.<br/><br/>At first glance, the plot is simple yet pleasantly naive, woven like a fantasy tale guided by an omniscient narrator. It does retain a logical order and proves complex. Though it is sometimes predictable, it is much entertaining. The characters, as in other films by Jeunet, are mostly eccentric and evolve throughout the film, often through small but curious and optimistic mundane stories, developed in parallel to that of Amelie.<br/><br/>Bruno Delbonnel's camera flies freely through scenarios, shooting well structured scenes that recall beautifully drawn pictures or artistic photographs with balanced composition and color. This unique visual work has characterized the work of Delbonnel with Jeunet, probably only bested by ""A Very Long Engagement"". The colors were digitally enhanced for an added charm to the already attractive world if Amélie, intentionally highlighting green and red hues that characterize the films palette. Blue items are often found on each environment, symbolically representing protagonist's mood.<br/><br/>Acting may seem somewhat exaggerated if no background is provided. However, they bring life to the eclectic collection of exotic characters who populate the world of Amélie (and for that matter, that of Jeunet), specially Dominique Pinon, who has collaborated on a recurring basis with the director. Audrey Tatou manages to build a believable character: a naturally naive, tender and warm-hearted girl who cares about others but is utterly alone.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by musician and composer Yann Tiersen is one of the film's greatest features. It reaffirms its French roots with melodic tunes, partly cheerful or nostalgic which have by now become classic movies themes (Valse d'Amelie, Le Moulin), composed for accordion, piano, violin and xylophone, along with other instruments. The musical selection includes songs from previous albums by Tiersen as well as some specifically composed for the film.<br/><br/>The film was well received by most critics (mostly European) who called it ""positive and inspiring"", ""visually beautiful"" but received little attention by the audience during commercial distribution outside of France, which may be explained by issues with distribution and publicity. Nonetheless, it received a total of 102 nominations from several competitions worldwide, winning 51 prizes.<br/><br/>The film reached a broader audience after its VHS and DVD release, earning a well-deserved cult movie status after a few years. May 2011's Blu-ray release commemorates its tenth anniversary (the American version seems like the best to me, having DTSMasterAudio and 1080). Additionally, the film will be screened once more a some theaters in France for those fortunate enough who can see this beautiful film the way it should be seen."

Whimsical, eccentric comedy with a romantic current, directed in a lickety-split manner by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Guillaume Laurant. The film's wizened cognizance of daily human behavior may strike some as precious (or perhaps as a stunt), yet Jeunet's attentive eyes and ears provide for some rapturous pay-offs.

You may also want to carefully examine said women, as they probably feel akin to the heroin, and trust me, having a space cadet like Amelie in your life could only cause you harm in the long run.

<ul><li>ultimately it's too hollow. It's a film that's pretty much based on nothing real and settles for being pure fantasy too overtly. It sets out to conduct a purely romantic plot that is, in the end, more fiction than anything, which is disappointing when it clearly looks to carry a certain realism about itself.

","This film explores how we define a person, introducing us to each character through their trivial likes and dislikes that in fact tell us more about those people than the typical questions we ask each other. It is a film of little things that make life magical when they are noticed. Amèlie takes on the role of trickster fairy, ensuring that those moments are noticed by even the most oblivious. She brings herself fulfillment through her good deeds to others, and yet, along the way it becomes clear that these acts are her way of running away from herself, avoiding the advancement of her own story.

To be honest, anything by Jeunet and Caro is simply genius! This film has it all. A beautiful set and backdrop. A story you can't help but to fall in love with. A great sense of humour. Odd and quirky characters; all portrayed perfectly by the entire cast. It is one of those movies you want to go on forever. If you haven't watched Amelie yet, then you are in for a spectacular treat. It makes an unforgettable impression. If you have watched Amelie already, then hey - watch it again (and again and again)!"

","I have known about this movie for a while before I decided to watch it. It has shown up on recommended movies that I should watch, no matter the website or app. I finally got around to watching Amelie, and when I finished, I immediately regretted having not watched it earlier. This movie was highly amusing and lets the audience fall into a world of imagination mixed with reality. <br/><br/>Although my understanding of the French language may be very bare, just hearing and seeing the expressions of the outstanding actors made this movie one of the best I've seen. The camera work in this movie was phenomenal and really contributed to the whimsical feel of the movie. The characters were also very well developed and fascinating. None of them were too perfect; they all contained very human-like flaws. Another noteworthy aspect of this movie is how they portray the backstories of characters to the audience. Amelie uses very creative and engaging ways to introduce us to these characters. <br/><br/>I believe that this movie can connect with people on many levels. Everyone can find a piece of their personality in this movie and perhaps learn a little more about themselves."
"roystephen-81252","9","2","4","21 February 2016"," A fairy's touch
","Jean-Pierre Jeunet is probably my favourite contemporary French filmmaker. I love his unique visual style that borders on surrealism with the stylised colour palette, the warm yellows and greens and the dreamlike tint, and I love his highly imaginative, complex schemes, those 'clockwork' or 'domino effect' sequences which are so characteristic of his films. I fell in love with his movies with The City of Lost Children and while Amélie didn't knock that one out of the top spot for me, it's a great, funny, heart-warming movie with a very positive message that makes the world a happier place.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel paints a fairytale-like picture of Paris which makes a perfect background for the story of the waitress-fairy, Amélie, played by Audrey Tautou (she's just adorable here), who wants to bring happiness into other people's lives. This is typical Jeunet, but the way he starts the film, the way Amélie summarises her past and the life around her through juxtaposing various statistical data, is reminiscent of another director's work with a very distinct (and painterly) style: Peter Greenaway's. Being sort of fascinated with statistics myself, I found that a welcome addition. Another clear influence that should be mentioned is Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express (another favourite of mine) which has a lot in common with Amélie story-wise.<br/><br/>For me, Jeunet hit the mark four times in a row (with The City of Lost Children, Alien: Resurrection, Amélie and A Very Long Engagement), and while I don't consider Amélie his best, it is clearly his funniest, warmest and most easily digestible work. A real feel-good movie."

","There comes a movie in your life that just grows on you and, eventually, becomes something more. Amélie is one of those movies.<br/><br/>After having watched it on my telly, I realized this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is so personal, so enriching, so playful and yet, so sweet that I can't help but fall in love with Amélie. To me, it seemed a movie capable of inspiring someone to feel good about their life, no matter whatever trouble they are in. During the whole course of the movie, one thing that no one will fail to notice is the sheer importance of imagination and fantasy in one's life and how it makes everything so interesting around us. Amélie lives in an apartment in Montmartre and earns her living by working as a waitress for Café des 2 Moulins. This is another aspect of the movie, where we are left wondering how can she manage to live in her apartment on the meager income of a waitress?! This is yet another instance of the fabulous life of Amélie Poulain, I guess, dripping and soaking in fantasy ever so amazingly and beautifully.<br/><br/>The colors of the movie are very beautiful; with red, green and yellow catching your eye. The acting is excellent and I can imagine no one capable of portraying Amelie better than Audrey Tautou; she is just PERFECT. She IS Amélie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece here; a story so pure to its very core and the directing just exceptional.<br/><br/>I LOVE the way Amélie lives her life and how she imagines herself, and the people around her, in a ridiculous and yet, completely interesting way. I LOVE the way she decides to and improves the life of the people around her helping them in the most ingenious way anyone could imagine. The love affair between Amélie and Nino has to be the one of the most special relationships captured in a movie and it oozes romantic vibes that will make you want to fall in love. The scenes where she wept, I wanted to hug her and console her. The scenes where she was mischievous, I wanted to join her.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was falling in LOVE with her. I wanted to be a part of her magical world. And when the movie ended, the feeling I went through could be most closely associated with the feeling one gets when one departs from a best friend.<br/><br/>This World needs a lot of Amélies to appreciate its surreal beauty rather than its materiality."

","Watching Amelie was for me like standing by a kindred spirit. It was so refreshing to watch the escapades and be able to identify with someone who appreciates the small things, is a small light of sensitivity and innocent good will, but also a lively and enthusiastic spark, a creative bringer of joy (and occasionally retribution) to others.  The scene of Bretodeau's reunion with his childhood treasure box was priceless.  As was Amelie's standing alone in the train station, having missed her chance to connect with Nino, or her melting into a flood of water, when Nino leaves the restaurant.  Or her walking the blind man across the street and flooding him with sensations of the marketplace. Or her imagined arrival of Nino prior to the moving bead curtain, .... Ah, such magic moments of moviedom.  Even to see one such moment in a movie is a fine thing, but Amelie had so many. Also, the many secondary characters all came alive as one could sense their stories and life's paths, that they had suffered, but could smile still.  Little joys amidst hurts. Overall, a finer movie experience is hard to find. Amelie has an innovative script, beautiful cinematography, lots of silliness, heartfelt yearnings, and love finally found between people you can actually like and care for.  And its a movie that seems to laugh at itself, too.  :^)   Bravo! Magnifique!"

","This movie is a pleasure to watch. It is set in a (non-existant) Paris, clean and filled with friendly people. It's sunny, and misery is only decorum.<br/><br/>""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is *not* the great movie everyone says it is. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it's easy to score with a magical, slightly surrealistic feelgood movie, where you can leave all human troubles at the doorstep.<br/><br/>Amélie did not ""grip"" me at any point, because it was so obvious from the start that things would work out. For everybody. Sure, I laughed at some points and marvelled at some technical cinematic wizardry, but that's to be expected of a comedy of this sort.<br/><br/>The eyes of Audrey Tautou are very nice to look into, but her regular girly grins (combined with a larger-than-life zoom-in) got on my nerves, at times.<br/><br/>This movie is not a 10. Over 4600 people thought it was, but I really can't see why. It's a good movie. It's not a great movie. The current top spot in the Movie Top 250 is, in my opinion, undeserved. Either people needed this kind of escapism - post 9-11 and all, but I sense chauvinistic voting.<br/><br/>Do you need to see this movie? Yes, but only as pleasing eye candy. I found no deeper philosophical meaning in ""Amélie"", but that's not the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>Two sidenotes:<br/><br/>Some elements of the movie were nicked. The travelling garden gnome is part of an internet folklore. The part where Amélie messes with the appartement of the greengrocers was lifted straight out of a story by Roald Dahl, in which a man brings his wife to madness by slowly, but deliberately changing small elements of the house.<br/><br/>Still, it was a pleasure to watch. Leave reason at the door, but remember to pick it up when you leave."
"evilmatt-3","9","2","4","6 January 2002"," Wordly cynicism be damned
","Many, many people reflect on this film and find it fluffy, cartoonish, and wildly unrealistic.  While the fact that this is mainly an emotional film (as all good films are) necessitates a certain degree of hyperbole, I disagree that it is all that unrealistic and charge that Amelie's detractors are those who are unrealistic.  The simple, undeniable truth of this film IS the only simple, undeniable truth: that of human emotion.  Amelie is a person unable to separate how she feels about the world from how she interacts with it.  This translates into behavior which is often brave, sometimes crazy, and always lovable.  In this sense, then, Amelie is not a superhuman or a saint (for she is also painfully aware of her shortcomings and petty vanities), but a person who has the courage to actually be herself and let her emotions, no matter how fanciful or ""unrealistic"" they may be, shape her world and the world of the others around her.  Simply put, every single person could be Amelie if he or she wanted to, except for our cynical and bitter insistence that people like Amelie don't exist.<br/><br/>The main conflict, of course, comes when Amelie falters and cannot allow herself to follow through in this fashion in pursuing her own true love. Truly, if ever the dangers of worldly cynicism (or ""realism"" as we are fond of calling it these days) have been shown more accurately in a film, I would love to see that film.<br/><br/>So, if the above description appeals to you, you will love the film.  If it doesn't, then you need to see it even more- the message is there not for the romantics who believed in this stuff all along, but for the cynics who maintain against all evidence to the contrary that the world is a rational place."
"sula-3","7","2","4","29 November 2001"," Am I the only one who sees darker implications here?
","Everyone thinks this movie is so, um....sweet. I thought the sweetness was forced and deliberately so. Amelie skips along the surface of the world, doing good deeds to strangers whom she cannot even face or talk to. When she falls for a guy, she can't even talk to him. The whole thrust of the movie I took to be that Amelie needs to wake up from a dream world and she does so at the end, with its implications of sexuality. To really love someone is dangerous in this movie, as in the world: look at the man in the cafe who is frankly stalking his former girlfriend. His possesiveness ends up ruining his budding romance with the hypochondriac. This is the dangerous undertow of sexual love."

","Amelie's matter-of-fact voice-over, alternating fluid observations with absurd yet simple statements, is so typical of the best French movies. It is a method used in a lot of their best romantic dramas and romantic comedies and creates a breezy, spontaneous flow to the movie. French romances are indebted to classics like Max Ophuls' La Ronde and Francois Truffaut's Jules et Jim for this ingenious device. It then allows the movie to sail forth with uninhibited joy, freshness and surprise.<br/><br/>I believe the French make the best romantic and feelgood movies. Hollywood's artificial, contrived attempts to create films of this type pale in comparison. They could learn a lot by looking at the way the French make these films. The audience is allowed to get more emotive, more involved because they are intrigued to see what will happen next. There is no rigid structure with films like Amelie. They are just allowed to drift blithely and sublimely like a balloon happily floating through the sky. The Americans, by comparison, use helium balloons.<br/><br/>There are also complaints by people saying Amelie was too long. I for one was sad when it ended. I really regretted it when the subtitles came up. I do not know how anyone can get bored of such a riveting, fast-paced, consistently imaginative, life-affirming romantic comedy as Amelie. It leaves you feeling happy and at one with life when you leave the cinema. It makes you appreciate beauty, love, happiness, and the generosity of the human spirit. It just celebrates humanity in its joyous, inimitable French style.<br/><br/>If you love this movie then it is worth going out to get Jules et Jim, a truly sublime yet slightly more serious French romance."

","Amélie is a beautiful love story that covers important subjects like happiness a letting go of our comfort zone to face the world outside.
When the movie started I was not really sure what to expect, I had heard about the movie but I never really had much interest in watching it. However when I started watching it and saw the visual and artistic style of the film I knew it was gonna be good. Usually I don't like narration in a film too much, but in this one I believe it worked perfectly to set the mood. I really liked how it starts with completely unrelated events being shown to lead to the birth of the main character.
All throughout the movie you can see how since a child Amelie has been kind of living in her own bubble, mainly because of her parents who were never really there for her the way that parents should be there for their children. This leads to Amelie living most of her days inside her head, even as an adult. She doesn't relate much with others, until she finds something that allows her to make someone happy. When she gives the box to the man and literally fixes his life, as he'll now go back and reconcile with his daughter, I would have liked it if she told him it was her who gave it to her. I understand why she didn't, and how it's part of her personality.
The scenes where you can see what she is thinking displayed in her TV are just great, how she sees herself becoming the ""mother of the unloved"", but I feel like if she had followed this path she might not have found happiness herself. Because of this it's important when she starts doing something for herself, which is to find love with a person similar to her. Mr. Dufayel also plays an important part in the film because he can ultimately be seen as the outcome of living a life full of reclusion and little human interaction. It's thanks to him that Amelie decides to just leave her comfort zone and take a risk by actually meeting Nino in her apartment where they display their love. This however makes me think, can you love someone without really knowing them? or is it more that you love the mystery and escape from your life this person offers to you?
The movie's greatest message in my opinion is that of leaving your comfort zone and taking risks, regarding of their outcome. This is something I can relate to, as it always hurts more to wonder ""what if?"" than to face the actual outcome of the situation. What could have been a simple love story was made in a way that is more thought provoking and has a great final message that applies to everyone."

","Amélie (2001) :
Brief Review -<br/><br/>This French Cinema's innovative characterisation and unique storytelling may be not be Outstanding but enough for a Classic tag. Amélie is story a girl who spent her childhood alon thinking about world in abnormal way. Now in teenage she decides to give a push and an aim to the boring life by helping people and in the meantime she founds love of her life. This is a simple storyline and like i said it is not outstanding stuff or something and i hope you agree. But i must mention and admire the innovative characterisation of the film and the unique way of storytelling. The world in the movie is normal, it isn't fascinating and all but it is just that is has been shown from different point of view and makes us look at it from different perspective. I always have problem to praise the dialogues of non-English films because subtitles is something that disturbs cinematic experience. Améili therefore looks a dry beck in dialogue writing. Audrey Tautou is magnificent as Améilie. She looks innocent, naive and cute throughout the film and make you fall in love with her. All the other cast members are fine too. Amélie is just another different attempt to look at an ordinary writing, may be it works for some and some people might find it underwhelming due to high expectations. There's no denying on Amélie's writing and overall film being regular or maybe less but i would like to mention the characterisation again for its being highly innovative and connectable. Jean Pierre Jeunet has made a very entertaining and thoughtful film but lack of intellectual elements bothers a lot especially in the climax. But his unique storytelling style is worthy to make it a Must watch film as the cinematography and editing is not typical and non regular from regular films. This is really interesting to see if not the story. Améilie carries a high reputation on IMDb which surely makes it over-rated but then i am not against the Classic Tag. It is just that some films are great but known as Greater and Amélie is that Great film.<br/><br/>RATING - 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

","God do I wish I liked this movie as much as everyone else seems to like it. It's so SO SO SOOOOO close for me. Everythings there, characters, music, plot, creativity etc. It all just doesn't fully come together for me. The colour correction is really cool, and every time Amelie continues her scavenger hunt type quest to make peoples life better it's really cool. All the characters have some sort of quirk and their respective actors play them quite well. Amelie herself is played brilliantly considering most of the performance has to be non-verbal. If it all fit together a bit better I think this could have been a really great film to me but it just didn't happen. Although I will say I wasn't in a particularly wanting to watch a movie mood and this still entertained."

","There are many touching pictures in this movie. What impressed me was when Dominique walked into the telephone hall when he heard the phone ring and saw the scene behind the tin box next to the phone. It is undeniable that personnel changes and years of washing have the ability to make people forget to forget. As the movie lens turns to Emily hiding in the dark and watching carefully, I will also worry about whether Emily has found the right owner, Dominic Will he forget the childhood treasures, will he put it back in disdain ... As the camera slowly approaches Dominic's face, he slowly lifts the photo, takes out the model of the little biker, his eyes move, his eyes look When fluctuating, I know that Emily's efforts are best explained.
Admittedly, Emily's kindness and perseverance are admirable. What moved me more was that Dominique's tears when he saw his childhood collection. The middle-aged man walked into the slow-moving camera calmly. From his gray hair, tight eyebrows, and serious face, he could see that he had experienced the vicissitudes, had experienced the time, and the world had changed. Weary and heavy-hearted, but when we face the childhood treasure, we know that he still has the young man, the young self, the excited him, to drink to commemorate, his temples are like a cloud, like Waves, he and Emily's eyes burst into joy.
Maybe angels have this intention to send surprises to others, or maybe Emily would like to observe people's reactions.
Another detail that touched me is the contact between the two angels. When Nino followed the arrow signal Emily left him, he looked down and saw the arrow formed by Emily using pigeon bait, and he smiled knowingly when he looked up. Both of them like to observe and pay attention to observation. Nino can glue the pieces of the torn photos one by one, and no one can lie on the ground enough to help the broken photos under the camera cabinet. Similarly, Emily will observe Nino in detail, just as she observes the world in detail.
Because most of the shots of the entire movie are showing the world in Emily's eyes, from childhood playmates to hanging pictures and table lamps that can talk in youth, they are actually things in Emily's world. Is it fantasy? Is it difficult to understand? Who can deny that he had no illusions in his childhood, and who can force imagination to belong only to children? It is our own deprivation of this ability that gives life to surrounding things. Emily lives in her own world, but she will also quietly walk into the world of others to punish evil and reward good. If it is difficult to understand, it is actually because we have difficulty entering Emily's world.
In his childhood, he hoped his father would hug him. Without friends of the same age, Emily would find fun in her life, change coins, draw pictures, and eat strawberries. In her childhood, she witnessed her mother's death because she was hit by a person who fell off the building. Her father escaped into her own world. Emily was still growing up, still kind, imaginative, and smiling. Konggu has Youlan, which is not a fairy pond. Even if there is no warm Yang Fu, Ting Ting Fang years.
Is n't everyone in their own world? You and I are either on the streets of the cross, or in the fields and the countryside, looking at the same sky, not all clouds will be born in the heart, and not all will rain, but who will not try to interpret the world, How about turning it into a habitat for your life?<br/><br/>Talk to the lake, hold hands with the wind,
Hiding under the blanket made by Luoxia, flying in the summer night sky,
Whose figure brings a reunion with the past,
In whose world dew will sing, moonlight will flow"
"Dame_Otoko","7","0","0","28 April 2020"," The love is in the details
","The origin of this saying goes back to the history of France and Germany, where exactly this phrase was first uttered is unknown today. At that time the saying went like this: ""God in small things, and the devil in extremes"".
Later, this proverb got into English ""the devil is in the details"", and most likely this version was then in Russian. In General, the neglect of small things is absolutely not excusable, since all the reality around us consists of small things. It is about this in ""Amelie"".
You can love something ordinary and simple, but this does not mean that it is something really such. It's just that others don't see it. Love is collecting unwanted photos, getting a letter from someone who would never be able to write to you. Love can take any form. What love means to you, you will understand only through the very details that symbolize your personality. Only by allowing yourself to follow these impulses can you become happy
The film is a little long, the idea in it is not new, but it is presented in a very kind, sweet and sincere way. It's a really good movie"

However, when Emily habitually threw a stone by the river and made a circle of ripples, it made me feel that the child who had been living in imagination since childhood did not lose his happiness because of the mediocre and trivial life.<br/><br/>Instead of focusing on a single story, the film tells a series of simple, clear pictures about a series of lovely and simple stories that are both important and connected to each other. Emily moves her beautiful heart from giving to others to caring for herself. She quietly returned the precious box of memories of her youth to its lost master; She helped the blind old man through the short journey, lively and enthusiastic to him to describe the dark beyond the gorgeous; In order to humiliate the stupid child, she punished his proud boss to a ""nervous breakdown""; She helped a couple out of the emotional world of the rain, for them to create an enviable love at first sight; She could not bear to see the neighbors miss her husband day and night, the fear of love, with their own way to write a beautiful lie; In the face of her aging but lonely father, she tells an amazing and happy fairy tale for her loved ones in the real world. When the breeze sings or the rain sings, the girl always walks the streets of Paris with a smile on her face. Finally, she bravely but still shyly took up the album to pursue her own beauty. ""Knock on the door of your happiness. If you miss the chance, as time flies, your heart will dry up and become as fragile as glass.""

But do we have to be that good? Full of blood but only a cold heart? In the hustle and bustle of the streets, the same coldness changes. Distance becomes the secret of our existence.<br/><br/>We always say that steel and concrete make a cold world, but are we more to blame? At least they can hug each other! Smooth life, cold life, will memories dissolve, it will precipitate out of what?<br/><br/>Less care, after all is nothing.<br/><br/>How long is life? Life is only in the breath.

"dudawriter","8","0","0","28 November 2019"," Amelie
","Jean-Pierre Jeunet's sugary-sweet ode to a pixieish do-gooder named Amelie is a visual wonder, but leaves something to be desired on the narrative side. Early on, I was drawn in by Amelie's exploits (the victim of a strange childhood, to say the least, she becomes a kind of invisible patron saint for riff-raff), but as her romance dragged on and on, I wondered whether there was really any point to it all. Apparently the moral is that if you do nice things for people, sensitive men will follow you all over the city to win your heart.<br/><br/>Leaving a bit of the sarcasm behind, Amelie is entertaining to a point, but the whole thing is just so drippy at times that it can't seem to hold the weight of its own ideas. Audrey Tautou is cute as a button, but her titular heroine is simply too much of a ""good"" thing.<br/><br/>Still, Jeunet's photographic palette is as exquisity as ever, and a great many of Amelie's exploits are wondrous, such as when she rushes a blind man through a busy street, describing everything for him in minute detail, then leaving him just as abruptly to soak it all in. And her little revenges against a bitter street vendor are truly a delight to watch unfold.<br/><br/>I just wish the filmmakers could have decided whether to make an idea film or a fairy tale. As it is, Amelie is nothing more than the sum of it parts, parts which could have added up to so much more."

","I have seen many French movies and for the most part these have been excellent productions to say the least. No one can make movies just like the French but occasionally they are going to make a bad one. Amelie is definitely one of the very poor examples.<br/><br/>Amelie is nothing less than a dreadful piece of work and how anyone can praise this piece of trash is beyond me. The writer, producers and director must have had a huge laugh at all the praise lavished on this trash. Talk about sending up and taking the mickey out of audiences all around the world serving them this excuse for a movie. Most of them fell for it though - just look at many of the reviews here. <br/><br/>The film is nonsense,loopy,boring,humorless and with the minimum of entertainment value. Of course when you have a main character who was some kind of eccentric weirdo nut job it is not all that surprising that you would have the basis for a terrible film. Thank heavens this is not typical of the many other products we normally see from France."

","Amelie promised to be quirky, cute and charming, and I think it succeeded. It mayn't be to everybody's tastes, but I really liked the film mainly for its irresistible and playful charm. The film may be a little too long, but what does compensate are a number of things.<br/><br/>Firstly, the visuals are a feast to the eyes. The visuals alone make it feel as though you'd just walked into a fairytale. The settings are colourful, the costumes lush, the editing crisp and the cinematography fluid with some inventive zooms. Secondly, the music score is wonderful, romantic, charming and sweet. I will say I have been on holiday four times to France, one thing that always sticks out as a highlight, asides from the beauty of the countryside and the majesty of the Parisian buildings is the true romanticism of the music itself. I love it, and I love France! Also, I love French, I enjoyed learning it, speaking it, reading it, I wasn't particularly great at it but it interested me. Hearing those charming french words caress my ears filled me with delight, it really helped that the script sparkled like bubbles on a glass of champagne. The story is ceaselessly charming and inventive, and I was surprised how quickly the film went as well. Finally I loved the performances, whether it was Mathieu Kassowitz's handsome loner, Rufus as Amelie's father or Yolande Moreau as Madeleine. But Audrey Tautou was the epitome of grace and charm as Amelie, the Montmartre waitress whose selfless ""joie de vivre"" leads her to improve the lives of her friends and neighbours. Tautou has natural charm, allure and a lovely face with an enchanting smile, and in my opinion Amelie is very iconic as a film character, annoying to some but enchanting to others. Overall, I loved Amelie, it was wonderful to watch, Tautou was enchanting and it was charming. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Doylenf","6","4","12","22 October 2006"," Charming tale of a girl who lives amid a world of eccentrics...
","Charming, eccentric tale of a girl who wants to enrich the lives of others around her--all of whom seem to be oddities of the first order. AUDREY TAUTOU is charming in the title role as a girl who lives with her eccentric father in a house and neighborhood teaming with strange characters.<br/><br/>Her motives about enriching the lives of others is hammered home from the very start, after the tragic death of her mother. Her do-gooder nature is triggered by the discovery of a neighbor's mementos of forty years ago hidden behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to track down the owner and if he's properly touched by the return of his boyhood treasures, she'll go on doing good work for the rest of her life to make others happy.<br/><br/>On this rather flimsy premise, the film is a series of vignettes in her life while she tries to fulfill her mission in strange ways. It's quirky, richly imaginative and rather clever from the very start, narrated with style and exquisitely photographed.<br/><br/>For Amelie, life is a series of small pleasures. So is the film. Aside from some bawdy situations (the French, you know), it stays mostly on track to deliver a good deal of charm and sentiment. One never knows where the story is going, especially when she falls in love with a young man with an odd addiction who turns out to be her Prince Charming.<br/><br/>Summing up: Quirky, richly imaginative, but as far-fetched as a famous French fairytale that begins with ""C"".

","The truth is the movie doesn't run very deep. I do love it, though, and especially the main character. Amelie Poulain an unstoppable agent of joy, anonymously bringing peace to those around her. But she's always one step removed from human contact -- communicating through pictures, metaphors, trinkets, one-sided phone calls, secret manipulations, windows and spyglasses. She's not exactly shy or anti-social or awkward. In fact, she appears to be quite content with her interior life... until the possibilities for real connection arise, something that both entices her and terrifies her. When she finally gives in, it's a joyous occasion.<br/><br/>In typical Jeunet fashion, the film's visual style is jaw-dropping, with a fistful of clever tricks, gorgeous splashes of bright colors, and a dynamic camera that keeps you on your toes. Jeunet uses cinema to enhance the significance of the details, in such a playful and generous manner. Audrey Tatou is charming, but really the entire cast is excellent.<br/><br/>A modern masterpiece of wit, whimsy, romance and warmth. A breathtaking celebration of the things in life that are lovely, in ways large and small."
"ElMaruecan82","10","3","8","4 November 2010"," A cinematic treasure ...
","To the viewers who complained about the movie depicting a totally unrealistic non-multiracial Paris, I wanna reply with a big and long : ""Soooooo what ?"" and here starts the review ...<br/><br/>First, it's called ART. Which means it's something personal. A personal view from Jeunet which -I agree- has a very nostalgic 40's/50's feeling depiction of Paris with a sentimental focus on Montmartre, but again, why not? Why do you feel obliged to kill the joy of many viewers all over the world by adding a political ""re"" to Jeunet's ""vision"" ... should Jeunet have artificially inserted some racial minorities in the background just to satisfy the PC supporters : ""Hey look, I'm not racist!"". Amelie is a piece of Art, and an artistic masterpiece. It may look fake or artificial or just weird, but for me it was just a dream-like realistic-fantasy world full of non stereotypical yet eccentric people like in Capra's movies. <br/><br/>Secondly, Amelie is UNIVERSALLY appealing. It deals with universal themes all of us can relate to : nostalgia, childhood, quest for love, family, meaning of life, there's a gallery of characters so rich that everyone can relate to the situations they live, their simple pleasures, the things they like, the things they don't. <br/><br/>Third point : it makes you feel so good.It's an incredible feel-good and poetic movie that doesn't have the typical depressing message some movies like to sell just because it became so cool to push people down. By the way, being a feel-good movie is not enough, Amelie works thanks to the innovative story, the director's creativity, the wit of the script, and the beautiful and enchanting cinematography ... not to mention the score that fits the movie like a glove. There's no cliché in Amelie, it was something totally fresh and new for its time. (As a comparison, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a feel-good movie, but far lest subtle than ""Amelie"" especially with the forced Fairy Tale ending and all the celebration : money, love, dancing etc.) <br/><br/>Ironically, those critics came for the same country that produced the film ... it's an unfortunate tendency to over-analyze things, to put them on a very rational and political level : the movie was highly praised, even by racial minorities. Why? for all the reasons mentioned before : an entertaining artistic and popular movie, with a stunning cinematography, a great script, and more than that : a movie with a HEART, incarnated by Audrey Tautou's illuminating smile. But some people feel obliged to show how smart they are and try to analyze movies like a 'journalist' just to point out some things as if we hadn't noticed them before. And you have some French elitists bashing one of the most popular French movies, one of the greatest achievements in movie's history and one of the best ambassadors of French Cinema all over the world. <br/><br/>""Amelie"" is such an inspiring movie, that invites you to forget today's cynicism, and enjoy the personal vision of the director, of the most beautiful town in the world, providing universal insights about the meaning of life ... Merci Jeunet for this cinematic treasure!"

","This is one of my most favorite movies.<br/><br/>Since there has been written so much about this movie (why it is so good) and since I agree with all of them I was trying to get to the bottom of another phenomenon.<br/><br/>From time to time I read or hear negative, total irrational and almost hate outbursts about this movie and I ask myself why there are so many extremely aggressive negative reactions to such a charming movie. I think I have some kind of an answer.<br/><br/>I think hardboiled realists are the ones who have extreme difficulties with this movie. They just can't cope with all the excessive fantasy and imagination in this movie. They are overburdened coping with a hero who is not mainstream, an outsider not getting along with reality and yet winning in the end.<br/><br/>It's interesting to deduce from the hate arguments another strength of the movie: Outsiders should be encouraged to be themselves no matter what because they give the world its individual, original and creative mark and that's what makes this world so unique in its mixture of reality and spirituality.<br/><br/>Bravo Jeunet.<br/><br/>Bravo Amélie."

And yet at the same time there are some points at which you nearly find your self crying, is it possible for a plot to be that good, it is now.<br/><br/>Take the central character, Amelie (hence the title) a character it is impossible not to like and yet you feel a constant frustration that whilst she is able to fix the life of so many others she is completely unable to fix her own when she is clearly the most deserving of all of them.<br/><br/>That said, you find yourself in some ways warming to every character who makes an appearance from Amelie's seemingly emotionless father to the odd neighbour with the tragic past from downstairs. Every time a ray of sunshine is brought into one of these peoples lives another ray is brought into yours as you somehow experience their joy.<br/><br/>Plot aside, the directorial techniques alone make the film a must-see.

","Amelie Poulain is a 23 year old Parisian girl who finds enjoyment in the little things of life, and tries to bring that joy to those around her. Due to the dull nature of Amelie's parents and upbringing, Amelie has an imagination that gives her a thirst for life. While this plot might sound strange to the average film-goer, Jean Pierre Jeunet manages to create a story of astonishing beauty and emotion. When thinking of movies that possess incredible emotion and feeling, the only rival I could find for ""Amelie"" was Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."".<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is the type of movie that makes you stop and think and value the small things in life. Other films would have to recur to tragedy in order to achieve the same effect. Audrey Tatou is amazing in the title role. To say that ""Amelie"" is just a feel-good movie is a gross under-statement. Jeunet shows what a director with real imagination and freed from constraints is capable of."

","It's been a long time since a movie has satisfied both the issue and the city it was filmed in (especially if this city is Paris). Amélie certainly did. Watching it is like moonily gazing the sun go down from high upon Montmartre. In this dark yellow glow everything seems to be a bit fairer (in all its meanings). This is exactly the feeling i had while watching credits. This is a wonderful example of how much more weight a movie can carry by being well thought out than by devouring a vast budget (Amelie's was only about 13 million $). Everything from the acuteness the characters are elaborated with to the small details that keep occurring throughout the movie seems to fit quite perfect. So if you happen to see this one in your local video store. Go for it and make yourself a wonderful evening, on your own or with someone you really like ;-)"

","Amelie is one of those rare chick flicks that I can honestly and proudly say I enjoyed. But then again, this film is really more than a movie about love and desire, but it's a movie that seems to touch a chord within us all, baring a bit of our souls in ways that is rarely done in cinema. You can't help but fall in love with Amelie. Her innocence is not contrived and her love is something that needs to be tapped. <br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece with this vivid and beautiful film. His famous attention to detail and his desire to make a technically perfect movie is something film school students should take note of. His ability to make a heart warming story but keep it devoid of any sap or saccharine was the true mark of this brilliant film. Each scene must have been a canvas to Jeunet, and the beauty of France is portrayed perfectly in this film. <br/><br/>Years from now, people will understand the greatness of this movie for what it is instead of looking at it as yet another foreign film.

","I originally saw this movie when it was released in the States five years ago, and I watch my DVD version from time to time. The only thing I can add to the other submissions is that American screen writers need to learn more from this director and his writers.<br/><br/>There is a real sense of whimsical creativity here that is touched on in A Very Long Engagement, even though it is a story of war time horror and rebirth.<br/><br/>However, like one other writer mentioned, Amelie is a creation of the human comedy. While many folks always take the blue path in life, there is much comedy even in the darkest hours.<br/><br/>In fact, when I originally saw Amelie, I was in a dark mood following the death of my 9 year old son after a two year battle with leukemia ... and Amelie set me on the road to recovery ... especially by allowing me to pull great practical jokes again.<br/><br/>Afterall, what is life without practical jokes?"

","(a.k.a - Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain) Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, Amelie is the visually and emotionally intense story of the painfully shy Amelie Poulain. Raised by 2 left of center parents, Amelie was left with only her imagination to get her through her childhood, an imagination that cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel brings to life nostalgically. Years later, after finding a past tenants treasure, Amelie decides to become a regular do gooder. However, we wonder if she will ever have the time to please herself, and if she will ever be able to tell the love of her life how she feels. Through a series of comical and heartwrenching trials, Amelie sets the wheels of fate in motion. This is a film, that when you think back about it, you cant help but smile. This is a film that will touch you emotionally, it will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly; think about the fundamentals of life. Visually, this movie is breathtaking. Acting wise, the characters are so well executed, and the characters are so real, that is impossible for you not to relate to them on some level. And if this film could not get any better, Yann Tiersen delivers an original score so beautifully composed and matched to the imagery, that it will give you chills time and time again."

","The most beautiful cinematography joined in harmony with a wonderful development of the main character. It is a movie to fall-in-love with. From the beginning till the end, the characters domain the scene beyond any picture enchantment or special effect. The love of the filmmaker for the main character makes you step on the point of view of the insanity that it is caused because of this love. The description of this world its very close to the existentialism and reminds me that the beauty of life is in the very own details of every single one of us. But pay attention, this is not the case of a naive or extra-optimistic picture, on the contrary, it teaches to all of us that love as the engine that moves everything creates a positive reaction despite off the bad or negative aspects. The images created by lights off green and red creates a warm environment were the loneliness of our main character is not even perceived as bad, in a world were we cant be alone for an instant. But this is the line, this is the space were the director sits and starts to twist and twist. He presents us a love story, between Amelie and us."

"phattdirty","10","3","8","26 September 2004"," Amelie, a review
","One of the most beautiful and wondrous films ever made, this is truly the gem of European cinema; not only is it heart-warming but also life-affirming. The antics of Miss Amelie Poulain cannot fail to captivate the audience largely due to the impeccable casting of the mesmerising Audrey Tautou. Not only does she look the part but the idiosyncrasies she brings to the character mean that no-one else could even come close to playing the role. Pay particular attention to how she drinks the brandy in the café as she speaks to the man who has just been reunited with his childhood belongings. At times her devilish-looking smile appears mischievous but this is simply because, at heart, Amelie is still a child growing up in a world populated with adults who sometimes need a little help to have some fun. Unfortunately she fails to help herself and begins to feel lonely despite secretly pining for the mysterious Nino whom she encounters as he lurks near train station photo booths.<br/><br/>Amelie's love interest is played by Mathieu Kassovitzbetter known as the director of the 1994 French classic La Haine. He plays the character with perfect aplomb; both naïve and childlikeas shown by his obsession with collecting discarded photographsbut also with more worldly experience than Amelie who has been sheltered all her life by an overly protective father. It is a great parallel that Nino's two main jobs are working at a fair ground on some days and in an adult video store on others; again showing the two sides of his character. A brilliant supporting castincluding long time Jeunet collaborator Dominque Pinonadd even more humour to the already quirky and mischievous screenplay.<br/><br/>One particular element of the screenplay is wonderfully conceived; her father is convinced she has a heart defect when in reality it is his rare displays of contact and affection which cause her heart to race. Other nuances included the world trip undertaken by the gnome belonging to Amelie's father and the hilarious tricks Amelie plays on the local grocery for the ill-treatment of his assistant. The start of the film with its irreverent look at the small things that no-one ever really notices is also a fantastic script device to hook the viewer.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunetwho came to prominence with the deliciously depraved Delicatessenonce again uses his self-taught directorial skills to bring to the screen this wonderfully amusing and captivating story. Fantastic, Oscar-nominated, cinematography means this is a sumptuous viewing experience. However one cannot fail to notice how artificial Paris looks in this filmthere is no graffiti and the settings look like something out of a picture postcard. This is of course another of Jeunet's deliberate stylistic choices (watch out also for talking pictures and figurines as the two main characters are asleep). Jeunet will be best remembered for this film but his early work too should not be dismissedDelicatessen is a perfect example of a director on the ascendant and there are stylistic similarities between both films.<br/><br/>Not only is this a genuinely lovely film but it also makes you realise how beautiful life can be if you look at it in the right way. Inventive direction combined with a superb script and ensemble acting makes this the best and most influential French film in recent times. Nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2002 Academy Awards, this really should have swept the board and makes the majority of other films seem bland in comparison."

Every shot of the movieisat risk of being repetitive, magic.<br/><br/>The film is really a hidden pleasure, I find that I can start it at anytime and watch it, and every time, I cry at the end, yet feel so great. It is simple amazing. Yann Tiersen chops up, what I consider, one of the best musical scores for a movie. It is so fantastic. The entire cast is so extremely well put together, Audrey Tautou was the best choice possible, she was her part one hundred percent. You are left, in love with her after viewing this movie. I found myself desiring to see every movie she has been in after I saw this movie. <br/><br/>Even though I saw this movie months ago, for the first time, I still just as excited today, as I was when I first saw it.

There is little dialog, with rather a narrator supplying much of the explanations. The audience chuckled a few times during the movie, but it wasn't really very funny.  The ending did make one feel good, but it wasn't worth watching the whole film for that.  As long as your expectations aren't too high and you expect kind of a bizare artsy type film, you might enjoy it.  Otherwise, be forwarned."

I really cannot think of a thing about this movie that I do not like. I think it has some of the most clever writing and one of the most effective character development devices. The quick two sentences about the person really gave a lot of flavor to the characters. I loved all of the acting and in particular the father really stands out in my mind. He is one of the funniest characters and is just fun. Amelie's personality is perfect and no one else could have pulled off the role. I totally fell in love with her the first time she looked in the camera and smiled. I liked the use of special effects and while most movies of this flavor it would look tacky it works so well. It almost reminds of Scrubs the way the fantasies play a role in the movie as a character development device and the writers of Scrubs must have watched this movie a lot.

I knew you could purchase the DVD, but I didn't even realize that you could buy it here in Australia unless you had ordered online, from then on i've been watching it almost daily, and I like to relive it by watching it on a regular basis, there are alit of skeptical people who badmouth the movie and label it as ""crappy, boring, false and unintersting or even a complete waste of time!!"" but i say those people should just keep quiet, if they don't like the movie then why don't they keep their horrible opinions to themselves, I am a fan of the movie and hearing their horrid and rude comments just make me mad, in fact if they don't even like the movie why don't they just not write or say anything or even go on another site for amelie haters..oh no, I'm giving those haters idea's!! About the movie, comments and all: The movie was just breathtaking and spectacular, it had the right amount of comedy, romance and mystery..now thats my kinda movie..I absolutely adore Amelie's actress Audrey Tautou, she's gorgeous, superb and has a natural gift of acting, I also loved Mathieu Kassovits as Nino, they have a real chemistry between them and they go so well together, like uh peanut butter and nutella(yum!!) I loved Joseph and his paranoid theories, they were absolutely hilarious, I almost was in tears when he came up on the screen, I feel sorry for all his exes lol, and Lucient was such a cutie with his obsession with lady di, and Nino was a perfect match for Amelie, with their similar childhood history and dreams, but of course as you all probably know, Audrey Tautou stole the show as the vixen and extremely adorable Amelie Poulain, she was hilarious, and such a cutie especially how she felt it was her job to set those meanies straight ala collignon and that horrid neighbor who blamed her for the accidents that occurred leaving the poor bloody child traumatized, overall this is my favorite movie, it has everything that you need and it's such a typical girls movie with a hint of peculiarness(if that's even a word!) and all the right lines and quotes and lines, and I reckon that if other actors and actresses were used the movie would not have been the same, the movie is outstanding and i have to say..anyone who hasn't seen the movie..please do..it's a wonderful Movie and you'll agree in the end like moire that it truly is the best movie..thank you all.."

I think she has a bright acting future, especially after the success of this film.<br/><br/>What really sets ""Amelie"" apart from most other films are it's art direction, cinematography, use of visual effects and clever, insightful story.

I think ""Amelie"" would be enjoyable for most anyone, not just film buffs or lovers of French films.<br/><br/>No one can really deny that after you watch ""Amelie"" you have a smile on your face! Yes, it's a fantasy film, however it shows the little things in life that matter. It's very vivid in it's use of cinematography and visual effects to display a mood or feeling. One of my favorite images of the film is when Amelie, disheartened and disappointed when her would be boyfriend leaves the cafe, dissolves into water and splashes onto the floor of the cafe she works at. This beautifully and poetically captures the feeling most of us would have in a similar situation of a potential love relationship.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","Amelie, in my opinion is THE most beautiful film ever made.  So colourful and blissfully happy with a fantastic soundtrack by Yann Tiersen.<br/><br/>If you are ever in need of a pick-me-up or just a smile, watch it.<br/><br/>Audrey Tattou's performance is fantastic, as is Matthieu Kassovitz as Nino. Nobody plays a bad part in this film.  Even Montmartre plays a huge part of the film, being the stunning backdrop to a stunning film.<br/><br/>
There is nothing wrong with this film in any way.  All i can do is recommend that you watch it and if you dont have a smile on your face at the end, then i don't think you have any heart or emotion in you.  :)"
"Diand","7","3","9","3 June 2001"," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
","This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camerawork are key elements to this.<br/><br/>In the second part Amelie lives on her own in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of ""Delicatessen"", except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.<br/><br/>Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.<br/><br/>The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like a absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates.<br/><br/>Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.<br/><br/>What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd."
"jotix100","8","3","9","1 December 2001"," Vive Amelie!
","Audrey Tautou has a great screen presence and it's a delight to see her throughout the film, where she's the center of the action. Amelie is just an exception in a world full of self-centered and unhappy people. She's willing to spice those lives she comes in contact with. The jumpy style of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet sets the right tone for this modern day fable set in the Montmartre of today. More than anything, the director has used this beautiful actress in ways that others wouldn't have dared. At times she keeps reminding us of another Audrey, Hepburn, with those expressive eyes of hers. Long live Amelie and Audrey too. Let's hope other directors will use her too and very soon too!"
"WilliamOTyler","10","2","5","13 February 2016"," An overwhelmingly romantic look at life
","Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a master of whimsical quirk and Amélie might be his ultimate achievement. It's a kind of neo-fairytale or modern storybook romance, heightened to such with its narration and its wonderful score by Yann Tiersen, simple and melodic, like a small band playing in a cafè on a sunny afternoon. It delves more than slightly into fantasy, as romance often does, but does so in a very refreshing and fun way. This is a world where gnomes travel and skeletons are somewhat sensual. At the same time, this is just the magic that can and does happen everyday.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is impressingly adorable as title character Amélie Poulain, a young woman with the power and imagination to change the lives of just about everyone she comes into contact with. She lives in the moment, enjoying the ways she can bring smiles to the faces of her friends and right the wrongs that she witnesses. She's quiet and seemingly meek, but speaks volumes with her mischievous smile and loving eyes. She finds exciting adventure in what could be the most mundane situations, not taking any little thing for granted.<br/><br/>The film is stuffed with intertwining stories small and large that Amélie drives along, and they are each as important as the next, no matter how much or how little the movie dwells on them. What truly brings happiness? Does the truth really matter if we never know it, when it's what we personally experience that moves us along, for better or for worse. How important is the smallest exchange we may have with a stranger? Sometimes you don't even realize just how much of an effect you have, because you're not seeing the situation from their eyes. But it's all important. The details are all meaningful.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is mostly warm and lush with yellows and reds that pop like blood coursing through the heart. This is contrasted with an undertone of very vibrant greens and cool blues that create a fantastic atmosphere and make everything feel like an organic, natural setting. The color theory here is actually quite amazing, making the film special and nostalgic right from the beginning. It has a lightness, but is still emotional and will leave you with the inspirations of a hopeless romantic. It warms your heart, becoming overwhelming without being overbearing.<br/><br/>Amélie is indeed pure romance. This is the romance of life and it's intricacies, even in it's darkest moments. The film allows you to enjoy even the smallest things that might usually be overlooked and gives importance to the playful particulars of life like the joy of peeling large strips of wallpaper or skipping the best stones along a canal. It shows how one small thing may unfold a series of events that can help you conquer your fears or lead you to where you need to be in life. It shows the perfect, imaginary life we live in our heads and how close to the real world it could actually be. And, of course, it shows true love, as easy or as hard as it might be to find, and just how close it might come to slipping right through your fingers if you're not looking at it from the right angle."

","This is by far my favorite movie. Though usually I prefer horror, thriller and suspense (in other words: if no one is getting killed, I am apt to get bored). I tend to hate anything romantic unless it's a period film. But this.... this film touched something so familiar in me. Anyone who has fallen in love with Paris, anyone who is a dreamer, anyone who has known true loneliness and detachment from the daily world we live in: you will love it and you will want to live it. I even love the soundtrack. I see the beauty in the film, because I recognize the characters and the way Amelie views life around her. Depending on whether or not you have the dreamer inside you: you will be enchanted, or it will leave you cold (Dutch expression). As for the dreamers: get a bottle of French wine, keep the remote handy (if you don't speak French you will be re-playing like mad, as the visuals sometimes make you forget to read the subs), lie back on the couch, and dive into Paris, romance and the funny things that add up to what we all know as: life."
"jim-austin-327-623727","9","2","5","29 March 2012"," Sheer Brilliance!
","Amelie is a quirky romantic comedy. It is refreshing to see those two words together. One of my favorite things about this movie is how it manages to be bizarre, unique, and surreal but still deals with real life issues. Issues that are so close to my heart, however, and I do not know if everyone can connect to the story. I think this piece of literature exemplifies everything I've studied in my World Literature class and that is why it speaks to me. First of all, it revolves around the ""artist figure."" Amelie is an artist, disconnected from society but wanting to impact it. That is why I identify with her so much, because she is a shy individual and she learns that she can't keep letting her chances for happiness pass her by. It is great that she is helping those around her, but you can't truly help others until you help yourself. That beautiful, heartfelt central message is what had me in tears. Good literature (and movies) give you an outpouring of mixed emotions which leave you not quite knowing what to think (and gives you a lot to think about after its over). The technical aspects of the film are quite brilliant. The script has believable dialogue. All of the characters and interesting and well rounded (The glass man being my favorite). Everything fits together in a perfect piece. The cinematography is quite stunning. Each camera pan and swoop is just breathtaking. The colors add to the fantasy of the story. All in all, from the performances, to the storyline, to the look of the movie is shear brilliance."
"lucianomarzo92","8","2","5","15 January 2012"," Wonderful
","Amelie is really an enjoyable movie. I was literally much happier after seeing it than before. It creates a world of fascinating characters and chronicles their struggles, their joys, and their fantasies. The protagonist is a lovable character, and a good person. She is a true individual and she loves to have fun however she can, even if it means changing peoples' lives. The writers of Amelie have wild and rich imaginations and they instill the very depths of their creativity into this film. <br/><br/>This is not a conventional flick at all. You have to see it to understand, but it moves like no film I have ever seen. It drifts between a frantic, lively mood and a relaxed, somber mood. These shifts would normally be abrupt and very noticeable, but they are quite smooth and delicate in this film. <br/><br/>The transitions in this movie are so impressive, it's almost as if they don't exist. The whole movie flows almost like a single scene. The pace is very quick, but it is never tiring. The plot would have been simple if it weren't for its many detours that prolong the story. These deviations, however, are never irrelevant, but delightful. <br/><br/>The film dwells on stories and scenarios of many minor characters, but these layer the film, and make it much more interesting. It wouldn't have seemed quite as original if it isolated a small group of characters, as many films do. This movie can be outrageous in the things that happen, but it is never hokey or lacking in intelligence. <br/><br/>This is a long film, but you don't find yourself wanting it to end. Amelie overflows with imagination. There is not a single dull moment in this entire film. It creates a vivid world that is bursting with life and energy. It is one of the most original movies I've ever seen in terms of both conception and style. I can almost guarantee you have never seen another film like this one, and I highly doubt you'll ever find anything else quite like it."
"Artimidor","10","2","5","24 December 2011"," Angels have names too: this one's called Amélie
","Romantic comedies rarely make it to anyone's serious top ten list, as movies of that kind cater to specific expectations and do not attempt to be anything else. But of course there's the exception to the rule: Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amélie. It's the movie about the search for happiness, about small things, about dreams tucked neatly under the surface of reality which want out, also a training video for wanna-be mortal angels: Amélie is the ultimate reminder of carpe diem, to seize the day and play an active role in the fortune of others and one's self, providing instructions on how to glue together broken personalities. Recounted in voice-overs, embedded in fantastic music that is as French as it can be, the movie is filmed with an incredible love for detail and quirkiness a viewer can handle in two hours: Learn fascinating facts about nothing particularly important, appreciate how different things happen at the same time all around Paris, meet traveling garden-gnomes, horses riding in the Tour de France.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou was born for the role of jaunty Amélie, and she would work again with Jeunet in ""Un long dimanche de fiançailles"" - however, you cannot copy the magic of the first film. Jeunet always takes risks with ideas, sometimes going too far in a direction the audience isn't ready to go with him. He should receive his merits for trying, though. Because every now and then idea, story, actors, combined with the incomparable image laden style Jeunet puts on the screen, come together, and the result is a film as breathtaking as Amélie."
"FSfilmblog","10","2","5","19 October 2011"," Fabulous French Fairytale!
","Could there been a better time to review a classic than it's ten year anniversary? Released only a decade ago Amelie has firmly established itself as a timeless classic. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's best film so far (his latter films are a bit of a disappointment but check out his earlier works ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City Of Lost Children""), here he is allowed full rein over his expressionistic ideas and visions, brought to live by a simplistic and charming story of a young girl with an imaginative and inventive mind growing up with little or no friends where all she has for company is her fantastical views on people and her unique look on life.<br/><br/>The story starts with a narrator regaling little facts about bluebottle flies before moving onto the main character and her family. Divulging further tit-bits in an entertaining and statistical manner over her families likes, dislikes and idiosyncrasy (not just about Amelie but every character the camera comes across, we get a little story on obsessive compulsive behaviours ranging from bubble wrap popping to bone cracking). As we follow Amelie on her fabulous journey (the English literal translation is The Fabulous Life of Amelie Poulain!) one event which affects our heroine is the death of Lady Diana. With the news playing in the background Amelie drops a lid, that rolls towards a tile, which happens to be loose and it's there she finds someones hidden childhood memories. That night she decides to track down it's owner, return it to him and if they are grateful she'll continue to do further good deeds. From there on the film goes off on an extraordinary and incredible adventure where she becomes a match maker, a tour guide, a deceased lover and a woman looking for love amongst others.<br/><br/>It's a film that is so beautifully shot with outstanding colourisation and a marvellous use of warm soft Earthy tones of greens, reds and yellows. Paris has never looked so autumnal. The complementary colours of the greens and reds brings out the vibrancy and warmth which gives the film more heart and feeling. It's a quality the film never veers away from and as a failed artist it's not too hard to spot the beauty and artistry of the cinematography. Along with the beautiful music by Yann Tiersen, they combine to add an elegance and haunting beauty to what is already a feast for the eyes let alone the ears.<br/><br/>The breakout performance from Audrey Tautou as Amelie who in nature appears child like and innocence enables her to tug on viewers heartstrings at all the right places. A spot-on capture of someone who is positive and has their heart in the right place though has a sly wicked streak for those who deserve punishment (a comical moment in the film where she teaches a market vendor a lesson or two in humbleness and humility). With a uniformly strong supporting cast (keep your eyes out for Jeunets regulars Dominique Pinon and Rufus) the story ticks along with each characters little foibles creating a world where perfection is not the norm and everyone has their own little obsessive behaviours whether they know it or not. <br/><br/>Cynics of you may not buy into its charms or understand Amelie's take on the world and life. The mixture of fantasy, dreams and reality may not be everyone's taste but it's undeniably wonderful and captures the human spirit and it's faults to a tee. It's an escape from reality and that is what cinema is all about. You don't go to see the mundane and the drab (though in this film even the mundane and the drab are given beauty and purpose). Here, the joys and euphoria come at you in equal measure and one persons act of kindness is surely something that's not too hard to imagine.<br/><br/>This is dedicated to my wife, my very own Amelie as this is one of her favourite films, and like Amelie she has a heart of gold and would do anything and everything for anyone."

","Not surprisingly, to me, the film garnished the best all around top scores at each and every usual sources I make a habit of checking. It was nominated for countless of awards, many of which it did win. That being said, I would be remiss not to mention that in my opinion and that of a very many others, the Oscar for best foreign film was incomprehensibly not awarded to this movie; in fair slight to 'the Academy', it was one of the most financially successful movie of the year.<br/><br/>The script has to have been a labour of love because it sure has to be one of the longest to write yet managed to result in this beautiful piece of work. If you read just a few of the 1,196 (so far) reviews, you will come across the adjectives original, funny, quirky, charming, delightful, and so on, repetitively. I could not help using a few in my review summary.<br/><br/>I won't kid myself in believing there's anything smarter, more insightful I can add, which has not been written. I'm just compelled to record, with this review that I share all the positive things said and dismiss any negative comments written, which could only come from bitter and intellectually deficient w**kers. In 2001 and 2002, I rarely watched movies and it is my only reason for missing out on the pleasure I, thankfully, was able to remedy recently. If you are another person who did not see the movie, get it or watch it soon; you will find it the best cure for the stress of today's life. Audrey Tautoo will charm your blues away."
"thomvic","10","2","5","9 May 2011"," Don't know how you cannot enjoy this delight!
","Amelie is sugary sweet in its approach to life, those around us and the pleasures of things that go around us. For some it might be a bit of an unrealistic view on how life can be but really - who cares? This is a film that focuses on the good things in life, but also touches on the regrets some of us hold dear to us. Plotwise it is essentially a love story - though a weird sort of one that deals more with the chase rather than the ending kiss - and is an adventure of delights waiting to unfold.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is perfect as the angel faced Amelie who is a somewhat oddball and takes delight in the small things in life - putting her hand in a sack of grain, cracking creme brule or skimming stones on water. She decides to turn people's lives for the better and ends up doing things such as matchmaking her colleague with a broken hearted stalker, punishing the nasty fruit and vegetable store owner for mistreating an employee and at the same time, falls in love with a guy who is almost as weird in her in terms of his pastimes.<br/><br/>So what is the main purpose of this character? Quite simply - she is a misfit in society essentially. But she is well liked and pretty, but isn't entirely sure where her life is heading. She is a girl who is not sure about love and is sort of afraid of it, and thus seeks pleasure in making other people happy but forgets about herself.<br/><br/>There are a lot of themes in this film and metaphors you can interpret which makes Amelie more than just sweet candy which is why it has mass appeal. It has a lot of humour, good performances and some funny visual effects. But in its essence, it is a film about not holding back in life and looking at all the fine things that life can bring us.<br/><br/>Amelie is delight from start to finish. For some it might be a bit too sweet and you think you've overdosed on a lot of lollies but for the two hours it worth, it's well worth it!"

It was so quirky and Tim Burton-esque, making the film look incredibly beautiful throughout. ""Amelie"" is a visual treat! There is some incredible cinematography in there, so if you're a fan of a good looking film, you've found one! Films that look good, usually use style over substance but I can't say that with ""Amelie"" the screenplay is ferociously original with a fast pace and some really well crafted characters. In fact every character we see actually has there own individual character! This is incredibly refreshing to see, after countless cardboard characters we've all gotten used too! ""Amelie"" really is a beautiful film, it's quirky, original, and truly a one off! ""Amelie"" manages to balance style with substance to make it a memorable experience. And even though at times I did get lost through the fast paced dialogue and directing, I ""got it"" in the end and it was really worth seeing."
"colebt33-780-179547","9","2","5","20 April 2011"," ""Times are tough for dreamers""
","I had never intended on this. It was hard enough getting me to rent the movie in the first place. I've never really been into foreign language films. It's not because I'm small-minded or anything, it's just that I find it very difficult to appreciate the visual techniques and conventions that a director uses in a movie when I have to pay attention to these damn subtitles. But I heard so much about this film, and about the director that I had to swallow all of my concerns and just sit down and watch this movie. You know what? One of the best minor decisions I've ever made. That's what this movie's about. The little things, the small everyday pleasures that very few people care to notice. But Jean Pierre did, and that's how he came to make this wonderful film, told through the eyes of one beautiful little dreamer named, Amelie.<br/><br/>For Amelie, life cannot be without enjoyment, even if it is somewhat less than others. As a child, Amelie was rarely loved, and as a compromise to her lack of companionship, she resorted to her imagination. This way of living became very regular to her, eventually becoming a major part of her identity. Now in her adult years, we get a glimpse of what her life is like. Half the time she is working, in a café called Montmartre, and the rest she is contemplating over her trailing thoughts of what goes on around her, like for instance how many people are having an orgasm in the instant she thinks of it. But then one day she finds a hidden treasure box in her apartment. She feels compelled to return the box to its owner, and upon delivery she receives a dignifying feeling of harmony and peace. From this day she continues to try and help those close to her who are in need of a change. And in her attendance to others she learns a great deal about herself, especially through the consolation of her neighbor, nicknamed the Glass Man.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful little tale about changing for the better, after all life is about change, and it's important that we follow along with this change, otherwise your just keeping yourself locked up. That's why we get the impression that Amelie feels somewhat isolated from everyone else, she's not just different, she's afraid to face reality, to take a chance with love. Hence why when she does meet her possible match she continues to test him, lay out obstacles and leaves clues for him, all to see if he's not going to end up breaking her heart. Amelie touches people, and they begin to touch her also, and when I was watching this movie I also felt touched myself.<br/><br/>Amelie is a peculiar, but charming, very lovable character, and actress Audrey Tautou portrays her with just as much sentimentality and curiosity as the character is intended to be. Another thing I really enjoyed about her is that she's both innocent, and at the same time a little bit devious. The pranks she pulls on that grouchy old store clerk picking on the bag boy is so funny, and very deserving, because I really didn't like that big bully (course there were a few occasions where I thought the guy was going to kill himself, and that made me feel a bit guilty).<br/><br/>Jean Pierre's stimulating direction captures the world of Amelie very well. Everything, the bright colours, the cinematography, the overall feel and atmosphere of the film was made perfectly to give us a strong perspective on how she sees the world. It's ruled by her child like imagination, full of life and random ideas, like a beautiful dream.<br/><br/>Le fabuleux destin d' Amelie Poulain, will long remain one of my most favourite foreign language films as it remains Jean Pierre's greatest piece. Its wonderful visuals create a fantastical world seen through the eyes of such a delightful character played by such a talented actress. I'm not going to go so far as to call this movie perfect, but it certainly deserves the rating I'm giving it, a solid 9.0 out of 10, a film to remember, and to watch again for another time."

","I'm usually incredibly apprehensive about watching Foreign films, but after hearing the 4th person recommend Amelie I decided I might as well see why everybody thought I would enjoy it. I absolutely fell in love with this movie. It's a quirky, uniquely wonderful film. One of the main reasons people recommended this movie to me was because I was a big Pushing Daises fan, and Amelie and Pushing Daises both share that colorful, whimsical feel. The awkward love story and the awkward characters and plot lines are everything I could ask for in a film. Audrey Tatou gives an amazing performance, and it's difficult not to fall in love with her by the end of the film. Amelie is one of those films that changes your perception of things, and truly makes such trivial things seem so much more beautiful."

","I liked Amelie a lot, even if it needed a bit more discipline in the tasteful stakes and tightening up on the running time. A film that opens with sperm and a live birth, continues later with the 15 orgasms blossoming in Paris at that moment, and is blasé in that true little shop of horrors, a porn shop, is not really my idea of a feel-good film. There's too many witty uncomfortably cynical moments in Amelie for that.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's an extremely confident, stylish (French style), expertly colourful and cleverly directed comedy movie, where life's daily eccentricities are totted up and trotted out as being meaningful by their mundaneness. Par example, are you one who hangs the toilet paper top rolling outside or in? Have you always put your left sock on first to ward off toothache? Then get these concepts out there in digital widescreen and make people feel good they're not alone!<br/><br/>An engrossing and pleasant enough two hours, but ultimately the feel-good movies I know I'll going back to include It's A Wonderful Life, Greyfriars Bobby or, as my daughter pointed out, Pollyanna!"

","A truly inspiring film of mischievous goodwill, the innocence of Amelie played by Audrey Tautou alone makes the movie worth watching. I couldn't help but feel a throw back to my own childhood and somewhere within the embers that flame my own childish enthusiasm and innocence rekindled. I somehow got wondering and became infatuated with the idea throughout, that children growing up without ambition for all the childhood problems that they may become afflicted with are better off than the rest of us. Is happiness so much easier to attain when what strives to make you happy in life and love is quite simply simplicity? I wonder does being a complex individual in today's society and being subjected to strive for excellence, knowing that there is always something better, become a restraint to being happy and content in all aspects of your life? The cinematography and style captures the playful complexities of the wonderful world of Amelie and in a sense portrays her with a sense of autism whereby she is so in tune with her surroundings it allows her to interpret in a totally different way and in a sense see the true needs of those around her. If only we could all live in her shoes for a day, this film is masterfully creative and childishly mischievous, a truly great escape and a large resource for the playful romantic."

Visually, the film is a treat, with one eye-popping visual after another.  But what does it all mean?  I don't know. It's a very good film, but top 20 all time?

It's nice to see so many liked it.<br/><br/>For me it also contained a nice subtle social commentary on celebrity.

Her schtick is to single out people she happens upon, and then to intervene gently and charmingly in their lives in order to better their lot.<br/><br/>However, in spite of some clever humor, and the intoxicating Audrey Tautou  who plays the innocent and fey Amélie to perfection  after 45 minutes or so I felt a twinge of boredom which gradually blossomed in insistence, so that I found myself looking more and more at my watch while awaiting an end to the increasingly annoying world of Amélie's childish shenanigans.  To my mind Amélie's observations are more appropriate to a 10-year-old than a young adult (howsoever eccentric and naïve).<br/><br/>Accordingly, while this is a pleasant movie generally, it has insufficient bumpf to fill its running time in a satisfying way, and, after a promising opening, the film ended leaving me with a mild sense of disappointment."
"Lumpenprole","7","2","5","17 June 2002"," At best, a fun film
","Amelie is an over-the-top exercise in style with a Hallmark card message. Be nice for the sake of being nice.  The last third of the film is much too long and predictable.  The film relies on zooming in on the cute smile of its lead so much that I found it annoying.  Still, I like Jeunet's use of colors.  It sucks for me that I keep going to his films looking for whatever Marc Caro has got that made Delicatessen and City of Lost Children so enthralling.<br/><br/>But, it's an okay film.     Just    an    okay    film.  It's saccharine sweet, not profound.  It's a simple Disneyesque blast of sentimentality.  It goes against the very oddball spirit of the film to claim it's profound or enlightening.  I gotta admit, compared to A Beautiful Mind and Pearl Harbor, Amelie must look like revolutionary `genius' with its relative lack of tired formula.  But compared to the movies playing at the same theaters as Amelie in 2001, it was merely okay.  I'd put this in the same league as Run Lola Run - fun.  If MTV would go back to playing music videos again, people might stop overrating this sort of camerawork."
"Topher-26","6","2","5","23 April 2002"," Good, but not all that.
","I know I really may sound like a party-pooper but I just didn't find this film all that great. However, the lighting is gorgeous and the guy should have definitely got an Oscar for that. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is perfect (her talent was already perceivable in ""Venus Beaute (Institut)"" despite her small part in the movie), and Jeunet's touch is there - maybe a bit too much actually, given how reminiscent it is of his cinematography on the City Of Lost Children (not to say identical).<br/><br/>There are also numerous cultural references for which I'm dying to see how they were translated into other languages, and the surprising presence of comedians who are well-known to the French audience to add to the fun (Yolande Moreau, Jamel Debbouze, Ticky Holgado, ...).<br/><br/>On the commented version of the DVD (at least the French pressing), Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes references to Frank Capra (the scene in the bar between Amelie and Nino), Wim Wenders (the man and the box in the phone booth) and Sergio Leone (the shot of Amelie in the train station) - the problem is that the same kind of scenes shot by these directors have an intensity that is light-years away from what I felt watching ""Amelie Poulain"". The commentary is actually concluded by the filmmaker stating that he couldn't care less for the anachronisms in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, you get an arty comedy directed to mass audiences with a very thin plot that everyone can understand without thinking too hard, and a good cast performing below their usual abilities. The whole wrapped up in a fairytailish package that, even if it is cute and without much pretense, still keeps me wondering if it is uplifting enough to come out of the movie theater with a big smile on your face, and the will to change the world like so many people seem to experience after watching this film."

","I first saw ""Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain"", or ""Amelie"" on the day of its release. I have seen it in the cinema four times since, and bought the box-set upon its release here in France. Needless to say in this case that this is a film you can not get tired of. Filmed and arranged in a style that can only be described as ingenious, Jean-Pierre Jeunet combines love, friendship, comedy, mystery and magic in this exceptional film which has featured in cinemas all over France for over eight months, even after its DVD release. The story of Amelie, set in Montmartre, Paris is realistically filmed, and although a happy film, it still features the realities of Paris today:- the people who ask  for money in the Metro, the pornographic shops on boulevard de Clichy, the lonely people alone in their appartments, and the alley cats! A wonderful plot, which unfolds progressivley throughout the film, and leaves one feeling warm and happy, with the help of the delightful music composed by Yann Tiersen of course. All round, if you feel down, or just want to see a really good movie - this is the one to see! ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" really makes me feel proud to live in this city!"
"eparin","10","2","5","1 December 2001"," Still thinking about it...
","As it's been over a week time now that I watched the movie for the second time, I realized that it still makes me think about it and feeling of warmth, a bit of joy as well as sadness that it gives me.<br/><br/>I am listening to the soundtrack and scenes are just popping up in my mind. Especially the scene when Monsieur Bretadou found the metal box and his childhood treasures, then when he sat down at the neighborhood cafe, he had the flashbacks of childhood memories that may seem very silly, and childish. But don't we all have memories like this which took place at some point in our lives that really effected us? That scene was a touching one for me for the very simple reason that it reminds you once again that life is very short and precious. You may become 50 or so before you even realize it, and forgetting about what life is all about. Are we missing our little opportunities here and there while we are having marathon racing against time?<br/><br/>Another scene was the one when Amelie had her disappointment with Nino when she heard her waitress friend met with him. That melting down effect is absolutely right. I don't know about North American, European or Asian women, but I can speak for myself and many others over here that ""yes, we do have that exact feeling of melting down when something like that happens to us""...Although Jeunet is a male, this feeling could not be described in a better way by a female director:) You just feel like dying and melting down right there. You don't even want to exist anymore. At least for a few minutes or hours (ok, may be days or weeks and even months depending on the situation).<br/><br/>The other one was when she playfully used the ""female"" in that painting of her neighbor Monsieur Dufayel was drawing one after another to describe herself. Those moments they discussed the look of her were so intelligently done. Don't we play games like these?<br/><br/>God I can write down so much more, but I'll finish up. Amelie ""touches"" my heart, I remember how it feels like when I do something similar to Amelie's act of help to the blind man. Empathy and caring...How much does it cost us? Just a little effort to touch somebody and be touched...<br/><br/>What else really matters in life at the end of the day? Are we really taking our careers and money and belongings with us when we are dead, anyways where we would be taking them?<br/><br/>If one movie can make me think of so much and for so long, and it touches my heart, do I really care about its technical details and length and so on? Personally NO....."

","I'd never heard of Audrey Tautou when ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (called ""Amelie"" in English) came out, but I gotta say that she is one great actress (not to mention really hot). This movie of course casts her as a young vivacious Parisian who sets up relationships between people, and then begins looking into her own potential love life.<br/><br/>I swear that I can't find anything bad to say about this movie; it was done perfectly in every way. Jean-Pierre Jeunet would later cast Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon in the equally good - if gut-wrenchingly violent - ""Very Long Engagement"".

","I have seen the other two films by this director, and I really enjoyed both of them, especially the City of Lost Children, which I thought was one of the best pop sci-fi films since Star Wars.  But this film was a real disappointment, loaded with treachly sentiment and annoying characters, not the least of which is the title character who spends the whole movie tormenting people when it's really none of her business and then the director thinks he can show a wide angle overhead shot of her smiling and we'll suddenly like her.  Well, I don't like her character at all, and the films moments of joy are little more than tired imitations of Truffaut or Goddard.

OK, film begins well, but later just fall in pieces because of all his silliness and bizarre issues (main character got nothing with ""cuteness"", it is more like watching a freak or mental cripple – I think it is all came from untidy story concept: Amelie behaves like a child, but the whole film as content is quite adult). Film really creates a clash that is bizarre, and not in a particularly good way. Yes, film has its own good scenes (individual ones), but the whole movie is just exaggerated attempt to show extraordinary person without thinking where that extraordinary thing comes from – I'm talking not about beginning of ""Amelie"" where all of this is poorly ""explained"", but more about film authors artistic responsibility not to try feeding audience with pathological issues. Even for the sake of entertainment. That is just not fun and it can't be fun. Unless you are primitive with your world outlook. I'm totally agree with those who thinks that it is a dull and absolutely overrated movie. Overrated and disappointing."

This is a magical story about finding happiness in making others happy and happiness finding it's way into your own life. The series of events and the way they unfold are perfect. The cinematography is outstanding, dare I say, whimsical. Sometimes a movie comes around that can just make you feel good, and laugh without being sappy or obvious.

"LilyRFox","10","2","6","21 July 2008"," Amelie: a modern CLASSIC
","2001 saw the release of the fantastic French film 'Amelie', and it instantly (and deservedly) became an international hit.<br/><br/>A fantastic modern fairytale, 'Amelie' follows the life and adventures of young and whimsical Amelie Poulain who embarks upon a life as a waitress in Paris. Audrey Tautou puts in a stunning performance as Amelie, capturing the magic of the old silent movie stars whilst creating a charisma all her own. Her elegant portrayal lights up the screen not dissimilarly to the wonderful Audrey Hepburn.<br/><br/>The style of the movie, wonderfully realised by director Jean Pierre Jeunet, captures the whimsy and fancy of Amelie herself. Pefectly placed shots, quick camera movements and a vivid colouring give this film it's own unique look. Although the way the movie portrays Paris as perfect - overlooking the gritty downsides all cities must face - received some criticism when it was first released, Jeunet's Paris is pristine and beautiful, reflecting the story itself.<br/><br/>This style has even gone on to create wonderful ripple effects in brilliant new TV shows like 'Pushing Daisies', and is similar to Tim Burton's more colourful stylistic flourishes (think 'Big Fish').<br/><br/>The story itself captures the imagination from the first frame, a story of eccentricity, friendship, love and finding your feet in the world, Amelie will make you laugh out loud, giggle amusedly, cry your heart out and last with you long after the final shot.<br/><br/>The fact that it is in French will make many viewers switch off instantly, but although it being French is a curse for those of us who cannot speak it, it is also its biggest charm. I was very cynical about watching this movie when I first saw it, because of the subtitling, but after five minutes of half-hearted viewing I was hooked forever.<br/><br/>If you see any movie this YEAR even, let it be this one."

"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","2","6","14 January 2008"," Might be the sweetest film ever made...
","Amélie is just divine. Few movies are as lovely as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's (""Delicatessen"") fable about this French Pollyanna (Audrey Tautou) who decides to do good for everybody around her after an uncommon discovery. We accompany her in a journey through a colorful Paris, searching for love while trying to help sad souls. Jeunet's peculiar humor and touch of melancholy, Bruno Delbonnel's gorgeous cinematography and Yann Tiersen's unforgettable musical score (I will never get over him not being nominated for an Oscar for this work - he should've won!) work together to make Amélie's story one with a happy ending.<br/><br/>Curiosity: Jeunet wrote the movie especially for Emily Watson (whose performance in ""Breaking the Waves"" is the most brilliant I've ever seen). Watson is a better actress than Tautou, but I'm glad she turned it down. Audrey was pitch-perfect as Amélie - her innocent, exotic beauty, her soft voice and her huge black eyes are unforgettable - a perfect example of the clichéd term ""born to play that role"". I can't imagine anyone else playing a better Amélie. Jeunet and Tautou created one of the loveliest film heroines of all time, and we got the ultimate French feel good movie - proof that they're not only good at psychological pieces and art-house experiments. The French can just speak to the heart when they want. Remember: Truffaut (the great poet) and Godard (the fabulous madman) broke through at the same time. Jeunet and Tautou made another fabulous feature together in 2004, ""A Very Long Engagement"", with Jodie Foster in a small but memorable part. A partnership made in heaven, that I wouldn't mind seeing again.10/10."
"gentendo","10","2","6","14 January 2008"," Simply Charming!
","Amelie is a highly imaginative and charming young lady who retains her child-like ingenuities and uses them to serve and discipline mankind. Her world is full of vibrant colors, destined chances, risky safe zones, and seemingly altruistic values. Due to a lack of parental love when she was a child (which otherwise would have boosted her self-worth and joy), Amelie resorts to her imagination to escape from the harsh realities that surround her (i.e. her mother dying in a suicidal freak accident; her airy father being completely oblivious to her needs). Reality often disappoints whereas her imagination does not. From taking pictures of cloudy teddy bears in the sky, to watching people's reactions in a movie theater, Amelie's imagination carries her into adulthood to find what she most desires: love.<br/><br/>Upon coincidentally discovering a memory box of the previous owner of her apartment, Amelie embarks on a destined journey to find the owner and return it to him. When she realizes the wonderful impact of finding and returning the box to its owner, a humble man by the name of Bretodeau, her heart excites and takes confidence in her new found discoverythat is, sharing love with others enriches your self-worth and restores your joy (two things Amelie lacked from her childhood). As this surge of love illuminates her body, she becomes aware of how simple and clear life is. She's now discovered her life's missionto serve mankind! Her philosophy, however, is not entirely altruistic. She has great need of people reciprocating to her alms in secret, thereby always receiving an instant rewardwhether watching their reactions from afar (i.e. spying on Bretodeau's discovery in the phone booth), or, simply listening to the accolades they have for her (i.e. Bretodeau talking to the bartender in her presence about ""paying the kindness forward"" and visiting his grandson). Every kindness she gives is, in part, a kindness to herself. In this manner, she is simply learning the positive effects of karma and acquiring the love she longed for as a child.<br/><br/>Although she feels the essence of love for every kind deed she gives, there is still something missing. She has not yet felt the euphoric effects of being in love with a person. The challenge to find and keep her lover will determine her ability to enter a rebirth. She has always been satiated in doing alms in secret, but will eventually have to find a reborn confidence of facing those in whom she loves on a personal level. When seemingly stumbling upon the man she has feelings for, Nino Quincampoix, a man who, like herself, finds pleasure in helping others, she loses her confidence to act face to face and begins to speak the only language of love she knows: secret gift-giving. She slowly begins overcoming her fear of love by taking healthy risks in order to acquire her desire. A specific metaphysical sequence that helps demonstrate how she overcomes this fear is when she rides the carnival ride from hell; Nino's work environment. Hell is often associated with feelings of fear, anxiety, or any other emotional vices labeled as causing pain or discomfort. The idea that Amelie is stepping out of her comfort zonea ride from hellknowing full well the risk she is taking of potentially being rejected, demonstrates her willingness to suspend her fear and embrace a resilient sense of moral courage.<br/><br/>Another moment that helps her gather the courage to overcome her fear of rejection is when the artist known as ""the glass man"", sends her a video tape commanding her not to let him pass, lest her heart later in life becomes as brittle as his bones. By the end of the film, she has taken enough chances and learned from her mistakes of not allowing fear to dominate her choices (i.e. denying who she was to Nino at the restaurant). Consequently, she is found nestled in the warmth of Nino's arms.<br/><br/>Filmmaker's Purpose.<br/><br/>Jeunet's purpose in making this film is to convey the following message: Every person wants to leave their mark upon the world and be remembered in the highest possible esteem. For most this is achieved by bringing forth good and honorable works so that others might see those works and emulate the same. It is a message of understanding the positive repercussions of karma and how continuing to perpetuate good will unto mankind leads to ultimate happiness.<br/><br/>Certain aesthetical elements help support this theme. The diegetic music played from a record player in the subway station during Amelie's first encounter with the blind man sings as follows: ""How could I live; never to know the joy that you give; when I'm in your arms; I'm under your charms."" The fact that the blind man is holding the record player is symbolic of a prayer he is giving to the world. The lyrics help foreshadow the joys and charms that Amelie will yet present to the blind man prayer when later helping him cross the street, describing in immaculate detail the vibrant scenery he has never experienced.<br/><br/>A specific camera movement and supplementary special effect is also used during the blind man sequence in the street. After helping him along the way and describing to him the delicate scene, Amelie leaves the man to ponder for himself what just took place. The camera is on a crane and is looking down upon the man as he looks heavenward. It's as if he's looking to God, expressing his thanks for the kindness just granted to him. To make the moment even more surreal, a special effect is used to highlight the man's surrounding in a brilliant fire-like glow. He has certainly been touched by the love of mankind, or better stated, the love of God. The viewer is left to assume that the man's life was affected for the better, restoring his confidence in mankind and perpetuating his own good will onto others."
"robert-temple-1","10","2","6","1 January 2008"," The Perfect Rendering of Imagination as Reality
","What can anybody say about this magical film which has not already been said? I saw it again and decided there are some things. This film has deep roots in a rich tradition of reality-as-imagination, as portrayed in French literature and poetry. It evokes the 'impossibile realities' of Andre Breton's romantic surrealist novel 'Nadja', together with its love of the mystery of certain Paris locations. As so much of the film takes place at the Gare de l'Est, which was the favourite haunt of the unique poet and writer of 'glimpses', Leon-Paul Fargue, the film draws much from his eccentric imaginative tradition too. And as anyone knows who has read the magnificent 27 volume novel 'Men of Good Will' by Jules Romains, as I have, that tale recounts the communication between two young lovers by means of signs and messages posted in public places, just as we see in this film. Whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director, is aware of these things consciously in the way that he must be of the many cinematic references he makes, I have no way of knowing. But these things are in the blood and the bone of every Parisian. And although he is a Loire man, Jeunet is a Parisian now. As for the raids which Audrey Tatou makes on Collignon's flat in the film, these are a standard Surrealist activity. I knew well the 'last of the British Surrealists', David Gascoyne (an intimate of Paul Eluard and friend of Breton), as well as his friend Kathleen Raine, a British poetess. Kathleen told me that one time when David was upset with her, he broke into her house in Chelsea and 'staged a Surrealist raid on her home'. He turned all of her furniture upside down and left, - a clear precursor to Audrey Tatou! You breathe these things in the air of Paris, and if you have read any 20th century French literature, these things leap out at you and grab you by your solar plexus until you turn into a Jean-Pierre Jeunet. This film is perfect, everyone in it is perfect, everything about it is perfect, and I won't hear a word or whisper of criticism of it from anyone who doesn't wish a Surrealist raid on his home made in retaliation. Long live the Imagination Liberation Front! Down with the forces of mediocrity and drabness! May there be magic everywhere! And thank you, 'little elf with big eyes like a deer', and thank you, garden gnome who travels the world, and thank you Jeunet, you mischievous fellow and all who sailed in you!"

The events hurtle past, leaving you gasping, but all are playfully fascinating; my personal favourite is the globetrotting gnome which confounds Amélie's father. Even better are the visuals - the movie is crammed full of wonderful images (the cloud photos, the nightlight piggy, the shot where Amélie literally melts, many others) and extraordinary montages. Tautou is hypnotic in the lead, with her graceful neck, cute bob hairdo, innocent smile and wide eyes, but everyone in the cast is good, particularly Merlin as the reclusive Glassman, agonising over his delicate recreations of Renoir's masterpieces, and Dussollier, the clipped, matter-of-fact narrator. Yann Tiersen's piano-accordion music is incredible and, like all great scores, adds so much atmosphere to the film, enriching both the comedy and the melancholy manifold. Stunningly directed by the gifted Jeunet; this being his first movie without his previous writer-director-partner Marc Caro (Delicatessen, La Cité Des Enfants Perdus). Shot all over Paris, this is a wonderful, life-affirming fable to charm all romantic souls everywhere. English title - Amelie."

","To sit and look at this film seems like a series of beautiful pictures, so is its cinematic value. The film had a distinct quirkiness, and a sweet endearing plot line that was admirable. I thought the exploits involving the gnome were ingenious.<br/><br/>It seems to be a conditioned response for all who see Ameliee to immediately love it, find the main character adorable and have a warm fuzzy feeling inside, with all those who don't; set to be on the next trek along the yellow brick road with Dorothy to get a heart from the wizard of Oz. However, while at first glance the film seemed to be about lightening people's lives and helping out others; its main character seems at least slightly unhinged. She did in essence stalk people, and break into houses. sweet? How would you feel if someone was doing that to you right now..."

"marcons60","10","2","6","6 February 2005"," There is an ""Amelie 2"" movie out there- but by whom?
","I need help resolving a mystery around a black-market DVD that I just brought home from Shanghai: It is called ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain 2"", and claims the Coen Bros as script writers. It has a cover closely resembling that of the original Amelie title, but is a completely different movie, even though it claims to be by the same director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The sleeve blurb outlines the storyline (in incorrect English) of what is actually happening in that mysterious movie, which is quite distinct from the original, e.g. different characters, storyline and names. Actually, Audery Tatou plays a character called ""Irene"", there is no Amelie Poulain in that movie at all! Among the mysteries are: The sleeve claims it to be a Miramax release, but I could not find any reference anywhere on websites to do with Coen Bros, director, actors or by Miramax itself. On the other hand, it is a full-feature length professional film production with high technical standards, and undoubtedly Audery Tatou herself is acting in it. However, it has a poor and depressing story line, and is a clear attempt of latching onto the success of Amelie without the visual quirkiness and humorous attention to detail. What is going on here? Has someone assembled a new film out of discarded production material? Is it a secretly produced sequel that turned out so bad that it was swept under the carpet, and subsequently leaked into the Chinese DVD copy circuit? Wondering if you can shed any light on this: Robert Auckland/New Zealand"

","Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet somehow brilliantly manages to make just about every shot in this hauntingly gorgeous film a work of art. Lead actors, Audrey Tatou and Mathieu Kassovitz are seemingly perfect in their respective roles. The cinematography, music and story blend all together in glorious synergy rarely seen in film. The music by Yann Tiersen matches the brilliance and beauty of the film. The fifth time I saw this film was just as exhilarating as the first. The film captures the viewer from almost the very first frame and sweeps you up into Amelie's alternately funny and bittersweet story with expert panache and style. It is a film not to be missed, in my opinion. Definitely in my top 10 favorite films of all time."

And it is a so simple life, that anyone could just take a look and prefer to watch an action movie or something else. But we stay, and we even get involved with her although our distance between the screen world an our world. I laughed, cried, and felt most of her feelings thanks to the pureness of her soul and also thanks to an amazing Audrey Tautou. This movie was a perfect Melody, those that not necessary have too many elements or sounds but the enough to get together in a perfect harmony.<br/><br/>When I said to a friend of mine that ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" was definitely one of my very favorite movies, she gave me an ironic smile and said to me: ""No way...I thought Amelie was a pour little looser..."" I was so mad at her, but then I realize that Amelie seems to reach only one type of people, the kind of people that dreams all the time, that loves to watch the sky at night and also during the daylight, the kind of people that observes most of the things that happen around them and also the kind of people that believes in that one true love. That love that loves in the same stereophonic sound that we do."

","To begin with; if you're the kind of movie-goer who balks at the prospect of enduring a two-hour film in which you have to read the dialogue via subtitles then this review is written for you. I am, I ashamedly confess, cut from the same cloth, and ten times more likely to sit through some slam-bang Hollywood garbage that I've seen a hundred times than some arty little French film, despite how good everyone says it is. It is through this stubborn philosophy that I almost missed out on probably the best film I have seen this year, and what has become one of my favourites of all-time. The intention of this review is to advise others not to make the same mistake and bypass this modern masterpiece.<br/><br/>On paper, it seems unremarkable; the story of a little girl, Amelie, raised by un-loving parents in France, who spends her entire youth without companionship and, as a result, becomes over-imaginative in the extreme. Years later, she moves to the town of Montemart and, while leading a relatively lonely existence, she sets out to improve the lives of those around her in her own unique and special way, while trying to find the love she so desperately craves. Admittedly, the plot does (very) vaguely echo that of Jane Austens' novel 'Emma' (recently adapted for the screen for Gwyneth Paltrow, and modernised in Amy Heckerlings' 'Clueless') but, that aside, this is one of the most strikingly original and wonderful films ever made.<br/><br/>It's a rare occurrence to describe a film as 'perfect', but no other term is appropriate to describe 'Amelie'. To begin with, its central performance from Audrey Tautou is astounding. Child-like, naive and impossibly adorable, it's hard to conceive any other actress in the role (interesting, given the fact that the film was originally written for British actress Emily Watson and the first script treatment was titled 'Emily'). It's difficult to recollect the last time a screen character had such an emotional resonance with an audience; you feel every high and low of the emotional roller-coaster Amelie endures during the story. However, it's not just a one-woman show, and the gifted set of supporting characters  especially Matthieu Kassovitz as love interest Nino and Serge Merlin as the mysterious 'Glass Man' - more than bring the film to life. Even the look of the film is strikingly wonderful, as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet paints the city of Montemart in vivid, lively colours, and animates Amelies' reality-bending imagination perfectly.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that you won't find a more heart-warming, uplifting and flat-out enjoyable film anywhere, never mind in English. Do yourself a favour; don't miss out like I nearly did. Reach for your reading glasses and prepare to be amazed."
"Soysoy","9","2","6","23 March 2004"," The real creative types
","I haven't been thinking about commenting on ""Amelie"" until I recently saw ""Irreversible"". The post-viewing ruminations triggered this input.<br/><br/>I've been admiring Jeunet since his beginnings. A highly creative person, with an (unfortunately) very rare poetic, naïve, sincere approach to storytelling, giving this fresh and heartwarming result found in ""Delicatessen"" and ""La Cité"". Mixed with an obvious passion for highly technical, tricky, difficult filmmaking, not far from DePalma's quasi-neurotic approach, and with a strong European fantasy cultural background, his works are as eccentric, highly personal, immediately recognizable as those from -say- Gilliam, Kubrick or Cronenberg (and Jackson before he sold his soul to the moneymaking system).<br/><br/>Jeunet is really one of a kind, and when looking back in time, I can tell he's been a major influence in filmmaking over the last decade, even if the general public is not aware of this. Quite a lot of cinematic elements from his movies have been borrowed by the Wachowsky brothers, David Fincher, Alex Proyas and other -much lesser- directors. Unfortunately or fortunately, only stylistic elements were borrowed. No one touched the inner soul of his work. The only attempt that I'm aware of is ""Chocolat"" that is, despite Depp's usual greatness and a marvelous script, a laughable inconsistent mess.<br/><br/>In ""Amelie"", it's Jeunet's turn to borrow from another filmmaker's work. Once again, very few people will actually ever notice this, as the source of ""Amelie's"" cinematic structure is inspired from a very obscure, overlooked movie: Garspard Noé's ""Seul contre tous"", which is like ""Amelie""'s evil twin.<br/><br/>These two movies are quite different in tone (that's the least to say) and tell very different stories, but they share something else than a quasi-identical editing structure: the will to awake something that's asleep deep within our minds, a part of us we have chosen to forget since our adolescence, because the western societies wants us to be ""adults"".<br/><br/>Jeunet has always been obsessed with this paradoxical notion of ""childhood"" and ""maturity"". He already tried to teach us a lesson in ""La Cité.."", during the confrontation between Miette and Krank: the older character is the immature one, and the younger one is the mature one. The extraordinary (and technically beautiful) metaphor of Krank turning into an infant as Miette turns into an old woman is the climax of Jeunet's essay. The message is clear: we, ""adults"", are missing an important part of our personality by putting our inner child in standby mode, and more than this, we are actually less mature because of this.<br/><br/>I tend to agree with Jeunet, and the fact that so many people were genuinely, deeply moved by ""Amelie"", much more than by the ordinary ""sentimental"" mush the movie industry feeds us, seems to prove that indeed, something in us is waiting to be awaken. Something that Noé, with ""Seul contre tous"", tries to awake too, but with a very different, much more intellectual -though heavily brutal- method.<br/><br/>""Amelie""'s success is a slap in the face of all those who claim they know what the public wants, and produce soapy, unpersonal, vapid, glossy but empty stereotyped stuff. See: give them some real poetry, they actually LOVE it. So much for the cynical idea that the public only eats s***t.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Gaspard Noé (who's responsible for the mind-blowing, utterly upsetting, thought-provoking and highly controversial ""Irréversible"") are the real creative types of today's European cinema now that Almodovar totally lost control and Bertrand Blier gets so multi-layered that his movies should come with a 2 inches-thick user's manual (yet his ""Un, deux, trois soleil"" stays IMO one of the best European movies ever). Oh and Kubrick is not around anymore (sob).<br/><br/>Jeunet feeds us with rejuvenating magical poetry, Noé feeds us with upsetting but essential ethic questionings. Both work with a high level of abstraction, an uncompromising attitude, and a very impressive cinematic vocabulary. They totally compliment each other. Let's hope they'll keep on making more and more and more great stuff."
"hewa-1","Null","2","6","3 November 2002"," Magic Realism meets Chuck Jones
","Well, ""Amelie"" at least allows me to forget ""Alien Resurrection"".<br/><br/>I'm a huge Jeunet fan, or to be more precise, a Jeunet/Caro fan. City of Lost Children and Delicatessen are two of my favorite films from the last ten years in which they were probably the most visually inventive and influential directors around. Films like ""The Matrix"" stole gratuitously from their visual aesthetic. Those films were nutty sci-fi/comedy/adventures where Amelie rests in more commonplace ground (albeit `Magic Realist'). It bears an almost too-close resemblance to the genre represented by ""You've Got Mail"", except Jenuet's filmmaking is far more vibrant and the laughs more genuine than in such spit-polished mainstream fare. There was also an honest and buried melancholy in Amelie which I stayed with. Of course there were plenty of bits that plastered a dumb smile on your face.<br/><br/>In ""Delicatessan"" and ""City of Lost Children"" there was in several sections of helter-skelter action, almost impossible to follow in the first viewing. In `City', there was one brilliant comic/cosmic moment where the girl's teardrop set off a chain of ludicrously logical actions that resulted in saving her life. Another scene in it had one where a group of child thieves retrieved a key in a door with a ridiculously complicated scheme. Much of ""Amelie"" is an extension in spirit of those two sequences from ""City""; mad chains of association like Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng used to essay in. Jeunet had been toying with such connections-of-fate right through those first two films, and here he took them to hyperbolic lengths (still preferable to the excruciatingly self-conscious ""Run Lola Run"").<br/><br/>In the insane breadth of modern life, Jeunet senses, there are grand chains of causality. Mathieu Kassovitz's Nino is a passive observer of one such chain, searching for his favored traces (the torn-up photos) in his attempts to make out something of its shape. He collects and studies these totems that tease him with practically unsolvable questions, like the identity of the mystery man, and gets an emotional kick out of this monument to chance and isolation.<br/><br/>Amelie, on the other hand, seeks to be a whole chain in herself; invisibly she tried to alter lives and manipulate events. She wants to be a glorious mystery. The price she willingly pays for this is self-erasure. Where Nino, dumped into reality by childhood brutality, has reduced himself to an observant speck in the urban cosmos, Amelie, the lonely sprite, having brought herself up in a fantasy universe, naturally expresses herself through interventions that make her something resembling a meddling Greek goddess or Fury. The drama of the piece then is in seeing Amelie try to re-integrate herself with reality (in love with Nino) without too much pain. Only Amelie can fulfill Nino's quest because she plays with omnipotence. But it costs her much, too, as much as it fulfills her; she sees her plans occasionally wobble, fail, and become tragic (like the romance she sets up only to see it slide into destructive, repetitive behavior). It's an almost theological question - is this what God goes through six billion times a day? But it's clear what Jeunet's thesis is; his filmmaking is equivalent to Amelie's dreaming and subsequent actions, they're both weavers of intoxicating magic.<br/><br/>That's really all the drama there was and it was a might thin for the film's length (about twenty minutes too long), but there were very solid, affecting emotional strands in the work; often it was like a meditation of forms of alienation and sorrow, lump-in-the-throat worthy, and it surprises me when people comment that it's all so lightweight. I was glad Jeunet didn't try to wrap everything up neat. The scene where the couple have love-starved sex in the toilet causing the café to shudder was nearly up there with the bedspring scene from ""Delicatessan"" (to which there was a neat reference also in the film). Indeed, was a genuinely laugh-out-loud comedy, the first I've seen in - I don't know how long. However, some of its comic bits, funny as they were (like the gnome in the international photos), seemed, well, second-hand. Much of the film was an almost mechanical process of watching Amelie set up her plans. There was a dizzying flow of information offset by what was actually a very simple little yarn of lovelorn not-quite-losers in the big city. Like Amelie herself, it was ostentatiously modest. Despite the superficial modernity, the film like ""City"" and ""Delicatessen"" was set in some weird netherworld between now and 1950 (a more innocent act really than all those French Socialist newspapers claimed) with a shimmering vision of a surviving cozy Paris full of cozy Gallic types, looking for the good heart even in the grindingly staid bourgeoisie (like Amelie's parents) that are usually the complete anathema to French artists.<br/><br/>I agree with the general proposition that this film was about twenty minutes too long. I felt the weight mostly in the middle; I was thinking ""Come along Mr Jeunet, tighten the pace a touch."" All those speed-cinema tricks do not actually make for a fast film. Jeunet's films always have a love of eccentric humanity but gosh darn it I miss those apocalyptic landscapes and the harder edge Marc Caro used to give. Plenty of Edible French Chic here but not so much nouveau cuisine as a fine chocolate liqueur. Not, thankfully, a complete souflee."

Amélie is the friend who everybody of us dreams to have: a sweet, tender, always available, innocent, pure-hearted girl with who you can share your fears, joy and sorrow and from who you can learn how to enjoy small pleasures of life.<br/><br/> Thanks to the magic setting in a cleaned-up and romantic Paris, to the inscrutable simplicity of the characters, but mainly to the skillful interpretation of this wonderful new star Audrey Tautou finally we have a new reference point in the universe of the good cinema. Nothing in common with Hollywood's millionaire, overrated crap!<br/><br/> I'm sad Amélie has been so underevaluated at the Césars and at the Academy Awards, but the biggest success comes from the public, this is the most important success of this great movie.

Not.<br/><br/>I had a distinct feeling that to really appreciate this movie, it would have helped if<br/><br/>(1) my mastery of French were better. (Even with my smattering of French, it seemed that the subtitles weren't quite as accurate as they might have been. Maybe someone else here who's fluent can address this.)<br/><br/>(2) I had a better understanding of French culture. (Somehow I didn't think that would be necessary for this film, based on the reviews. I was wrong.) As with most French films I've seen, this one left me feeling that you had to be French to really appreciate the humor, the situations, etc.  In fact, partway through the film, little thoughts began popping up in my mind, for example: ""If this had been an American film, she would never have done *this*, she would have done *that*"", and so on.<br/><br/>
The movie had its moments of charm.  And Amelie was nice to look at.<br/><br/>
But--and I add this strictly for Americans who might be wondering about whether to see this film or not--I don't think this film is quite as accessible to your average American as the reviews may lead you to believe.

The mechanism in which the film is based to tell the story and to show all the scenes seems awesome to me, everything happens like if we were looking at a production chain in a factory. Also, the fact that the story is that unusual and funny, make this even better as we do not expect at all what is going to happen again.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the fact that the story is not told neither by Amélie nor by a normal narrator but by a narrator who knows more than us and predicts what is going to happen, is one of the best points of this film. At some points during the film, the narrator says what is going to happen in the next few seconds or even in other scenes so, it is funny to know more or less funny to be watching a movie which seems like a realistic novel where we are even inside the head of the characters.

","It is a difficult task to capture the internal monologue of an introvert; many of whom are often chocked down to bookish and obnoxious- this experience was as natural as breathing. Amelie comes across as well rounded, interesting and dynamic. The characterization is clever, not overly explained and the imagery gives the viewer some credit in its decryption. I also find this to be one of the few films that gives credit to the massive internal world of children and explores in depth how a character's child- mind grows with her. A stunning, vivid world and a stunning mind well explored and perfectly represented in imagery and music."

"mar9","9","1","2","13 February 2002"," Romance is alive...
","... but this film could easily be regarded as the category killer of the romantic comedy genre. There are very few ways that anyone could make a better ""boy meets girl"" film than ""Amelie"". It makes the endless succession of Hollywood romantic comedies look dull and ordinary by comparison.<br/><br/>But what a curious pedigree! The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, gave us bizarre nightmares and post-apocalyptic alienation in ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"", although it must be said that both of those films include beautiful romantic moments. ""Amelie"" retains some of the surreal elements of the two earlier films, but there is a lightness of spirit about Amelie that sets it apart and makes it something truly special.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou gives a magnificent performance as the quirky, clever, but intensely shy Amelie. We believe that we truly understand her as she secretly makes changes in the lives of those around her, playing matchmaker for some, bringing unlooked-for happiness, punishing the wicked with impish glee, but when it comes to her own pleasure and happiness, we see her torment and feel her pain as she is unable to make that crucial final step. How the Academy failed to recognise the quality of this performance with a Best Actress nomination is frankly incomprehensible. I note BAFTA among others got it right.<br/><br/>There is much more to like about this film. The ensemble supporting cast, music, cinematography, the curious use of colour (Jeunet films are alike in this respect, the look like no-one else's), the narration - just enough of it without being intrusive. I have very few criticisms. The subtitling can be a challenge to read at times and I thought at least one translation could have been better. This is hardly a fault with the original film, however, just the barrier of language. Finally, a small reprimand to Jeunet for reprising the classic bonking scene from ""Delicatessen"". It just wasn't as funny the second time around. Otherwise, great film, see it. If you don't like it, you have no soul."

","I tend not to write comments on well-reviewed films which I have myself hugely enjoyed.  It is when I feel somewhat let down that I want to analyse why.  It is certainly not because I despise sentimentality (I am a notorious weeper at movies, even in the happy bits) or I don't like foreign films (because I see many).  I found the first half an hour or so absolutely hilarious, funnier than anything I have seen recently.  But after a while I felt irritation building.  I found myself feeling that Amelie was unnecessarily toying with Nino, and I felt that I didn't know her well enough as a real person to sympathise with her actions.  When I lost some touch with the story around the middle, the style of film-making became overwhelming and I was noticing that style rather than the action. I found myself preferring the somewhat more naturalistic scenes in the cafe than Amelie's doings.  There was much I liked (including the globetrotting gnome and the matter-of-fact porn shop) and I did enjoy it much more than many films I have seen recently, but I still cannot feel part of the general feeling of love shown by most reviewers."

","I don't normally see that many foreign films because it is annoying hearing silly languages and having to read subtitles. But after all I heard about this film I decided to see it, and it turns out to be probably my favourite foreign film. Amélie (the weird looking, but quite attractive BAFTA nominated Audrey Tautou) is a lonely young girl who discovers a secret box in her house, and after returning it to the owner and touching him, she becomes a do-gooder. The main reason this is a good foreign film is the good use of French jokes and the sex comedy like format. For me, it is like a French version of American Pie crossed with When Harry Met Sally. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Yann Tiersen, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, the David Lean Award for Direction for Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien: Resurrection), Best Film and Best Film not in the English Language, it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

"Coventry","Null","3","12","18 December 2003"," The ""magic"" of this one is completely lost on me...
","'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' was on my ""avoid like the plague""-list ever since it got released. Just because I know for a fact that I don't like stuff like this and everybody else DOES. And if I share my opinion on it then, everybody hates me... And I hate it when I'm right. It was on TV recently and while everyone praised it...I was forcing myself not to moan too loud.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I can't be too harsh. I'm the first to admit that Amélie has several good and refreshing elements in it. But those are just the details of the story and the side aspects of the characters. The complete plot and moral of this movie is crap in my opinion. Just another feelgood movie that tries to convince people that life is - in fact - beautiful and a terrible thing to waste. If you look beyond the lovely settings and the adorable portrayal of Amélie, it's just another dull mixture of love, sentiment and relationships. Predictable and everlasting... On the other hand, if you're a fan of innovating and original cinema, you could see this movie as a satisfying experience. Like I said before, several small aspects in this movie are very pleasing and sometimes even brilliant. The style of the voice over, for example, is a real plus. A solid male voice brightens up the story, constantly using the same type of voice. The seriousness of his voice is really funny and the useless stuff he explains is really intriguing. Also, every personality that walks through the screen has his own strange characteristics and it's a real joy to discover them all. In my opinion, these are the only few points that makes this movie worth looking at.<br/><br/>
In conclusion...I'm not at all saying that Amélie is overrated. Because - let's be honest - how can you overrate a movie that has been made with a limited budget and an overload of goodwill and creativity ? But it certainly is overhyped !! Basically, it's only stuff that lonely housewives and teenagers with a broken heart dig. Explorers of special cinema will like it up till a certain level, but that's it..."

"st-shot","9","2","7","13 November 2007"," A Whimsical Paris Tale
","Amelie as it is known in the states is a warm sweet tale of a young Parisian girl who decides to practice random acts of kindness with neighbors and strangers. The thought aside, it is Amelie's methods that give the film its joie de vivre as she races around Paris concocting ideas that will bring a little light into the otherwise melancholy, hum-drum existence of co-workers, a concierge, a blind man and a stranger that she reconnects to his past. All does not go according to plan in some instances but that only adds to the infectious frenetic pace that transitions so well between reality and fantasy.<br/><br/>As Amelie, waif like Audrey Tautou resembles a young Audrey Hepburn with a more impish demeanor and devious streak. All her acts are not out of kindness and an act of revenge on a fruit seller is comic and ingenious. With a character and look that falls somewhere between Chaplin and Giulietta Masina in La Strada it remains impossible not to fall for her charm.<br/><br/>Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's assemblage is tour de force. His opening montage of scenes that reveals Amelie's life growing up is skillfully edited and juxtaposed with a narration delivered at a break neck speed that dilutes the gloom with dark humor. His excessive use of wide angle and tracking shots and zooms all seem appropriate to a style that bursts with energy throughout. The music score partners wonderfully with the pace and it gives the film an even more joyful trajectory. He also utilizes the Paris setting well (especially the Sacre Coeur area)without becoming self conscious. Part of the film's attraction lies in the great city but Jeunet never let's it get in the way of his characters. <br/><br/>Amelie may be populated by glum, lonely people and topics that deal with loss of opportunity and dreams but Jeunet's audacious style turns it into a celebration of life by providing what Amelie does for those around her. Escape."

Does it always have to be about screaming and crying in heavy tears to earn a nomination, what is wrong with comedy? Didn't Audrey Hepburn win an Oscar for a role just like Audrey Tautou's nearly 50 years ago, well I gotta say back then the academy had a little bit of sense among its members.<br/><br/>And have you guys seen the last 15 minutes of the movie; it was 15 minutes from heaven I mean that was the best romance you can get ever.<br/><br/>Thank god the Bafta awards gave this masterpiece the justice it deserved, and you members of the academy just keep your statues for your selves."

And after the discovery or a long forgotten treasure, she decides to make people's lives happier, the small way.<br/><br/>This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. The cinematography, characters and storyline especially are wonderfully shot and developed. The opening scene has to be one of the best. It dictates Amélie's childhood (a very good place to begin, if I may say so myself). It describes her pleasures, troubles (or rather her parents troubles) and the main events, which took place (such as her suicidal fish). You fall in love with her instantly. You feel for her: pity her, admire her. Amélie is a dreamer who never grows up.<br/><br/>This film is almost impossible to describe. Amélie's love for small details is obviously a love the writer/s have passed on from their own fascinations and the details are abundant. Every person Amélie touch's life changes.

","I will keep this pretty brief. There are way too many things to say about this excellent work of art. In my opinion, this film is a ""Perfect 10"". In a nutshell, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius, and ""Amelie"" is a masterpiece. After I saw this film, I purchased ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"", and fell in love with Jeunet's style. I am a 40 year old American male and my friends are all action and scifi lovers (I love a lot of that also), and they are perplexed that this is my favorite all-time film. I have turned quite a few people on to Amelie, and most of them are shocked to find out that foreign films are much more beautiful and cerebral than most of the garbage that Hollywood puts out. Now that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has opened the door in the U.S., it is my hope that more foreign films get a fair shot in American theaters.<br/><br/>If you like this film, check out Jeunet's aforementioned titles and also ""A Very Long Engagement"" - it also stars the beautiful and incomparable Audrey Tautou and a couple of others from ""Amelie""."
"Mr-Brightside","9","2","7","20 June 2007"," Sweet perfection.
","Possibly the most beautiful film in cinematic history; hats off to whomever the cinematographer was because Paris, despite all its beauty has never looked so magical.<br/><br/>From beginning to end I was mesmerised by just how rich each and every colour was, how strategically placed every filter was and how apt each scene was in putting forth the colours that reflected the feelings being conveyed. Paris became more than just a backdrop, Paris became yet another protagonist for us to fall in love with, yet another protagonist who's narrative became beyond engaging and impossible to resist and yet another protagonist who's arc mattered. It truly is a showcase in all that is great (of what little there is) about the French; overtly indulgent, pompous to an almost unbearable degree but underneath all the bravado ridiculously charming at its inner most core. A stunning achievement in visual mastery.<br/><br/>Juxtaposed with this is the insanely charming lead Audrey Tatu. So lost is she on finding fulfilment for others that she seemingly forgets about finding it for herself. The beauty of the performance and the writing is that whilst she never openly craves it we, now living vicariously through this most lovable of characters, route for her to become emblazoned with the amorous feelings she so craves for those around her. The perfect example of how the primary protagonist of any feel-good film should be wrote and performed. Amelie could well claim to created an archetype; the character that is actually impossible to dislike, but is still as multi-faceted as any character in cinema.<br/><br/>An infinitely charming and infectious piece that manages to warm the very cockles of this most cold of hearts."
"pastellation","Null","2","7","28 April 2007"," discovering life's little miracles
","about a year ago, I saw a movie that quite literally changed my life and went on to become one of my favorite movies. Ever. Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, or Amelie for short.<br/><br/>It's this 2-hour-long, little French movie directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet in 2001 that has become one of the world's most endearing movies in history. There's a certain charming, whimsical quality about it that just makes me want to cry, laugh, and sigh at the same time. The most intriguing thing about it is that it is made entirely in French. The fact that this wholly French movie gained such prestige in an English-speaking country illustrates just how powerful it is.<br/><br/>The movie has a very simple plot, entailing the journeys an innocent girl named Amelie Poulain has when one day she decides to help those around her. Amelie takes pleasure in the little things in life: cracking open creme brulee with a teaspoon, dipping her hands into an open sack of beans, or looking at people's expressions in the dark during a movie. She likes her solitude; she doesn't talk to many people and her only friend is a painter named Dufayel who paints the same Renoir painting day after day. <br/><br/>One day, she decides to enrich people's lives by doing little, mischievous things. She helps a blind person cross the street and describes very vividly and beautifully the various sights on the streets, letting the blind person ""see"" for a couple of moments. She helps two people find love at the café where she works as a waitress. She plays a trick with a garden gnome so that she can convince her father to fulfill his lifelong wish: to travel the world. Amelie is so busy trying to assist other people that she overlooks her own life. When she falls in love with a man just as eccentric as she is who collects old Photomaton pictures, she seems to unable to overcome her own shyness to approach. She cannot take charge of her own life and can only dream romantically of the life she could have with him. Amelie needs to confront this man in order to make these dreams reality. It's a very quirky movie, but the little quirks are what make it so enchanting and childlike.<br/><br/>I am in love with everything about this movie. The cinematography is pure genius, capturing camera angles to achieve the most dizzying and fantastic effects. One of my favorite shots is at the beginning of the movie where Amelie is skipping stones at a canal and all of a sudden it switches from a high-angle shot of the bridge to a low-angle shot of the trickling water below. Visually, the effect is stunning. And the soundtrack. Oh wow, it's indescribable. I can sit at my desk and pop my headphones on and be instantly transported back into Amelie's dream world, in shades of reds and greens where tiny miracles happen.<br/><br/>This movie has really changed my outlook on life. I think everybody has a little Amelie in them, marveling at life's ironies and truly appreciating the small things life has to offer. Each action is something wondrous, from the wind moving the wine glasses the crunch of newly fallen snow beneath your feet. You just have to learn to reach for that moment where you really feel alive and free. Every time I see the movie (which is really more than I ought to, I can practically memorize the dialog now), I walk away a little wiser, a little happier, and a little less cynical. We all have had our hopes and dreams shattered, we have all had to endure the little heartbreaks that simply go with life, but Amelie showed me to celebrate the small moments that I do have. For life is ephemeral, a collage of a million little things to cherish, and it is too short to walk around in with your eyes tightly shut.<br/><br/>Amelie isn't one of those ""everything's breezy"" films where nothing ever goes wrong; it's has its sad, poignant moments, just as life does. Life has its ups and downs, but the movie taught me to take what life hands me and revel in the little marvels it has to offer."

I use the phrase ""the most (positive adjective) movie I've ever seen"" a lot, but I cannot emphasize the happiness I felt while watching this film. There are few movies, no, few situations period that I'll be a part of that make an unconscious smile appear on my face while they are happening; Amelie is one of them. The movie brims with heart, emotion, and an overall appreciation for life and humanity. Seeing the world through Amelie's eyes, her own beautiful perspective (which dies in most of us through the rigors of maturity and the passage of time) is as refreshing an emotion as can be experienced. When Amelie succeeds in her plans, we are as happy with her as she is; when she hurts, we hurt. Crying in films is usually reserved for tragedy, or a bittersweet departure, but I found myself crying at the sheer uplifting beauty that's crammed into every minute of this film. To call Amelie a ""good movie"" is an insult to the movie's strength of heart. To call Amelie herself a beautiful, shining spirit is a vast understatement; she'll charm you like no other character in film. A classic."

After a rather mediocre, if somewhat underrated Alien: Resurrection, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is back on form. The film is striking with delicious colours; the cinematography is truly first rate and every frame is like a perfectly taken Polaroid. And to accompany such beautiful visuals is the wonderful and uplifting instrumental music by Yann Tiersen, with these quality elements in place the mood is set for Amelie's story.<br/><br/>Played by Audrey Tautou flawlessly, Amelie is one of most endearing characters in cinema history. I don't want to give too much away about the storyline, but this is a romantic comedy that is easy to stomach, even for the most hardened thrill seeking movie goer, in essence, unless you have no heart at all, Amelie should win you over. I make a final esteemed mention about the narration throughout the film by André Dussollier, the recitation complements the movies eccentric charm and is a very nice touch.

(Audrey is too ... yep.. no word would be enough.<br/><br/>Introduction of characters by talking about their idiosyncracies immortalises them in the viewers mind; Interesting quotes and wise sayings; the stories of all the characters so well patched together.. and of course the background score is unforgettable. In every respect, a movie nobody should dare to miss."
"JiaQiLi","9","2","7","18 January 2007"," Fabulous Journeys for Amelie and Me!
","I prefer the French title because its meaning is much more relevant to the film. I first watched ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" (The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) in a theatre five years ago. The film has gradually faded away since then. I have recently encountered it in Toronto's second hand market. I purchased it because I want to acquire some comedies. ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" not only fulfills my wish, but it also brings many more elements to me. I am glad to purchase it on DVD at a very low price while regretting for overlooking it after my first viewing.<br/><br/>First, the use of colour is fabulous. This film is so colourful that it builds up the humorous sequences. The colours are appropriate but they do not exaggerate. They make the film bright and optimistic, which are the atmosphere that I experience.<br/><br/>Second, this film conveys a message while being a comedy. I like comedies that has a meaning instead of mere laughs because characters act in stupid and exaggerated manners. ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" talks about Amelie changing other people's lives. She recaptures a man's childhood memories. She brings a man out of his obsession over his ex-girlfriend. She punishes oppressors (somewhat a social justice activist). I am impressed that she is so multi-dimensional. The film provokes me to reflect on how I can change other people's lives. I believe that everyone of us can play the role of Amelie.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou was awesome playing Amelie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes the right decision by casting her after Emily Watson is unable to fulfill the role. I think that Tautou is much more suitable than Watson because Tautou's native background is French.<br/><br/>While ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" has many funny moments, I am most impressed by its tragic beginning. Amelie had a tragic childhood according to the standard of average people. She does not dwell in the tragedies throughout her lives. Instead, she opens herself to a personal journey, albeit small and coincidental. While we can change other people's lives, we can look around us. Some small and negligible incidents can change our lives."
"jaasalanis","10","2","7","6 January 2007"," Charming!!
","I have seen movies about romance and honeyed things, but Amelie overcomes any movie about this topic. Simply incredible! without words to explain this masterpiece. A simple story about Amelie (a terrific Audrey Tautou) a girl who notices how to make feel well to another people, but she is not completely happy yet.<br/><br/>With this argument, Jean Pierre Jeunet builds a tale combining fantasy and surreal elements with live and real action. We know how Amelie feels through her fabulous way to see the life. Amelie falls in love with Nino and literally melts when she sees Him; and her strange but gorgeous and charming way to captivate his attention turns out simply wonderful, and makes to the movie a story worthy for watching every time when you feel so sad.<br/><br/>You must see it!!"

Crafty and sublime. I was just overwhelmed while watching it, it amazed me from the beginning all the way to the end. Not just the story but technically with the camera work, the color tone, the perfect cast.<br/><br/>Brilliant Jean Pierre Jeunet.

It is a very private movie, and I guess that so many people like it, because it shows all the little things that we realize but don't think about. Amelie shows what could happen to us if we *would* think about these little things.<br/><br/>Some people mentioned that this movie could change your life and of course, like everything else it could change it.

I keep watching it on DVD when I feel down and it cheers me up. <br/><br/>The colours in the movie, the cinematography, the amazing direction of Jeunet, the wonderful soundtrack and most of all the fabulous and so full of expression Audrey Tautou,made this movie one of my personal all time favourites.

It is conveyed with such warmth, it makes the world seem a much simpler place. But it isn't just the storyline that gives a warm and fuzzy feeling. The wit and style of the constantly moving camera, the constant flow of happiness and colour show an image much more clearly than a bunch of words ever could. This is a work of beauty, each frame crafted perfectly. One moment you're crying the next you're laughing. A brilliant painting of a vibrant city.<br/><br/>Bon appetit."

But all agree that this was a beautiful movie, whether of not you speak French. <br/><br/>The storyline is easy to follow, for one. A lot of foreign films have a tendency to be hard to follow and very complex, which can be discouraging for people. The storyline of Amelie is complex, but not confusing. It is easy to follow all the the characters and situations (due much to the delightful way Jeunet decided to introduce them), but not so easy as to be boring. <br/><br/>Honestly, I could watch this without the subtitles and be completely satisfied. The beautiful colors and sets, as well as the music, are something to experience within themselves."

","AmÃ©lie Poulain is a hidden mountain treasure discovered only by the eyes of children's and adults which have rediscovered their innocence. It's magic, poetry that Jean-Pierre Jeunet has written, not a script. This was a long time since I haven't felt so free after a movie (Le Grand Bleu, L'Ours, La Vita Ã¨ Bella): lightness, decency on love we give every day. Each time I watch it a notice a hidden secret: it can be a position of a character, a color and apparently inexplicable face expression. It's a chef d'oeuvre and comment it too much will damage it.

You need to see the movie twice to notice all those wonderful and funny little details. This is a real ""Masterpiece"" and a very modern ""Year 2000"" Fairy Tail. The photography is brilliant and the scenery too. Too bad it missed the Oscar because it would have made the movie immortal (although it will never die on me :-)). And now that I have it on DVD I know I will enjoy it for a very long time to come. I can recommend this movie to everybody. Just sit down, relax and give it a second run. You'll be in for a big surprise. A sincere ""thank you"" to the entire crew who made this wonderful movie."

","For me this film was a bit to arty, I'm not saying i didn't like it because there were some impressive camera shots and angles which made it good to look at. This film opened a few stories and explored them a little bit but did'not go into a lot of depth about what was going on or why. I liked the narrator all the way thru the film as he provided a lot of the main story and kept u informed of what was going on if u missed something in it Audrey Tautou played her role very well as the shy french girl doing good deeds. The film wasn't really my type but for others it may be the best film they have viewed.<br/><br/>These are my opinions and the film has good points and bad points but i wont say what they are because that would be a spoiler which isn't allowed<br/><br/>lecture over!"
"Quinoa1984","7","2","7","29 December 2001"," cute, weird, it's France
","Amelie is a film that may appeal more to some than others; those who are devourees of the French cinema food plate will really enjoy this one, those who don't might still find it amusing in it's visual humor and Tautou's incredible charm.  And that overall is what makes this somewhat even is Tautou's performance as Amelie, a sad waitress who hasn't had the most normal or happy life she could ask for who starts to give joy to others around her and thus to herself.  Lighthearted throughout with the main drag being the constant third person narration (it almost makes the story better to tell in a book than in a movie, but what can you do?) B+"

","Normally when someone tells me a movie is a ""feel good film"" or is ""heartwarming"" I make sure not to see it. Most of these films are clichÃ© with boring characters and sappy dialogue. This one is different.<br/><br/>Even though I prefer Tarantino films over romantic comedies, I can't deny that this left me smiling like no film has ever done. Others have pointed out that there are parts that are unrealistic. This is true, but is not a fault--the film has magic and magic deserves a creative license.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while the film isn't actually laugh-out-loud funny, it will make you laugh on the inside, not to mention make you feel good about life. And when a movie can so masterfully make an audience feel good about who they are and find beauty in the mundane--it's one you don't want to miss."

""Amelie"" is all of that and more.It is ,in fact,sui generis.It provides Mlle Audrey Tatou the role of a lifetime as the eponymous heroine,a naive and kind - hearted young Parisienne determined to bring happiness to peoples' lives whether they want it or not. Now you will either buy into this or you won't.Simple as that.But I suspect that if there is an ounce of romance and optimism in your soul ""Amelie"" will reach out to it.

","This has to be my favourite film of all time, and the comment given by a critic which is printed on the front of the DVD case states - ""quite simply its PERFECT"" and i honestly agree. This is what love stories should be about, forget about the romantic comedies that are regurgitated every year, all of them loosely basing themselves on one another. This story of a recluse who falls in love at first sight and through imaginative and wonderful ways she allows him to fall in love with her...without them even meeting. Amelie is the sweet girl who cares of other people's happiness above her own, a trait that maybe more of us should adopt. She sets out to make people happy and set their mind at rest. <br/><br/>The interlocking of other characters stories is refreshing such as the gnome which travels the world, a boss of a cafÃ© with one leg shorter than the other, and an old man with brittle bones, to the painting by Renoir with the girl with the glass that is mirrored to Amelie's life. <br/><br/>The cinematography is incredible, the use of colours such as the green and yellow tones add an alien dimension to the film allowing it to look more beautiful than it actually is. This film is a beauty in more ways than one and i cannot praise it enough.

","AMELIE (2001) **** Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Yolande Moreau, Artus de Penguern, Urbain Cancelier, Maurice Benichou, Dominique Pinon, Claude Perron, Michel Robin, Isabelle Nanty, Clotilde Mollet, Claire Maurier, Serge Merlin, Jamel Debbouze.  (Dir: Jean-Pierre Jeunet) FRENCH W/SUBTITLES<br/><br/>Ever since Audrey Hepburn has passed critics and film pundits alike have been trying with great effort (and no reward) to bestow her gamine crown to another actress along the likes of Irene Jacob, Anne Parillaud, Juliette Binoche, Julia Ormond, Rachael Leigh Cook and even Julia Roberts as possible heirs to the throne of romantic comedy.  Well stop the presses.  We have a winner in the amiable, flawlessly pretty French over-night-sensation that is Audrey Tautou, an utterly fetching and undeniably sexy comic actress with Ms. Hepburn's innocence tainted by curious frivolity.  That's just what is on display in full force to be reckoned with in this frothy fairy tale<br/><br/>
As the titular innocent Amelie is a precocious yet well-meaning romantic at heart who makes it her life's work to intrude on others' lives ; that is by making changes for the good and positive to friends, strangers (and even enemies) alike.  Her whole life has been about enjoying the simple things and their unique calming qualities that she wishes were encompassed by all around her.  She helps a blind man cross the street vividly describing all imagery that they pass; she gets even with the browbeating produce market manager by infiltrating his apartment and making subtle adjustments to his daily life like changing the sizes of his bedroom slippers and adding sugar to his liquor cabinet's stock; she finds herself fixing up the local stalker with the addled hypochondriacal cashier in the diner she works as a waitress.  Ultimately Amelie's destiny is to make life more pleasant and in the process for the first time in her lively existence despite her loneliness, falls in love. The object of her affection is an odd fellow who she spies in the metro sweeping up torn pieces of photos from one of those sit for a quarter 4 poses machines for travelers to take snapshots of themselves.  Nino (Kassovitz) is a quiet man who uses the scraps to fill a huge album of memories of complete strangers in a weird art-as-life metaphor for how we all should perceive life in general: passing by in a sea of faceless strangers (that is giving credence to those we don't know as being significant). The latter is well on display here as Amelie lives her carefree lifestyle by doling out personal chores of goodwill and its charm is that she is self-less and even self-deprecating.   The fact that she is cute as a button doesn't hurt her either as she befriends many unlikely companions including an elderly brittle man in her apartment complex who invites her in to see his life-long preoccupation of re-creating paintings from memories of exhibits he saw in his past. The humor is also on full throttle in the sarcastic interplay with many of the denizens of the picaresque Montmatre and Paris particularly with the diner inhabitants and one hysterical running gag with Amelie's practical joke on her reserved father involving her abduction of his garden gnome by giving it an international jaunt and her father receiving snapshots by mail of the statue in famed cities having a ball. Utterly charming and exquisitely photographed by Bruno Delbonnel in saturated unreal living color has the appeal of a surreal picture postcard brought to life, the film relies on the slender yet capable shoulders of its ingenue, another Audrey who I hope will be around as the original."

","Amelie has its positives and negatives. The writer and Tautou (Amelie) try a little too hard to make Amelie seem quirky, making the character stand out as imaginary rather than a believable person. This is amplified by the unrealistic coincidences that make Amelie's plans successful. That combination makes a story too farfetched to be believed, though Amelie's best intentions do bring a constant air of heartwarming charm. That charm carries the story, and the vibrant and stunning cinematography brilliantly demands the audience's attention."

","I had to watch this movie for my French class and I was absolutely dreading it. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how uplifting the film was. Although my French isn't very good the story was told impeccably through out the film and the acting in this film was also incredible. The only problem I had with the film is that occasionally it could be hard to follow especially in the areas where my French was spotty however the actors managed to tell the story even when I couldn't understand the language they were speaking and that to me makes this film a must watch. Its also a very good way to practice French!"
"CinematicInceptions","9","1","3","12 November 2016"," Engaging.
","The theme of anonymity is probably the most important aspect of this very inventive and entertaining film. Amelie Poulain knows intuitively that the best way to help people is not to show her part in it. Were she to be more open with the people she tries to help, her efforts may not have been quite so fruitful. Through her scheming, she is able to give people what they need emotionally by giving them experiences rather than advice.<br/><br/>The way each character was introduced was different, addressing some of the emotional ticks and preferences that each one has rather than their job or some bit about their past. It wasn't the most effective method of introduction, but it was interesting nonetheless. Most of the supporting parts were not terribly dimensional, having only a couple aspects of their personalities and lives shown. They all feel distinct and provide the atmosphere of the story, almost blending into the setting. Though their problems are all different, each character is facing essentially the same problem: they cannot move on from their problems. From a viewer's standpoint, this might be a pattern that you like since it provides theme, but it could also be annoying if you feel like you're just seeing the same scenario repeat itself. <br/><br/>I found the first half of the movie more enjoyable than the second. The emotional progression Amelie goes through when she is seeking to help her friends and the strangers she meets is engaging. I felt so happy for her when she got to see the impact she was having. The first of these scenes, in which the middle aged man receives his tin of mementos, is far and away my favorite scene; not only because it is emotionally gripping, but also because it alerts Amelie to a world of possible ways to help people. After Nino was introduced, I lost interest slightly. At this point, it just turned into a romance that fell rather flat. Not that it was dissatisfying. Having a personal desire come into play was good for Amelie's arc, but it drove the story away from what I had initially liked about it.<br/><br/>This is the only French feature I have seen, so I cannot provide any recommendations for similar movies. If the premise doesn't sound appealing to you, I would advise that you reconsider. A story about helping others might conjure up images of missionary work or random instances of people being friendly neighbors, but this is not the case. The way Amelie makes her kindness personal and invisible gives the movie a lot of emotional resonance and life. It's very light hearted, possibly enough to be annoyingly cute. However, it is pretty entertaining in its unique style, showing us the world through Amelie's fantasies and imagination. Overall Rating: 8.6/10."

","Amélie is a young naive growing isolated from the world. As an adult, she moves to Paris and starts working. Quickly, she changes the way she sees the world, beginning to try to improve people's lives through small acts of kindness. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with Guillaume Laurant dialog's, it revealed to the world the talent of Andrey Tautou.<br/><br/>European cinema has never had the importance and visibility of American films. It lacks the money and power of large corporations of Hollywood, able to invest billions in a film and all the merchandising and advertising that it usually takes. But sometimes this lack proves to be a quality for European cinema, which increasingly focus on quality, artistic care and the beauty of art. This is the case of this film, exceptionally beautiful and striking. What amazes us more is the beauty of the plot and the moving performance of Tautou, who lent talent to her character, giving it an authentic soul. It's rare to see a movie with so much beauty, so many positive values ​​and good thoughts, being reported as if it were a fairy tale of our time. The costumes are very good and paired well with the romantic scenery of Paris. The photograph is one of the most original and unique that I have seen in contemporary cinema, thanks to lighting and color it have. Another valuable item is the soundtrack, absolutely amazing, signed by Yann Tiersen, and it's impossible not to know hums it or whistle it.<br/><br/>Currently, the film industry leaves little space to the film as a work of art. Because of this, it's good to see a movie that favored the artistic side in it's design but also achieved commercial success due to it's quality. Thrilling, touching, profound and poignant, this film is pure art and deserves a place in the table of the best films ever made in Europe. It's unfortunate that there are so few like this, and it's unfortunate also that the major industry awards have so little concern for it. This film would have won many Oscars if it had been made in U.S.A. and had a multimillion-dollar company behind, but it wasn't the case..."

I have never been to Paris, but after looking at the movie, the city is on my must see list. <br/><br/>Audrey Tautou has done a fantastic job of portraying Amelie, who is instantly likable. Amelie is an innocent girl who empathizes with everyone she meets. The movie is about how she helps her friends with their problems, in the due course finding her true love along the way.<br/><br/>The director's (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) cinematography is brilliant. All the shots have a perfect blend of the character, the city and the music. Ah, yes, the music is one of the main aspects that carry the movie throughout. The soundtrack for the entire movie is absolutely amazing. It perfectly blends in with each of the shots and enhances them. The music is what reminded me of an older Paris (from the 60's). <br/><br/>All in all, one of the few perfect films that have come out. A true visual and audio delight."

","I adore Amélie. There's something so wonderful and hopeful about this film. I generally don't like romance, but this is a true exception. I have seen this more times than I know. Amélie is wonderful and quirky. All of the characters have their own fascinating charm. The colour scheme is lovely. I am a huge reader and subtitles make a film all the more interactive and fun for me - give me something to do. There are so many hilarious scenes and so many sad scenes. You really go through a gamete of emotions with this film. The soundtrack is in my incredibly biased opinion, the best I've ever heard. I listen to it regularly. It makes me feel sad and it makes me feel alive. I adore this more than I can ever hope to explain. This movie gets all the stars."
"nymeria-meliae","10","1","3","5 January 2016"," For me the best movie of all time
","I had a laugh at the poor reviews for this movie... I can only conclude that don't watch this film if you like action films.<br/><br/>For me this is my greatest movie of all time and I will proceed to tell you why I think this...<br/><br/>1) It does have a story... it is essentially a love story. I am baffled as to how people can't pick up on that. It is a romance and as such it delves into the fantasy feeling of being in love and infatuated with a stranger who you have yet to talk to and you have yet to know but your entire body aches to be with them nonetheless... that adrenaline that rushes through your body and creates that tingly feeling of nerves in your belly. The film captures that moment perfectly.<br/><br/>2) The film is visual poetry. It is not seeking the harshness of reality... it is seeking to portray the pretense of love - see point 1. The photography in this film is just amazing and the focus on facial expression as a means of dialogue is fantastic. While I like heavy dialogue films that are characteristic of a Tarantino film, it is nice to go back to the facial expressions of the silent movie era... and Jeunet is a master of capturing the face and using actors capable of expressing emotion through the visual. The camera angles, the orange tint in the photography and the choice of colours, the attention to minute detail, demonstrate a true artist at work.<br/><br/>4) The acting... too many poor reviews are given because of the lack of dialogue other than the narrator... So I am guessing these people don't like the silent movies of times gone by... nor will they like harsh films such as Hunger or the acclaimed The Artist. Expression need not be about words... and the actors that Jeunet has gathered around him are artists of expression without dialogue. Their skill at expressing an array of emotion through the face is astounding.<br/><br/>5) Character development... we learn so much about the characters in this story in such a short time through a like and hate narrative that builds upon Jeunet's short film... Foutaises (available on youtube with English subtitles).<br/><br/>Ultimately this film is about capturing a single emotion - the first feeling of passion and infatuation when you glance a person you would love to know better. It is visually stunning and is about expression through the visual. For me the film ticks a lot of boxes that I look for in a film... I want something that celebrates the visual - if I just wanted a plot then I would read a book, that said, I want something that has a story to tell and this film does have a story... it is a romance story. I look for good photography in a film and for good acting and this film delivers on both accounts. I also want to leave the film with a memory of the film and feeling whether it be a warm fuzzy feeling like this film delivers, anger, fear, or hate. I love films that make me think but those thoughts need not be complexities, this film makes me think about the film and how it was shot... that alone makes it one of the best films I have seen... it is great because it makes me think about how it was made as a film. In that sense I can understand how some reviewers can call the film self-indulgent... it is... it celebrates itself... it celebrates the art of film (there a number of little things throughout that celebrate film) in this respect you can draw similarities with Cinema Paradiso.<br/><br/>However, ultimately, what makes a great film for me is one that transports me to another place where I am so engrossed in the film that I lose sense of time and when the film comes to an end, I feel as though I have lived as part of the film and have been away on holiday... a film that sucks me into itself... a great film is one that transports you to another place like a great piece of fictional writing in a book... where your own reality subsides and is replaced with the temporal vision being portrayed. This film delivers in that respect. It shuts out the outside and replaces it with a visually stunning piece of cinema."

","What can be said about the beautiful film Amelie? It is a charming picture filled with inspiring messages. The lead actress is very likable, and I never found myself becoming restless. My only complaint is the speed at which the subtitles went by. As someone who speaks no French, it was difficult to keep up the the pace at which the dialogue was spoken. Be ready to read quick. I would even suggest viewing on a computer rather than a television so that pausing is made easier. The movie is not just a love story, but also a story about finding oneself, and our own meanings for life. Definitely one you should watch before it's too late."
"willcundallreview","8","1","3","11 December 2015"," A great little piece of French cinema
","This movie is not quirky in a way which feels overly quirky or in a way that just feels pretentious, this is quirky but it's just lovely. Amélie is of course the French film that was very well received when it first appeared in the early 2000's and not just from the audiences of France, no Amélie seemed to take the hearts of people from around the world and managed or still manages it should be said to capture the hearts of many who view it. Although some claim this to be a masterpiece I don't think it is quite at that calibre, nevertheless it is still a great movie and one that is highly recommendable, even to those who wouldn't think they would like it.<br/><br/>The story centres around well Amélie of course, Amélie Poulain is just a seemingly normal woman working in a Parisian café and lives by herself, but of course we as the viewer get to see what she is truly like. She is not weird really but she is definitely odd, but Amélie is awesome in this film because she is extremely hard to really dislike or the performance of the lady playing her, Audrey Tautou. The plot see's Amélie do a lot of things actually, she becomes a friend of sorts with a fragile old man, tries to find a young man who caught her eye and messes with her dad, sounds like a very random plot and to be fair, it is.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is frantic and speedy, the lines sometimes come out extremely fast and all credit to the cast for really getting the dialogue out in a way which in funny and entertaining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet directs the movie and really tells quite a little story at the helm, he makes this super strange but really entertaining and although the decision to colour the movie in terms of lenses is quite a peculiar choice, it actually pretty much works in the end. Guillaume Laurant who thought up the story alongside Jeunet then also writes the film and gives Jeunet a great little script to work with, the movie moves along without stopping for too long and that I feel really makes this keep going until the very end.<br/><br/>I mentioned Tautou as Amélie and she is very good in the role, she very much makes you feel for the character and she is fun to be around as well. Serge Merlin as the frail man Amélie befriends is good and works well at the beginning of the story because most other characters take a little while to get used to with the random stuff they say and do. Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is pretty good too, when he is in the film the story is usually at quite a fast part and so Kassovitz does a good job of keeping the pace going so that the movie really does flow very nicely indeed.<br/><br/>I feel Amélie demands a second watch, I watched this the first time and felt it was pretty basic, but on the second watch I truly opened my eyes and saw this for the great film it is. I couldn't recommend this more to those who haven't already seen it, it's fun, oddly thrilling and just generally very different indeed. So Amélie, a film that showcases how quirky can be done so well but also shows just how good French cinema can be, oh and this movie is stunning to look at by the way."
"StevePulaski","6","1","3","8 October 2015"," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Amélie is a film predicated off of a whimsical color pattern - consisting mostly of urine-yellows, pea-greens, and blood-reds - and an impossibly fantastical world with a unique presence at its core. It opens by defining the characters that surround our protagonist Amélie Poulain (the uniquely beautiful Audrey Tautou) by their strangest, most peculiar quirks; one character gets deep enjoyment out of using his fingers to elaborately dissect the hot carcus of a turkey and another character's greatest pleasure is emptying our her purse just to put everything back again. In the grand scheme, these quirks are fairly minor, but the fact that these are the traits screenwriter Guillaume Laurant wants us to immediately associate these characters with - not a job, a specific education, a personality trait, or a personal history - is, in itself, a tad subversive.<br/><br/>With that, we finally meet Amélie, a woman who was kept largely sheltered as a child, being homeschooled by her now-dead mother and, as a result, learning to escape monotony and certain gloom by running away in the realms of her imagination. Working as a waittress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, France, Amélie has consistently led a fairly isolated life largely focused on herself, until one day, her motivations change in the blink of an eye. Upon hearing the breaking news report concerning the death of Princess Diana, she drops the cap to her perfume, which rolls and eventually dislodges a loose tile. Behind the tile is a small tin of trinkets, presumably belonging to a young child. Amélie decides it was something of her destiny to find this box and return it to the rightful owner, and before long, she finds her destiny of helping others panning out with another circumstance of a lost item. <br/><br/>The significance and contents of said lost items are irrelevant; their purpose is to, in turn, provide Amélie with something she never had before and that something is a reason to exist and belong. Throughout her life, while not depressed nor particularly sad, Amélie's loneliness has been a constant thing she's had to battle in her day-to-day actions; it's been the typical daily occurrence of her to wake up, go to work, and relish in her alone time for years on end. These situations allow her to search for some kind of companionship, further develop her love for humankind, and find maybe even find a romantic partner.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm making this sound a lot more extravagant than I think I should be. Amélie, through all its color and decorated mise-en- scene, is a drearily familiar story with its original element being the fact that it's captured in a realm of artificiality that, in turn, makes it appear far more compelling than it ever manages to naturally be. It reminds me of the lesser films of Wes Anderson, which weren't so much concerned about how many objects, costumes, and people could be fixed into one particular frame, or the general excitement of dialog as much as they were presentation and eccentric dialog. <br/><br/>While the visuals in Amélie are colorful marbles, and the juxtaposition of characters with cinematographical color (the work of the great Bruno Delbonnel, who'd go on to work with the Coen brothers and Tim Burton in more recent years) is unmistakable, these efforts feel more geared to disguise the fact that Amélie is a relatively simple story with little in the way of remarkable themes. The presence of scenes ostensibly colored by way of a filter over the lens, canted angles (most notably during a scene showcasing a character named Bredoteau's most traumatic moment as a child), and lavish setpieces almost entirely blind us by whimsy and warmth until we realize the takeaway from the film is that of an empty candy wrapper.<br/><br/>There's something to be said about Tautou, however, who remains an interesting screen presence throughout the film simply because of her presentation. Her jet-black hair, petite figure, frequently blood- red wardrobe and lipstick, and ghostly paleness make her protrude out in nearly every scene, even if the background is a pulsating hue of red - as it is in a scene when she reads a letter in a bathroom. In addition, scenes in the sex shop bring a fascinating level of warmth to a place often condemned and avoided for its almost inherent seaminess. But just like I find myself doing now, one winds up remembering Amélie for short, eye-catching scenes rather than a complete film with an impacting takeaway.<br/><br/>Starring: Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. Directed by: Jean- Pierre Jeunet."

","Is there anything about this movie that can get a note less than the highest!? So, naturally, this gets 10 from me!<br/><br/>I like the story. I guess anyone who is romantic and who believes in eternal love or love at first sight or soulmates or similar love affairs things will give this movie a 10!<br/><br/>Audrey is brilliant in the role. She is so convincing that no wonder she will always be remembered and known as Amelie. All other actors are great too and the mini society we get to know from the caffe and the building is appealing.<br/><br/>Paris scenes... Who can not fall in love with the city of lights? Who can not wish to go there once or return? And who can not wish for a love like that to happen in Paris? <br/><br/>Renoir painting... I think that Renoir was chosen very carefully because I do not think that there is a painter ( was) who was as 'sweet' in his themes as Renoir. So, it is natural that such a painter fits perfectly into the sweet film.<br/><br/>Soundtrack ... It is one of the best soundtracks I know when it comes to mostly music only arrangements. And the title music/song has become somewhat of a signature song for France and French culture.<br/><br/>So... Great love in a great city. Beautiful music that adds to beautiful scenes. Perfect movie is here."

"devrinusta-50684","10","1","3","14 June 2015"," One of the greatest of all times
","One of my favorite of all times:) Love the music and the plot. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet. He had done a great job... Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car."
"hamass-mujadid","10","1","3","4 March 2015"," If Only Everyone Was Like That
","Amelie, and girls like her, if even her most distorted versions, are the loves of my life. With that, yes, I am implying my strong support for polygamy—there's nothing unethical about it. <br/><br/>Amelie follows simple rules—good to good, bad to bad—and with that mindset, she can classify everything relatively. She doesn't need help, with exceptions of destiny and miracle, and some pragmatic skills—mechanics, job, planning, logistics, money, and a lot of imagination. She's one of those who love to work, but not in the mainstream category; they work for selfless motives, with little pinches of comic and awkwardness. <br/><br/>Several things pop-up Amelie's mind in the manner of bubble-wraps; she can't control her urges. She loves to play with real people with real ideas, only to marginalize their fake disguises, that is, to bring out their true-selves. Occasionally, she is betrayed by her humanitarian instincts which humiliate her for plunging into things that do not directly concern her, but that's a necessary stake. With colorful reasoning and pondering, most of which are deceitful and wild, she tends to look-up the hidden good behind everything around. However, like with all humans, she is selfish—she wants to be loved back, not appreciated; she wants people to be happy, and thus, to make herself happy. That's the only degree of selfishness to which she can go. Spending hours on freak-show-albums, returning nostalgic accessories to '50s people who once lived in her apartment, counting the number of orgasms in neighborhood, spying on the painter-next-door, turning people into victims of war, heist, and revolt, and sending off dad's gnome on a world tour are few of the things she does, and as weird as they may sound, they are for their own benefit, if mildly so. <br/><br/>Audrey Tautou has pulled this one off brilliantly. I've seen only one of her works before—The Da Vinci Code in which she plays a leading role in the adaptation of Dan Brown's historical thriller; she was good but didn't really have a ""role"". Now that I have seen Amelie, I'm surely going to hit her more. For most of Amelie, Audrey uses her eyes. Actually, her eyes are the only actors in the movie, and believe me, I mean this as a complement. It's harder to express yourself just through eyes than with the whole posture. You should try doing this at home—playing an introverted maniac for a day just through weird expressions; I'm sure you'll look like a dumb monkey and nothing else. With Audrey, this wasn't the case, after all she was nominated for the BAFTAs; I don't see why not for Academy Awards. I mean she didn't deserve a win, but surely a nomination. Anyways, I won't criticize the Academy again; they've done some real favors for me lately.<br/><br/>Even when you put Amelie aside from the movie, the way the story is narrated is charmingly unique. The bizarre shots, cinematography, set-design (practically everything), sensory details, direct interaction with the audience (when Amelie stares at the screen with that creepy smile), and weird footage (babies swimming, one-legged country man tap-dancing) make it so exhilarating an experience that it can never leave audiences' minds (well, it won't mine). I won't call it excellent directing, because the scribbled facts were simply told in the most understandable way. I would therefore laud the writer, because the imagery of set, angles, minute details (yes, like the one where Amelie notices an insect on the screen behind the couple in a movie) and order are almost entirely on writer's shoulders; this has surely been one of the finest pieces of written art I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The world of Amelie is unique. She creates modified models of it, while accepting the world as it is, and this is a great gift. If we start having people who are like her, we wouldn't be the whining fags that we are. So apart from the light-heartening comedy and romance that Amelie provides, it's also a precursor of doom for the ""real"" men. My intuition tells me that men/women like Amelie do exist, and it's for us to find them, and adopt any measures to append them to ourselves, whatever the relationship. And no, I'm not a weirdo."

","Now here is a movie that relies solely on our main character's likability, personality, and charm. If we hate her and has no personality, this movie fails, because I imagine if a character I hated did the things Amélie did in this movie, I would, well, hate it. Fortunately, our main character is simply wonderful and impossible to hate. The first half of this film is about Amélie trying to help people, and the second half is her playing mind games with a guy she has a serious crush on. I mean, in all honesty, that sounds rather boring, but, like I said, Amélie is to likable for it to be boring. I like watching her do her daily routine. She does it while being decently interesting and quirkily funny. The better half of the film is the romance part, as I found it to be both more sweet and more funny. The whole time this guy is trying to find out who is playing these mind games with him, and when they finally meet, you get this feeling of satisfaction. To me this kind of shows that the movie did in fact create a relatable character. I mean, why would I feel any kind of emotion for someone I didn't like? Amélie is a very feel good film and it's something you can watch at any time. I recommend you watch."

What's more is that Amélie calls that side of our heart out and put it into practice in her own way. In the end, It not only tells a beautiful story but reminds us that to confront and fulfill the void in our own mind, we have to at first lend our hands to others and be their angels.

That is, the whole film is as fluid as a beautiful poem is being recited, just that the language is French, we need the subtitles to help us through. I wish I learnt French to avoid reading those subtitles. <br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is refreshing, her every nuance indeed is beautiful and I have loved her over and over again whenever I see this piece of art. The music by Yann Tiersen is delightful and accompanies perfectly with the stunning visuals. <br/><br/>Above all, if I must thank anyone, then it's the director Jean Pierre Jeunet who made a good tale written by Guillaume Laurant into a great one. Of course, the director was helped a great deal by the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel who created a perfect Paris. <br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that the film was shot in Paris, yes indeed Paris is shown and we see a very intrinsic and an intimate Paris that is devoid of the famous monuments it has and comprised of the simple homes and lanes most tourists might be missing. Yet, all is beautiful and mostly, you will love it. <br/><br/>Oh, I used the word love many a time so this is not a film that is merely likable, it's a delightful tale that is loved by many and I am happy to be one among it's lovers. <br/><br/>A 5/5 for a great loving film."

"schreiber-stephen","9","1","3","24 January 2014"," Without Amélie, today's films are the scurf of yesterday's
","Amélie is a film that I am happy I finally stumbled on. It has a healthy rating on IMDb and is among the top rated films of everything on the site which is awesome so my expectations were fairly high. I am glad I watched the movie. There was a few times in the film that I had to replay parts because I was so enthralled by what was going on screen that I could not keep up with the subtitles as a result of me watching the film instead of reading. The color in Amélie is akin to a Wes Anderson film and maybe Anderson took away some things from this film as he didn't quite hit his stride until the same year Amélie released. It was a fantastic year for this type of quirky film.<br/><br/>There are many reasons to love Amélie. The major one is Audrey Tatou. She is strange but in a cute way yet frustrating way. Tatou does a fantastic job of delivering a lovable performance while playing a role that might have been designed for a different type of actress. She fit the role perfectly. Her interactions with the other characters are clever, witty and at times odd. One of the greatest parts of this movie is when she helps a blind man and explains everything she sees in a quick short way while still making it light hearted. That scene as well as many other parts of this movie forces you to think that Jean-Pierre Jeunet is light years ahead of everyone else. If this film were released today, it would most definitely receive some Oscar nominations and I believe that Tatou would win for best actress because she is that good in this role.<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about this film but the best thing I can say to do would be to watch for yourself. Many parts of this movie are fantastic and you should be experience all of it for the first time without explanation or too much detail as it is hard to put into words how clever and beautiful this film is. From the daydreams to the book of ""family"" portraits, this movie is a masterpiece."

The fear, as we all know, is hard to get over, especially if hidden in the deepest part of our heart.Then the courage, or we say passion. Faced with my passion, why not go for it? Though talking of cherishing the unique opportunity thousands of times, we barely do what we said or what we thought we should.

"The-Sarkologist","7","1","3","14 September 2012"," Blows your Hollywood Rom-Com out of the water
","For those who are familiar with some of Jeunet's other films, in particular City of Lost Children and Delicatessan, Amelie is a little more down to Earth, though that is a little bit of an overstatement because the larger than life characters are still present along with some of the more bizarre occurrences that you would expect from such a film. The only reason I say that it is more down to Earth is simply because it is set in modern Paris, and the events are a little more realistic and believable (with the exception of Amelie's mother dying when somebody decides to jump off of the Notre Dame and just happens to land on top of her).<br/><br/>Amelie is basically a love story, though it is not what one would expect from your standard Hollywood offering. It is much better, particularly because the characters, including the main character, are so larger than life. Amelie's father is a doctor, and not a very good one at that, namely because he mistakes Amelie's quick beating heart due to anxiety as a heart condition and thus prevents her from going to school for fear that she may die. However Amelie, despite growing out isolated from society with an overtly protective mother and father, does manage to go out into the world, however one gets the impression that she is an observer, not necessarily interacting on the world's level.<br/><br/>However, that changes when on the night Princess Diana dies, she happens to discover a secret compartment in her flat and discovers in this compartment a box containing somebody's childhood memories, so she takes the box and decides to go and find the owner, however she does so in a way that nobody actually knows that it is her doing this. After getting such a thrill she decides that her purpose in life is to go a make people's lives just that little bit better, but in a way that nobody actually knows that she is the one doing it.<br/><br/>It is not so much the story that I enjoyed in this movie, but the larger that life characters that make up the movie. There is a mystery of this photograph that appears in a bin next to a photo booth, and this one man is collecting these discarded photos and creating an album full of them, however there is a lot of speculation as to who this mysterious man in, and while the mystery is finally solved, the answer, in the end, turns out to be very mundane. There is also the man that sits in a café all day obsessed with bubble wrap and one of the girls there that he went on one date. Amelie tries to set him up with another of the lonely women there, but as it turns out, thus guy is hugely obsessed and paranoid, and at the end of the film lands back at square one.<br/><br/>Another of the regulars at the café (where Amelie works) is a failed writer whose latest offering is a story about a man who learns that the world is going to end, and how to prevent it, and then decides not to tell anybody because he thinks nobody will believe him, so as it turns out, it is a story about a man who does nothing. The funniest part of the film though is right at the beginning, however so as not to spoil this film much more, I will leave it for you to watch. As I said at the beginning, this is a romantic comedy, but on a completely different level to what one would expect from Hollywood (namely because it is French and not America)."

","There are few movies out there that usually make me go, ""Wow!"". This one did. Is has such an original screenplay and storyline that you just get sucked right in and are wondering what is going to happen next. You can call it a bit of an ""abstract"" movie, but it sort of in a way, relates to many people! My point is, if you have an extra 125 minutes, go and watch this movie! The story is about a girl named Amelie who lost her mother when she was just a little girl, she lived with her father until she moved out and you watch Amelie follow this man named Nino who works at an adult sex shop. I know it seems a little fuzzy now, but stick with me. She follows Nino around trying to have decent conversation, or just so he notices her and from the point that she has her first encounter with Nino, you follow her on her journey to have her one love."

","If ever there was a film that closely resembled an actual work of art, Amelie has to be one of them.  Between the presentation, the charming story and the unbelievably engaging Audrey Tautou as Amelie, it is not difficult to see why this film has quickly become a beloved modern classic.<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers within*<br/><br/>There are no `slow spots' in Amelie  you are immediately thrown into the story, which is anonymously narrated in a rapid-fire opening sequence, where if you blink you'll miss something.  From the narrator we learn that Amelie was an only child of neurotic parents who were unaffectionate, but smothering enough to mold her into an introspective and quirky loner who, as an adult is now living a quiet life as a waitress.  She is still introspective and quirky, and through a serendipitous occurrence, decides to anonymously help others.  This may mean playing matchmaker to the lonely, returning long-lost property or keeping company with other lonely eccentrics, but the result is generally positive and the experiences personally rewarding for Amelie who relishes in her anonymous status.  It is when she finds love in one of her `projects' that conflict arises for her.<br/><br/>It is impossible not to fall in love with Amelie, who is so charming that even when she is dispensing her own brand of justice against a hateful man by doing little irritating things to his flat like exchange his toothpaste for foot cream or resetting his alarm clock for a couple of hours earlier than normal, she is completely adorable, perhaps more so because the `evil deeds' are so inherently innocent in the grand scheme of things.  Her imagination and innocence is both endearing and admirable, and Audrey Tautou is so engaging and beautiful that she provides the perfect vessel and face for this heroine.  Additionally, the excellent supporting cast is a perfect compliment to its leading lady.<br/><br/>The film itself is absolutely marvelous and awe-inspiring.  The cinematography employs a lot of rapid-fire movements, and the camera work is incredibly original.  The set design has the colors and energy of a Fauvist painting by Henri Matisse and the charm and quaint feel of a post-Impressionist Renoir, who himself is featured prominently in the film. Along with the script, which is both heart-warming and sentimental without losing its intelligence, Amelie is a modern day fairy tale that is so exuberant that it made me want to watch it again, but was so profound and heart-felt that I was speechless and unable to weigh in with my opinion until I could let the film absorb into my brain like a sponge.  Only then could I unequivocally assert that this film easily makes my list of favorite films, even with just one viewing.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","3","28 December 2003"," Feel good!
","'Amelie' is an utterly charming French rom-com, that stands out due to director Jeunet's quirky sense of humour, wonderful visual imagination, and above all his ability (well evidenced in 'Delicatessan') to create an atmosphere within which the whole film breathes.  Audrey Tautou's big child eyes also help.  A real feel-good movie, in the very best of senses."

","Amelie is an extraordinary film, and this makes the ordinariness of its conclusion profoundly unsatisfying.  Throughout the movie (known as Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain in its country of origin, France) the characters are presented as delightfully quirky - Amelie enjoys running her hands through sackfuls of grain; her father likes lining up his shoes and polishing them; Nino keeps an album of photos discarded by their owners - so the ending, where Amelie and Nino leap into bed together, just as would happen in any other movie, is a huge letdown.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: one day Amelie Poulain finds a small box of 'treasures', which would appear to have been hidden by a small boy 40 years ago.  She decides to return the box to its owner, and if he is appreciative she will continue in her quest to help those around her. <br/><br/>
One of the strengths of the film is that - much like real life - nobody is 'normal'.  As well as being introduced to characters, we are also shown their idiosyncrasies and history. However, Amelie's running time of over two hours feels too long and one gets the impression that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has attempted to fit too much into what is a light-weight movie.<br/><br/>It is also very funny in places, notably when Amelie takes revenge on an intolerant neighbour.  It is interesting how we can, after an interval of five years, look back on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and recall with a wry smile how completely it consumed our attention at the time. Overall this is a charming and whimsical film (even if at times it is a little too aware of its quaintness), and certainly deserving of a more fitting finale."

"jpapadopoulos","Null","1","3","17 December 2002"," one extremely sweet story of love!
","Amelie.<br/><br/>Amelie is a film that describes in its most sweet way the importance of love in terms of the purpose of life.<br/><br/>Amelie, the main character in the film, is a girl that was brought up so as to care tremendously about all the little things in life and all the tedious details that usually would be of no importance to regular people. This as said implies that she is not a regular / normal girl. But then again, what is normal? This is a question posed somewhere along the lines in Amelie's life. In the beginning she would think that she is the rather unusual as she has properties that can suggest that she stands out. However soon she realizes that these aren't properties that make her odd but merely what makes her different.<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden she finds herself in a quest for purpose. So, as she could never ever dare to imagine this could be to look for someone that could lead her to love (which all things being equal is the most obvious and immediate purpose for life to all people) she discovers the warmth of the ultimate emotion by riding the arrow towards the exact opposite direction. The oxymoron here is (and not only does it apply to her but to us all) that it so happens that so very often someone that cannot trust love in itself, not for a second (the reason does not matter - here is because she is just so innocent and scared), can give and feel and produce oh so very infinite amounts of it! So she does that and sees clearly that helping people makes happy and can be an adventure. It also gives her the opportunity to apply her unique perspective of social intelligence and her own sense of justice.<br/><br/>However, the miracle happens and I think it comes down to simply the fact that to the pure in heart love is inevitable. Hence soon she realizes that she wants to live and experience love herself too. She experiments, of course, tries out her power of being spontaneous so as to unleash it / provoke it in her near environment and then enjoys the effects.<br/><br/>Then she meets someone (again rather odd) and sees that there can exist other people with similar care for little things and this of course triggers her emotions at first to a small extent but later to the maximum. She falls completely for this stranger and decides to try and attract him. She is quite successful but it's more due to the innocent and true nature of her emotions rather than it being due to a sense of habit or addiction.<br/><br/>All this though is merely the story of what happens and cannot tell you of the unbelievable - in my opinion - way in which all this is put to description. This film has a great value because it shows in an innocent (but not naive) way the 'reach out to love' that all of us are capable of living in our lives. I think of this film as a lesson that teaches that true happiness lies in love and all I have to do to have love in my life is permit it to enter my life; all that love is, is infinite and can expand from nowhere, can be produced from nothingness and at the same time can be as filling so as to compose the whole of my life's meaning. And there, at that moment I'd be happy; totally, with no fear, no regrets, no uncertainties, no complications, just a clear perception of happiness as if it could be something tangent and I could wrap it around my self like a blanket.<br/><br/>I can only hope it tells you the same thing."
"johanleupen","7","1","3","2 December 2002"," An interesting effort that is enjoyable but highly overrated nonetheless.
","Amelie tells the story of a young girl's quest to make the world a better place by bringing people together. Rather than presenting us with grand narratives and extensive plot-devices, Jeunet starts off by focusing on the little things. It's refreshing to see a movie dedicated to detail and everyday life. For instance, every character is outlined by a micro-history catalogueing his or her likes and dislikes, which leads to some amusing scenes. Furthermore, Amelie's vivid imagination is captured by a terrific art-department and very dynamic camera-movements. However, as soon as Jeunet feels compelled to shift focus from setting up his environment to constructing a plot, he loses that which sets Amelie apart from other films. To be perfectly honest it's relatively tiresome to watch Amelie looking for and finding the love of her life. The strongest element in the movie is it's ability to steer away from (predictable) plot lines but unfortunately Jeunet eventually feels the necessity to conform to classic narrative. We are left with a movie that is enjoyable but highly overrated to be sure."

","This film has it all (apart from action, which is nonsense anyway); romance, comedy, drama... I consider it as one of the best films I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. Even if you are underage, sneak into the cinema and watch it carefully.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the film for you and write the entire story out, which most people tend to do whilst writing their comments out. After all, ""Le Fabueux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" doesn't have much of a plot anyway; it's just... nice. It may be a (very funny) comedy, but it is also very thoughtful at the same time. The director (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) has made the film flawless by choosing the perfect cast, perfect soundtrack and by using his natural ability to his greatest potential as a director.<br/><br/>Now, let's start with the two main characters in ""Amelie""...<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou plays the part of Amelie Poulain with ease and perfection. Tautou may not be the prettiest girl on the planet, but she definitely has the best eyes I've ever seen. She has this unique and unexplainable attraction and innocence which makes her the only person able to play the part of Amelie... it's really hard to explain. You've got to watch the film and see for yourselves.<br/><br/>Mathieu Kassovitz plays Nino, the man who Amelie falls in love with. Kassovitz seems not to need to do too much for the part (all he has to do is to act a little spaced out), but since I'm not an actor I can't really comment. After all, I thought he had a (AGAIN!) unique presence which I can't (AGAIN!) explain.<br/><br/>The other characters (you can look the names up yourselves) were equally as excellent as each other. They were all slightly strange in their actions(including Amelie's and Nino's) but I guess the director is trying to emphasize the fact that everyone is different and emotions are also very relevant in our behaviour...<br/><br/>Yann Tiersen, the highly prolific and original multi-instrumentalist composer and performer who worked on the soundtracks of French movies like ""Alice et Martin"", also did the sountrack for ""Amelie"" (apart from two very old French songs written in the 1930's). In my opinion, the soundtrack made a significant difference to the film.<br/><br/>It's really hard to say why I am so in love with this film... it just happens. Not many films are so unexplainable, but I guess that's probably a reason for my inspiration for it."

It is exremely funny, stylish, thrilling and touching. I think the only movie that comes close to it is BArton Fink which also unites many elements to a great movie. The acting is brillant, too, especially Audrey Tautou is amazing. I think no one else could have played that part and I'm extremely worried that Hollywood's gonna do a remake starring Julia Roberts - urgh. This film shows that not only Hollywood produces well done movies but also Europe which seems to increase its ability to deliver masterpieces of cinema (in the last few years it delivered films like Billy Elliot, Trois couleurs: Rouge, Das Experiment, Lola rennt, Todo sobre mi madre, The Full Monty,...). I hope Le fabuleux... will win an academy award for best foreign language film, but I really doubt it'll win more, even though it truly deserves more as 2001 hasn't been a good year for movies. Jeunets work is the best there is this year and I wish that next year the first foreign language movie will win the award for best picture. You see, I'm very enthusiastic with this one and I cannot understand how someone can say that it's a bad movie. I am also very excited about its us-release and how it'll be liked by the American audience. But I think that especially in the present political situation a movie like this is the best that can happen. Like I said, the movie is pure magic and it's hard to summarize it, as it's so full of everything, that makes a movie worth of being watched. Furthermore the score by Yann Tiersen is one of the finest I've ever heard and I recommend everybody who liked the film to buy its soundtrack, you won't be disappointed.

By showing the faults and quirks of the characters around Amelie, and by showing how Amelie falls in love and breaks through her emotional isolation, Jeunet gives us a positive outlook on live and communicates a great feeling.

Jeunet still lets the camera get a bit to close to the characters, so that the lens slightly distort their features and let you study every pore of their skin. That's the surreal ingredience.<br/><br/>But behind that, and beyond the unexpected turns of the events, lies a story about a young woman and here lonely life among her lonely neighbours. If it wasn't for the humour, the surprises and the surrealism this could easily turn into a sad story. Now it's instead a bittersweet tale of how life could be if we cared more for each other."
"tjackson","Null","1","3","17 October 2001"," dazzling and lively, intricate, and stunningly woven stories and circumstances
","This is an amazing extravaganza of intricate, complex, and stunningly woven stories and circumstances.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a extraordinary visual storyteller and a gifted fabulist. His past films have been arresting, but had a dark edge. Amelie is pure delight and romance. It may be closest to a kind of non musical French `Wizard of Oz'(There is in fact a Toto reference). But the story, if one can call this breathtaking array of circumstances and characters a story at all  is one of romance found. And it is the discovery of romance in all its forms: love, memory, imagination, the inevitability of chance in life and the hidden and mundane magic in the smallest details and corners of life. It is said that a motion butterfly's wings over China could change the course of history  or something to that effect  I forget the quote  but this is exactly how the film starts  with a butterfly's wings.  It tumbles into a dazzling and lively series of outrageous narrative turns, which introduce the loveless childhood of our heroine  Amelie - whose vivid escapes into her own imagination are made literal. And that is just the first chapter'. Audrey Tautou, who was so gorgeous and riveting in `The Venus Beauty Institute' plays Amelie as an adult, who is on a hero's quest to inject magic into people's lives while searching for her own possible romance. Tautou is so striking that her face literally holds all this together.  <br/><br/>The director freely and rapidly bounces between the coincidental, the imaginative, the possible, the magical, the unlikely, between real life and the imagination. The effect is difficulty to define, but the result for the audience is to experience a kind renewal of hope in the transcendent magic of human nature and the everyday. It is a movie the world may need about now and should, if there is any logic to movie going at least, make this film a real hit."

Easily the best thing I have seen for a long time..now we turn on our TV's and get pictures of war, what a relief to relish in the good side of humanity..see it and enter another world.."

","This is, without doubt, among the best films I have ever seen and in the direct aftermath of the attack of colour, surreality and bon-vivant (no pun intended) this film imbibes, I would have to say, it IS the best film I've ever seen. You don't have to know Paris to enjoy this film, but boy does it help! And if you don't want to go there after seeing it, there is something wrong with you!<br/><br/>The pace is wonderful, the cinematography and colour are spectacular, the story, while at times is a little predictable (I found myself congratulating myself on knowing what was going to happen next in one instance but this just made the scene better!!), is so well thought and processed that you don't have time to find falities in it and the characters are just superb. I have to disagree with Diand. I thought the length of the movie was perfect. A story had to be told and it was given the time and place to be executed. There are the eccentricites of French cinema as only they can do (similar to the orgasm scene in Delicatessen) littered all over the place and they are gems. This is feel-good cinema at it's very, very best.<br/><br/>The world of Amélie Poulain is a wonderfully fantastic one... Allow yourself to be immersed...<br/><br/>If you don't skip a stone on a canal or lake, if you don't travel abroad, if you don't try and paint a picture and if you don't try and make someone else happy after seeing this film, then you've missed the point...<br/><br/>Either that or you're dead!"
"egp01djm","10","1","3","10 October 2001"," Movie of the Year? Or the Decade? Of the new Century?
","Watch the film before you read this - there might be the odd spoiler. But make sure you WATCH THIS MOVIE. It will MAKE YOUR DAY, and it might even CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Or at least how you look at it.<br/><br/>Its not often a movie that's billed as a 'feelgood' can successfully fullfil that claim without the audience feeling they have somehow been manipulated. Its not often that a romantic comedy escapes the piercing glare of cynicism that must be cast over the average churned-out Rom-Com tripe we are used to. Its not often that every second of a movie is overflowing with genius, charm, honesty and spirit. Its not often a film like 'Amelie' comes around.<br/><br/>
A simple tale of a simple girl who likes simple pleasures. From the opening, the movie's style is as cute and heartfelt as the story which it depicts. An example? The simple, effective  'likes' and 'dislikes' of Amelie's parents. Who needs exposition of character through 'realistic' situations when you can be told enough about a character to know all you'll ever need to know in a short sequence. And through not having any contrived 'set-up' of the co-stars around whom  Amelie lives, the viewer can fall back into the world of Amelie, and of 'Amelie' completely.<br/><br/>And what a world - apartment block and cafe culture, train stations and cooky secrets. Jealous ex-lovers and hypochondriacs, failed writers, long lost lovers... A world in which the supporting players are as well developed and - to pull a cliche - rounded as the main characters in any other movie, this world heightens and augments our faith in, our admiration for and our delight in the very presence of 'Amelie.' The movement of the plot towards its conclusion is secondary to the pleasure experienced by the viewer as the movie is seen. A world in which dreams and imaginings are as real as the people we see, in which doing good deeds is an experience enjoyed rather than one rewarded, in which a girl like Amelie can... can do the things that Amelie does.<br/><br/>This movie will charm you, affect you, surprise and delight you. It will pull your ears and make a face at you whilst you are trying to be serious. It will leave you feeling like you just found something you lost. It will make you laugh - out loud and in your soul. It will make the world a better place. Its not often a movie like 'Amelie' comes along... don't miss it."

"marcost","8","1","3","6 October 2001"," Magical movie
","This is my first review on IMDB. I couldn't resist praising Amélie!I am not going to repeat the bits of the story here, there's already a lot on the reviews.<br/><br/> The movie plays with the small details and obsessions in peoples life. Amélie notices these details and she starts changing them for either making people happier or for punishing the bad ones. She acts like a guardian angel by setting up small changes and surprises. It makes her happier but on the same time it helps her escape her solitude.<br/><br/> Throughout her everyday journeys she falls in love with a stranger but she's too shy. She tries to attract/flirt by setting up a little chase with her love by invading his everyday habits. Her shyness is always preventing her for making the big move and she realises that she's a coward. It's fantastic the way the movie ends. I found this just perfect.<br/><br/> I couldn't label the movie as a romantic comedy. It's full of humour and full of genuinely funny moments through Amélies adventures but nothing like a Hollywood romantic comedy. The day-dreaming of Amélie and her dream-reality mix is so well embedded everywhere in the movie. Don't we all live a life blended with dreams?"
"adrienneanson","9","1","3","5 October 2001"," A French film that will appeal to Americans
","This movie hit France like the Sixth Sense or The English Patient hit the United States.  Amelie is light-hearted, romantic, comical, and yet brilliantly intelligent.  It's a romantic comedy fashioned by an experienced and smart film-maker, so the story is like a day at the fair but the cinematography and underlying themes are worth a semester at any film school.<br/><br/>I like to watch French films in Original Version, but normally I prefer American films for entertainment.  France has produced some pretty wacky films that can turn you off of foreign films, but this one is on my favorites list."

There's humor, love, human compassion, delightful characters that you quickly grow fond of, a well written plot filled with surprises and moving moments, great soundtrack that blends in perfectly with the picture and a wonderful cast led by newcomer Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. Who could ask for anything more?<br/><br/>A must see and the best antidote I know to the nonsense the world has experienced recently.<br/><br/>If you understand french, it's worth seeing in its original version.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 Yes, a perfect score!"

No wonder a French film is #1! Then the movie started...and in a blink of an eye sceptism was long gone and i thought I was in a fairy tale. When you see the opening scenes it's obvious: this movie is not your ordinary, every day Hollywood production. Amelie sparkles throughout the whole movie. Living in her own magical world en trying desperate to get some magic in the real world to. Sometimes it works but every once in a while it goes not quit as she planned. This creates some really hilarious scenes. A pathetic stalking man hooks up whit a sick, insecure woman in the toilets and a garden gnome travelling around the world sending postcards everywhere he comes. I really enjoyed this film a lot and in the end every spectator is shiny and happy, just what Amelie wants..."

When she is tempted to play the part of guardian angel to friends and strangers alike, the results are hilarious.<br/><br/>Eventually she is tempted to cast aside her normal restraints in pursuit of an equally strange young man. Several aborted attempts to make contact without commitment lead to laugter. Will Amélie finally jump into life with the rest of us?<br/><br/>A delightful film, great cinematography and witty script.

One that makes you instantly smile should you inadvertantly recollect your favourite part. However, I was saddened to see the breakdown of the films ratings on this site. I mean Americans, what are you thinking? Considering it doesn't come out in the states until November 2nd how can 37 of you give it 1 out of 10 and an average of 4.7?

","It's all about happiness and how a few images can make it real and near palpable. With Amélie Jeunet fully succeeds to light the magic in life throughout his gallery of portraits. The way he deals with the context to make it unreal may be disturbing but it's his poetic license to make up the dull ends of life. Of course if you don't feel like being happy you will rant you're fed up with those dreamlike images. You should have known French directors do not only shoot distressing movies. Some of them are so ambitious as to make movies for more people than a bunch of ill-fitting brains.<br/><br/>The simplest of stories leave much room for creativity to develop most beautiful images to eventually form magical movies. Movies that make you feel so well that you wonder how it is possible to deal about life with just a dozen reels. Jeunet distills a little nostalgia and a mellifluous composition of other simple ingredients. The result is so great, marvelous that there is no point in analyzing the making. Questioning Amélie Poulain's achievement is the same as to say ""I don't like the colors"" ""I don't like the characters"" ""I don't like the story"". When you're happy you don't wonder why and there's no point in asking for more than what you get. But afterward you ought to be grateful for the wonderful time (and rooting for more) while the non-happy are still trying to word their own private impotence."

","This movie is a true masterpiece. It is beautifully filmed and the cast is fabulous. True, most of them don't look like they are hot off the Vogue-Cover, but that makes them look so much truer.<br/><br/>
The story is basically a romantic comedy. Amelie is a woman, who seems to be a typical single of modern life. Her imagination sometimes takes her on ""little trips"". You get to know her and her surroundings. It's just an everyday story with a little twist towards a fairy-tale.<br/><br/>
The ""magical"" elements never take overhand, or get unbelievable. We all have day-dreams like that sometimes, but in this movie they are an integral part of the whole story. But watch out: because of some adult content (you get to see a bit of naked flash, and bit a few sexual items are discussed) this is NOT a movie for young people.<br/><br/>
I give this movie 9 out of 10"

Amelie is an introverted young French girl who learns the secret of changing people's lives for the better. Her shyness, however, is a stumbling block when it comes to changing her own life. From the first few minutes of the film, by a subtle use of special effects, an unusual script, and fairly innovative editing, the audience is completely captured. The ambience is that of a fairytale for grown ups. The imaginative stratagems Amelie uses to achieve her ends keep us engaged. The beautiful photography, wonderful acting, and unforgettable imagery combine into a masterpiece of understatement that is both impressive and uplifting. Altogether a joy to behold."

","_Le Fabulaux destin d'Amélie Poulain_ is a masterpiece.  I loved this film so much.  I saw it towards the end of my semester in Paris last spring, and I've been waiting ever since for it to come to the USA.  I'll be taking all of my friends to see it when it does come here Nov. 2!!  I recommend this amazing movie to anyone.  Its something everyone can enjoy!  Its about a lonely young Parisian woman, Amélie, who enjoys the simple things in life; plunging her hand into a sack full of beans, cracking the top of crème brulée, and skipping rocks in the Canal Saint Martin.  Amélie decides to take it upon herself to change the lives of some of the people she lives around, like her father, her neighbor, the concierge, and those who work in a fruit stand of the corner of her street.  In between all this she manages to find Nino, who works in a porn shop and on his time off goes to photo booths to collect discarded photographs.  Does a romance blossom between the two, well, I'm afraid you'll have to go find out for yourself."

"kythorn-2","10","1","3","27 April 2001"," A must see, at least for French Europeans
","This movie is so great about all stuff: acting, filming, plot, humor (but it's definitely NOT a comedy    you laugh because you get to see the twisted minds and thoughts of everyone around, and that's the most funny part)... everything is unique and everyone I've met until now who have seen it have loved it. For my part it became my best movie just after seeing it because it's so unique: every other film I like has some kind of ""cousin"" which looks a lot like him, and even if it's not as good both movies are likeable and quite ressembling...<br/><br/>But ""le fabuleux destin is the only movie of its genre. How to describe it? think about magnolia, but it's much more refreshing: I think magnolia was made to have people think over human relations, whereas ""Le destin...."" is clearly about happiness and contentment. When you've seen this movie, you are happy, and during the seeing, you just like every single picture.<br/><br/>However, I'm curious to see how Americans will like it. I wonder if it will ever be translated because I think a lot of it is likeable because of our culture. Anyway, if you've seen it and didn't like it, before voting ask yourself it it's because it wasn't fun or because you didn't understand it.

Amelie is an example of what a visionary director can do with a strong story (I haven't been delighted by a movie like this in years) and fresh cinematography (can we all live in Paris for at least two years). In the lead role, Audrey Tautou is the discovery of the year.  She is so ""fresh"" on the screen .. her wonderment of the world in this movie is remarkable.

Life can be so stressful, we make it so complicated for ourselves. With English Subtitles and symphonic DTS 5.1 Sound, in just a short time with Amelie you'll be as rejuvinated as I feel right now.<br/><br/>For those that say its 'cute' and fob it off to the dusty bargin bin shelves - don't be so miserable with life.

"hkevin627","Null","1","3","20 April 2002"," A well made film with heart and depth to cheer anyone up
","I really wish that I had seen this at the cinema, because it's an instant classic.  The plot is outlined by IMDB so I'll concentrate on what made this so special for me.<br/><br/>100 years into cinema nothing is totally new and individual, but this is refreshingly diverse from the norms of popular cinema. It is quirky, avoids glamour and embraces the little oddities in people and life.  This makes it so human, you care about the story and the characters. The film holds your attention and fascination all the way through.<br/><br/>I like the anecdotal stories and comments about characters.  There are scenes which I have just had to play over and over, laughing out loud. The same goes for the final scene, funny and heart-warming.  The acting is wonderful with subtle looks and mannerisms that make the characters so engaging.<br/><br/>I watched it on DVD with surround sound and this movie shows off the format. Such a change from looking for bullets and car chases to immerse you in the spectacle of home cinema. It is shot so well, such colour and wonderful camera views.  This, along with the inventive use of special effects and the wonderful soundtrack just make this a film to envelope you.  Again, this holds your attention and concern for the characters and the story.<br/><br/>
'Amelie' is a feel good movie with plenty of laughs.  It's all the more so because of the theme of various characters withdrawing from life, being too shy, too scared to relate to others or do the things that they enjoy.  For all of it's magical, surreal moments it is made all the more touching because of it's embracing of the real, the mundane and unglamorous aspects of life.  There is resolution and romance in this film that can be identified with, none of it seems artificial.<br/><br/>I like a broad range of movies, and this has broad appeal, as long as you look past the fact that it's a foreign film with subtitles.  It's funny, romantic, gorgeous to look at and very well made.  Quite simply I'm smitten, this is as good as cinema gets."

I've seen hundreds of movies from all over the world during my short 40 years life experience, but few moved me and put me back instantly in my child's happy and careless life as Amélie.  The last movie to enter this special list was ""La Vita è bella"".<br/><br/>Seen on opening night in Montréal with the two persons who have the most important place in my life, we looked at each other when the lights went on at the end and we all wished only one thing: to remain seated and live this experience immediately all over again.  I cannot wait to own this precious gem on DVD and use it as an antidepressant to life difficulties and gray moments.<br/><br/>I do not want to reveal anything from the movie since too much has already been written here and by critics.  I just wanted to share my excitement with other moviegoers and my pride in telling everyone that - at last! - the French movie industry produced one of the best movies in my mother tongue. Fresh, imaginative, breathtakingly beautiful and impeccably played.  A movie that makes you smile, laugh, cry and feel so alive without the need of violence, cruelty, vulgarity and using just a bit of sex in good taste.  I hope the Americans will learn more about ""necessary"" cinema when they'll discover this masterpiece in a few weeks and that they will be clever enough to award it the Best Foreign Film Oscar on March 24, 2002.<br/><br/>As many other IMDb users wrote, you feel so light and joyful when you go back in your real life after seeing Amélie that you really want to kiss everyone on the street and begin seeing the world differently.  A must-see for permanent unhappy and selfish people on this planet.  From now on, I will always enjoy going in a Photomaton and might leave a few pictures there...  If I'm lucky enough, Amélie and Nino might find them and invite me for a trip in their surreal exciting world!<br/><br/>P.S.: I simply don't understand the people who find that 2 hours or so is too lengthy for Amélie's fabulous destiny...  It could even be longer and I would not mind at all.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the film editor applied the perfect pacing and have a wonderful sense of rhythm in telling us about Amélie's original dreams and magical accomplishments."

First the movie was nearly sold out and so my place was terrible and in front at the edge. Nevertheless i was for 2 hours entertained like seldom before,a suicidal gold fish, garden dwarves on a voyage round the world and the imaging of a romantic and fabulous world...Jean-Pierre Jeunet - you know, this wired European who commited Alien 4 (in which at the end North-america is blown away) - is a wonderful creative director and I fell instantly with Audrey Tautou in love. I could just say ""Amelie"" will be a ""classic movie"" but imho this film is more! It has - well, call me crazy - a special magic that only few movies posses but for that i love cinema.

Before seeing this movie I had never really been too enamored with the French language and culture, but now I am.  Every word that came out of Amelie's mouth was like poetry to me.  The subtitles were easy to follow and did not distract at all from the beautiful cinematography of this film.

","When you see Amélie you don´t have to worry about the story, because the most important thing in this movie are the details.  And that is the geniality of this movie, it shows that the films are so much more than a tellingstorys tool.  The films as an artistic medium has a lot of resources to make us feel an aesthetic experience (more than a simple story) and Amélie uses a several amount of them.  Amélie herself tell us that what she likes about going to watch a movie is to see the details that nobody else see.<br/><br/>The movie begun just as a very beautiful film and at the end you find that is much more than this.  From this central idea the movie starts telling us some apparently unlinked events and then introduce each character telling us details about its life like what it likes and what it hates. Make a character that repeat every year the same picture fixing each time a new detail, to the point that now he is trying to catch in a perfect way the eyes of a girl.  The movie has some majestic scenes (Amélie with an imaginary friend, the suicidal fish, the talking photos, she becoming a tear, etc).   With out those moments the movie wouldn´t be the same, neither would be a good movie.<br/><br/>Another important point to think about is how the TV plays as her consciousness."

","If you saw this movie and can honestly say you didn't like it, love it in fact, then I can honestly say that that I am speechless. There are so many wonderful emotions in this movie that even a lifelong pessimist will come out of the cinema smiling and thinking of a brighter tomorrow. The movie is very very funny and is celluloid proof that the so called ""Academy"" doesn't have a clue when it comes to good movies. If you saw both ""No man's land"" and ""Amelie"" you should know what I mean. But no matter, those Oscar people have lost the last speck of credibility a long time ago.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is a truly magical movie and it doesn't try to be anything else. Right from the start you are taken for a joyride through her wonderful and exciting life and it doesn't end untill, well, the movie ends.<br/><br/>The brilliant visual portrait brings a great amount of freshness and ingenuity to the movie as well as the screenplay. There is also the score that fits perfectly with the movie and the great voice of the narrators that made me want to learn French What I didn't like about the movie was its ending, because I thought that the optimistic atmosphere of the movie was spoiled with the unnecessary and incomprehensible twist of faith(when Amelie's coworker goes out with Nino???). Because of that everything that the movie was trying to(and did) accomplish, the wonderful and surreal world of Amelie, was suddenly placed onto reality and the magic was lost.<br/><br/>But that's just me. <br/><br/>A movie that doesn't hide its ambitions and rightfully so, due especially to the great leading actress, without whom the movie wouldn't, couldn't have lived up to its potential. She has the most amazing eyes that could have done all the acting by themselves. I never say this, but go see it.     9/10"

","If no miracle is going to happen, this is certainly one of the best movies in 2001. Of course the movie's merits and shortcomings could be discussed in great length, but all I have to say is this:<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see that there are still people out there who can simply tell a simple story, a love story, a fairy tale without resorting to vulgar humor, silly effects and brand-name faces to hide their creative shortcomings. It helps to know that someone is still out there who can still characters who are not ""realistic"", but unique, and who get a life of their own. And at last, it is also good to see that people still honor good work and fresh ideas - that ideas that are not produced to be 100% mass-compatible are still honored."

It shows a very funny as well as fairy-like world, set in a wonderland-like Paris, in the Montmartre area, where an imaginative young woman makes happy people she likes, and drives crazy people she dislikes.<br/><br/>In the theater where I saw it, the audience was caught in the movie after the first minute, and everybody remained seated until the end of the credits, which is rare ! When I stepped out of the theater, I felt happy. I don't see how it is possible to dislike this movie. It gives the same feeling of joy and happiness as ""It's a wonderful life"" (Capra) or ""Black cat White cat"" (Kusturica)."

"fonquer","10","1","3","6 August 2001"," Never thought that i could fall in love with a movie
","I saw ""Amélie"" at the Fantasy Film-Festival. It was not planned, because i'm normally more interested in thriller-, horror-, scifi- or splatter-stuff. it was just a cancelled date, that brought me into the cinema, and what should i say, i never was so happy about a cancelled date. It's hard to describe, but ""Amélie"" made me a six year old boy again, that, first time in a cinema, watched with an open mouth and big eyes 'the wizard of oz'. I'm 33 years old and i saw tons of movies, but no one kicked me like ""Amélie"". I had the feeling not to watch a movie, it was more become a part of the wonderful world of Amélie Poulain, which definitely depends on Bruno Delbonnels incredible greatful camera-works and one of the best storyscripts written the last years. Jeunot and Laurant created lovely, bizarre, obscure and mischievous characters and they where filled with so much live by excellent and marvelous actors (specially Audrey Tautou, Matthieu Kassowitz and Dominique Pinon)that everything went perfect. It's a cineastic pleasure to watch garden-dwarfs travelling around the world, to learn what the production of crepes have in common with the production of vinyl-records or to enjoy how a goldfish survives suicide. And when Amélie takes care, that the hypochondric tabac-woman and the pessimistic regular become passion lovers and having wild sex at the cafe-toilet or she protected the small shophelper from his tyrannic chief by drivin him slowly insane, you don't know if you're tears coming from laughing or sentimental emotions. When i went out of the cinema, i walked like a feather and wanted to embrace the whole world. Amélie, i love you and your world and from now on i promise, that i'll never make stupid jokes about dreamers and freaks, because their world is so much brighter than the one we must live in.<br/><br/>The biggest difference to ""Delicatessen"" and ""Cities of the lost children"" is, that there are no morbid or pessimistic moments in ""Amélie""."

","Amélie Poulin is another one of those stories that depicts the gravity of the human situation, but in no way 'just another one'; this master pies combines a great plot, with enchanting music, hilarious punch lines, marvelous imagery, trancing emotions, and it'll glue you to you're seat, comfortably, right to the last minuet, and after, it'll make you're like sweeter.<br/><br/>The motif is pretty simple, it doesn't tackle problems like sex or money, it's dedicated to the little things that make up our humanity so bearable, and yet, this is no romantic joy-ride, it's a conscious journey in which fantasy plays leitmotifs, taking the shape of each situation, carving it slid from sounds and image.<br/><br/>Like American Beauty; it tells us that 'there is hope!' not necessarily by love, but but the love of one's own dreams; life doesn't have to be wonderful, but can make it be so by dreaming, and when you dream truly enough, there's no line left between reality and imagination.<br/><br/>Amélie is a cute young parisian, who appears so sweet and harmless, but actually capable of anything others wont expect. she's the master of her illusions, while the others are captives of theirs, that what makes her the strongest. the only thing holding her down from becoming also the master of her own 'real' life is fear, that soon she discards realizing, with some help, that 'when you're bones are not made out of glass, you can survive the bumps of life'.<br/><br/>If you liked American beauty, Magnolia, and the Royal Tennenbaum; you'll love this, if not; then take my word for it: this is one of the best movies ever made."

Thus is le fabuleux destin d'amelie poulain, a film with subtle perfections, incredible moments of cinematography, acting and above all a heart-felt story of a european metropolis taken back to a setting that is both modern in how we think of things nowadays and classical, the way the good world use to be. See this film, if you can, in a theater, with someone you care about, and you will walk out, feeling alive, feeling good, and filled with ""bonheur"". I won't describe anything, but only say that a great description eliminates any meaning it has for this piece from the director co-director of 'Delicatessen' and 'The City of lost Children' a visual masterpiece, an incredible filmic feat."

","When I had first seen the commercial for Amelie on TV, I decided I would see it in the theater, so until I could find time in my busy schedule I downloaded the trailer. Trailers always look good, Amelie's is no exception. When I watched the trailer for Pearl Harbor I thought the movie was going to be incredible, I have to say however, that it was a real disapointment. With this I began to worry that Amelie's trailer would turn into another Pear Harbor, in a sense. In no way was this the case, the movie was incredible, I couldn't believe it! I give it 5 stars. Amelie has become my new favorite movie - this is coming from a die hard StarWars fan. In two words: Wildly eccentric."

It was a very uncommon work of art that gathered together all the elements required for being an  exceptional visual feast that fed all the minds that were enlightened by it. Set in a very weird/fantastic environment, it was impossible not to be absorbed into it like a whirpool messing with all your senses. That film is called ""the fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain"" or if you like just ""Amelie"".<br/><br/> And behind these unique fantasy view of France, there is the man, the director who took for himself the hedonistic role to make happy most of the people who would see the movie...Jean Pierre Jeunet. The murky, mysterious man who brought us the Post-Apocalypse in his previous work, now brings redemption in a world that is as strange as the others he's created.<br/><br/> Amelie, is the story about a unique girl who suddenly realizes that her mission in life is to bring joy to others, but at the end is incapable to help herself when it comes to her happiness. This film, is the kind of fairy tale these days are lacking; like a couple of Aspirins that relieve you from the pain the outside world brings you for 2 hours.<br/><br/> Now, the fact that the film is a fantasy and that Amelie might be the sweetest thing you would ever see, doesn't mean that she's capable of being mean with the people that messes with her. Just look at the poster for the movie, we see a girl that is happy just by enjoying the small delights of life, but that will get back at you if it is necessary. At the end, a person just like any of us in a world just like ours, only sought with different eyes and color...green.<br/><br/> It is implied that this film has become one of my all time favorites ever.

The story is entertaining and funny, including several brief anecdotes about the characters and what they think about as well as creative cinematography.  The actress who plays Amelie is adorable without being irritating and her adventures are a perfect example of the excitement in reality that everyone wants to experience. Jeunet is a master of buildup who has proven that while the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the lines which curve and bend make the trip much more interesting.  He is able to make the audience believe that strange and extraordinary things can happen in reality. Sometimes it is the short, brief encounters that occur and result in positive relationships that remind us that life is beautiful.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this film I would recommend ""City of Lost Children"" which, while a darker fantasy, has the same incredible build up to different events."

","In a year of film that was enmeshed in mediocrity, there was one effulgent star that shined far brighter than the rest.  That film was Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, ""Amelie.""  Jeunet adeptly exacts excellence in all aspects of this film.  His use of colors and cinematography is magnificent, and the acting is first rate.  Audrey Tautou proves to be more than proficient at capturing the nuances of her character.  Every word she utters, and every face she makes, leave no doubt in your mind that she was born to play the part of Amelie.  Also, her surrounding cast are effective at both complimenting Amelie's character, and establishing themselves as part of this truly captivating tale.<br/><br/>Further, director Jeunet proves his worth in the use of subtleties to help paint the larger picture.  I've actually seen this work of art twice, and the second viewing was actually much better than the first.  Many of the details that initially seemed inconsequential, actually turned out to be quite prophetic in the end.  Pay close attention to the details of Amelie's solitary childhood, and how it ushers in her inability to truly communicate with others.  This is just one example of Jeunet's effort in this carefully crafted work.  In short, he does a masterful job of tying together many details, and thus, artfully presenting a film that will leave you begging for more.<br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack is indeed the crowning jewel of ""Amelie.""  An already great film is enhanced much further by Yann Tiersen's stroke of genius.  Unfortunately, I was so enraptured with the film the first time, that the music was taken in more on a subconscious level.  Upon reading about the soundtrack, I made a concerted effort to pay more attention to the music the second time.  Thank goodness I made the effort, because the music adds to the film in grand fashion.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""Amelie,"" run, don't walk to the theatre.  If you saw a better movie in 2001, I'd like to know what it is!!"
"Ed-90","10","1","3","8 January 2002"," Fabulous film in every way
","I loved this film...it excels in so many areas.  It's very funny, very touching, very human, very weird, very sad, very very.  When I see a film like this I wonder why Hollywood does not (or cannot) produce films of its quality (""Martha Fokker"" indeed).  I guess what was best about Amelie was that is was <real>; that what she did and felt was something all people could identify in themselves:  her desire for justice, but not in the tired old legal way, but in a real, human way.  Her desire for love, not simply for herself, but for others in the world, even for those who the world sees as misfits, or as somewhat undesirable in appearance or behaviour.  I loved the film, my wife loved the film (an unusual agreement!), and we're going to see it again."

But forget Harry Potter, forget Lord of the Rings, no movie is going to be as good this year as Amelie (or even next year). The story, the characters, the surroundings, the cameramovements, the light, the scenery, the music, nothing, and I mean really nothing, has a bad side ... that's why this is a absolute 10 out 10 ten movie (a 10+ would be better).<br/><br/>By the way, this morning I saw it for the third time.

"meechiganman","10","1","3","6 January 2002"," Every one of my friends will see this film! Marvelous!
","Amelie is most likely the best movie released this year. Charming and whimsical, it invokes a feeling of joy for finding the good in our lives. Make sure you have all that you need and don't drink too much prior to this film, because if you miss one part of this film you will inevitably miss a joke or punchline later in the movie. The mastery of Amelie is that nearly all the characters has just the right amount of character development, giving us enough insight into their lives to make each plot development poignant and fun. There are a lot of fantastical scenes where reality is bent a little, but I think most people have had the same kinds of thoughts and seen the same hallucinations at one point in their lives. Audrey Tatou is gourgeous and endearing at the same time with a grin that can't help but make you laugh. The payoff for this movie comes right near the end, and you feel every bit of emotion that can be wrung from it. I've seen Amelie three times, as of today, and I plan to see it many more times while I accompany all of my friends to see it. Also, this is a great date movie! LOVE IT!"

"misspeggy","10","1","3","16 June 2001"," A contemporary fairy tale
","Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is the kind of movie everybody expects to see when they go to a movie theater. Cinema can't make us dream anymore like it used to, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet found the receipt for beautiful movies. He already made us dream with La Cité des Enfants Perdus, but it was in another world, and in other times. Amélie Poulain is a young girl living a regular life in Paris, when she discovers that she can, with very little means, change the others' lives. She can give happiness to people, without waiting for reward. In fact, she doesn't do anything special, but she can, for example give sight to an old blind man, just making him cross the street. She can cure hypocondria... But she doesn't need any power, just a pure heart. What about her? Who will help her to be happy and change her life? Who will take care of her? She seems to be unable to help herself. But I told you, it's a fairy tale. There must be a prince charming..."
"hollygurll","10","1","3","26 December 2001"," Amelie is a clever, eye-dazzling, and thoughtful satirical romance.
","Amelie, a coquettish little girl with a disturbed family, grows up into a wide-eyed imp whose life view is charming, wry, and luscious. Unfortunately, it is also lonely, so Amelie plays at match-making, avenging, and discovering -- romping through her comfortable Paris with a warm heart and a devilish mind. Populated with characters as intricate and charming as our heroine, the movie is a whirl of emotions, characters, and layers of meaning set with cafe china and velvet boudoir curtains. Highly recommended."
"rmonyb-1","10","1","3","26 December 2001"," A great movie with a lot of heart
","""Amelie"" is a delightful movie and lots of fun. Coming on the heels of the filmmaker's earlier, darker works, it's refreshing to see that he is not a ""one-note"" artist, even if those earlier notes were excellent as well. It's the best date movie in years."

"clevertwist31","10","1","3","22 December 2001"," A Movie for the Dreamers
","I have a message for all who might scoff at this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, of course this movie is a fantasy, all movies are. If you want the run of the mill fantasy; your gritty, your bloody, or your just plain gruesome, you can have it. But don't knock a movie that has heart just because you have forgotten yours. If you are not touched by movie's end, if your heart does not palpitate in recognition of past memories reenacted on-screen, if you do empathize with Amelie's losses, her shyness, her utter humanity,I am afraid, you have lived your life in vain-or are otherwise very hardened. To not know the pain of solitude or the loss of a dear friend or the fear of becoming close to someone and letting them truly know you is a reflection on you, not the movie. If you cannot relate to this movie you are living your life in a box. Either that or you take life too literally.<br/><br/>Also, you cynics, you must remember this is a movie. (A wonderful, excellent, quirky, and endearing film.) Yet, there is one requirement for viewing this film. You must be a dreamer. This is the movie for the underdogs who have never lost the courage to look up at the stars and thank God-or whomever-for the gift that they possess just by being alive. Amelie teaches us to be thankful for the little things, a child's laugh, a cat's purr, a blue sky, simple acts of kindness. And believe me, by reading these hateful reviews, these are things that we, as a culture and a world, need to be reminded of.<br/><br/>Maybe next time you're watching a film you think is superior to the so-called fluff of Amelie, you could do a reality check and realize life imitates art but only for those who truly believe in beauty.<br/><br/>To the dreamers: Don't let the cynics dissuade you, watch this film at all costs, Amelie will inspire you as only a kindred spirit can."

","I'm an uncouth American and not exactly chomping at the bit to see subtitled films. However, the trailer looked interesting, the movie is rated very highly on this site, and my friend had free passes, so off I went, to the Century Landmark, the huge independent/foreign theater we have in Chicago.<br/><br/>I was amazed. It is hard to explain without experiencing the movie, but I didn't want the movie to end. Felt the length was just right. In fact to me the movie seemed flawless. I will definitely see the movie again, and annoy everyone I know about how they must see this movie. I don't usually rave about movies but this one is an exception."
"DR.Z","10","1","3","28 December 2001"," Paris in the sunshine

Paris is also about<br/><br/>beauty, and Montmartre, Sacre Coeur, Latin Quarter, Austerlitz train<br/><br/>station et al never looked better than in Amelie.   And the beauty in<br/><br/>the heart of Amelie, the chronic loner and outsider who yearns to<br/><br/>make a difference in people's lives (and ultimately affects her<br/><br/>own)is even more affecting than Paris in the sun.  The meanies<br/><br/>get their comeuppance, the lonely hearts find warmth, the<br/><br/>disconnected re-connect, and for an all too brief 2 hours in the<br/><br/>winter, we are transplanted into a wonderful movie land.

Intelligent, visually intense and beautifully filmed, well acted in the best French farcical tradition, this movie rocks! It's fun, fantastic and sexy, but the amazing thing is that it is also very real in its characterizations of human behaviors and, especially, human quirks.

I must admit I've seen it in its original language (yes, I speak French) but I guess the translation made it very good...<br/><br/>The rhythm of the movie is quite unusual especially for a (partially?) French movie and I find it really breathtaking by moments even no specific action is shown. That's what we call magic!<br/><br/>The flick is so beautifully shot and the colors temperature/scale so bewitching you go out from it with that broad childish smile only a fairy can put on your face.<br/><br/>Bottom line: To be seen over and over again."

","This movie is an embarrassment of riches, but could easily have been thirty minutes shorter. A story about a person doing good for the people around her with elements of fantasy and a love story at its center. This manipulations of Amelie are reminiscent of Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" although it's teeming with originality too. It's a mix of pleasant & ingratiating ideas. The pleasant ones are the reason to see it. The ingratiating ones border on the twee and sophomoric. I could have found half an hour to delete. For 'pleasant' it's a very hard sell. At a certain point you feel like Jeunet would strangle you if it made you like him more. I admire this movie more than I enjoy it. The cat and mouse things is a bit precious and goes on a bit too long. And I've never understood how if Matthieu is stroking Tatou's cheek in the funhouse, how can he not know it's her at Les deux Mouls? Her haircut is kind of distinctive from front or behind. <br/><br/>It's miles beyond what Jeunet and Caro did in ""Delicatessan"" and ""City of Lost Children."" Two overwrought movies that are too clever for their own good and rapidly wear out their welcome. This is more directed. Some familiar elements from the other movies are mixed in with fresh ingredients here: Contrived cause and effect, special effects, eccentric camera work, twins, and innocent children. <br/><br/>A commentary track by Jeunet is very nice. But it's a mystery why the special edition requires two dvds. There ain't much on it.<br/><br/>The frizzy-haired gal behind the counter was Jean-Pierre Leauds hotty mother in the 400 Blows."

Story-line: brilliantly clever- there are so many things going on, but in a coherent way that tricks us as well as Amelie's ""subjects.""  The opening scene had me cracking up.  I wondered if the rest of the film could be as well-paced and strong as this, and I found out it is.  I bonded to Amelie right away, and was fascinated with the quirky characters that inhabited her life.  Soon, she began to observe the world around her, as did I.  As she began setting up her ""stratagens,"" I became an active part of the film. The ending left me happy, and with closure.<br/><br/>Upon first viewings, I wonder if a film will hold up after five or ten watchings.

"crypticcrytic","Null","1","3","14 December 2001"," A delightful tale
","What forms a personality? Nature, nurture, trauma, training? Here is a film that gives you some insight into the development of a very unusual child. This film has a charm and a lightness that lets you excuse most of its flaws. Who can resist a young woman setting out to be a do-gooder? Well besides you Senator Thurmond.  And as we follow her through a series of amazing coincidences, tragedies and connections, you must suspend your disbelief in the magic of good intentions. It makes me want to visit Paris, sit in a bistro and watch a story unfold.<br/><br/>After we meet her parents, we can see why Amelie is such a free spirit. Her parents were wound so tight she had no choice but to spin free. And their tragic experiences would have given any child a chronic sense of irony. She does suffer from terminal cuteness though that's not particularly annoying in this film.  <br/><br/>The narrator introduces most characters with an unusual style. He gives us more than we want to know about them and things that we would never expect to ask. And character development proceeds throughout the film giving the audience a humorous insight to the most minor roles.<br/><br/>Amelie lives in a dream world but one which so closely parallels the real that at the crossover points we find characters out of a nightmare.  The bitterness of spinsterhood, anger of relational rejection and the intolerance of abuse perforates her world, providing an opportunity for Amelie to intervene. Whether well thought out or merely by coincidence, Amelie pull off some amazing strategies to improve the lives of her hapless associates while her own needs are addressed only indirectly. <br/><br/>
Amelie will give you a brighter outlook on humanity, the possibilities of relationships and a renewed hope for the potential of filmmaking. Who says they don't make them like they used to?"

"alafolle","9","1","3","12 December 2001"," A film that no sentient creature could possibly dislike.
","French cinema often leaves me underwhelmed, so I was pleasantly shocked by ""Amelie"". Rarely, if ever, has a film so perfectly captured the spirit of a unique character and thoroughly infected its viewers with her charm. But what really caught me off-guard was the film's wonderful sense of humor. Amelie is so many light years more romantic, funny, and creative than Hollywood's recent so-called ""romantic comedies"", that the makers of such movies should be forced to quit their professions, move to Uzbekistan, and take up goat-herding.<br/><br/>The only meaningful comparison is to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", but ""Amelie"" is significantly more entertaining. Much like a certain other actress named Audrey, Ms. Tautou is absolutely charming. Indeed, the entire cast is stellar, breathing a real vitality into the troop of oddball characters that inhabit Amelie's world. Jean-Pierre Jeunet takes obvious delight in capturing the quirks and oddities of life, adding surprising depth to characters and events that might otherwise feel clichéd.<br/><br/>I've heard many people say that they don't like to watch films with subtitles. I say that anyone who can read at a high school level, and possesses a soul, should enjoy ""Amelie"". You'll love it. <br/><br/>If nothing else, you will never look at gnomes the same way again."

A superb date film, if there ever was one. I'm a devout cynic, and this film actually exuded a life-affirming influence over me, nonetheless. Extremely recommended!"

It takes a hell of a movie to make me care or even crack a smile, but man, if I didn't walk out of ""Amelie"" grinning like a complete and total buffoon.  ""Amelie"" is cinematic wizardry of the first order.<br/><br/>Paris has never looked better as director Jean-Pierre Jeunet centers his story on an Oscar-worthy performance by Audrey Tautou.  So vulnerable, so cute, so unabashedly good, the emotions of the character of Amelie Poulin seep into the minds and hearts of the audience.  She is surrounded by quirky neighbors and co-workers that make up a few major strokes of ""Amelie's"" canvas.  Jeunet also populates his film with bizarre special effects that provide a better grasp of the interior of Amelie's world, making the entire movie a free-for-all funhouse of imagination and wit. <br/><br/>
Anything could happen, which is not something you could say for ninety-nine percent of the romantic comedies that are released in America.  Freddie Prinze Jr./Tom Hanks/Richard Gere falls in love with Jessica Biel/Meg Ryan/Julia Roberts, but doesn't really talk to her very much, before gunning to the airport to talk her off a plane before she goes to New York/San Francisco/Los Angeles for school/work/her fiance.  Here, time is taken, characters are developed, and a journey is made instead of stagnant scenes where the male hero talks to his insipid best friends.  ""Amelie"" is so full of brilliance and charm and full on verve that the pat and simple ending may not come for those who want it.<br/><br/>**** out of 4"

","We're introduced to Amelie Poulain at a very early stage in her life (as sperm), which made me nervous that I was going to sit through this person's ENTIRE life in two hours. Not so. The opening sequence simply lays out the groundwork for the rest of the story, thematically and visually.<br/><br/>
For the rest of the film, we follow Amelie as a 28-year-old woman who, after her love life doesn't make her happy, devotes her life to performing secret, inventive acts of kindness toward others. The deeds she does are so imaginative and funny, the audience can't help but fall for her. The way they are presented is equally imaginative. <br/><br/>We soon realize that the acts are a sort of defense mechanism, a wall she's thrown up between her and personal relationships. She longs for contact but is almost afraid of it, something attributed to her parents, like the way her father never touched her except once a year when he'd give her a medical exam. Her neighbor, Mr. Dufayel, the ""man of glass,"" helps her to realize it's time to be as kind to herself as she is to others. As the story moves on, Amelie comes out of her shell more and more, finding the courage to speak up, to ""get the last word in.""<br/><br/>The same theme is strung through the film, that beauty unseen is tragic, but is still beauty. Amelie's selflessness is her beauty, but after a while she realizes it's not making her completely happy. She finds herself using her craftiness to trap the man of her dreams, but has trouble actually facing him. <br/><br/>""Alien: Resurrection"" aside, this film should lift Jean-Pierre Jeunet out of his cult' filmmaker status. His films have been famous only in film people' circles, at least here in the States. But hopefully ""Amelie"" will change that. It's no less inventive and visually captivating than the rest of his work, but targets a wider audience demographic.<br/><br/>
It's French, so expect crude humor than U.S. audiences will find out of place. Still, ""Amelie"" is the kind of foreign-language film that could break away in America like ""La Vita e Bella (Life Is Beautiful)"" or ""All About My Mother."" It will likely be that foreign film that leaves all others behind in the Oscar race.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I was introduced to the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet by a friend of mine through his earlier piece 'City of Lost Children' which blew my mind with it's sort of 'fairytale techno noir' that is very much a staple of his work when you look at 'Delicatessen' or 'Alien: Ressurection'.<br/><br/>But if genius is measured by the way in which an artist can diversify and build upon his distinctive style, then it is obvious that, with Jeunet, we have a genius in our midst forAmelie is so far from anything he has done, yet is so obviously only HIS work.<br/><br/>I went to see Amelie after having spent a week with one eye pressed against a viewfinder, the other the computer screen as I shot and edited a production of my own and very much emotionally, mentally and physically drained. If ever I needed a breath of fresh air in regard to what film could do for me, this was it.<br/><br/>Jeunet saturates the screen with vibrant colour and sets up (within the first 15 minutes) the character of Amelie to such a degree that you just want to get in and enjoy this film, and that's what you do.<br/><br/>Some have branded this amazing work as too naive to be taken with any real degree of seriousness, but I feel that this is a more cynical view that tends to see naivety (or even optimism) as some sort of character flaw. I hate to refer to current times, but if you want something darker and less fun, open your damn newspaper. We all need films like Amelie because without them, we end up with brittle and cold hearts."
"rogierr","Null","1","3","6 December 2001"," Jeunet steps out of the dark
","Amélie leaves the macabre and moisty darkness behind and tries to change destiny: born under a bad sign, but coping and helping others while she is on the job.  Not better than Delicatessen (1991) or City of the lost children (1995), but a certainly more accessible story (and not too graphical nudity too).  Strangely it was a summer hit, while it might as well be the ultimate christmas film, because it accomplishes with subtlety what most other christmas movies tried with in-your-face emotions and cliche tear jerking.  None of that here.  There is the subtle mood of surreal intervention with everyday life and virtually impossible camera-angles to accompany the kinetic and dynamic cinematography from Bruno Delbonnel as you might expect from a life that's existent of dreams (disappointments) and coincidences.  Comparable in a way with the appropriate cinematic acrobacy of Fight Club (1999) and the eye-opening imagery of coincidences in Magnolia (1999).  120 minutes seem not to be enough to tell the entire heartwarming story of Amélie.<br/><br/>And then: how to cast a woman like Audrey Tautou with eyes like worlds and lips like magic.  Where do you find actresses like that?  Only Liv Tyler (Stealing Beauty, Lord of the Rings) could come close to that.  The cover of the video doesn't do justice to the awardworthy protagonist.<br/><br/>9/10"

","As Luc Besson is the only French Director that made it big time, it's very easy to forget what gems lie in the sea that is France. But I can see without a doubt that this movie is one of the most clever written comedies (if you can call it that) I've ever seen. That in combination with the most excellent shots of Paris in the summer and the bright use of colour, makes you fall instantly in love with Amelie and her surroundings. I can only say one thing, I can't wait to get to Paris again."
"madmaxdog","10","1","3","3 December 2001"," Absolutely wonderful
","I found this to be one of the most creative, original, whimsical, and uplifting films I have ever seen.  Jean Jeunet seems to have taken a very personal idea and adapted it to show to the world.  I would not be surprised if he himself has an album of photomat pictures.  The film manages to make people feel as if they themselves experienced an Amelie intervention.<br/><br/>Some people have commented that the style and length of the film does not carry over well to foreign audiences.  If feel that this is an extremely conceited idea.  A writer/director/producer should not have to consider the economics of the film being shown to an audience that speaks a different language when creating.  Anyone in those countries who would have a valid, intelligent opinion should be able to take the origin of the film into account.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10, or 100/100.  The movie makes you feel good."

","French cinema has presented superb movies over the years. I am glad to see that it still does. ""Amelie"" is one of these movies. It's a hymn to hopefulness. There are great ideas that are presented on the film with the best possible way. The humour is very elegant and intelligent (there are some scenes that I couldn't help myself from falling about). Romance and hopefulness are shed all over the movie. Wrap them all together with a very good direction and you make a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Well, enough with words...

","When I told someone in the elevator this morning that I had seen ""Amélie"" over the weekend, she asked, ""Isn't it just pretty much cute girl gets a lot of close ups, does things for people that changes their lives, and then learns some sort of lesson about herself at the end?""  ""Well, yeah,"" I said. ""That's it in a nutshell.""  <br/><br/>Only the worst kind of cynic could dislike ""Amélie,"" however.  Once again the French have come along and shown us how cinema is done.  ""Amélie"" isn't strikingly original or groundbreaking--I've seen funny asides, quick cut-a-aways to imaginary events or fantasies, exocentric but harmless characters, and even talking photographs in other films.  But ""Amélie"" uses all of the above and more not to show off but to charm its audience.  It never misfires, never takes a wrong step.<br/><br/>And Audrey Tautou.  So much has been written about her already that I won't go on about her here.  I do think the comparisons to Audrey Hepburn aren't too far off, though.  Really no actress since Hepburn has been able to steal entire moments of a film with her eyes alone the way Tautou does all through ""Amélie.""<br/><br/>Admittedly, I haven't seen too many titles from 2001, but I'd venture to say this has got to be one of the best films if not *the* best of the year."
"blueprintfilms","10","1","3","1 December 2001"," beautifully crafted film, thoroughly enjoyed.
","This is really the third major motion picture from writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, following his magical film City Of Lost Children and 1991's Delicatessen. Amelie is the story of a young girl whose life changes when she comes across the hidden box of childhood memories of someone who lived in her apartment years ago. She sets out to find the mysterious owner of the box and when she does, her life changes in un-expected ways. The striking quality that enticed me throughout the film was the beautiful cinematography Jeunet employs in some of his scenes. There are many wonderful overhead shots that start behind the character and swim overhead in beautiful 360 degree wide angle shot to end near the characters feet or in their lap. Another rich quality that adds to the story is Jeunets use of silence. The film is scored with an emotional piano arrangement by Yann Tiersen, yet there are moments in the film when not a sound is heard, not a chord, or a breath exhaled. This use of silence offers a wonderful symmetry of drama and suspence to what the audience is viewing on the screen. Amelie is a gorgeous film with witty humor and a coy romantic story. Audrey Tauton's performance is exhilerating! She is undoubtably one of the most adorable faces in cinema today. Ironically the name should suggest a coy resemblance to Audrey Hepburn's charming demeanor that has entertained audiences for decades. Looking forward for more work from the talented team of Tauton and Jeunet.<br/><br/>Hands down this was the best film to come out in 2001."

","While watching Amelie, I was filled (for the first time since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) by my immense love of the cinema.  This movie filled me with joy, but more importantly, with Amelie.  The wonder of this movie is its ability to keep you in the moment.  Every emotion of Amelie is felt by the audience.  Via his poetic and artistic techniques, Jeunet transports you into the separate realities of his characters, as successfully as Darren Aronofsky did in ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but Jeunet's pallete of emotions is far greater. As I exited, a couple of the people I was with were bubbling away, ""Oh, everything about that made me happy,"" ""didn't you just love Amelie so much,"" etc.  Do not let people's simplification of this movie detract from it. Yes, people will fixate on some of the surface qualities of this film, but it is, regardless, a triupmh, as well as the best movie you will see this year."
"antoine rabany","10","1","3","30 November 2001"," A blockbuster for the emotional dreamer
","This is a masterpiece. The movie starts at a frantic pace that makes you think it is going too fast. You think it is going to be easy filming technics, easy laughs and not much of a movie. But this technics is used to give you an overview of all the actors in the movie. And it is quite entertaining. You are left to wonder how much of the actors you are going to know before the movie is over. Well hold your brace! You will enter their EMOTIONS. And that is were this movie is incredibly well made. It is common feature for a long boring slow moving flick to let you enter emotions like sadness, love, hatred ... But this movie while slowing down in pace is still going about 90 miles/hour. And yet you begin to feel the rewards of knowing all the characters in depth. The movie fills your heart, fills your brain and atop of it makes you laugh with its crazyness that resembles a high speed dream of your own (a bit like Woody Allen in this respect). But on the opposite of Woody Allen style that strays away from the main story to get lost in details and escapes, this movie progressively focuses on the heroin and on her dream. Mix all this with alluring filming technics that shifts back and forth from 1950's still standing camera to today's ultrafast travelling (reminding Hidden Dragon, Crouching tiger) and you have a wonderful movie for people that mind their emotions. A blockbuster for the dreamers."
"griffonrl","10","1","3","30 November 2001"," What a film should always be.
","Have you ever seen a movie able to move you inside, make you think, feel more optimistic, friendly or just happy ? This is some of the side effects this movie can do for you. When everything goes wrong in the world, many fell alone, sometimes depressed, losing faith in the life, worried of our future... A movie like this one makes you realize how much everyday life is important, how great life can be, how much we should enjoy all the little things that makes our life, our experience, our difference. This movie is so good, touch you so deeply, that some people preferred to protect themselves (being sarcastic, pragmatic, critic) when they saw it. I read a lot a reviews before going to the movie theater, and even I was expecting something really wonderful, I was far beyond the real value of this pure, state of the art performance. Speaking of criticisms, I remember one of them from a New York Business journal, writing how disgusting was the film, how the sweetness of the story was tasteless... Is this a surprise ? Not really. When you are driven by business values, and you believe your level of happiness is more or less the amount of money you earn or the size of the car/house you own, you can not just think happiness as a simple thing. To critics that found the movie was not realistic, not a true picture of life or Paris, not just trustable... Is not the purpose of a movie to make you dream, to make life looks better ? Why don't use the same critics against all Hollywood movies ? Do you really believe the stories ? In you everyday life, do you really think people look as pretty as in these movies ? And what a nice refreshment to see a non violent film more meaningful that any of the violent stuff coming these days. Are you not so tired of all this violence ? Think about what is going around the world. Only one advice: go see this movie and just watch/ear."

","""This movie will change your life"", that's what is said in trailer. I thought it was a bit pretentious ... before i watch it ! Don't be afraid of ghosts, Amelie Poulain will haunt you for days. I recommend you not to drive just after the film, because it could change your life in an unexpected way ! So how could a single movie change your life ? Well, it'll simply make you happy, and appreciate differently each little joy of life.<br/><br/>This is the simple story of a young woman with a simple life (she is a barmaid), who decided one day to make people around her happy. She acts as a kind of guardian angel, a clever one. Anyway, she has a problem : she is very shy, so she can't take care herself of her own happiness. I won't tell you more about the story to preserve a bit of mystery.<br/><br/>If you remember the two previous (except Alien 4) films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of lost children"", you'll find some strong similarities, and many actors of these movies are again present : Dominique Pinon, Rufus, Tiky Holgado, Serge Merlin, ... . Without Marc Caro, this movie lose the ""dark side"" of the previous ones : there is no violence, no death (except two, but amusing ones), the dominant colors are different. Yes, this film is a Romance, but not at all a naive and boring one, it is really full of details (you need to watch the movie several times to discover it), it's pure poetry. The music, light and simple, perfectly fits the story. One of the most important character of the film is Paris, not the touristy Paris but the charming, human and timeless one, and it contributes strongly to the enchanting atmosphere. Oops ! I nearly forgot to tell you that not only this film is touching and brilliant, but it is very funny ! Audrey Tautou is simply great as Amelie Poulain. Her smile and her big eyes could melt an iceberg, her mischievous voice make her a fairy. You'll undoubtedly love her. Other actors, like Dominique Pinon (what a great actor, so different roles each time, and so perfectly played !), Serge Merlin, Isabelle Nanty, Matthieu Kassowitz, and so many others are excellent. You are not forced to watch this movie, but it should be inhuman to ignore it, it should be refusing happiness."

","Another commenter, from Turkey, said, ""A human being lives as long as they dream and imagine. The day I stop imagining and dreaming will be the day I will be dead."" I think this beautifully sums up what truly great cinema aspires to be.<br/><br/>If one goes into a movie theater only to be entertained for a couple hours and then to forget the experience, that's escapism. But if you are so moved by a film that it changes your life (like seeing Star Wars for the first time), then we're talking about a whole other level. <br/><br/>Viewing Amelie is one of these rare experiences. <br/><br/>Through the dreams of another, we are connected through a shared sense of lonliness in this (seemingly) uncaring world. But someone with a heart of gold (quite literally in one scene) shows us how to love by giving, without any need of validation or compensation.<br/><br/>In one of the most touching sequences, Amelie sees a old blind man trying to cross a busy street. She takes his arm and leads him across. But she doesn't stop there, she holds on and walks him briskly past the shops, describing what's in the windows and what people are wearing. She gives the man a sense of sight for a few minutes. When she drops him off in front of the Metro stop, the man experiences Rapture. She has given him a priceless gift.<br/><br/>This film operates at so many levels, I could write for hours, but I will stick within posting guidelines and simply state:<br/><br/>Amelie is a perfect film."

When bad things start happening around her to the people that she cares about, she decides to anonymously intervene and bring them surprise and joy.  Everything about this movie was wonderful.  The story line was delightful and the direction and cinematography compliment it well. If I were to compare it to an American film, I would say it was like a happy, quirky version of Pay it Forward.

But I disagree with the critics, and I agree with the fans:  I think this is an astonishing film.<br/><br/>I always judge a movie on its own terms.  I don't judge it on some outside criteria of how long it should be, how realiastic it should be.  A movie should not be a confirmation of our own worldview.  It should be a trip into another person's head, a taste of someone else's vision.<br/><br/>And the vision of this director, Jeunet, is nothing less than stunning.<br/><br/>I had seen City of Lost Children, and was ready for the visual feast.  But Jeunet has taken a huge step forward here.  Has a female character been more lovable than Amelie since Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly?  The palate of characters is funny, human, tragic, and full of longing.  The movie pushes you to the edge of your imagination in an exhilarating and yet confident way.<br/><br/>Go to the theater ready to laugh, ready to fall in love, and ready to experience something wonderfully different.  Do this, and Amelie will make you believe in the magic of film."

Its quotes and references are often funny and always apt.<br/><br/>I cannot praise it enough, but if you need further convincing, think of it in similar sumptuous genre-spanning terms as Moulin Rouge and Tears of the Black Tiger.<br/><br/>Only better."

The cinematography is very well done and it evokes all it is supposed to with a beautiful and charming Audrey Tautou even more cute than a young Juliette Binoche. Somehow I find the film less than satisfying, however.<br/><br/> I am at a different point in my life maybe than older coming to terms with my mortality people, but it seems to be the running theme in many french films, a long stretch for someone who grew up on the pain of humanity in Scorcese and Coppola. It seems like Amelie sacrifices her own capabilities to live the simple life as a waitress who finds love around the corner with the photo geek. The only character who has seen any of the world seems to be the garden gnome. A well, I guess I am a sucker for a hard luck story and I take the happy endings with a little too much pessimism.

Who cares if the movie has an effect of a ""lollipop"", life and people can be so bitter, some of us need their escape to find some ""sweetness"" and ""warmness"" in the movies... So millions and zillions of thanks to Jean Pierre Jeunet. A human being lives as long as they dream and imagine. The day I stop imagining and dreaming will be the day I will be dead.

","This film is this year's cinematic sensation among the French and most of Europe. The reception here in the States seems to be along those lines for the time being. We'll have to wait and see for the long-term effects of this movie. There are a few things I want to comment on. <br/><br/>First off, I came out of the theater being amused at this film for the same reason I had for ""Chungking Express."" Two films are very similar in content, tone, and style. I was afraid that this movie would be too ""French"" for me to connect with. My past viewing experience with the 1961 film ""Last Year At Marienbad"" comes to mind, which was utterly frustrating and even torturous for me. It almost made me give up on French cinema altogether. Boy am I ever glad that I didn't, for French cinema is, in my opinion, among the world's best. This movie shows you the highlights of the French film craft. It is an in your face display of ""stop at nothing embrace for life, love, and the world around us."" I laughed most of the way. I found the gimmick with Amelie's father's statuette to be especially funny. I would just love to have lunch with Audrey Tautou. Not since the one and only Jeanne Moreau has an actress pefectly captured the essence of feminine charm. I liked the film's hyper-kinetic type execution and direction as well.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I do agree that the film is very good. Is it one of this year's best? Maybe. The year is almost over and currently, it is safely placed in my year's top ten best list. However, I am a bit perplexed to find that it is currently (as I am writing this) #28!! in the top 250 list among the IMDB users. It is not even close! As a matter of fact, it is the only French movie in the Top 100. How can this be? Our IMDB users must not have seen many French movies. Where are the great works of Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, Agnes Varda...even Truffaut and Tanner...the list goes on and on. What can I say? I'm shell-shocked!!!"
"Moira Rose","Null","1","3","22 November 2001"," Charming Tribute to Odd Introverts
","This film is inspiring on so many levels, not the least of which is how it manages to draw you in to the emotions of the protagonist by showing nothing more than a child amusing herself with home-made toys of a lost era in the first minutes of montage.<br/><br/>Amelie's emotionally deprived and bizarre childhood seem at first to be preparing her to become a modern urban casuality a la the glass-man who paints copies of the same painting year after year, the bitter produce seller, the weeping tippler widow or the hypochondriac tobacco seller. But her charm, beauty, piercing insight and natural openness work in her favor as she battles her own tendency to withdraw.<br/><br/>Finding a box of lost trinkets, she sets out to restore them to the rightful owner. That good deed and the emotional transformation she witnesses seem to set her on a path to right wrongs having to do with personal loss and alienation that she sees in her fellow parisians, not the least of which is her widower father whose only emotional tie is with a garden gnome.<br/><br/>
When love beckons Amelie, she is not at all prepared for the chances she must take. It is hilarious and heart-warming to see her pursue and hide from the object of her desire, an eccentric wounded artist of a man who collects discarded photos from train stations and works part-time in a porn shop.<br/><br/>This movie is a pure delight. Scenes of Montmatre and other parts of Paris often neglected in films evoke a wonderful feeling of that city for anyone who has visited, lived in Paris or left a part of their heart there.<br/><br/>Go see it!~"

Amelie helps so many around her, yet she seems unwilling (not unable) to help herself; it took me awhile to realize the depth of her fear.  For such a lighthearted movie to touch on so powerful an emotion reveals that ""Amelie"" isn't quite so simple as it initially seems.  Audrey Tautou is so physically perfect for the role, that she wouldn't even have to act--luckily for us, she knows how to turn hesitancy and slyness into a comic art form.  And Mathieu Kassovitz (grrr!) finds just the right tone; everything we hear about Nino from others is there, but he allows us to see much more than he lets others see.  They are a perfect match, and the joy in the movie is watching them pursue, back away, go forward, stumble away out of fear of contact. And the squeaky-clean faux-city the director creates is the perfect rarefied atmosphere for this little tale (in fact I find the movie fails only when it goes back to the country--the subplot involving Amelie's father and a ceramic gnome is an old joke, not deftly handled).  This is a keeper.  Go to see it if you're down; heck, go see it even if you are happy--it will merely lift you higher!"

","I am amazed that I could like a movie about something so silly and saccarine.  But it just goes to show you that with clever writing, good acting and inspired and interested directing, simple stories still make great films.  I do think the film has something substantial to offer, it is not a ""pastry"" as some overweight film critics try to pigeon hole it as. Instead, the story attempts to show the importance of triviality and the insignificance of ""world events""  I love the way the story was loosely framed around the Lady Di tragedy.  We see how Amelie's world exists inside and isolated from the events that the newspapers say we should care about. This film is about escaping the isolated voyeuristic world that we live for and begin to live our own lives, rich with our like and dislikes, or fetishes and quirks. While I watched the film, I wondered if Jeunet was in cahoots with Bin Ladin because the timing of the events could not be better.  So turn off the 24 hour war coverage, skip Survivor and see Amelie.  On the way home stop buy you grocer and dip you hands in some grain if you like.<br/><br/>Also, anyone who does not like this movie because it's too cute or sugary, is dead inside and should just off themselves now.

The photography is striking and highly atmospheric: I liked the warm colors. The setting makes you want to live in this dreamlike Paris. The plot is simple, honest, refreshing, touching. The soundtrack is very à la française, with haunting valses played on accordeon. I had the chance to watch the original undubbed version, and I can assure you the script is not bad either, with some hilarious passages! Do not miss one of the best movies ever made.

","Jeunet is one of the best European directors (at least that's my opinion).

I have to say that I didn't know most of the actors (only those that appeared in another Jeunet films), but the most of them make a very good acting in this movie. Like the other movies of Jeunet, in the movie there's a kind of magic during all the movie, it reminds me of a faerie tale, with excellent secondary histories. I will say not much things about the plot, I think its better to discover it by yourself, I would only say that its a fabulous kind of tale, a history about the fear to love and loose that love, and well I think that i said too much.

It is a movie so charming and intelligent and sweet that like many of the other people who have written reviews, I feel compelled to see it again, only two days after my first viewing.  It has so many layers, all of them complex and worthy of much thought--it is a Valentine to everyone who wants to believe that good things will continue to happen to them, in spite of the troubling times we're living in and have been living in, though perhaps more obviously now than at any other time in recent history.  It is a testament to human kindness and its ability to change the face of the world.  But aside from the possibility it will make you feel hopeful about the future of your life, it's just so funny and surprising, and the element of surprise is something many movies lack these days, much to their (and our) detriment.<br/><br/>Jeunet and all of his actors and producers deserve to be praised and admired wildly, and I'm more than willing to do this here and with everyone I know--I'm urging them to see this movie immediately."

","This is the kind of movie Hollywood could never make.<br/><br/>Not that it doesn't have the financial capabilities, but quite frankly Hollywood could try and reverse engineer this film and try and figure out what made it tick and you'd have a couple $100 million directors sitting around like Area 51 engineers marveling a spacecraft, having no idea what makes it tick.<br/><br/>The construction of this film is so meticulous in both its writing and its execution (direction and acting) that it may take several viewings to actually understand what an achievement it truly is.<br/><br/>It's rare that a film contains this much originality in all aspects of its conception. It took me about 15 minutes into the film to truly grasp the scope of this work.  I haven't been this impressed since seeing Moulin Rouge earlier this year.<br/><br/>After watching it I couldn't imagine what the US distributors were saying to themselves when they realized they had to actually market this.  It isn't really marketable.  Much like Moulin Rouge wasn't marketable, these are works of art that you have to SEE to understand.<br/><br/>It would be my wholehearted opinion that if you feel American Cinema (if it can even be called that these days due to the Fear and lack of Creative Insight that grips the Hollywood Enablers) has slipped and is in dire need of direction from any and all willing participants, then this film is for you.  It's the sort of thing that can rebuild a Movie Lover's faith and make you happy to pay $9 again."
"mtrinca","10","1","3","13 November 2001"," Sugar for the soul.
","I went to see this movie with some friends on a whim.  It was recommended to us by one of our French-speaking friends.  I was a little wary, but decided to immerse myself in the experience. From the opening of the movie, I could tell I was in for something different.  The images and the sounds were brilliant, whisking me away into a different world.  Character development was short and snappy, but very effective.  As each character is introduced, we hear little facts and intimate details about them.  Once you understand these details, you feel like you can really identify with these people.  They become more human and less cellophane.  The pace of the movie is sometimes difficult to follow, especially if you have to read the subtitles.  But it definitely is nice to hear the real actor's voices and intonations.  I really dislike how Hollywood tends to dubb movies for audience appeal.  Anyway, the plot is absolutely delightful!  The audience was laughing every few minutes, and every face was glued to the screen.  At the end, people applauded...twice! The last time that happened was when I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  This movie definitely ranks up there with that one.  But whereas ""Crouching Tiger..."" left you feeling somewhat unsure of what to feel, ""Amelie"" left me with deep satisfaction and a love for life and all its excentricities."

","What is there to say about this film other than that it is across the board fantastic?  If ever there was a foreign language film deserving of the attention that it seems to be getting over here, then this is it.  2 hours that pass like 2 minutes, and you're walking out of the cinema feeling a whole lot better than when you went in.<br/><br/>This follows the tale of the eponymous Amélie, who having had a solitary childhood, lives alone and keeps herself to herself.  Amélie however, has a big heart and sets about anonymously helping out the various people in her life and generally trying to `do good'.  But when it comes to applying this same help to herself, her shyness means she prefers to remain in her fantasy world, rather than acting to make her own life happier.<br/><br/>This is a fantastically told, truly funny and heartwarming film.  And all this before even mentioning the inordinate beauty of Audrey Tautou (Amélie), who has the most amazing eyes and soul warming smile in the history of cinema / the World!<br/><br/>Visually, the film excels, with a great look and style to it (unsurprising to anyone who has seen any of Monsieur Jeunet's previous films, from City Of Lost Children right down to Alien Resurrection), and is possibly as near a perfect movie as I have seen in ages.<br/><br/>If you don't walk out of this film totally loving it then you have 2 facts to face: 1) you have no taste and 2) your heart is made of stone."
"NickD","Null","1","3","13 November 2001"," A wildly creative fairy tale
","""Amelie"" is a magic realism fable told with imagination in overdrive. What could have been overly saccharin or cloying is saved by a wonderful combination of humor, inventiveness and the lovely Audrey Tautou as Amelie, the wide-eyed waif who becomes destiny's partner in making miracles happen for her Parisian co-workers and neighbors (and, ultimately, herself). Every moment there is so much going on -- visually, emotionally, narratively -- that it becomes dizzying, but it somehow gels to create a world that is at once dazzlingly complex and profoundly uplifting. Your first thought after the film ends is, ""If life could only be like this.""  And then you think, ""Maybe it is!"""

And the second time, I literally adored this movie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's directing is excellent; his camera works is breathtaking (cf. scene where Amelie playing at ducks and drakes, the opening sequence and so many others). The dialogues are perfect and this is probably the best comedy ever made, since Dr Strangelove, and that's a change from `Walt Disney's' politically correct humor or the crude `American Pie's' sex jokes). All the characters are touching and  unforgettable.<br/><br/>Some scenes are really masterpieces, for example the scene where Amelie imagines that Nino is coming to see her and the curtains move (for those who saw the movie, you know what I am talking about!). This movie is a subtle balance between macro and micro, between logic and absurdity, between beauty and ugliness between dream and reality, in short this is a HUMAN movie). This movie is definitely going to change your life and to quote an American friend I went with `This is the kind of movie we needed in those times'.<br/><br/> I gave this movie a 10, a grade that I usually give on rare occasion, but this movie definitely deserved a 20."

The characters are amazing, from Collignon the grumpy grocer who gets his come-uppance (not once but twice) to Joseph the cynical bar lizard, to the gentle and charming Amelie. None of them are unbelievable.<br/><br/>Amelie is gorgeous but not in a supermodel way that makes one stop and stare (although she is very much my type ;-)). Everyone else is sort of average. You could bump into them any time.<br/><br/>I need to mention the background music: it twinkles or is reflective and sombre, or uplifting according to Amelie's circumstances.<br/><br/>I disagree with people who say this film should have been shorter. Maybe it would make the film ""tighter"", but as it stands it's really easy to soak up and still want more.<br/><br/>I'm quite a fan of many French films, but I'd say this is the best I've seen now. IMHO it's better than ""A bout de souffle"", which is one of my top three favourites. I believe it will be the biggest French film of all time (I've no idea what currently is).<br/><br/>It deserves more than 10/10. Go and see this film, twice. I did."

","If you love Paris, see this film.  If you have missed Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron, see this film.  It is a joy and exactly right for the tense times we live in. Amelie is a lovely gamine of a waitress who has survived a cold and indifferent family and has taken pleasure in practicing random acts of kindness that bring lonely people together.  One of her most appealing kindnesses brings puzzlement and then joy to her own lonely father. Audrey Tautou (Amelie) is a lovely actress with enormous brown eyes.  The Montmartre area of Paris is lovely, bathed in a golden glow.  The supporting cast is an interesting collection of folks, none of whom is as lovely as Amelie herself.  There is an impishness to much of her good works, especially involving a heartless greengrocer who mistreats his assitant. Of course Amelie's good works lead to her finding a love of her own, but the path isn't easy. This is a heartwarming, funny, charming film that is worth working through the subtitles."

","The French romantic comedy `Amelie' has been a big hit in Europe, so I approach it with respect and an eagerness to prove 50 million Frenchmen wrong. Somebody needs to watch the eponymous Amelie closely: she's a little troublemaker with a big heart, and if you don't watch her, she'll steal the gnome from your garden and then your heart. <br/><br/>Amelie commits her grandest scheme by trying to connect with an introverted porno store clerk through a series of clues and coincidences that would make Tom Twyker envious.  In fact, the frenetic pace of Twyker's Lola, as she races for love, seems to have influenced director Jeunet. The romantic ingenuity of `Moulin Rouge' with its lovers' dreamlike pursuit of each other is here as well.<br/><br/>I am distracted, however, by the conscious effort to ingratiate, both in the way-out vignettes (like sending a fake final love letter from a dead husband to a forlorn wife) and the many close-ups of the lovely, bemused Amelie. It is like watching `Life is Beautiful' for the 10th time-the bloom has long ago blown off by the film's obvious campaign to be relentlessly cute.<br/><br/>Paris, however, is another story.  Montmarte is lovingly photographed, not expressionistically as it was in `Moulin Rouge' but spiritually; anything can happen anywhere, and it will be magical if Amelie is in charge of the event."

Amélie's eyes: you can dive into them and swim around for days. Every face, every character, well cast, sharply defined. Like a Kubrick, a master of a totally different universe who has his own unique, recognizable style and vision, not just a multi-camera editor or anonymous hired hand.

Its made me want to look for more movies with Audrey Tatou, who really shines as the title character.  I took my boyfriend to see it with me to glimpse Paris as I knew it, quirky."
"NastyC","10","1","3","3 November 2001"," GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT!!
","I think this film is totally overrated. it is impressive stylisticaly but does, frankly, not deserve it's sky-high position. We have to belive that there are so many good movies out there and on the 250 list, like Reservoir dogs and Se7en and this does not outconquer these masterpieces! The story is a bit too basic and the whole impression is distorted by the screenplay clichés, borrowed from top movies such as Magnolia. Amilie's character is destroyed by the overplaying Audrey Tautou and her wish to seem innocent and naive. the result is a cartoon, a blurred image on something fake.<br/><br/>

","I've heard about this movie a lot. I was full of expectations, which usually means, that the film is not so good, as expected. But - this film is better, much more better. In our country, another very good film was made, the Dark Blue World, and I thought, it can get this year's Oscar. But after I saw Amelie, I found out, it has no chance. Amelie is the best film of this year, in my opinion."

","This movie is extremely well-made and well cast. The beginning takes off like a jet and the clever and insightful story unfolds in front of you like a perfect meal. Some may fight the sweetness and goodness of the piece, but I feel the filmmaker strikes a wonderful balance between whimsy and reality. Some wonderful pay-offs at the end with supporting characters and their stories plus some wonderful huge laughs. Touching and funny. I'll take that anyday. (Plus it shows how clever a romantic comedy can be as opposed to a by-the-numbers mess like Serendipity)."

","Amélie is arguably one of the most original and enjoyable films of the year. You'll find yourself involuntarily smiling throughout. The main character Amélie (played superbly by Audrey Tatou) is such a pleasant character, who you feel yourself really relating to. The support cast were outstanding too, and in the two hours you get to know so many of them so well. With very unusual photography and direction, special effects reminiscent of Ally McBeal, a very sweet story (which can sometimes seem a little bit jumpy), and characters that you genuinely care for Amélie is an absolute must-see. And even if you are put off by subtitles there is enough happening visually to keep anybody interested."
"gianniz","9","1","3","1 November 2001"," Fabulous? Absolutely!
","From French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes a film with the most original and sparkling look I've seen in a decade. Using camera angles and colored filters we've come to associate with TV commercials -- the good ones -- Jeunet turns this romantic adventure of a young Parisian who's afraid of intimacy into a visual whirlwind. His film-making technique owes much of its inspiration to those small orbs of water we shake to see the snowfall, the flashing open-shut action of a painted Spanish fan, and the zig-zag movement of the skateboarder.  My favorite visual trick is the talking passport-size photos, not one, but four, images of a Spanish gent who dispenses advice to the love-lorn hero, brilliantly played by the endearing Matthieu Kassovitz.<br/><br/>The images and scenes pass with a speed the dazzles, as the young heroine Amélie pursues her many projects, whose goal is to improve the lives of ordinary Parisians who populate her life. Her imagination works overtime, even as she herself becomes the target of another form of improvement -- falling in love. The film has relatively little dialog; verbal cohesion comes at crucial points from a slightly authoritative voice-over. The wonder of the film is that it tells it story and holds us viewers primarily through visual means, as well as the enchanting performance of Audrey Tauton in the title role.  And then there is that music, so charming it makes you sit through the credits that roll at the end. And finally you sit in the theater, lit again and reeking with the reality of spilled popcorn, and you wonder if you can't just sit there, and watch this wondrous escapade all over again."

Why Hollywood ALWAYS considers that Their movies are Better than other countries'ones? And over all, why do Hollywood want to steal other countries'good ideas? Please,do your own movies with your own culture, but stop wanting to adapt every thing! I think it could be interesting for american people to discover that foreign movies exist!"
"rdarlington","Null","1","3","27 October 2001"," Escapism par excellence
","It s very unusual for a French-speaking film to break into the Anglo-Saxon world, but this quirky Gallic offering has done it. Some American audiences may find the sub-titles and the saccharine-sweet treatment difficult to swallow, but most British viewers should manage to cope. After all, the Paris portrayed here is the kind of innocent charm that so many of us seek on our holidays there; all the characters are eccentric and we are noted for our tolerance of eccentricity; and, after all,  the eponymous role was originally written for the British actress Emily Watson (hence the name).<br/><br/>In fact, following the stunning success of the movie in its home land, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the lead role than the gamine newcomer 23 year old Audrey Tautou who gives a wonderful performance as the Montmatre waitress who wants to escape her own withdrawal from so much of life by giving some pleasure to so many other lives.  In the process, she discovers love in the odd form of a porn-shop worker who spends his time collecting torn-up photo booth pictures (Matthieu Kassovitz).<br/><br/>The bizarre story-line and the inventive shooting are the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, previously known for `Delicatessen', `The City Of Lost Children' and `Alien: Resurrection' (only the last of which I have seen). The  possibly unfashionable - message of the movie is that all of us need a little magic in our lives and, if we can be the one to bring some of that magic to some other lives, then our own will be enriched along the way. Escapism par excellence."

But when it comes to her own happiness, she needs a bit of help from her friends...<br/><br/>The actors in this film are marvellous and I would like to praise the supporting actors who I find are making a tremendous performance.

","I am not someone who watches foreign language films very often. This is obviously my great loss and shame. 'Amelie' is the second such film I've seen this year. All I can say is, if 'Crouching Tiger' won Oscars, then this should too. It's far superior, in my opinion, to last year's surprise Oscar-scooper, and it was every bit as good as I had expected. I didn't find it too long at all. In fact I didn't want it to end. I don't know where they found Audrey Tautou, but she must be the greatest discovery of the century! Everything else about the film is good, too, (I especially liked the gnome) but it's impossible to forget Amelie herself, with whom I, amazingly, identified. I've never been to France. I certainly want to go now. If I could take 10 films to a desert island (preferably with the means to watch them) Amelie would definitely be there. 9/10. If Hollywood doesn't pull its socks up, I'm going to be fully converted soon. An utter gem."

","Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives us a refreshing tale about Amélie Poulain, an ordinary girl until something extraordinary happens to her: she falls in love. The whole story is then treated just like this was a wonderful tale, a great and exciting adventure. The mood of the movie is somewhat strange: the city's walls are clean, streets are not overcrowded, basically Paris isn't shown as a city but as a mixture between a city and a village. As a result this modern tale has a unique atmosphere."

","The story of a shy Parisian girl and her efforts to find love. This movie rocked! It managed to be uplifting and whimsical, with beautiful cinematography, fantastic, yet understated special effects and lots of heart. The best elements of the excellent, but surreal ""City of Lost Children"" are presented in a fashion accessible a wider audience. The film is said to be wildly popular in France right now. If I ran the world I'd look for a best picture at Oscar time."
"ikaRooS","8","1","3","23 October 2001"," Probably THE feelgood movie of the year.
","Although somewhat of a departure from Jeunet's previous works, ""Amelie"" never fails to amaze and amuse. I have to admit the dark, almost noirish sets and twisted camera angles of ""City of lost children"" and ""Delicatessen"" have set the bar for visuals extremely high. ""Amelie"" didn't get even close to that level, but did Jeunet really want it to?<br/><br/>This movie is bright. It is funny. Touching. And just a tad too long. Though it does picture the process of falling in love, calling it a love story would be quite an injustice, it is so much more. From the moment Amelie decides to go on her quest of good doing you can't help but hold your breath only to burst with laughter every few minutes.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected something as ground breaking as COLC or as twisted as ""Delicatessen"", I do not know. There seemed something was missing but I'm not yet sure what it was. ""Amelie"" is a fantastic experience, but not a masterpiece. Eight out of ten, nine if you're going with a date.<br/><br/>

This movie will be soon a bench mark. Worth a few tons of Prozac.  Rated 10, without any hesitations."
"jhvacs","10","1","3","20 April 2001"," Utterly brilliant French comedy
","If there is one French (or should I say European) director who is capable of showing that original and fresh movies absolutely do not have to come from Hollywood, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is the one to go...<br/><br/>Starting at the first shot showing a beautiful old street in Paris and the first extremely funny 15 minutes setting the characters and the location (à la Magnolia) to the surreal end of the movie; everything is perfectly thought out and shot. You will see incredible camera work and editing you would normally expect from oscar nominated pictures. Even the special effects are some of the best this year (coming all from a French sfx company) and most of all they fit perfectly into the story; as opposite to many modern Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>The story is about a young naive woman who discovers during the movie what love is. So much for the story, I don't want to spoil anything because this is a movie which works best if you know nothing about it. Amélie, the main character is superbly performed by Audrey Tautou, who really manages to get the way how she thinks and feels during the movie to the spectator. The rest of the cast is rather unknown outside France besides Mathieu Kassovitz (actor and director of the controversial ""La haine; Hate"") and Dominique Pinon (the guy in the wheel chair in Alien Resurrection) who is often casted by Jeunet.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet whose previous movies includes ""Delicatessen"", ""The City Of The Lost Children"" (my all-time favorite movie) and ""Alien Resurrection"" is back again to deliver a romantic comedy different than anything made before. He succeeds in producing a comedy which is not only funny but also visually; musically and plot wise most interesting. Part of Jeunet's trademark is that the story is filled with tons and tons of ideas, metaphors and subtle details, more than normally 5 movies have to offer, which makes it almost impossible to get everything the first time you see the movie.<br/><br/>I'm really interested in how this movie will succeed at the box office because it is unfortunately a very difficult movie to advertise due to its strange plot and characters. Even a trailer can't possibly do the movie justice, because the story is too wicked to summarize.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to see this movie because it's a French one or you will miss one of the most impressive movies this year...<br/><br/>9,5 out of 10"

"sharky_55","9","1","4","14 September 2015"," The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain
","Young Amelie is a few years old, and her parents rarely give her any attention. Her hearts beats irregularly once a month when her father does touch her, and so she is misdiagnosed with a heart condition and forced into home-schooling. This fatal combination makes a lonely young girl retreat into her imagination and daydreams. She develops an eccentric streak - Audrey Tautou, along with her excellent wardrobe, display this wonderfully. Every wickedly sweet smile directly at the camera, every little skip in her step after a good deed, the nervous apprehension before the wordless final consummation. It's altogether not too sad; despite not making many genuine connections she finds solace in the little things, and when a fateful TV broadcast of a royal figure appears, her life is turned upside down. She begins a series of little acts of goodness; returning a long lost box of boy heirlooms, punishing the abusive grocery store owner, writing fake long lost love letters, and my personal favourite, leading a blind man across and through the streets of picturesque Paris, with a lively and colourful narration. <br/><br/>Jeunet's Paris is clean, peaceful and romanticised. It is the city of lovers; but without the blemishes. Delbonnel's almost acidic cinematography saturates the frame with bright greens and reds and yellows, together with the impeccable details in the set designs creating a storybook feel for the film. So strange love stories, playful mysteries and exaggerated and unusual characters all fit in very well with the setting. When Amelie's mother dies via suicide jumper at an early age, it's played for laughs, absurd as it may be. And when Georgette and Joseph's attraction culminates into a very loud and animated sex scene in the bathroom, we smile mischievously along with Amelie. Mission accomplished. The sound design also is vital to creating the whimsical approach of the film. Every little moment is magnified as time seems to slow down for tiny details that spiral into big things; the ambient whoosh as the camera eagerly zooms into her surprise and as she peaks her head to discover a treasure from behind her bathroom tile, the little dink as the tile itself pops open to reveal its contents, a mouthful of blowed air as she unveils the dusty lid...like the voice-over suggests, it's played as just as significant as the historic opening of a Pharaoh's tomb. Tiersen's score also has to get a lot of credit - the whimsical mix of quaint mouth organ and accordion pieces, contrasted with quieter, more sombre piano tracks sets the appropriate mood for this modern day fairytale. <br/><br/>The film has a great cast of unique and colourful characters. There's the odd obsessive tendencies of Joseph, who regularly visits the cafe to observe his ex, Gina. In most films his behaviour would be creepy, but in this one when he whips out a voice recorder and makes a overly analytical observation, it's very funny. There's the sensitive and elderly painter Dufayel, whose fragile bones are made of glass and that places him at the mercy of the comers and goers of the block, offering bites of wisdom here and there. And my favourite of them all is the grocery store assistant Lucien, who is played by Debbouze with such a wonderful boyish charm and innocence. His shy smiles are adorable, and when he is allowed to show his heart it's even better; as evident in that delightful scene where he unveils treats for Dufayel via a magic show act. <br/><br/>Amelie contains so many bits and piece of imagination gone wild that instantly captures an audience's attention. I suppose many of us would like to pretend that we are Zorro, mask and sword and all, leaving a signature at the scene of a mysterious act of goodwill, or place ourselves in our own television documentary of a short but fulfilling life. Even better, they all serve Amelie's characterisation; whether it's pointing at her loneliness and insecurities of never finding love, or her nervous excitement after successfully pulling off her own heist, or just her eccentric curiosity, best visualised through a series of quick cuts of every orgasm in Paris in a single second. It's about as far away from seriousness as you can get, but you can't help but smile at all these delightful little vignettes. I for one hope to pull off the garden gnome prank someday. For the fun of it of course, but if it inspires someone to travel and see the world, even better."

","Amelie (2001): Dir: Jean-Pierre Jeunet / Cast: Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Serge Merlin, Dominique Pinon: Delightful French comedy with visual flair and a feel good expression of giving. Amelie is raised in a strict household but has an active fantasy life. She was home schooled due to what her parents believed was a heart condition when in fact, it sped up when around her father who is a doctor. She works at a café but inspired to do good to others. She hunts down the owner of toys she found hidden. She observes a video store clerk who collects photos out of photo booths. She brings together a waitress and an irate customer, as well as befriends an elderly artist with a condition. Original with lush style and intriguing images. Refreshing triumph for Jean-Pierre Jeunet who previously made the wretched Alien: Resurrection. Audrey Tautou is delightful and charming as Amelie whose imagination is visualized through exquisite imagery. Mathieu Kassovitz collects photos at photo booths and is the object of intrigue by Amelie. Rufus plays Amelie's widowed father who is confused with regards to photos of a missing ceramic figure. Serge Merlin plays a painter with brittle bones who observes Amelie's need for companionship. Dominique Pinon steals scenes as a jealous ex-boyfriend who records conversations and bursts bubble wrap. Wonderful portrait of giving that has heart and grace. Score: 10 / 10"

","French so happens to be one of my favorite foreign languages to learn since it is fun to use (if a little difficult to master at first), and this movie helped me not only learn the language but simultaneously appreciate the beauty of the country as well. I love the whimsical magic thrown into the story as we see the world from the titular girl's eyes and imagination how she helps others out, while searching for her true love as well. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (the French Tim Burton) as turned France into a blissful fantasyland chock full of interesting people and sights and sounds bustling with activity.

It's highly relatable as it reflects a sense of progress that each person yearns for at some point or another in their life. I also loved the feisty moments that the viewer can indulge in with the protagonist, her naturally submissive and introverted personality make her antics all the more hilarious.

"adrianff","9","1","4","17 December 2014"," ""Amelie"" is a story about a girl named Amelie who learns to help other people and herself.
","To me, Amelie is a heroine. Imperfect, Amelie learns to deal with what life throws at her. She is diagnosed, by her father, with some problems in her body. (SPOILER!) More specifically, she is diagnosed with heart problems. (END OF SPOILER) She ends up living only with her father. By then, she decides to leave and to start her own place. Also, even though she manages to help many people, she gets to a point that she has trouble trying to help herself, and she needs help from other people.<br/><br/>Amelie's adventures keep her on her feet, as she begins to understand the world and the people around her. She opens up to new possibilities, optimism, if you will. And by performing the great task of a dynamic character, Audrey Tatou manages to send intricate messages to the viewer. Amelie becomes a role model and an example of someone who cares more about other people than herself, and I think that this is one of Mrs. Tatou's achievements. Besides Amelie, every other actor does an almost perfect job of becoming their character, which goes beyond just staying in character. As I've seen in many other films or movies, actors that do mostly comedies, have trouble being serious or even professional in action or adventure movies. This is also why the actors for this movie are so good, they are in a movie with mixed feelings and genres.<br/><br/>This film is romantic, a comedy, and an adventure all at a time, which makes it so simple for actors as great as these to send a message to the viewer. Joseph the stalker shows us how important it is to not get distracted from the world around us, as well as Georgette. Nino Quincampoix teaches us that we should never give up at anything. He works at a sex shop and lives a life without knowing that his true love, as we might call Amelie, is near to meeting him. And finally, Amelie tells us to be ourselves. If it is helping people that shows our inner selves, then we should be ourselves. If it is video games, technology, movies, and series what make us who we are – may I say who I am - then we should go ahead and be who we are."

Paris is supposedly the most beautiful place on earth and going along with all the colors and paintings that this film has it creates a great atmosphere for a film.

","One of the most adorable, original & sweetest movies of all time, Amélie (also known as Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain) is a beautifully crafted, exquisitely narrated & gorgeously rendered tale about the simple things in life that usually are far more valuable than we deem it to be and throughout its runtime, all it attempts to do is to make us pause & admire those small wonders that abound around us at all times.<br/><br/>Presenting its peculiar story with irresistible charm & incomparable wonderment, Amélie is a celebration of life that is captured in such an inventive manner that every single frame of it is an aesthetic work of art & passion and with its insanely magical blend of all aspects, the film also triumphs as arguably the finest effort to come out from French cinema & certainly ranks amongst the greatest motion pictures of all time.<br/><br/>The story of Amélie follows its titular character; an innocent, young & extremely shy woman in her early twenties who, after making a surprising discovery in her apartment one day & using it for a certain good deed that pays off immensely well, dedicates herself to helping others find joy & happiness in their own lives in the most unexpected yet delightful manners while struggling with the isolation of her very own life.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who incorporated chapters of his very own life into the film, Amélie is brought to life in a style that completely defies conventions from beginning to end. Throughout its runtime, it ponders on moments that seem irrelevant to the narrative at hand yet without those little snippets, Amélie wouldn't be the same film for they add a great deal of sweetness into the picture & this level of unusualness is present in every single aspect.<br/><br/>The screenplay is equally good with best parts being how it opens the story, introduces all its characters, paces the narrative & keeps it all glued together. Cinematography in itself is a heartwarming delight that exhibits rich, resonant & remarkable use of colour palette that captures Paris in stunning detail & vividness. Editing provides a refined pace to the whole film and although its 122 minutes of runtime sounds fair, I wish this splendid beauty never ended.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Audrey Tautou as Amélie Poulain is adorable beyond belief & effortlessly manages to win hearts with her extraordinary performance. Beautifully capturing the innocent, naive & shy nature of her character, it's impossible for me to imagine someone else playing this role because Audrey turned out to be the very definition of Amélie as if she was born to play her. The immensely cute Flora Guiet also deserves a mention for she was equally amazing as young Amélie.<br/><br/>And last but not the least is Yann Tiersen's mesmerising score which seamlessly integrates into the narrative to further elevate the joyous, cheerful & pleasant ambiance present in the picture and, together with other aspects, effortlessly succeeds in transcending its viewers to an otherworldly experience for 2 hours. The storytelling is unique, the performances are superb, the music is powerfully evocative, the direction is simply impressive craftsmanship, and because of all that there's no denying that Amélie delivers on all fronts.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Amélie is a celebration of selfless good deeds, the joy of little things, the satisfaction one gets in making a person smile and how our actions can really inspire & change someone's life forever. A whimsical journey & a life-altering drama that remains one of the most heartening & gratifying film experiences of my life, this is one masterpiece that left me smiling like a maniac like never before & I really mean it when I say that ""Without Amélie, today's cinema would be the scurf of yesterday's"". One hundred percent recommended."

","I just finished watching this film. Its one of those that is more a piece of art rather than some typical film out there. At times it makes no sense because it has no definitive purpose, what will happen?<br/><br/>But thats what makes it so great. Amelie takes you on an adventure of someones life, maybe someone a bit EXTRA Ordinary. By the end you love it and you don't even know why. Its very blunt about everything that is around, scenery, the people and even the main character is perceived as strange at times; I find that foreign movies have that magic in them. Even though it is in french, I find that you don't even realise because as a viewer you are so entranced in what is going on. Not many films do that these days, or at least that I know of.<br/><br/>The use of narration from time to time especially at the beginning give it that unique, quirky feel. As if you are reading a book and as you read the images you conjure, are up on the screen in front of you. Maybe not the right way to explain it but it just has a different vibe as a film and thats why I loved it so much.<br/><br/>The music is also wonderful.<br/><br/>The thing is that I can't exactly describe the plot, because it wouldn't be the same.

","When I heard about this movie, I did not get many details, I've just heard that it was really wonderful, a true masterpiece. And then I thought the movie was some kind of a biography or a beautiful heartwarming story ... after seeing it I can say that is a little bit of everything.<br/><br/>In the movie we have the story of Amélie (Audrey Tautou). Since she was a kid, she always liked to help people around her, making them happy. Not doing great things or giving money, but with little things. For example: She helps her father, making him believe that his garden gnome is on a trip around the world; it helps a lonely neighbor just by visiting it; it helps a stranger returning something from your childhood that she found in her house; and so on. On the way, she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who spends his time collecting photos of automatic photo booths in railway station. Then she begins to try helping him, but ends up helping herself.<br/><br/>The story is not only sweet and charming, has some very funny moments, and all of these elements help make the beautiful journey of Amélie, which almost acts as a biography. And by the way, the dream of Amélie is to be remembered for many years through their deeds, and her inspiration is Lady Di. In this world of Paris, Amélie is almost perfect inhabitant. She has one of the faces seem to smile all the time. Managing to convey happiness not only for his achievements, but also by her dear eyes.<br/><br/>The film looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts of the life of Amélie, her youth, for example, seem almost strangely happy. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director-writer) can do this in a wonderful way. Leaving us stuck to the life of Amélie, with a sweet and fantastic performance of Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is one of the most wonderful movies ever made, with a character, story, direction and writing just fantastic, leaving the film totally unforgettable."

I kept hearing rave reviews about this movie, and when I finally had the opportunity to watch it, I took it. The moment it started, I knew it was going to be different. I almost turned it off, though, because it's subtitled, and I'm not very fond of having to read a movie I'm watching. I decided to give it a chance, and I'm so glad I did! The story follows a young girl who was starved of attention from her parents, kept home because of a non-existent illness, and spent the majority of her life as a loner. She develops a vivid imagination, and an odd curiosity about life. Something changes her destiny, and that's where the story twists and turns, becomes unpredictable and somewhat magical.<br/><br/>Amelie is an amazing character; full of humor, deviousness, sadness, imagination, compassion, beauty, intelligence, and she also has a keen eye for detail.<br/><br/>There are times when this movie reminds me of ""Seinfeld"", in which it's a movie about nothing and everything all at once. It's a masterpiece, full of ups and downs, sharp turns, slow interludes and fast paced action. I can't categorize this movie as just a comedy, romance, drama, action, mystery or suspense ... it's all of the above! It's wickedly wonderful! <br/><br/>Oh, to top it all off, I completely forgot that I was reading subtitles after about 15 minutes!"

","I feel the point of this film, is that none of the characters would be considered 'normal' in the real world. It's a cartoon with humans. To name just a few - An artist totally obsessed with Renoir to the exclusion of everything else in life. A shouty greengrocer with an idiot sidekick. A porn shop assistant who hangs around train stations scraping under photo booths for torn up pictures of strangers. A hypochondriac tobacco saleswoman, and her beau-to-be obsessed with recording his entire day on a portable dictaphone. And then the central character, Amelie, a strange young woman with a little-girl pearlescent complexion which seems to be what catches the high ratings of this film.<br/><br/>I watched the French language version, and have to admit that I did chuckle at a few of the humorous lines in the first half. But the two hours could easily be cut to a forty five minute snapshot of French oddity, and one would come out with a greater sense of satisfaction having seen it.<br/><br/>I'll give a middle-of-the-road vote for its colour, tone, cinematography, and Audrey Tautuo's on screen appeal."

"cingac09","9","1","4","5 December 2012"," A Film That Helps You Find Charms in Life in the Little Ways
","*** WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! ***<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 2001 film Amélie remains the highest-grossing French film of all time, and it's no wonder. This film is one of my favorite French movies I've seen with gorgeous cinematography, and provided an element of escapism through an atmosphere that took viewers away from the world of cynics and the harsh realities of life. The main idea that was well presented was a quirky female in the pursuit of happiness, not just of herself but of others she didn't even know and the possibilities it brought to the world. A scene that depicted this best was when she arranged for Dominique Bretodeau to rediscover his childhood trinkets, and how he believed his guardian angel must have arranged it. The second idea that Jeunet continually reasserted was the necessity of engaging with life in any fashion as a creative act, not as a success or failure but as an engagement. This was shown throughout many scenes but in particular, the one where Amelie began to record fragments of wonder from the television for the benefit of another character and edits together fragments of reality; horses running with cyclists, tap-dancing peg-legs that evoke how often the world slips its own limits of gullibility. This made me realize how the film was drawing attention to the possibility of orchestrating chaos, and the enormous varieties of existence on Earth. The quirky and wittiness of the characters were all very typical and present for what you would expect in French films. What stood out, as particularly French was how Jeunet removed crime, corporate, and cynic infestation, which is so present in big American cities and typically, in our culture in general? The removal of all that was especially noticeable since the film's setting was shot in the big city of Paris. This depicted the city as a fairy-tale, clean and pleasant non ""hussle and bustle"" place which correlates with how the French try to live their lives. <br/><br/>Jean Pierre Jeunet is a self-taught French director who was born in 1953. His career began to flourish after meeting Marc Caro, a designer and comic book artist who became his long time collaborator and co-director. His films are known for giving his audience a world of fantasy to get lost in, while never forgetting to include beautiful art, imagery, and music. Jeunet is a worldwide success and best known for his films Delicasstean, The City of Lost Children, and Alien Resurrection. He has been nominated for many Academy Awards, and has won a European Film Award and Cessar Award for Best Director."

","9/10 ""Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a brilliant show. As a student of the French language, I was searching for shows that are easy to understand and interesting to watch. The film ""Amélie"" fits the bill. The words used in the show are fairly simple and the characters speak clearly. <br/><br/>The main character, Amélie, is easy to love. She appears eccentric yet intriguing. The narrator's witty, dead-pan lines augment the sense of quirkiness in the film, making it comedic and light-hearted. Watching Amélie grow up strikes a powerful nostalgia in the audience chord; it is at times laughable, at times pitiful and at times shocking. <br/><br/>In all, this show has it all - laughter and tears, and downright weirdos. I would recommend it to all."

","Amélie is a film that gives us the receipt for a peculiar romance. It is filled with query humor and refreshing glimpse of isolation from reality. Amélie's physically and emotionally childhood lead her to an adulthood of loneliness and a lack of purpose. Unexpectedly she finds her life's calling. Through elaborate good deeds she finds herself a detached way to bring joy to others and herself. Finally she is force to abandon isolation and surrender to the vulnerability of love. Paris is an insightful locating for this film, it gives the viewer a foreshadowing of the happy ever after ending. However, it does not take any mystery away from the curves and bends of the plot. Paris is the city of romantic, but most of the film is shot inside of the confines of Amélie's apartment and the café she works at. Her physical and literal isolation are key elements to the tone of the film. Inside the confines of her apartments she finds Dominique Bretodeau box of treasures and sets out to help make other people happy, while unconsciously taking herself gradually out of isolation. Amélie's physically deprived childhood lead to her unusually disconnected nature, as well as her inability to function within the confines of common reality. Elements of the film demonstrate Amélie's reality compared to common reality. Common reality shows us what is plainly happening; Amélie sees Nino for the first time, the dreamlike world of the main character shows us the feeling of the scene, and the viewer can watch Amelia's heart glow and change in speed. A powerful object is the television, it is used as a window into her reality; it is a tool to show us how she is trapped, not only in physically isolation but also emotionally. Via the television she hears about the death of the princess, fantasies about how her death and hears the plea that pushes her to open her heart to Nino. One scene represents the fear Amélie has to be vulnerable, as she rides the spooky slow roller-coaster through the mass of things to find Nino, in his skeleton costume, sneaks up behind her. He lightly howls in her ear, she closers her eyes and let's go. Allowing herself to experience the thrill of the ride, the scene depicts the figurative nature of love. Mr. Dufayel seems to play a key figure in the plot, without him this movie would have continued on a frustrating path of the indecisive timid leading charter. The glass man, Mr. Dufayel, is the only person who recognizes Amélie's acquired ""good doer"" behaviors. He was also the only person to point out the crucial fact she was overlooking her own inadequacies. The glass man is a very interesting character in this film, he shares similar isolated tendencies much like Amélie's, however, his physical isolation is not made by his own choice. He's bone disorder keeps him isolated in his own home, however, he chooses to selectively distance himself from other people. Once he sees Amélie's similarities to himself he knows that it is vital to push her to pursue a more filling life than he himself has lead. <br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet unexpected visual style added another layer to this film for me. I think it was very well shot, and the quirky characteristics of the main characters were made to live through the screen. I enjoyed the big close-ups of the main characters, this did a job of further confirming their emotions and feelings to the audience. Also I thought it was very refreshing when Amélie would break away from the narrative and talk directly to the camera. The writing was good; however, I think the numerous sub stories in the film make it a bit too long. The many other characters to enrich the plot, but I would have preferred under one hundred minutes. The films female lead centered storyline is unlike Hollywood writings, and has lead me to see I prefer this films style of writing much more than the latter. Romantic comedies all have happy endings, and Amélie is a romantic comedy that follows suit. One thing that makes it different is that is coils through the sub stories and gives us a very comprehensive view of the female lead before her love interest comes into the film. The main elements that I saw throughout this film that were being grouped together were people. I see groups of similarities between; her mother and father, Amélie and Mr. Dufayel, Georgetta and Joseph, and finally Mr.Collignon and Lucien. The grouping of the elements that happened at the same time on the same day, just in difference parts of a city. There are characters who are do gooders, like Amélie and Luicus, and people who need that extra push in life, like her father, the widowed neighbor, and the glass man. In this group of givers and takers the viewer watches as the people who Amélie does not think deserve what they receive face retribution. She finds her own mischievous way of obtaining justice against Mr. Collige. At the same time the writers avenge the discard of Mr. Bubbles as well as the unkind way Amélie was treated by killing off her mother. The events that happen in the real world compared to the events that are illusionary in Amélie's mind show the viewer a more enhanced view of reality."
"tbdahmen","Null","1","4","22 September 2012"," Follow the gnome...
","Paris is my favourite place in the world. So you can understand that I had to include Amelie in a list of films that say the most about me as a person. Putting aside my partiality for French chic, this film also provides insight to my childhood. The title character's (played by Audrey Tatou) penchant for life's simple childish pleasures eerily resembles my own. In fact, the entire opening title sequence of a young Amelie entertaining herself by putting glue on her fingertip and peeling it off, spinning a coin, eating 10 raspberries in one mouthful and other activities (I won't spoil it for you) is almost verbatim of how I would spend time on my own as a little girl. After discovering a hidden treasure in her apartment, adult Amelie decides to devote herself to ""fixing"" other people's lives. But destiny has so much more in store for her.<br/><br/>This film will make you want to strike up a conversation with a stranger or buy a garden gnome or just tuck into a good ol' creme brulee; the ultimate anti-dote to a dull, rainy day.<br/><br/>Stand outs: Brace yourself for the ""Fifteen Orgasms"" scene. Try to keep your pants on."

","¨ Amelie has a strange feeling of absolute harmony. It's a perfect moment. A soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city. A surge of love, an urge to help mankind overcomes her.¨ I didn't fall in love with Amelie in the same way many critics did, but I did enjoy this wonderful and uplifting movie powered by an interesting script and a great performance from Audrey Tautou. The cinematography is pretty breathtaking as well as it uses a lot of color (green, yellow, and red are predominant) giving the movie the fantastic touch it conveys. This French film was written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who had previously worked in the Alien sequel, Alien Resurrection. This is a much better film. It has some great moments of humor, some mysteries that are solved along the way, and several romantic moments. It is a strange movie, but it works and ends up being uplifting. The narration in this film reminded me a lot of Y Tu Mama Tambien, where you had the narrator explain certain events that were happening at the time that didn't have anything to do with the story. The film was nominated for 5 Oscars in 2002 despite not winning any, but it did win a lot of recognition from international audiences. The movie takes place in Paris and that alone is a plus with such great scenery, and it also has a lot of energy that transcends the screen. It's hard not to like this small movie.<br/><br/>Amelie (Audrey Tautou) had a difficult childhood; she was raised by her relatively unsocial parents and had little contact with the outside world due to her father's misdiagnose of a heart condition he thought she suffered. She was homeschooled by her neurotic mother and thus lived practically on her own imagining a world of fantasy. Her mother died in a rather comedic accident when she was young and ended up being raised by her father. Once she turned 18 Amelie moved out and began working at a cafeteria. She doesn't have many friends since she isn't good at relating with real people, but one day her life changes when she discovers a small box that was hidden in her bathroom. The box contained some treasures from a boy who had lived in her apartment some fifty years ago. Amelie decides to search for this boy, now a grown man, and give him back the treasure box. When she finds him and sees the positive reaction it has on his life, Amelie decides to become a good doer and help as many people as she can. In this process she falls in love with a man named Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who has a weird hobby of collecting tossed away pictures from photo booths. Amelie is afraid of speaking to him and idealizes her love for him. Meanwhile she continues to help out as many people as she can including a lonely old neighbor, her father, her co-workers and their love dilemmas, and pretty much anyone she meets in the street that might have a need. Amelie puts their needs above her own and lives with purpose.<br/><br/>Pretty much every character in this film seems to be strange, but it's not hard to fall in love with them and accept their differences. Amelie seems to enjoy helping out her co-workers to find love, but at the same time has a difficult time to express her own love for Nino. She's always putting others ahead of her, but as the sang goes ¨You sow what you reap¨ she seems to be destined to find happiness as well. Her life begins to have purpose when she discovers she can bring joy to others, and in the end that is what gives her a sense of joy after so many years of living a quiet and sad life. The movie moves at a really fast pace with a lot of energy combining a lot of comedy with some romantic moments. The performances in this film are great and the characters are all interesting. The music in this film is also catchy and happy some the entire film seems to work as a fantastical love letter where dreams are fulfilled in a rather unconventional way. The film is brilliantly written as well and the screenplay is very original. Amelie is a fun movie that will have you laughing and smiling from beginning to end.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","The always interesting Audrey Tautou stars as Amelie, a shy loner who has grown up as an orphan, playing alone and developing a vivid imagination. At twenty three she works as a waitress at a cafe, along with other oddball characters. When she hears of the death of Princess Diana, she drops a bottle cap, which hits a tile, and loosens it. Behind the tile, she finds a box with a collection of stuff from a young boy who lived in her apartment many years before. She decides to track down the guy who left the box there. She manages to find him and places the box in a phone booth and rings the phone as he walks by. He is brought to tears by the contents of the box and vows to reconcile with his estranged family because of it. <br/><br/>Amelie now becomes a matchmaker and do gooder, secretly making the lives of others better. She meets a blind man at the metro train station, takes his hand and gives him a description of the streets they walk along. She steals her father's garden gnome and gives it to her stewardess friend to take pictures of at different landmarks around the world, to fulfill her dad's wish to travel. <br/><br/>Amelie performs several more good deeds and eventually meets a man named Nino who collects pictures from passport photo booths to make a collage. The two are equally eccentric and what happens next, I will not give away. Romantic comedies are usually awful, but Amelie is excellent."

","I had seen snippets of ""Amélie"" on TV but had long wanted to see the whole thing...a summer project of the IMDb 250 led us to France for this wonderful story.<br/><br/>Amélie is nominally about a young woman in Paris (?) who is looking for love, adventure and mostly a friend. In the end, it is about overcoming your internal shyness, bringing hope and joy to others and a bizarre, eclectic cast of characters that have their lives changed by this remarkable young woman.<br/><br/>It all starts at birth, or should I say conception for our heroine who is homebound because of a misdiagnosis by her father (She has a weak heart he says...) but moves out and then has her mind wander and her heart even more. She eventually finds a kindred soul in an eclectic collector of discarded photographs (from those old photo booths) and they play cat and mouse until he is tantalizingly close at her café, but she lets him slip away, collapsing in tears.<br/><br/>Eventually Amélie does get her man, thanks to a push from her downstairs neighbour, but not before we get some hyper-kinetic chases through the city, some great characters including an irascible vegetable stand owner who gets his by our sly heroine (shaving foam replaced, shoes displaced, alarm clock changed...) and you just cannot stop laughing and hoping for everyone in this bizarre neighbourhood.<br/><br/>If you are down in the dumps, depressed or in need of some hope then get Amélie.

"letstalk3000","8","1","4","18 January 2012"," Such a lovely film, with such a original story.
","Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, from 2001, resembles a bit the TV series Pushing Daisies from 2007. Not only the presentation of the main characters are made from a total different point of view, but the way the story rolls is very peculiar, there is always something from the background of the character that we have to keep in mind.<br/><br/>The main character, Amélie Poilain, shows to be a shy, but daring young woman, given the fact that she was basically deprived from her childhood by her father. Although, her early years are very present in her life, her personality didn't change much and that is why she's a very consist character. Some of the traits she had as a child are very alive as a 21 years old. Her sense of justice as a young adult is still present, for example. For instants, when she gives a lesson to the grocer's patron for being rude to his employee as an adult and when she takes revenge on her neighbour for being cruel to her as a child.<br/><br/>Madame Poilain also cultivates some peculiar pleasures, like dipping her hand into sacks of grain or cracking crème bûlée with a teaspoon or even skimming stones in the St. Martin's canal. These little details gives her a special touch to her personality and they explore much more her character, giving her a more natural and realistic tone. And along the film we may watch her collecting some rocks to throw them later which may not represent nothing, but it keeps reminding us that Amélie loves skimming stones and therefore remind us how she really is.<br/><br/>Other great aspect of this film is that it makes us questioning how we are going to be remembered once we leave this world (at least it made me question). And I find it very interesting when a film makes me thinking about a certain topic. Although, this doesn't happen when the film is ending, but it's somehow present during the whole film. Amélie at some point thinks how she will be remembered once she dies and if she will die alone and that's her motivation to keep helping the people around her, despite the fact she doesn't let them know it's her.<br/><br/>At the moment Amélie falls in love with a stranger, the point of helping people is no longer the main action, but meeting this man who collects id photos from people who throw them away is. And the way she tries to meet him is lovely. It's not like the old fashion trying to approach him and exchanging phone numbers, but it's more like a kids game where he has to work hard to try to meet her.<br/><br/>So basically I would give this film a 8/10 for its originality and the way Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director, approached the story. I would definitely recommend it."

","This film really has to be explained rather than reviewed. It's just too good to have come from skilled film makers, never mind how unworthy we moviegoers are. But I do have an hypothesis as to how it came to be. It's fresh on my mind because I just saw it again over my satellite system.<br/><br/>My hypothesis is that this film essentially coalesced like the dew on a daisy around its brilliant star, Audrey Tautou. If some giant voice came out of the sky demanding proof why this world should be spared celestial retribution, I would argue we point to Ms Tautou. I see this tour de force as an homage to her peerless perfection. I can believe everyone involved intended it as such, their best efforts probably came forth effortlessly, inspired by her performance. And I've no doubt Audrey didn't have a clue.<br/><br/>Some countries are endlessly proud of their various accomplishments, but if I were French, I'd be content to have produced someone like this shining example of a woman capable of lighting up a million faces as if she were born capable of it."

","There are so many reasons why this is the best French film ever. I mean, the story is like really good. It's a nice tale about love and being yourself. And there are funny side characters. The way the movie is filmed is quite different what we are used to see. That makes it unique. It contains several scenes of small details about characters and most of them makes you smile happily because they're either funny or they remind something about yourself. It's great.<br/><br/>But for me, it is all about Audrey Tautou. Oh man, love at first sight. I mean, this is how a woman can be naturally cute and irresistible. She doesn't have to do anything special, just being herself and giving that unbelievable smile that makes even the unhappiest person on earth smile. She seems so real like she is not acting at all. I wish I could speak french. Totally lovable.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And you may fall for her too.."

","Audrey Tatou's performance as sweet, shy introverted Amelie is really a brilliant in the film. Of course, the film is quite playful and joyous at times. It's one of those feel good films that come around once in a while. Well, this film has a great cast. I loved Isabelle Nanty who plays hypochondriac tobacconist Georgette. She's a brilliant actress herself comically. This comedic, light-hearted and serious film at times is quite enjoyable to watch. I love the Parisian sites like Sacre Couer and Montmartre as well. Amelie tries to make lives better for those around her around the time of Princess Diana's tragic death. She wants and she dreams about being appreciated for all those good things. Amelie's childhood wasn't a happy one. She didn't have playmates. Her mother died tragically and her father the doctor was cold and distant. She works as a waitress in a bar/restaurant in Paris. She visits her father on Sundays. For the most part, Amelie is a lonely character until she herself falls for somebody."

","Amelie is a quirky film about a woman who discovers her own meaning to life after finding a small box of childhood mementos behind the baseboard in her apartment. Amelie, played by Audrey Tautou, proceeds to hunt down the rightful owner of the box, a man who is now a grandfather himself, and return them to him. He never knows who returns his forgotten treasure, but the mysterious reappearance of them leads the man to make a life changing decision to make contact with his daughter and grandson. After seeing the difference she made in that man's life, Amelie decides to go on to help out her neighbors in similar ways. For one neighbor, she goes to great lengths to create a letter from a dead unfaithful husband that was supposedly lost in the mail some forty years before. For her father, she steals his garden gnome and sends him photos of it in various locations around the world, this is in an attempt to encourage her father to use his retirement to travel. For yet another friend she torments his hateful boss in subtle ways to make him think he has lost his mind. In the process of helping these people, none of whom know that she is the culprit, she stumbles across a man pulling papers and garbage out from under a photo booth. She becomes infatuated with him after he drops a photo album filled with torn up photos that people had thrown away from the booths. She teases him with a playful, and creative game of chase, sending him little clues and having him meet her here and there, but never really showing her face to him. The mystery is attractive to his artist's heart, and of course the two eventually fall in love, and we are given the impression of happily ever after.<br/><br/>This movie is a refreshingly unique and quirky tale, very fun to watch. Amelie's childhood is a total failure, she is not loved enough or touched enough by her parents, she never attends public school, and she loses her mother at a very young age. Although all these events are very tragic, the director/writer of the film, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, makes them seem comical. Another thing that makes this film unique is the way that the narrator of the film, tells you a few likes and dislikes of each new character we meet. I enjoyed this little detail very much; I think it was a unique way of introducing us to the characters and finding out a bit about who they are."

","The little things in life matter.<br/><br/>Amelie is a terrifically heart warming story about a young woman who leads a very ordinary life and of those ordinary people surrounding her. And Amelie has a nice romantic overtone to it as well.<br/><br/>As a young woman Amelie doesn't have a lot going on, other than a VERY ACTIVE imagination. Amelie is naive but very kind and giving as she tries to make others in her life happy. But don't treat badly anyone she cares about. If you do, you may have an unpleasant surprise or two in store for you.<br/><br/>I confess I was a little concerned when I saw that Amelie was 100% subtitled. So many times the people doing the subtitling fail to make it easy to read. In this case, Amelie's subtitling was very easy to read, which helped make the movie that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>One lesson to take away from Amelie is there's a lot going on around us. Maybe it's time to smell the roses."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","4","3 October 2010"," One wonders how a film can be so sporadic, so over-the-top, and so slaphappy and yet be brilliant at the same time
","When watching the wonderful 2001 French masterpiece ""Amelie,"" one thinks about many things. A great, great many things. It's one of those movies that grips you by the head and forces you to pay attention regardless of whether you hate it or love it. And I think people will hate or love it for the exact same reasons. But the one question that I think gets asked the most about ""Amelie"" is how can a movie be so unpredictably erratic, so slaphappy in its motives, and so over-the-top and yet all the same time by a brilliant, mind-tickling masterpiece? The answer I think is that it knows what it's doing.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is the story of a young, goodhearted French girl and her adventures in modern-day society. I am almost tempted to say ""misadventures"" but I won't because Amelie, like the filmmakers, is aware of what she's doing and is aware of all that goes around her. She is fascinated by a great many things, but the one thing that fascniates her most is love and sex. She fantasizes about others' sex lives but does not have a genuine one of her own. As she helps others with their lives through her own creative and fresh ways, she becomes transfixed with a young man (Mathieu Kassovitz) and begins to work her whismical tricks to help him and help herself.<br/><br/>Right from the start, one is given the clear message from the director that you are in for two hours of bizarre twists, turns, images, and sequences. So if the opening image compels you to leave, you might as well do so. If it holds your attention despite its awkwardness, sit down and enjoy the show. Yes, it is a vastly over-the-top film. Even when you can get a fairly good idea of what the end result of a scene will be (which is seldom here) the final result nevertheless gives you a shocking sensation. Even if I were to give you a synopsis of the entire film and told you exactly what to expect - even if you believed me - seeing it for yourself would still surprise you.<br/><br/>But even though it is sporadic, sometimes preposterous, overly silly, and more free-living than any film I've seen in a long, long time, ""Amelie"" never fails to lose your attention and bring a charmed or amused smile to your face. Watching it is like conusming a bizarre foreign dish. It is unusual and perhaps not one you'd want to be caught eating by your friends, but in your own moments of privacy, you want to scarf it all down. There are lots of jokes in the movie and they are hilarious. The protagonist Amelie, played with great enthusiasm by Audrey Tatou, becomes a lovable heroine and you really end up rooting for her in the last half-hour of the movie. Here is a point where it still preserves humor, but takes an effective turn for drama. I'm still very surprised at how I could have been rolling on the floor laughing earlier and yet now was transfixed, quiet, involved in the romantic moments that followed.<br/><br/>For those who care, yes, ""Amelie"" is a French film and it is not available (to my knowledge) in an English dub. You must see the French version with English subtiltes. But honestly, should this matter? After all, if it was dubbed it would probably not be in a controlled manner that the film's director Jean-Pierre Jeunet would have approved. Even though it's a slaphappy, whacky comedy, I think ""Amelie"" should be, in some ways, taken seriously. Why? Because it escalates from being kitsch and evolves into art."
"alexart-1","10","1","4","16 February 2008"," A beautifully quirky comedy
","Amelie is a splendid movie. It is truly a feel good movie that will charm anyone who watches it. The quirky tale is about a woman who sees unhappy people in her life. She tries to enrich the lives of those seven people to make them as happy as her own. When Amelie finds a man that she loves, she is unsure what to do and is completely clueless. Amelie is a great movie because of its odd sense of humor. The humor is very quirky (to those who have already seen it: the orgasm scene). The humor is somewhat similar to the American TV show ""Pushing Daisies"". Amelie should be able to charm any person and will suck them in within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. It is a film that makes you want to go out and make other people as happy as you felt when you were watching it."

","I cant think of any movie which reinstates my faith in Life more than this one. At the end of the day, the happiness in our life is the summation of all the simple pleasures that we experience.<br/><br/>Amélie is simple; she has devoted herself to simple pleasures, such as cracking crème brûlée with a teaspoon, going for walks in the Paris sunshine, skipping stones across St. Martin's Canal, trying to guess how many couples in Paris are having an orgasm at one moment (""Fifteen!"", she informs the camera), and letting her imagination roam free. Even the idiosyncrasies of the central character(Amelie) are truly incredible. I wont go into the details of the story.<br/><br/>The cinematography is top-notch, the direction is fabulous. All in all a rare film where everything falls in together in perfect harmony. A must-watch!"
"curious_student","10","1","4","18 January 2008"," The most wonderful movie I've ever seen!
","Amélie is a movie of superlatives. It is the most powerful, moving and adorable film I have ever seen. So let me tell you how this film became my favorite of all-time: On one side, the actors fit perfectly into the image of the city of love: Paris. They are created for a non-existing dream world, where every single person has its place and love is around everywhere. On the other side, France's elementary culture subliminally manifests throughout the whole film. It is maybe just because of this fact that the movie abstains from the image of the modern city of Paris, which could eventually have destroyed the film's charisma. The viewer is somehow guided into several parallel worlds like the Montmartre café ""Deux Moulins"", the trains of thoughts by Amélie or a world of an ill man, the ""glass-bone man"". If you expect the movie to be made out of silk, then you are certainly on the wrong track. Amélie, who has never experienced luck and happiness in her life because her mother died when she was a little child, grows to an angelic figure over the time, trying to solve little grievances in the everyday life of other people. With sophisticated pranks against the mean ones and the support for the socially weak she achieves her aims to make world a better place. Her only problem is that she forgets to care about herself and her own life. She is not able to establish a real relationship because she is always forced to help others. On one day she gets to know her neighbor in the apartment house, the ""glass-bone"" man. He is one of the socially weak because he cannot leave his flat without the danger of breaking his bones. His everyday activity is to copy masterworks and to treat the stories of people he discovers in the paintings. It is him who helps Amélie breaking out and to work up the courage to meet a man she saw at the metro station and with whom she fell in love. Amélie is finally rewarded for all her efforts and justice takes its course...<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I could almost live the passion of the unselfish protagonist and emotions flew high. It is very rare that a film without a high degree of drama can touch my heart but this one could. It is the power of love that triumphs over the whole two hours the movie lasts. I regard this film not only as a story about people with love in their hearts; it is a statement to the world that Amélie actually has not succeeded to save the whole world although she could enlighten her small environment and this is what every person should and can do. I must honestly admit that I've eventually not understood the whole deep meaning behind it because there are so many small but important things in the movie that could be mentioned here. If you ever happen to see this movie, be prepared for a huge dose of happiness but also fun and humor."

","Subtitles, as I've said before, are either a passport or a barrier to the rest of the world - cinematically, at least. My Better Half, bless her cotton socks, cannot get along with subtitles whereas I find them much more agreeable and have no problems whatsoever. In short, you either love them or hate them and when they are found in a surreal movie with a quirky lead character then the chances are that many casual movie goers may be put off. But those of us with broader horizons will enjoy this modern and unusual love story with its wonderful cinematography, beautiful performances through the cast and a very strong Gallic flavour. It may as well wear a string of onions around its neck and smoke Gitannes.<br/><br/>Audret Tautou plays Amelie, an innocent single woman living alone in Paris and working as a waitress. On hearing the news of the death of Diana, Princess Of Wales, Amelie accidentally discovers a hidden box of boys toys left by a previous occupant in her flat. Determined to return them to the rightful owner, Amelie decides that she will spend her life enriching those around her - from the down-trodden greengrocer's assistant (Jamel Debbouze) who serves her to the equally lonely artist living opposite her with brittle bones disease (Serge Merlin). But when she falls in love with the equally-odd Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), Amelie's scheming begins to get the better of her. Will she eventually be as happy as those whose lives she touches? <br/><br/>""Amelie"" feels like a very traditional movie at its heart, filled with the usual rom-com moments we're used to seeing thousands of times before but this time, with a very French twist. The first thing that strikes you about this movie (besides the French narration) is the details that the story goes into, making the whole thing feel dream-like and surreal. This is the image of France that we'd like to see more of! Performances are superb across the board and Tautou deserved the increased exposure she has since received. But without a solid supporting cast, this could easily have been rubbish and ""Amelie"" is not a rubbish film by any stretch. It also constantly surprises you as characters dissolve into water and shine like angels, almost as stunning as the imaginative and unconventional camera-work. It's difficult to stress how interesting and different this movie is from almost anything else you can think of, although it is easily the most ""French"" movie I've seen since ""The Fifth Element"" and only you, dear reader, know whether this is to your own tastes or not.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people who will not like this film but quite frankly, they're missing out. This is a quality movie that challenges and delights in equal measures and if you give it a chance then I'm sure it will work its magic. It won't be to everybody's taste - I won't deny that - but ""Amelie"" is an experience worth trying and sticking with. Proof that not all French films need Luc Besson or Jean Reno to succeed - this has more heart and intelligence in it than any Hollywood film I can think of and for that, we should all be grateful."

","Amelie is a playful romp through the imaginative perspective of a girl who prefers her home dreamt fairy tale over reality. It has a childlike wonder to its narrative that does anything but undermine the more sophisticated workings of the plot. It has the bright and colorful palette of a little girl's fantasy, and it wears the mischievous smirk of a soul born to cause trouble. Every inch of this film embodies the spirit of its titular character.<br/><br/>Early in the film, Jean-Pierre Jeunet introduces the main characters via the simplest method: a one on one introduction reminiscent of a first-grader's story with the narrator naming the characters, informing the audience who they are, and listing their likes and dislikes (and no, that is not a criticism).<br/><br/>In the hands of another director, this would bore the audience to tears (like so many other films have done); but Jeunet is a visual filmmaker who understands that cinematic stories must been seen. So he punctuates each character's introduction with an energetic camera that glides across the sidewalk to close in on each character, then quickly cuts to a sample of each bit of information (likes and dislikes, and so on) ending with Amelie smiling to the camera and answering the narrator, ""Fifteen."" And in one sly move, Amelie has revealed that this film is an individual's perspective on reality, and not reality itself: her voice may not be narrating, but she's definitely in on the retelling of her story.<br/><br/>This is the rare film that has placed all hope of success on two factors: total unity from all aspects of its production and total disbelief from the audience. It's the film that has to seduce its audience into believing that, in this world, the discovery of a forgotten treasure would lead to the revelation of Amelie's purpose in life  that Amelie would go so far out of her way in her schemes to make the world better (by making someone else happy or someone deserving miserable) rather than directly confronting the issues.<br/><br/>Jeunet put out the call, and the cast, the DP, the composer, and all parties answered appropriately. Audrey Tautou in the lead role perfectly portrays that mischievous, sometimes malicious, woman who never fully grew up (loved her malicious side.) Ever evident in her eyes is that childlike fascination, curiosity, and passion to be a puppeteer manipulating the world around her  that sense that her mind is forever at work figuring out how to pull all the right strings to return a photo album to its owner without directly handing it to the man (to name one scenario).<br/><br/>Tautou's performance and her character overshadows the rest of the cast  rightly so since, again, this is Amelie's perception, her story, and her fantasy, and not an unbiased documentary of her life. Still, her world is populated with colorful characters appropriately exaggerated to match the exaggerated world they live in. I liked the tangent surrounding Joseph and Georgette in the diner who come together as a direct result of Amelie's intervention, the artist (the Glass Man) who guides Amelie throughout the story, her downplayed father whose garden gnome takes a trip around the world and decides to send postcards, and the poor owner of the produce stand who falls on Amelie's bad side.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film most because it was like watching an act of insanity, a life-threatening stunt that even David Blaine has rejected and declared impossible. This is a movie whose raw storyline begs a critical bashing - whose main character's actions draws attention to itself and asks the question ""why bother?"" The only way for Amelie to work is through its style - complete acceptance of Amelie's perception over our own. All the pieces had to fit together to achieve the correct tone to make this happen, and, lo and behold, Amelie gracefully and effortlessly succeeds.<br/><br/>Like watching a disaster waiting to happen, and witnessing a miracle."

But this movie did live up to its reputation, I felt. A few odd scenes (some that really make you laugh - the deep guffaw sounding laughs)but there is something nice about a movie that portrays how one's childhood can affect one's own future and finding your destiny.

I just watched it for the second time two nights ago, and it put me in such a great mood the next day. It presents the sort of world where you might want to live. So often, we see people who do things for their own gain, who use deception to cheat people, those who no longer care about others around them, and we've gotten so used to being wary all the time - and often, it's reflected in entertainment, it's so nice to see someone who delights in trying to make people happy and to improving lives, just for the sake of creating pleasure in other people, just because she sees an opportunity to do so. This is not warm and fuzzy in the usual way, where the saccharine nature, the predictable lines all get wearying - it feels so fresh and new, and yet, so much like a fairytale too.

","Amélie Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet Starring Audrey Tautou<br/><br/>For what its worth, Amélie is a good example of what feel-good movies are supposed to be. Light, joyful, and easygoing, one can only think of his or her childhood to imagine the feeling the protagonist, Amélie Poulain, radiates. From the opening credits itself, you would already expect Amélie to be different than most people. You will laugh at her and her parents' eccentricities, yet you'll feel melancholic after finding out that Amélie's heart problem is nothing more than the desire to be hugged. In the later scenes, you will feel that Amélie exudes a distinct aura; she seems to brighten up the place she goes to.<br/><br/>Amélie's attitude and upbringing sets the events of the movie. She finds happiness in the simplest of things. Also, it is her gift to bring joy to others, regardless of how simple or complicated the joys appear. But she doesn't simply choose to help others; it appears to be her fate. The movie is very specific with certain moments in time, and at these moments something beautiful happens. It's as if the movie is telling us to live each moment in time to the fullest, because we will never know if this is the end.<br/><br/>The lines were light and funny, and were well-performed by the cast. The film does not expound too much on lines--a thorough analysis of the lines is minimally required to understand the character's personality.<br/><br/>Yet the only noticeable flaw in this movie is Amélie's character. She could not do to herself what she has done to others. She helps others realize the intricate beauty of life too much that she cannot see what the people she helped experience. This flaw ultimately balances Amélie's character and makes her much more appealing and appreciated.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Amélie is wonderfully constructed--so much that many critics and fans consider the movie an moving artwork. Notable are the camera movements employed, such as zooming-in scenes in the introduction of Amélie's parents. And the Paris backdrop is, needless to say, beautiful.<br/><br/>Amélie is a light-hearted, heart-filling wonder, and is worth every cent and minute spent."

","Who knew that such a quirky and original premise could evoke so much heart and creative expression? From its opening shots of a dragonfly being squashed by a car on a beautifully winding brick road in Montmartre, the wind causing wine glasses to dance up and down on a restaurant's tablecloth, and an elderly man erasing the name of an old friend out of his address book after his funeral, the viewers of Amelie know they are in for something both visually and literally stunning. Truly, it was the camera-work of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet that initially captivates the viewer (the whole scene in the rain on the bridge as Amelie's mother pours her goldfish from the bridge into the creek is beautiful; that gliding, overhead shot could be viewed over and over again without losing its appeal), not to mention the vibrant colors of Paris and the quick exploration of wild tangents somehow related to the bigger story. But after all is said and done, and the tricks of Jeunet have lost their initial luster, it's the screenplay and the characters especially that cause the audience to remain captivated.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou brilliantly evokes the oddball characteristics of Amelie Poulain without resorting to turning her into a hollow caricature. Despite her eccentricities, Tautou's performance helps the audience see elements of themselves scattered throughout her everyday feelings, longings, and, at times, actions that are so creatively translated to the screen in a type of visual symbolism that is almost so simple to comprehend, yet so difficult to evoke without dialogue. <br/><br/>In closing, this is an excellent movie, and an even better character study involving people who, despite living on the other side of the world, hold so much in common with ourselves. If you feel discouraged by foreign films, please don't let that stop you from seeing Amelie. I honestly kept forgetting that I was even reading French at the bottom of the screen because I was so caught up in the visual style, story, and fresh bursts of comedy. This is simply a creative delight! ***.5/ ****"

","This is the first French film I have seen and all I can say is: If all French films are like this, then I think I'll emigrate to France! This film is hilariously funny and heartbreaking at the same time. It's the kind of film that should be performed on the stage, but could never be. Audrey Tautou is brilliant as she plays Amelie, a girl who spends her life helping others in a neighbourhood in Paris. The film could be seen as fairly 'arty' or 'eccentric' but, in a way, this style helps to create the general atmosphere of the film. The film is arty but not just for the sake of being arty. It actually fits! Its the kind of film that could only be made by the French. 10/10."

","There are some films that are pure joy to watch. These are films to be watched, cherished, and loved over and over again. There are certainly films that I may not herald as perfect cinematic achievements, but bring a smile to my face, and warmth to my heart. Amelie is such a film.<br/><br/>Jean Piere Jeunet made a series of dark, depressing films before Amelie. They seem to come from some strange crossing of Brazil era Gilliam and HR Giger inspired Alien landscapes. In fact Pierre directed the 4th installment of the Alien franchise, Alien resurrection. Prior to Amelie's huge success he was only known in the US for this picture. Which is a shame, because her previous two films (Delicatessen and City of Lost Children) are real gems.<br/><br/>In Amelie, Jeunet has lost his Orwellian vision of the world and has come up top of the world into the clear, blue sky. It is a beautiful, color filled, world that he has come up into. Amelie is alive with color and beauty. It is as if his first three films were harrowing graphic novels, and this one is bright, Technicolor Saturday morning cartoon. It is even a change of story for the director. Where his previous films concerned such meaty subjects as cannibalism, child murder, and those bloody awful Aliens, here is a simple story about making people happy. I'm not sure what caused these changes in the director, but it is a treasure to behold.<br/><br/>The story revolves, of course, around Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a shy, quiet, and lonely young women living in the Montmatre section of Paris. Through a random series of events she decides to make people happy. The means in which she manages this, and the heart of the movie, is through devising an extraordinary, and quirky, series of stratagems. For example, in order to bring some excitement into her saddened fathers life, she kidnaps his garden gnome and sends it across the globe with an airline stewardess. Her father sees the gnomes through a series of photographs taken with the gnome standing near national monuments! The entire film is played out with a child like innocence and beauty. Jeunet uses his camera to create images that are light and joyous. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie like a pixie who is bursting inside to tell the worlds funniest joke.<br/><br/>Having actually visited Paris before watching this film again I found an additional joy by noticing the little details unknown to me on previous viewings. I have walked the steps of the Sacre Couer, have seen the photograph kiosks in the train station, have seen the top of the Notre Dame. These actions did not bring any further realizations into the film, but brought a little more joy to my viewing. It is like when a film is set in an area you once lived. It may not have anything to do with you, but there is a pleasant joy in knowing where the events take place.<br/><br/>The film does not look or feel like the Paris that I visited last Christmas. It is almost a fairy tale version of the city. A city that, as an American, I conjured up with such names as ""City of Light, City of Love."" The reality is a much darker, dirtier sort of place. But in this film everything is lighted beautifully, there is no garbage piling up on the streets, and the metro stations look lovely. Even the people if not always cheerful, are quirky and cute in their unhappiness.<br/><br/>There are other films that achieve more in their 2 odd hours of screen time, than Amelie. Though I could site more serious, and relevant films, it would be difficult to find one so full of innocent joy.<br/><br/>Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more."

Amelie represents most of french people in the way they leave. A bit of psychology, of philosophy and a lot of ""spleen"" as some of our poets said (Baudelaire, Verlaine).<br/><br/>The fact is that Amélie is just a little girl like you and me, she is good and is almost lost in today's world.

So colorful, amazing with great characters and unusual situations and above all fantastic music. Amelie as a character is very well described through lots of details and her behavior, feelings, situation can be compared with ordinary, live people. Cause this type of people exactly feels like Amelie feels. For those who love love stories this is the greatest film story made by this moment. I recommend it also to everybody who love movies in general. You wont regret watching this movie.

","This movie is exactly what it pretends to be: a romantic fairytale. Don't seek realism, but just the reliving of childhood fantasies, sugar-sweet romantic expectations and unlikely comedy that nevertheless magically put a smile on your face. Take your girlfriend to see this film and she'll love you for it, but check any macho comments at the door, the film's reality is fragile and has to be protected from the normal male realism. It's a little girl's movie for adults.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Amelie's history - from her childhood to her young adult self which we will see the rest of the movie; it's fast-paced and narrated, and the storybook look you see at the beginning of the movie, are what you should expect throughout the movie, most of the time. There is atmosphere in every scene, there are rich, warm colours in every scene and they complement the acting. Many characters are stereotypes, as they should be in fairy tales, and of course, the universe conspires to bring Amelie a wonderful future, as promised in the title. The jokes are often corny and old, and thus exactly what you would expect - the joy of this movie, throughout, is not in the surprise, but in the recognition. The things you wanted to do as a child, Amelie still does, as an adult.. yet she is lonely. And her entire world is about to change.."
"shokenjii","10","1","4","19 September 2004"," ""--- Spiritually And Sensually Uplifting --- ""
","On the 24th of March, 2002, widely acclaimed ""Amelie"" did not win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2001. That honor went to ""No Man's Land,"" a story of civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the encounter of two Bosnians, a Muslim and a Serb (Orthodox Christian). ""No Mans Land,"" may have been the better film; and its context of tragic civil war, with questionable US participation, apparently prevailed upon an often socially sensitive and responsive Hollywood. Conversely, ""Amelie"" received some local (French) criticism for the absence of a grittier urban setting -- real-life demographics and environment.<br/><br/>The historic Monmartre district, with its landmark Sacre Coeur basilica, is highly popular with tourists and Parsians. On any given day, the streets of Monmartre are home to the affluent and the poor, drug traffic and crime, dirty air, street noise and litter, and descendants of Algerians, Moroccans, Senegalese, Tahitians, and Viet Namese, in addition to neighboring Europeans. It's accurate and fair to cite the sanitized, picture-postcard qualities of the film's on-location cinematography; but it should be added that ""Amelie"" is a spiritually and sensually uplifting film, a remarkable achievement of highest craft and quality with few equals.<br/><br/>Within the world's densest urban region (Western Europe) and the 18th most populated metropolitan area (Paris), ""Amelie's"" characters share a common malady -- the special loneliness and isolation borne by inner cities.<br/><br/>The film's primary focus is on symptoms of, or remedies for, this urban illness. The daily routines of cafe habitués, and the laughable, ribald scenes of sex -- real or imagined -- are sadly inadequate band-aids for meaningful relationships. We cheer for all of them -- from the less likable, Joseph and Collignon, to the winsome, Amelie -- to find someone to share love and happiness.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is an impressionist film, rivaling the brilliantly colored impressionist paintings of Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Van Gogh. Director and film writer, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, floods our five senses; and he does not short change us on emotional content, especially when we study the faces of Amelie's neighbors and customers. This is truly a remarkable display of sensitivities, skills, and both urbane and openly boyish, locker-room humor.<br/><br/>Perhaps, M. Jeunet will attempt an inner city film in the near future, showing the darker shades of realism, with the open plumbing of humanity's toil.<br/><br/>This delightful and enchanting film must be seen by all who believe in the potential of forgotten and often overlooked members of the human race. And we must remember to see ""Amelie"" with our children -- and our grandchildren -- sometime, when the time is right."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED! Can you believe such a story folded with joy, cheer, laughter, cry, and beyond of all romance? I truly cannot. I had never thought that it would be this much more eccentric than I could not keep up with it, although I am a sort of person like this cute, sunny Amélie who notices more subtle matters, things, and so on than normal stuffs. This movie gave me both an ability of laughing and an inability of stopping my crying simultaneously.<br/><br/>It's all about life, love, work, revealing hidden and unfolded side of people's lives. It is introduced in a funny way in which we feel dazzled then we try to be on the right course. One of its great moments I found immensely impressive was when Amélie helped the old man cross the street then started describing what was going on around them as they were walking in a detailed manner. This scene opened me a new horizon of this world in which we are living. It made me think how simply helpful and generous we are to our kinds at least. Simple and shaking it was. The other remarkable sequence was when she was disappointed of miracle and started cooking and imagining her lover coming to her apartment and at last laughed but that coincided with the cat. She had a heart like an angel's. She wanted to be of any kind of help such as putting a sparkle in her old neighbor's life, being concerned about that photo booth's repairman, making her coworker and the other's boyfriend love each other, making that grocery shop's boy stand out, even having his father's gnome travel to convince him to do so, and many delicate scenes can't be described this way. Above all she started to be helpful to people but was forgetting herself.<br/><br/>As a technical viewpoint, we can greatly appreciate its editing, movement of camera, and lovely decoration set!<br/><br/>Habib's Assessment: 10 / 10!"

","This was a very beautiful story, both visually and emotionally. I could relate to the central characters very well, and the outcome was absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>At first I thought the ponderous narration was a bit distracting, and I told myself if this story turned into a tragedy I would hate it. But I soon realized how the narration had a rather droll, tongue-in-cheek feel to it; sometime complementing the action, sometimes playing against it. (Rather like the way THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY works.) And the wrap-up at the end is simply perfect.<br/><br/>The colors and locations of this are very striking, and there is a strong artistic theme running through the whole story. It's cute, without being cloying. A brilliant masterpiece of cinematic storytelling all-round.<br/><br/>My fav comic line in this (at least according to the subtitles on the version I saw) was the insult: ""His father probably pee'd in his mother when he was conceived."""

The colors and the scenery are also wonderful to watch. It is a very quirky film that has bits of randomness, which i also love, and is a movie that just makes you feel all warm and gooey inside!

"pjl-7","9","1","4","31 October 2003"," A good movie, but not necessarily a great movie.
","I'd have to agree with the writer who said that those who think this is the greatest French movie can't be getting out much.  It has none of the power of ""Manon des Sources,"" none of the dramatic flair of ""Chocolat"" and very little of the poignancy of ""Ponette.""  It is, however, a very well constructed film, and one which it has been fun to watch several times.<br/><br/>To those unfamiliar with French culture, some of the vignettes may miss their targets.  The French obsession with collecting odd things, with bicycle racing, with sending postcards from every place they visit, their willingness to be demonstrably affectionate in public, all get lampooned mercilessly.  The characters are largely stereotypes; what more can one expect in a movie with so many important characters - there isn't the time to develop each one adequately, so they remain necessarily two dimensional. But it is this two dimensionality of the characters that gives the film its surreal touch that drags the viewer forward from scene to scene, wondering what can possibly happen next.<br/><br/>As comedies go, it lacks the gross slapstick of a de Funes film, and this is very much to its credit.  The subtlety of the emotional torture Amélie applies to Collignon the greengrocer is far more entertaining than any pie-in-the-face schtick would have been.  Even the running garden gnome joke fails to pall, because it is carefully not overworked.  Still, if I had to designate a ""funniest french movie ever"", it probably wouldn't be this one - I'd more likely go for the James Bond style ""Une Chance Sur Deux""  which managed a better balance of types of humor, with a wider range.<br/><br/>All in all, Amélie is a good movie, but not necessarily a great one.  It's one that is worth plopping down the money to rent, or even to buy the DVD, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid good money to see it in a theatre - there is nothing in the movie that could take advantage of a large screen and theatre surround sound, and nothing in it that warrants parting with $15 or $20 to see it just once, with antisocial louts making comments and crunching popcorn just behind you."

","Another addition to the pantheon of great romantic comedies... Jean-Pierre Jeunet, once again, masters in bringing to life and sharing with us one of his surrealistic world. After Alien4, the city of the lost child or Delicatessen, one may be confused with the almost 'realistic' atmosphere of Amelie.. but don't be mistaken: the neighbours of Amelie, although human-like looking, are closer to fantasy characters than real human. Amelie should be watched as a complicated, entertaining, artistically designed jigsaw which integrity can only be fully perceived at the end of the movie. Actors are fantastic... All of them play their role with conviction and add their personal touch to Amelie's world. Dominique Pinon is truly exasperating as a maniac-jealous guy, Matthieu Kassovitz proves that besides his directing skills he can also be a wonderful actor, the destiny of Audrey Tautou will surely be as fabulous as Amelie's one...

","Why is that everybody likes this movie? Let us think about it:<br/><br/>The first thing that comes to my mind is the set-Paris-one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The buildings, the streets, the palaces, and everything. It wouldnft have had the same effect if it were shot in any of the cities in the USA. Paris symbolizes love. However, for those of us who have been there we know that that kind of Paris: clean, orderly, safe, simply does not exist. (it reminded me in a way of the small town that Jim Carrey lived in ""The Truman's Show."")<br/><br/>The second thing I guess has to do with the cast, to be more precise, the selection of the citizens of Paris. All of them were native French (with the exception of one picture of a black guy). Again for those of us who have had the pleasure to visit the city we know that you get a completely different picture of the city. <br/><br/>The third reason has to do with the language. Even though I am not fond of the French language a totally agree with the Merovingian from the second Matrix that in French even when cursing it feels like wiping your a** with silk. Imagine this movie in German or Japanese. <br/><br/>And the forth and most important reason is Audrey Tautou. I haven't seen such a big and beautiful eyes in a long time (Ifve been living in Japan for quite sometime now). It wasn't like she threw a great performance it was more like she was born for that role. I hope that she will manage to escape from the ""halo"" of this role and avoid the destiny of such actors like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher from ""Star Wars"" and Tom Hulce from ""Amadeus.""<br/><br/>I am surprised that there are not many French movies out there nowadays and I don't know why. I hope to see more of them in the future."

Mom wasn't much better, either; thus, this child, like all too many kids, never enjoyed the pleasures of what magic a loving hug can bring.<br/><br/>So now as a young adult she must seek creative fulfillment as a do-good hobbyist, and what an elaborate series of projects she undertakes.

","I'm actually discussing ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" (or ""Amélie,"" as it's called in English) on my second viewing - I saw it on the big screen first, but I fell asleep during the first hour; this is something I also did during ""The 13th Warrior,"" ""Mission To Mars"" and the wildly overrated remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" (not that the original isn't itself overrrated, but that's another matter). But whereas my lack of interest in the other movies continued when I woke up, with ""Amélie"" I continued to be enthralled by the strange mix of reality and fantasy that the heroine's world revolved around.<br/><br/>Seeing it on video again, it worked just as well without any sleep interruptions; this hugely successful French movie may well be a basic trifle at its centre, and it may play at times like a Gallic take on ""Ally McBeal"" with a dash of ""Emma"" - a dreamy young woman takes it upon herself to move among people's lives for the better (helping those who deserve it and tormenting those who don't), but finds that she in turn needs help in sorting out her OWN life - but its high rating among IMDb users is understandable. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie sometimes overplays its quirkiness (having our heroine's mother die when a tourist jumps off the Cathedral of Notre Dame and lands on her? Giving Amélie's lover a job in a porn shop?), but most of the time the movie judges itself perfectly; with its good nature and optimism, it's one of those movies that almost defies you to hate it.<br/><br/>Which means that it'll be condemned as being manipulative, sentimental tripe in some corners - but others'll find themselves gradually drawn into the movie's embrace, and won over by Audrey Tautou's central performance, by its clutch of characters (it's very satisfying when the assistant to the hateful greengrocer comes out of his shell), and by its overall lack of cynicism. (That must be why some people hate it so much; and why it was such a hit in France - ""How dare French people finance and go to see a movie that isn't pretentious, is accessible and makes you happy!"")<br/><br/>Come to think of it, I might see it again.

","After watching Amelie for the first time, I thought it was the best film of 2001.  After viewing it again a second time, with even more appreciation, I have come to believe that it's one of the best films -- ever.  And it's French!  My God, Who would have believed it?<br/><br/>Amelie is a woman who lives in a fantasy world.  Conditioned to behave this way in her childhood  -- deprived of playmates, slung between a neurotic mother and an iceberg father -- Amelie prefers to dream, a personality trait that blossoms full-flower in adulthood.   Amelie habitually retreats into the private world of her imagination, where she plays, like a lonely child without any friends.  <br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking:  this is another boring movie about family dysfunction and its long-term consequences, The Price of Tides with a French accent.  But I'm delighted to inform you that it's not.  In fact, it's the very the antithesis of such films.  And it's a work of uncommon brilliance for that same reason:  it takes Amelie's charming but mildly self-destructive idiosyncrasies -- her tendency to dream and remain an introvert, to `mess up her life' with stratagems, play-acting, and meddling, habits unavoidably formed in the bosom of her family -- and shows how wonderful they are.  That's right, wonderful.  <br/><br/>Throughout the film, she is helped into the real world by the affectionate counsel of an archetypal `wise old man;' but, along the way, her preference for fantasy over reality is treated with the grace and generosity of a culture that considers human failure inevitable, perhaps even necessary;  a culture with the courage to say, simply, `that's life.'<br/><br/>
`I love the word fail',' the barroom author says in an important but easily overlooked scene.  It's human destiny, he insists.  Doing his best `sidewalk Socrates,' he adds:  `Life is but a draft, a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.'  It's the perfect, ingenious set up for the question facing Amelie:  Will she fail, allowing herself to merge with the ebb and flow of universal woe, or will she (through love  it's so French!) overcome her common destiny to fail?  <br/><br/>I won't spoil it for you.  Find out for yourself."

This was an uplifting and funny movie that was creatively directed with great colors and a wonderful soundtrack.  it really sucks you in with the first 5 minutes, the scenes describing amelies childhood as well as the likes and dislikes of the people around her are funny and well directed. the film does slow its pace towards the end but as long as you switch gears with it you should keep on enjoying this movie.  amelie didnt ""change my life"" but it did make me feel good after watching it 10/10"

","""Amélie"" is the perfect date movie. Or at least my perception of what a date movie should be.  Date movies, especially first-date movies, should be light-hearted romances. Nothing too serious, but not fluff either. ""Amélie"" strikes just the right balance between a light-hearted trifle and a film requiring some thought. Life is not a bed of roses for the title character, but there is no grimness, no depression. <br/><br/>People your romance with people that are realistic. No one that is too dashing, too beautiful, or too rich to be believable. Amélie and her friends and co-workers are people everyone can relate to, and mostly, would want to know. They're eccentric, but accessible. <br/><br/>And finally, have a happy ending. But I can't address this without a ***spoiler*** warning.  <br/><br/>""Amélie"" deserves all the praise that has been bestowed on it. With a date or by oneself it makes for an excellent rental."

","Never has a world looked so wonderous as that of Amelie. If one could ask for such dreaming, let the eyes close upon this dream.<br/><br/>
I saw this opening weekend in a small arthouse cinema. Though we were all strangers in this small room our laughter did befriend us all. I have never experienced the magnitude of absolute joy shared within an audience; So often your experience is confined to you and your companion/s, but this time I shared it intimately with the whole theatre. Everyone walked out the doors with a smile upon their face and a feeling of humble acknowledgement of an experience!!<br/><br/>Who cares for history? Who cares for the future? It a film that is about the now! It's about us! In our lonely, unloving, scary, neurotic world. Amelie is about humanity, it's about love, happiness, beauty and one persons ability to see that beauty and change the world.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this film, not just because it's great, but because it's all that should be of our world. It's about the beauty of our world if we would just stop to look at it and let it in. It's impossible to see such beauty in life and be so shy of it in reality. No matter how hard life gets it is all still so wonderful."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","4","11 August 2002"," An exercise in pure artistic creativity, Amelie is a beautifully made romantic comedy that succeeds hugely at the daunting task of being a freshly entertaining romantic comedy.
","The dreamy atmosphere and truly creative romance of Amelie reminds me of the similarly captivating Chocolat of the year before. Both films are endlessly charming in their own original way, and both leave you with a huge smile on your face. The first fifteen minutes of Amelie consists of one of the most obscurely interesting pieces of plot development that I've ever seen. We seem to be given completely arbitrary bits of information about what's going on around the city, and it's not until the film moves on from there that we realize that we've just been completely brought into the world presented in the movie. <br/><br/>The film deals with the heartwarming story of Amelie, a girl who has grown up in an unhappy an unaffectionate family, and now has to deal with the resulting fear and discomfort with romance and physical as well as social contact. The event that changes her life forever is when she learns that Princess Di has been killed in car crash, but only because it causes her to drop a bottle cap, which rolls into a tile on the wall along the floor, which turns out to be loose, and behind it she finds a box that a little boy hid there 40 years earlier. She determines to find the man that was once that boy, and it is her anti-social tendencies that prevent her from giving it straight to the man when she finds him. Rather, she devises an ingenious way of getting him to find it on his own, and is delighted with the pleasure that comes from bringing so much happiness and joy to this man. She decides that she will make it her life's purpose to bring happiness to other people, and the interesting and creative ways that she comes up with to do this provide much of the entertainment for the middle part of the film.<br/><br/>(spoilers) During her quest to make people happy, it is not unexpected that she should run into an equally unusual and unique method to bring about her own happiness, which she ultimately finds in the eccentric Nino, a man who works in a sex novelty store and has the hobby of collecting unsatisfactory pictures from the trash can and the floor around photo booths. Audrey Tautou flawlessly captures the nervousness and anxiety of Amelie, and Mathieu Kassovitz delivers a wonderful performance as the strange Nino, who seems to be more shocked that someone is interested in him than anything else. A strikingly endearing romance begins to develop between the two, and even though this is a light romantic comedy and we already know that they will wind up together at the end, the delivery of the story itself is so original and unique and fascinating that it makes the whole thing fresh and interesting again.  <br/><br/>Besides the fact that the film is packed with eccentric little things that pop out of the woodwork (reality is completely set aside at many points in the film, and with spectacular effect), there are so many different stories being told that we don't even have a chance to get bored with a budding romance the end of which we knew before the movie even began. There is the story of the glass man, there's the story of the one-armed artist who is subjected to heartbreakingly vicious verbal abuse for most of the film, the disillusioned cigarette saleswoman who finds temporary relief from loneliness in the disillusioned romance critic with the microphone at the café who is sure that all women are operating on the same master plan to deceive and destroy the hearts of men, and of course there are the various stories of the people that pop into the film only long enough to be transcended onto completely new levels of happiness because of the actions of Amelie. <br/><br/>Amelie is not a movie concerned with the real world. It provides a fantastic bit of escapism for anyone who has anything to escape from, which is why its disregard for reality in a lot of scenes is so magically successful in having the desired impact on the audience. This is the story of a woman who has had a rough life but decides that she wants to spend most of her energy doing various things to make others happy, and the film as a whole has the exact same affect on the viewer."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","1","4","9 August 2002"," Delicious, like a glass of sparkling burgundy
","I don't often view foreign language films.  I find it maddening to try to read the subtitles and watch the film at the same time.  Also, I had heard such glowing reviews about this film that I was prepared to be disappointed as well as frazzled.  I could not have been more wrong.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, wonderful film.  Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a mousey girl living in Paris whose life is so ordinary that it borders on pathetic. One day she discovers a tin box in her apartment with little toys and keepsakes of a young child that was hidden behind a wall decades ago.  She sets out on a mission to find the boy and return the treasures to him.  If the mission has a positive effect, she vows to devote herself to doing good deeds for others.  This leads to numerous touching and droll adventures, where Amelie doles out her own personal brand of justice to various characters, both good and evil.  Along the way she discovers love and turns it into a cat and mouse game of mystery and fascination, making her lover fall for her and pursue her without ever knowing who she is.<br/><br/>The story is brilliantly written, with a wry sense of humor.  Only the French could make mundane situations so funny, ironic, charming and philosophical at the same time.  It is a marvelous mix of intrigue, misdirection and offbeat humor.  Director Jean Pierre Jeunet squeezes the maximum amount of wit, sentimentality and humanness from every frame.  The Parisian street scenes are wonderfully done showing us more of an insider's look at Paris than a tourist's guidebook.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is captivating in the lead role.  She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, full of breathy enthusiasm with a twinkle in her eye and mischief on her mind.  When she is good she's wonderful, and when she's bad she's even better.<br/><br/>This is an enthralling delight of a film, like a glass of sparkling French burgundy.  It will make you chuckle and tug your heart strings.  I rated it a 10/10.  Even if you hate subtitles, see this film.  You won't regret it."

Not since godard's ""A bout de souffle"" has a french romance been so meaningful."

","""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" is an awesome movie. I saw it in France when it was in general release over there, and again tonight in Berkeley, and I have to say it was even better the second time watching it. Audrey Tautou is brilliant. She charms the audience, and can make almost anyone fall in love with her. The camera work is excellent, especially in the last scene on the motorcycle, which is just perfectly filmed. The film is funny and clever, and amazingly sweet, the perfect date movie, or in fact, it's the perfect movie for almost any occasion."
"babe_of_wrath","5","1","4","23 April 2002"," Not as good as city of Lost Children or Delicatessen
","I love Jean Pierre Jeunet, he is a genius, Amelie seemed like a French Hollywood film. It was imaginative and beautifully shot and Tautou is beautiful but is not what I would think Jean Pierre Jeunet would go for. She has typical French qualities. The film was strange but sweet, I liked it but it lacked the full on emotion and bizarre that Jean Pierre Jeunet includes in his previous films.<br/><br/>Amelie is a good film and quite fresh to watch. Little stories and people make it worth watching and Jeunet has done his best to make another French masterpiece.<br/><br/> After watching it, it makes one think about how we view the world and ourselves and how our life is too short to  hide away, there are people out there who we should all be talking too in this time of mass communication.<br/><br/>The story of the return of the book of photographs is funny as is the suicidal Goldfish. I got a little confused with the video of the Tour De France and the horse and the artist that copied the paintings,and the whole changing of the room that belonged to the landlord. Though it was beautifully shot, some of it is confusing. There are little explanations but it does not matter because the film is worth watching, even if it is just for the gorgeous Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/> The sound track, the cinematography and the acting is wonderful and one sees that Jean Pierre Jeunet usual actor who was in The City Of Lost Children plays the neurotic lover."

"schemedemon","Null","1","4","21 March 2002"," Life-changingly positive and a genuine must-see.
","Amelie is the highest grossing film of the year. And it's easy to understand why. This film has been directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the leading light of the modern French film industry.<br/><br/>Amelie benefits from Jeunet's innate ability to use the cinematic medium to create an environment which the audience feel part of. Watching the film is escapism. The character of Amelie, played by Audrey Tautot, is sweet, innocent, and modest, although her childhood was one that would have turned most people into criminals.<br/><br/>The entire film relies on sentimentality. The relationship of humans to the physical space they inhabit, the little things that mean so much to people, the games we play, the inner child. That true love exists, that happiness is possible in this day and age.<br/><br/>Jeunet's films look beautiful, thanks to Darius Khondji (also David Fincher's DoP) and are usually anachronistic in that it is always difficult to determine which era they are set in. A world apart from the dark, gothic, champagne-coloured lighting of Delicatessen, this film bursts with oversaturated colour, further communicating the joyful spirit of the film.<br/><br/>He uses the classic French talent of solid characterisation, making 3D people who interact wonderfully. Like the scene in which the erratic old man teaches the simple boy to mock his boss, chanting names, magic is made.<br/><br/>It's cinema in the truest sense. It's magical. It's also postmodern, helped by the creative team behind The Beach, Fight Club, and the Alien films, but so far removed from any 'plot' films that America may produce. If there's one avenue the global film industry should explore, it's how to make films like Jeunet's. And the box office profits reflect this.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the actor playing Nino Quincampoix, Mathieu Kassovitz, is the director of La Haine, one of the best modern French films made, and a global hit. It was strange to see him in the least hateful film one can imagine!"

","Can I get a transplant from anywhere? Damn, this movie is the funniest I've ever seen. It is sweet, picturesque and captivating. The story is simple, yet wonderfully detailed and complex in a sort of ""life-like fantasy"" sort of way. Ok, I'll dispose of the wordgames and just say: Fabulous Film! Best comedy/romance ever! (And who cares if it is French? this is the movie that redeems all those ""Two guys sitting in a bar, smoking Gauloises and uttering cryptic zeitgeist sentences in monochrome colours!"")<br/><br/>I saw the film in ""the notoriously intellectuel"" movie theatre in Copenhagen. Normally, this is the place where movies by Lars Von Trier (Dancer in the Dark), Trois Colours by Kiezlowski (?) and anything in Polish, black and white is shown. I didn't really know what to expect, but was kinda nervous from entering the Halls of Intellectual Opinion. Ten seconds into the movie, the theatre burst with laughter. Two hours later, the theatre was still laughing, eventhough the film was over. Everyone was just smitten, happy and had that little smile constantly playing about their lips. There was literally a warm feeling in the theatre. Everyone had just shared a beautiful, heart-filled experience - and laughed their asses off in the process. I'm pretty sure that less than ten percent understood French (I didn't), but even subtitled this movie was hilarious. <br/><br/>11/10 for humour, 9/10 for story and 10/10 for directing, cast and overall script, photography and that elusive ""something more"" feeling."

I'm struggling here trying to come up with a description of how wonderful this film is and all I can say is that you MUST see it. It's one of the most kind-hearted, funny, beautiful movies I've seen in my lifetime (granted it's hardly 18 years, but that's pretty good). I've recommended this to everyone I know and now to all of you. See this movie, you won't be disappointed.

I think Hollywood directors are often afraid to use this kind of cinematography fearing that their big-name stars will fade into the background; their beauty overshadowed.<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning is the wonderful acting of the Hepburnesque Audrey Tatou (who can express extreme emotions brilliantly with the mere flicker of an eyelid) and the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The plot of Amelie is an enchanting modern day fairy tale dealing with the eternal search for happiness and True Love and the fact that sometimes we really can live happily ever after.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite films; I had a big smile on my face for hours after I left the cinema and I'm one of the most cynical people I know!

"soanim8ed","10","1","4","7 December 2001"," How Romantical.
","Ah, the French.  So romantic, or least that's the stereotype and the newest French film from the great director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City Of Lost Children), won't put an end to that.  In fact, it will perpetuate the belief beyond all reason.  You see Amelie is a film that should melt the heart of the most frigid cynic, but you know cynics, they just won't let go of their hurt.<br/><br/>The story involves a woman who discovers the ability to make other peoples' lives better, but won't use that power on herself.  That's the simple.  The complex is the film itself.  It is beautiful, colorful, quirky, funny, strange, moving, lovely and romantic as all get out.<br/><br/>Each new conquest of Amelie's is stranger and more complex than the last and almost all of them reward you with a great laugh or the ability to put yourself in her shoes and feel a sense of accomplishment of making others happy.  However, as you sit there basking in the afterglow, you also feel the underpinnings and loneliness that she feels.  She won't let go of it. She doesn't feel she deserves it, so she continues to manipulate others into happiness therefore she doesn't have to deal with her own pain.<br/><br/>Don't fret though.  Into Amelie's life walks a man of mystery and good looks, who, from the moment they lock eyes, knows he must meet this wonderful and strange girl.  Thus begins one of the most bizarre and fun courtships ever put to film.  They put up posters around town asking to meet, play scavenger hunt and wear disguises all because Amelie isn't comfortable with herself.<br/><br/>Jeunet's sense of timing and humor work well for this film.  His quirky camera angles and movements and use of special effects actually add to the story and don't distract.  Plus he's worked hard with his crew to bring color and amazement to Paris that could only be real in the movies.<br/><br/>Don't let the fact that it's subtitled dissuade you from seeing Amelie. This is one of the best films in many years and very deserving of an audience.  Plus you can bet right now that it will most likely walk away with the Foreign Language Oscar this March.  Drag your romantic side out of the closet and take it on a movie date.  Amelie will make you believe in love again."

By the time the opening of the film is over, you are already rooting for Amelie and enter the story of the film loving her.  Audrey Tatou is absolutely perfect as her very unique title character and makes the film, but the rest of the cast is also spectacular.  Everything about this film worked for me, but I suppose I am an optimist at heart.

I really think the story is not worth a film and definitely not one that lasts two whole hours. Just filling it with strange characters and imaginations doesn't make it better. Just because of the wonderful view of Paris you can't call it a good motion picture. The actors are accurate but also nothing special. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it but the romance isn't lovable at all. It's rather boring and a goony vision of love and relationships between people."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","5","18 April 2011"," A peculiar little film
","Looking for an extra dosage of quirk to liven up your day? Then look no further than Amélie, an odd little French film from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amélie is the title character of the story. She is a curious and naive young girl who takes a lot of enjoyment out of life's little pleasures. One night she finds a box full of knick knacks in her apartment that had been left there fifty years ago by a little boy. She tracks down this boy, who is now obviously a man, and returns the box to him. Upon seeing his reaction Amélie decides that she wants to devote her life to helping the people around her, only to discover that she has lost sight of helping herself. It is a strange little story that is fairly melancholy and leaves one with a fairly underwhelmed state of mind. At least that's how I felt.<br/><br/>This is by no means a bad film. In fact it is very good, there just isn't a whole lot to it. It's fairly melancholy and low key, in its own uniquely quirky way. I enjoyed watching it for the most part, but nothing really stood out for me, or struck me as remarkable. By the end of the film I just sort of shrugged and said, OK. That was good, but nothing life changing. The film does have a lot of subtext and motifs that carry throughout the film, that all mainly relate back to enjoying the simpler things in life. The film takes life one step at a time and just sort of diddles along, not really amounting to much. I feel like all this is intentional, and thats why I don't really want to knock this film for doing this. I was just personally expecting more out of an interesting concept and the unique visual style that Jeunet uses in this film. But overall what is delivered is a simple film that is devoted to its message, and definitely has more intelligence than the average film. But again, it doesn't really amount to much and by the time it was over I was satisfied and amused, but not blown away or heavily impacted.<br/><br/>However, what did truly astound me in a good way was this films visuals. The direction here is very quirky and very peculiar, but also very unique. There are all sorts of strange little quirks that Jeunet throws into the film visually. They aren't really things that can be explained in words, or without a lot of context, but everything that Jeunet does in this film works very well and gives the whole film a very fun and very frivolous atmosphere. I suppose the best adjective to describe the visuals would be artsy, as moments of this film are shot in a very stylistic way with a lot of uniqueness to the visual design, essentially making this film a work of contemporary art. It is something very unique, thus hard to put into words so you really have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Visually this film is excellent and everywhere else it is just sort of there. Everything this film does, it does well, but it doesn't seem to do much and nothing about the film amounts to a whole lot. To say this is a bad film or it is poorly made would be a grotesque lie. This is an overall very good film, but it isn't something I would ever watch again, and the only thing I can really see sticking with me would be the artistic flare the film applies so well to every scene."

This film looks and sounds great but it does lose it's way a little bit in the final third.

","I saw this film at an arts centre with friends when it was first released. The fact that I spent the entire duration having to move in my seat to see the film through the moving heads of the people in front somehow added to the enjoyment. I guess a movie can seem like forbidden fruit when you've got someone's head in the way of the screen for half of it.<br/><br/>Regardless, I clearly enjoyed it as I'd originally rated it 8/10. Seeing it again nine years later then it still stands up fairly well... it's relatively inspired, undeniably well directed and the performances are fairly likable. However, what once seemed quirky and charming now seems self conscious and twee, the cloying nature of Amelie's ""cute"" personality beginning to grate.<br/><br/>What's more, the impressive special effects - used for fantasy renderings of small situations, rather than garish Hollywoodised CGI - distract rather than enhance. For a film about romance and finding that special someone then Amelie possibly lacks a real heart.<br/><br/>I once liked this movie a Hell of a lot. I still like it quite a bit as evidenced by the above-average score, but in the immortal words of Peter Griffin, ""it insists upon itself."""

","Amelie is a movie deserves more than a few random praises. I watched it a couple of years back when I was surfing channels randomly and the narration caught my attention. It is one of those movies which even if you watch for a few seconds; you will sit through for the remaining part. The detailing is par excellence, the narration fast paced, storytelling mesmerizing and the cinematography so unique, with a quaint retro visual style, colours, sound and special effects all juxtaposed beautifully, that it's an experience worth having. <br/><br/>Amelie is the story of a young French waitress who has had a loveless childhood and relies of her imagination and simple pleasures of life (dipping her hand into sacks of grain, cracking crème brûlée with a teaspoon, skipping stones across the canal)to colour her existence. <br/><br/>Her life changes when she hears about the death of Princess Diana. Bitten by the humanitarian hug, she has a strong urge to help mankind. She goes around silently straightening people's messy lives, promoting happiness, arranging romance between her miserable co- worker and a nutty customer. In between Amelie is forced to examine her own life as she is attracted to a stranger. Watch Amelie to be a participant in her journey to find love and life. Besides the narration, what really interested me was the great use of colour ( directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet of Delicatessen and The City of lost Children fame ) , great humour, and of course the wonderful characterization of Amelie by Audrey Tautou ."
"antonjsw1","Null","1","5","31 January 2010"," Its charming, witty moving and hugely entertaining
","This is a charming, witty and moving film.<br/><br/>The movie is steeped in enthusiasm, which is clearly driven by the films director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, and has clearly rubbed off on the cast and crew.<br/><br/>The script is superbly constructed, and yet is semi autobiographical (re the director) in places. It is clever, multi layered, funny and moving - a rare combination these days. Even coming back to it more than 10 years after its made it still has the power to entertain and enthral. The humour is quirky but entirely accessible, and the film doffs it cap to a older Hollywood and French films - including a really moving and funny Tex Avery type gag.<br/><br/>Acting performances are very good. Audrey Tautou is excellent, and anchors the film with a charming, affecting yet controlled and understated performance, despite the heightened reality of the world that it takes place in. Serge Merlin is also very good as the elderly neighbour who is the only character in the story who really understands Tautou's character. Other performances are very good but Mathieu Kassovitz's performance as the romantic interest comes across as a bit bland. This was the only quibble I had with the film.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the design and photography are entirely appropriate for the picture, with clever visual effects by French company Duboi. The music by Yann Tiersen is absolutely superb and elevates this film to something really special.<br/><br/>However, the ultimate credit has to go to director Jean Pierre Jeunet for putting together a wonderfully personal film with some real flair and charm, and yet making it extremely accessible."

"ellieforpeace","9","1","5","11 July 2009"," A Girl and a Boy and France and Superfluity...
","Le Fableux Destin d'Amélie Poulain or simply Amélie is a delightful movie. It's so... French, and superfluous, and fantastic in every way.<br/><br/>It's the story of a girl, Amélie (Audrey Tautou), who grew up in a cold household, and is left lonely, and yet alive in her own mind. She dreams of having a great life, but is too intimidated to do it. That is, until one day when she is prompted to help everyone around her and herself, which means taking the reigns of her life and making her dreams a reality, including chasing after the boy of her dreams (Mathieu Kassovitz).<br/><br/>I realize I just used the words ""girl"" and ""boy"" to describe them, but I'm afraid that's misleading. They're both twentysomethings, or thirtysomethings, I'm not even sure, but they aren't kids in any way. But the story is so childlike and innocent, and yet adult and tainted... It's timeless. I always think about how innocent the movie is, and consider it okay for all to see. I always forget it's rated R. Only for sexual content on a moderate scale, but it's still very present.<br/><br/>And it's so brilliant. The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, knew the material and is as certain a director as say, Baz Luhrmann. Truffaut's Jules et Jim, is very evident in Amélie, in its frantic, kinetic pace and narration, and nifty camera tricks that help to move the story along. He even splices bits of the movie into it.<br/><br/>Tautou is simply delightful. I always forget she's acting, and that she's an actress. This isn't her life, it's not the only part she plays. Amélie is a splendid character, one that will go down in movie history, I'm sure of it. The movie is almost universally liked, almost universally uplifting. It's lighthearted and fanciful. It's delightful. You can read almost any review and they'll say the same thing.<br/><br/>There are some things that are wonderful, some effects that are distracting. It inspired the traveling gnome commercials. Isn't that worth something? Give this movie a try, I don't know anyone who doesn't like it. I don't know if you can like fun and not like this movie."

","A simple, yet unique, quirky, and spontaneous film full of hilariously flawed 'human' characters, clever dialogue, dazzling cinematography, and a poignant story that encourages one to bask in life's simple pleasures, not taking a moment for granted, and above alltaking chances. It's with the latter that we all seem to have some learned societal trait to avoid taking said risks, in being different, rather pushed to assimilate, masquerading our idiosyncrasies and seeing being unique or 'weird' as a flaw. In this respect, Amelie is an unusual fairytale that uses its oddly charming story and cast of quirky characters to deliver a charming and ultimately uplifting film brimming with a child-like splendor, full of an unmitigated aspiration to view the world through a technicolor lens, one of pure enchantment. A definite re-watch."

","Its hard to describe how much I enjoyed 'Amelie' I felt as though I was sitting next to Monet, watching him as he effortly splashes beautiful watercolors across his canvas. It was so refreshing to watch a movie feeling like you were inside the mind of Amelie seeing everything in the vibrant colours as she viewed life with.<br/><br/>Amelie is a beautifully realized and uplifting modern day fairy tale that owes much of its irresistible charm to the adorable charisma of its star Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>Amelie is a 2001 French film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet and Gullance Laurant; the film is a whimsical and somewhat idealised depiction of the contemporary Parisian life. It tells the story of a shy waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, while struggling with her own isolation. Laurent and Jeunet use a kind of 'magical' realism to give the movie an almost dreamy effect.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the film is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who had composed 19 songs in 15 days for the film. The music continually changes from somehow being joyful to at the same time becoming sad and slow and sometimes fast and exciting. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes a part of the fabulous world of Amelie.<br/><br/>Jeunet established the dream like atmosphere by mostly using greens and reds and sometimes adding blues to set the contrast. Sometimes the use of colour gets very obvious; like Amelies apartment for example it's almost completely red, the underground stations are kept in green and the green grocery stores stand out from the grey buildings behind. Also Audrey Tautou (Amelie) mostly wears either bright red or bright green.<br/><br/>Besides Jeunet use of colour to bring light in the film, his masterful camera work and few special effects, just adds that touch of fantasy to the movie. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amelie flipping stones on the le canal in Paris. The camera shows a shot of her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another fantastic camera shot is seen when Nino is shown falling up the stairs chasing the yet to be discovered repair man. The camera shows the repair man driving off with Nino following close behind. Amelie then enters the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning around almost 180 degrees around shows her holding Nino's bag that he had just lost. Also when Amelie sits in front of the station we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are extremely effective supporting the dream like atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.<br/><br/>The few special effects incorporated in the movie were effectively showing the audience what was happening that could not be seen. Jeunet decided to show the key in Amelies pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door. Jeunet uses digital effects showing the keys silhouette in a yellow light hidden in Amelies pocket. This technique is also used for showing Amelies heart beat faster and the blind man feeling happy after being guided by Amelie.<br/><br/>Amelie is probably the most enjoyable movie I have seen this year, a mix of surreal images and good-natured, quirky charm that's both visually and emotionally intoxicating. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is endearing and effortlessly charming, much like the movie itself. When Amelie turns to the camera and smiles, it's terribly hard not to smile back."
"gfvaughn","10","1","5","18 July 2008"," A sensitive and groundbreaking personal film.
","""Amélie"" along with many other French films since the 1960s New Wave Cinema has the potential to alter an American's cultural awareness for the better. It's clear that young Amélie and her diverse ensemble of characters are fighting their way out of a grab-bag of codependency issues. What's unique is the writer-director's sensitivity to these issues and the positive way the show's story has the characters lifting each other up. It's a quirky, entertaining trip that cannot help but be uplifting for the film's audience as well. The positive plot a) shows the facts relevant to each character's past, b) shows how a combination of abuse and deprivation has affected each person's feelings, c) shows their need to reach out, and to be reached, for acceptance and love, and d) works through their compensating behaviors with more or less original constructive changed behavior to resolve some of the dilemmas faced by each of them. Characterization is eccentric and raw. No Dilbertized, glossy drones from the corporate mode can be found, here. What is striking is how much heart there is in a jumble of one-of-a-kind far-from-mainstream personalities. Amélie is the catalyst. Her journey to help those dear to her, in a determined but prankish and mischievous manner, is as touching and inspirational as it is entertaining. The film's simple piano and accordion score is not overpowering. It has a colorful, bright, cheery, mostly sharp-focus look with reasonable special effects.<br/><br/>In contrast, most modern films devote themselves to the flip-side of the same coin. These individuals would be ""lost souls"" in mainstream contemporary films. The same characters would likely be consumed by waves of anger, judgment, and sarcasm, as mere bodies to be used for background, bit parts. If they were seen at all they would live in darkness, in the shadow of more powerful, more selfish, nihilistic and empty lead characters. Their outcomes would be tragic, playing opposite lead characters whose personal example would be ""honor in the breach"". We see very, very few actual male or female role models in mainstream film and television. But at least one has surfaced in the person of Amélie Poulain. The two DVD set with commentary and bonus interviews is a worthwhile addition to a serious film collection."

She lives a rather uneventful life but once she stumbles across a mysterious tin of childhood treasure, she is devoted to giving it back to the owner, who was a child when he planted it in her apartment over 50 years back. This rush of goodness gives Amelie the desired mission to help all of mankind but whilst helping others she comes across some love for herself.<br/><br/>Amelie's character oozes of originality and she is exceptionally lovable, to me anyway!. Amelie is quiet, reserved yet intelligent. She enjoys the smaller things in life like skipping stones and looking back at peoples faces in the cinema!. Amelie acts as a role model for shy females, she shows that despite having a conservative personality, you can still find love and furthermore, the themes of running after something rather than waiting for it to run after you can in itself act as a powerfully inspirational message to many women, even men. Amelie is a heart warming bona fide character that truly lightens the film throughout. Bravo Audrey Tatou! <br/><br/>The film manages to cover many emotions, laughter, happiness, sadness, pity and more. This roller-coaster of emotions is a big achievement for me in the film. There are fantastic moments of great humour yet there are tear jerking segments. The balance is close to perfect, in fact it is perfect! Not only is this film a relatively easy to watch film, the story is quite complex in its own way. There are many things going on, and small sub-stories that go on that somehow link to a bigger story etc. All just a meld of stories that link together in a very smooth way.<br/><br/>Does this deserve its high place on the top 250? - Yes <br/><br/>This is the definitive feel good movie in which the director explores and experiments in many unorthodox ways.

","Amelie is by far the most beautiful romantic comedy made in the West in a very long time. I keep trying to come up with comparisons, but the freshness of plotting and the timelessness of the setting assure the film's unique. The director clearly feels the temptation to take us off into a fantasy, with Amelie magically making everything perfect for everyone, but always pulls his story and characters back to earth to remind us that the theme of his story is neither spiritual nor sexual but emotional - about the desperate need we all have to be recognized as special by at least one other person we feel is special.<br/><br/>The acting is all shamelessly excellent in that manner peculiar to French cinema - great French actors have no modesty when it comes to their talents, and great French directors incorporate this virtue into their films, as we see done here. The cinematography is gorgeous, and works equally well on large and small screens. I suppose there are quibble-points in the details, but the pacing doesn't give us any time to linger over these. The overall design of the film - to make the Paris of 2001 seem as romantic as that of 1890 as frequently treated in cinema - is achieved almost flawlessly.<br/><br/>Finally, it has to be said, there is nothing inaccessibly 'arty' here, this is a very funny film. This is a film that can appeal to everyone, on several different levels, and really needs wider exposure to a larger audience than hitherto. <br/><br/>Very refreshing."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","5","30 March 2008"," A light-hearted and imaginative story of about life's ordinary miracles
","Rarely are films so originally and simplistically creative as ""Amelie."" There is so much innovation in cinematic storytelling done in this film that you can even begin to see life in a unique way. Writer and Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet takes us into the dream-like world inside the mind of his title character Amelie Poulain in a way that is exciting, entertaining and insightful.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is about a girl of the same name played by Audrey Tatou who grows up living a shy and sheltered existence that carries into her early adulthood as she works in a cafe in Montmarte mostly minding her own business. Her life changes, however, when she uncovers an old box in her flat that belonged to a boy. She sets out to find the owner and when she does, she is launched into a self-fueled mission to do justice as she sees it and silently bring good to the lives of those around her. As she does, she begins to confront the need to change her own life in the process.<br/><br/>It's a feel-good story from the start, but what makes it interesting is Amelie herself. Jeunet shows us her imagination as well as her actions in real life and we really get a good sense of why she is who she is and why she's introverted. The scenes where Amelie watches TV and the dialogue is truly about her, or when things come to life are really clever and interesting. Tatou shows us Amelie's quiet demeanor and uncontrollable smile in a way that makes Amelie likable, identifiable and even catches you pulling for her to succeed.<br/><br/>Sometimes the film tries a bit too much to be artsy for the sake of being artsy, but overall it makes the film more entertaining regardless. The storytelling is still very clever in that we will see Amelie doing things and setting up the events to come without understanding what she's doing and then we get to see the events unfold as she planned them and it's very satisfying. There's a lot of it and it can get confusing (especially if you're not fluent in French) but there's still a lot to enjoy from the quirky characters to the clever language.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Amelie"" though is that it's a film with a big heart in addition to its big imagination. In the end it's about helping people and the small miracles we can create for others every day and how that helps us learn to face our personal challenges and make small miracles happen for us. Amelie sees how she can make a difference and that is the greatest thing that people wish for."

But definitely it is not true that only French could make film as good as this. I absolutely disagree. It does not depend on nationality of a director or writer, actor. I think it depends on how much the people who make the film are good in their profession and so on. I like as well as hades35 that Amelie emphasises the trivial things in live and has fun from them.<br/><br/>Wadodger has good opinion, however it is very exaggerated. Wadodger should realise that it is not a real story but it is a film. I really like the idea with changing people's life. If it was real story, Amelie and her changing lives would be strange but I would not get at Amelie  I like it. <br/><br/>I really liked the plot because it meant and emphasised something.

","AMELIE is not a staid CineMall movie but a quirky-plus unreality check- which was to be expected, coming as it does from the director who gave us both DELICATESSEN and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN (both way over the top where AMELIE is an ephemeral fantasy). The amiable Amelie's theory that a dead man is leaving his photo all over town so as not to be forgotten is only the beginning. The ever-evolving story plunges full speed ahead and the cinematography (which is beautiful, by the way, as it is in the aforementioned ""eccentric cinema"" classics) carries the viewer along like a roller-coaster gone haywire. The performances are razor-edged and it's only taut direction that keeps it all from getting out of control. It's like something you might find in your dreams. (Which brings me to another thought: Jeunet would be the perfect choice, it seems to me, to direct a live-action version of Winsor McCay's LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND.)

"lost12many","Null","1","5","15 January 2007"," Amelie
","Many people when they think of foreign films probably goes right to the wrong thought, ""Oh great I get to sit and read sub-titles for 2 hours."" Well there is no doubt I thought that same thing. However, ""Amélie"" changed my whole outlook on the subject. As the movie enters we are immediately introduced to the young Amélie (Flora Guiet) and all that she has gone through as a child. We get to see what has formed her life and shaped her thoughts. This works to set up Amélie's choices throughout the film.<br/><br/>After living with her father for 5 years after her mother's death, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) moves out on her own. We get to see her try to live a normal life but it just doesn't interest her. Then all things change when she finds a box that has objects of sentimental value to someone. Amélie couldn't just leave it be. She had to go and figure out who's it was and return it to them. Upon asking the neighbors she learns that it is a man by the name of Bretodeau. She searches for him and finally gives him back his box. This would set up the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Amélie becomes a person that looks out for others. She helps out Lucien (Jamel Debbouze) when Collignon (Urbain Cancelier) is always yelling at him. She helps out a blind man when he isn't able to cross the street. All of these people need something, including Amélie. The only difference is that there is no one to help her. It however is through her plight to bring others together that she ultimately helps herself. Some of the choices in the writing were magnificent. I couldn't get over the thought that Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet must have put into this screenplay. The idea of creating all the games for her to play to solve her problems was brilliant. Not to mention the casting by Pierre-Jacques Bénichou and Valerie Espange worked wonderfully. They chose actors that fit the roles and gave a very down to earth feeling to the film. These actors placed in the vibrant colors of Marie-Laure Valla's set decorations created some very memorable images. One that comes to mind is Amélie sitting in bed with the beautiful red walls behind her. There were various locales that used color in a very effective manner. The show is all about this ""dream-like happiness"" that Amélie so desperately desires. I felt that it was very important to give it that dreamy feeling and they did just that. <br/><br/>I would greatly recommend that you go and see this film if you haven't already. I know to some the thought of reading sub-titles doesn't exactly tickle their fancy. However, give Amélie a chance and she just might change your mind, and your life."

Does anyone know anything about this painting? Was it an original for the movie or an existing painting? I would like to find a copy or print I could purchase. There are also several other props used in the movie that would be interesting to own - the pig lamp, the duck painting, etc... <br/><br/>Is it possible that the Roaming Gnome commercials were inspired by this film?

","Another great foreign movie, Amelie is superb in its whimsical romantic element. Vibrant with color, zany editing, and fabulous narration along with great music, this movie is magnificent from start to end. It dares to be bizarre in a controlled way to lift the material from the clichéd romantic comedy to a dashing witty journey of one young women's plight and observations of love in her own mind. Strange weird imagery and day-dreaming freshen up scenes. Side stories were well placed and supportive in tone bringing some screen time to deserved supporting cast members. On going pranks were amusing but not overly used as. This movie really sets a new standard for whimsy. It captures a strange, wonderful mood and look never straying into seriousness. Not for those who like serious things....worthy of your collection or at least a viewing."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","5","7 July 2006"," Charming... but I don't think I ""got"" it
","After hearing so many wildly positive comments on this film, I decided to watch it... and when I found it on the bargain rack(we aren't quite as clever with sales rhymes here in Denmark), I bought it. While the film captured me immediately with its unique style and the interesting, amusing story-telling, I found myself lost in the plot and the various actions of the characters. This was more noticeable in the latter half. Maybe it's a cultural difference, I don't know(it may also be because this isn't meant to be understood or analyzed... something I have a tendency to subject all things in life to). The main reason I watched this(positive feedback sounds good, but I've never been one to follow popular opinion) is that I'm interested in the work of the director... Jean-Pierre Jeunet. So far, I've only seen Alien: Resurrection, but I've heard fabulous things about Delicatessen from a man whose opinion I hold a great deal of trust and respect for, in particular when it comes to movies. Jeunet has a peculiar style and an unusual(occasionally bordering on the downright bizarre)sense of humor. The film clearly doesn't take place in our world... the line between the real and that which is fantasy is blurred to the point in which it doesn't exist. Normally, I'm not interested in fairy tales(and that may very well be the reason why I didn't get this film), but I found this quite charming. Everything is pretty and has a magical reason behind it. The comedy in the film is also extraordinary... it's so human, so light and delightful. Nothing crude, never offensive(except for, I suppose, to puritans) and somehow sweet. Like the naive little girl the film revolves around. I didn't quite agree with all the actions Ms. Poulain took in effort to uphold justice, but I am known to have(or attempt to have) a soft spot for most anyone, no matter their actions. As I hinted at before, the film is more... shall we say ""free"" than, for example, American films. The limits for what can be shown are looser, for better or for worse. Personally, I wasn't bothered by it, but if you think you might be, you may wish to skip this one. Most everyone who can watch this should, however... it is a welcome trip back to one's childhood, with the imaginative visuals and soft, light tone. Now, to anyone who doesn't speak French(including yours truly), you must view this with subtitles(I haven't heard of a dubbed version, and I personally find the idea of dubbing any movie appalling, unless it is a children's film and to be viewed only by children or people who haven't been blessed with the schooling necessary to be able to read; you should show the filmmakers the respect of viewing their work as they intended it). Personally, being Danish(I read once that we in this country have had just about everything subbed since some time in the early decades of the previous century), I'm not only entirely used to it, I have no problem with it(though with films like this and Der Untergang(and of course the works of Alejandro Amenábar), one is reminded to read them, as I cannot understand much of anything spoken; quite different than the case is with all works in the English language, where I only read on occasion, and often simply to pick out mistakes made by the Danish-born(and often linguistically incompetent) translators). People from other countries may experience difficulty at getting used to it, however. The cinematography is stunning beyond words. Acting, editing, score... basically everything seemed flawless to me. Apart from not understanding much of what goes on for the last part of the film, I enjoyed this. I recommend it to anyone who can watch a fun, light film with a great imagination. And if nudity or sexual content bothers you, you may want to ask someone who knows you and the film to either detail it or to estimate whether or not you can handle it. 8/10"

","Like many at that time, I had heard so many great things about this movie. But given the rating for our cinemas here in my country then, I could not go and watch, even if I have a chance.<br/><br/>It is also the first time I first learnt of Audrey Tautou before she is in The Da Vinci Code movie recently. But, way before the world knows about The Da Vinci Code like me, many are mesmerized by Amelie (Audrey Tautou), the main character. So I was thankful this was once shown on the television before here (few years back). Given I had always been kind of interested in the French culture at times, it's a good way to start.<br/><br/>Audrey as Amelie...it is almost quite perfect for an actress like her. Showing some of the quirky things she does and the people she knew around her in Montmartre, it's just one of those kind of French movies one will like to expect. Not so sophisticated as we like to think.<br/><br/>Maybe at that time as I was watching on the television I did not really understand at times in terms of some of the dialogue...but Audrey really lighted up the entire movie with her portrayal of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Simple, fun and amusing."

The star of the film is magical. She has a remarkable energy that will keep you glued to screen. She is so beautiful on so many levels. She certainly accomplished her tasks in this film like those days of great classic stars might have. I can't wait to see what comes next from this very talented group of filmmakers."

I also happen to be in love with the music from the film.. As a result of this movie, I will now do serious research on both the film's director, as well as Yann Tiersen.

Amelie's sweet mischievous ways will make you chuckle and grin even more. Feeling blue? Well, check out the gallery of oddballs and sad sacks in this movie and count your blessings. A little nostalgic? Guess you're entitled because the olden days were bliss. But there's no turning back and when you follow your heart and try to do some good in the world, nothing's quite so bad. In a flash, you multiply joy and it all comes back. With a bit of inspiration, Amelie proves that you don't have to accept the status quo. You'll be in a better place when you take charge of your life and begin creating your our own happiness.

I think that it is on a par with Casablanca and other such classics.<br/><br/>The film contains many witty one-liners and ideas with a masterful performance from Tautou and supporting actors.

"The_Triad","10","1","5","4 June 2006"," A film to cherish
","I'll start by saying that Amelie is easily one of my favourite films. It's about Amelie, a shy, day-dreaming, waitress who enjoys life's simple pleasures. One day, Amelie finds a small tin box in her house, and decides to return it to it's owner, the first in a long line of people who's lives she will make better (and worse) over the course of the film. On the surface, this could be just another ""quirky"" film popular with the more art-house types, but Amelie has a great emotional depth in it's central character that is unparallelled in any other film. Amelie is the poster girl for lonely, shy, weirdos everywhere who struggles to find love herself because she can't face reality. It's this subtle, quite distressing subtext that makes Amelie the great film it is and will surely be missed by those who don't make the connection with the character. Elsewhere, Amelie has great cinematography, script, acting, score and whether you notice or not, brilliant direction from the back on form Jean-Pierre Jenuet. On first viewing the film comes across a bit of a mystery. How is that gnome going all over the world? Who is the mysterious character who keeps getting his photo taken and throwing it away? But unlike some ""one-twist"" films, where once the mystery or twist is revealed there is no need for a repeat viewing, Amelie reveals depth in the characters within the main plot, and entertains with exchanges between the more minor characters, and a few very subtle sight gags. Right, problems... being this should be an impartial, critical review and all that, the one complaint I would have is that JPJ pushed the green a little too much on the DVD. If there is a shortlist for films to be considered ""the perfect film"" this would surely be on the list, and just might be the one to deserve that title."

","I have never been touched by a movie as I was touched by Amelie. It is so simple, so sweet, it'll make you believe in the beauty of life. These are the only things i wanted to say about the movie because when you like a movie a lot you can either say very little or say too much without exactly saying what needs to be said. As I said earlier, the movie is a hymn to life, and I feel very happy knowing that Jean Pierre Jeunet will be directing Life of Pi, the Yan Martel best seller, the story that will make you believe in God.<br/><br/>I saw the movie about five years ago and it still impresses me every time I see it. It is very different from anything else around. The music is touching, the acting is out of this world. It's like being taken to a dream world that can only exist in our hearts and in the imagination of talented people as Jeunet. In case you haven't seen it, i definitely recommend you to. This is a must in your DVD collection."

"synkronized-1","10","1","5","23 May 2006"," I want to be Amelie!!!
","One of the main reasons I love French movies so much is that the French directors always have a good eye for visualization. It's all hidden in little details (like colours) and interesting angles of camera. And ""Amelie"" I think is one of the best examples of it. Probably even THE best. And this movie also has a great and very talented story. Makes you laugh from the bottom of the heart and there's even a scene when you're ready to cry with Amelie. Every time I see it I actually think that I want to be just like Amelie. I want her determination and her joy of life. This movie shows how happiness is really on the small things. And that you have to grab chances. And that you can make life worth living! And of course I enjoyed those weird and most creative ideas (like the traveling elf, suicidal fish etc.) Cast is wisely picked. They totally complete each other. Audrey Tautou is perfect for the role of Amelie. She carries a bit of mystique touch in herself and that was necessary for the character of Amelie as well. Plus she's really sweet. And actually - how many people in this world actually care about people next to you and people you don't even know? Most people are just really egoistic, but Amelie is like this little light who suddenly cares and makes things better. Mathieu Kassovitz is a very talented actor and director as well. Perfect choice for the role of Nino. He also carries out that mysterious side. The side of little weirdness, but in a good very sense. And I also have to point out the music of this movie. Yann Tiersen has completed a fabulous score. This is something extremely romantic and totally french-like. Definitely 10 points out of 10. And believe me, I would give a lot more."
"c_alice24","10","1","5","18 May 2006"," One of my favorites, hands down!
","I remember first watching this in my first French course in college. I instantly fell in love with the characters and the whole idea of the movie -- probably in the first scene or two. Anyway, I remember so many of the other students looking around at each other, not ""getting it."" I loved it. There were so many things I could relate to with the main character, Amelie, and I never knew that others thought that way about little, everyday things. It's a great story about life, love, and even fate... I think. And I've told a lot of people about it. I know I have taken forever to comment on it, but the fact that she's in The Da Vinci Code sparked me to do so. Anyway, it's a must-see for everyone -- and if you don't like it, oh well. But if you do like it, well... it just might change our life like it says!"
"piklu_2005","10","1","5","11 May 2006"," A Modern Fairy Tale...!
","Jean-Pierre Jeunet has created montages of insignificance and triviality only to bring out in an euphemistic way the biggest support one can get in life;love.Every single character,including Amelie herself,has some kind of peculiarity in their characteristics(which often resemble the eccentricity of Dickensian characters)but the one thing binds them together is their agony of being lonely,unnoticed and search for companionship and appreciation.Amelie is like the angel who repairs the missing links in their lives and finds a root of her own.The ""All's Well that Ends Well"" motto of fairy-tales has been adopted very skilfully in this movie and it rather wakes up the fairy godmother in each of us."

","This has to be one of the best foreign films ever! With brilliant acting by Audrey Tautou as Amelie Poulain, and Mathieu Kassovitz as Nico Quincampois (the love interest), this film soars. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie with dignity, and Amelie's eccentricities do not detach the audience from her, rather they endear the audience to her.<br/><br/>The script is intelligent, witty and engaging. I found that the audience were taken up by both character and situation: this is a film about love, about self-discovery, about life.<br/><br/>Like the title, it's fabulous! The film does not fall into cheap clichés; it maintains a humour throughout. It's a superb slice of life, and Amelie (the character) is so well-meaning, so scatterbrained, so ... well, human, it's a treat! Well deserving of its place in the top 250!"

(Just so you know.) I also never use cliché's like ""it will change you"", but I have to say, there will definitely be a little more optimism to even the most ruthless pessimist. I also hate to call it a ""feel-good movie"" or a ""romantic comedy"" (I hate romance films) but it technically constitutes as both, even though the romance part is a byproduct of the plot (thank god)."
"ashrich_13","9","1","5","8 March 2006"," Just like daydreaming!
","Of all the films we've watched in class, my favorite is the film about a girl that'll change our lives, Amelie (The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain). I first heard about this film on my freshman year in high school and I neglected it just like what I've done to European and Asian films (I was so into Hollywood before). Still, I was curious when I saw the movie poster, showing Amelie with a giggly yet mysterious smile. Often I tried to search for a copy of the film but I ended up buying poorly-written, Hollywood teenyboppers. So it was really a good experience when we got to watch this on class.<br/><br/>I chose Amelie mainly because its theme is unique for me. I am really fond of films with very colorful characters, those who are not usually found in every society. Amelie might be very typical externally speaking. She's just an ordinary boarder working as a waitress in a ghastly restaurant. We might have seen that kind plenty of times already. But personality-wise, Amelie is unique, being curious on everything she's unaware of and trying to deal with the people around her while being herself all the time. She's childish, she throws stones at ponds to ease with her problems, but quite inspiring. She encountered certain traumatic experiences in her childhood, but still she preserved her colorful personality.<br/><br/>As much as I've enjoyed the color of Amelie's personality, I was absolutely entertained with the color used in the cinematography. In the whole film, the yellowish tone of the color was maintained. It was advantageous for me since I am relaxed with this kind of tone, unlike those in films that are too dimly-lit or too bright. I don't know exactly why, but I think it psychologically relaxes my mind (and my poor vision).<br/><br/>In general, I liked the film because it doesn't preach, it tends not to change our perspectives in an instant. It just clearly shows us how slowly we could improve our own lives and at the same time, try to improve others in our own little ways. There are some flaws in the film's realism, especially in the animation-side, but I still enjoyed the whole of it. It was just like daydreaming, and then waking up having a dose of heartfelt optimism."

If you realize that the happiness is hidden in small details, you are lucky.<br/><br/>Nowadays a lot of people cannot find any reason for being happy; but this movie, heats our heart and reminds us looking around more positively. Jean Pierre Jeunet gives us a movie full of colorful scenes.<br/><br/>Amelie, whose parents are pretty strange, who hasn't got any friends and any expectations, used to live her life in small details finds a box one day. The box belongs to a little boy, who lived in that flat with parents before Amelie. Then Amelie thinks and decides that if she can conveys the box to its owner and make him really happy, then she will be able to get inside the lives of people and continue it.<br/><br/>Magic of images, hidden lives in details, soundtracks, colors, performance of actor and actress are blended perfectly in this movie. I think at the end of the movie you will ask yourself whether you believe miracles or not one more time.<br/><br/>Do not forget ""life is a trial of a real acting which is never displayed.""

","Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film Amélie will touch the hearts of moviegoers, just as Amélie did with those around her. Amélie, portrayed by Audrey Tautou, is a sweet young Parisian woman who unselfishly and secretly helps people around her before helping herself (and she does it all without ever expecting a thank you). After suffering through a childhood without affection and growing up with one parent, Amélie learns to become independent at a young age. She lives in an apartment by herself and makes a living by being a waitress at a café. Amélie devises plans and goes out of her way to see other people happy including her father, her coworker/friend at the café, a young man who works at a fruit and vegetable stand, and even strangers. While she works so hard to make others happy, she ignores her needs and puts her happiness second, even after developing a crush on a young man. Although seeing others happy makes her content, she finally realizes that her happiness also matters and that she needs to take the initiative in order to make things happen for her. Amélie is a unique and original film that incorporates fantasy with reality. At one point,there is a part where Amélie ""melts into a puddle"" when her crush comes into the café. The ""dreamy"" parts of the film do not take away from it, but instead, it adds to the uniqueness of the film. Audrey Tautou's character in the film is easy to fall in love with and root for until the end."

","I really wanted to like that film. I heard a lot of good things about it, plus it had a good presence in the Oscars in 2002(I don't know if anyone cares, but I think it's worth noting) so I finally watched it. And I realized it wasn't impressive. First thing that bothered me was the narrator. It was insufferable bad. I don't like that kind of narrator at all. It looked like I was reading a book instead of watching the film. The worst part is that it really wants to look like a book. The narrative is also weird. Also don't liked at all the stylized editing. It cuts the story way too much, and there is always a lot of things going on. Thankfully the editing is less frequently used. <br/><br/>The themes used – introversion, charity – are certainly interesting, but the approach made in the film isn't appealing nor strong enough to make a big impression. In the end, is just a romance story of a 'late' girl that finds in the introversion and in the fantasy(her biggest allies) are now troubling and ruining her life. It certainly has a good message _ but, a good message don't means good film or whats ever. Even because this film is mostly bad executed, at least in it first half.<br/><br/>But obviously, this film is fantastic technically. The cinematography is top notch, full of gorgeous moments, and the art direction is equally excellent. The abundant use of green suggests a sheltering aspect in the ambient, and also a weird nature in the atmosphere. The actress Audrey Tautou did very well and fitted almost that perfectly the introvert female protagonist. Really worth-noting. She seems that was born just to bring to life the Amelie character.<br/><br/>But anyways, the story, while seems to be original, looks like it was told one million times before. We know that she is going to face her introvert problem and finally find her love. But while it's depiction of an introvert life seems top notch, it use isn't the best– it has no impact in the way it's told. Thankfully to –worth noting – the editing (an underrated aspect that is essential to any film). A better approach and this film could have been much better. Unfortunately the world isn't made by 'Ifs' and 'maybes' so it's fair to give it a 7.3/10."

The movie revolves around the Bistro where she is employed, primarily, but more specifically Montmarte, which is where she lives. I hesitate to call the movie a snapshot into her life, but it sort of is.

Either you like this sort of whimsy or you don't, and I loved it.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou, sporting probably the worst haircut in the history of cinema, is so utterly adorable that you could simply melt. Also, she does some of the best knowing looks to camera ever seen (Mike Myers, watch and learn - mugging is not necessary).

","Those of you who doubt that Paris, France is still the most magical and romantic city in the world should perhaps take a look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film ""Amelie"" (2001). In it, we meet a pretty, shy young woman, Amelie Poulain, who works in a Parisian coffee shop and whose favorite hobbies, we are told, are skipping stones, cracking open creme brulees, sinking her hands into sacks of grain, and daydreaming about all kinds of strange things. She soon becomes a combination secret benefactor, philanthropist, fairy godmother and protector for the unusual assortment of oddballs at her job and in her Montmartre apartment building, but is stymied when she meets and is attracted to an equally eccentric young man. Anyway, it is just as difficult to not use the word ""charming"" when referring to ""Amelie"" the film as it is to not use the word ""adorable"" when speaking of Audrey Tautou's Amelie herself. Ms. Tautou brings to mind another Continental actress named Audrey; yes, Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, in some shots, as when Amelie looks directly into the camera with that little mischievous grin, the resemblance really is something. Many magical things transpire in this highly amusing fantasy comedy--lamps come to life, snapshots speak--but I guess magical things can and WILL happen when a gal like Amelie is around. The film is remarkable to look at, with ingenious and colorful art direction, unusual camera angles, unexpected special FX, and--need I even say?--lovely Parisian backdrops. It is also, surprisingly, at times laff-out-loud funny. This picture is certainly not your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, but something truly special that manages the tricky blend of fantasy, reality, comedy and romance. I can't imagine it not appealing to anyone with a heart and a sense of wonder. A real winner, indeed."

","Amélie Poulain is a philosophical tale about a young woman who decides to make the people around her happy, and how she finds love herself.<br/><br/>It is a tale about new love, about how unique people are.

","I don't like French films, as a rule. I dislike subtitles.<br/><br/>I loathe and despise movies that people describe as ""feel good"" movies.<br/><br/>With that understood, go watch this film. The story was lighthearted and fun, and even moving sometimes - true. But what you've got to see for yourself is the storytelling here.<br/><br/>There's pretty photography - but that's not what makes this film so unique. The narrator (usually an intrusion, or a failure to tell the story without a voice-over) is marvelous, the unreal bits that show flights of imagination are wondrous, and the twists of unreality - such as the scene where a four-part photo-booth picture starts chatting with someone - with the pictures disagreeing among themselves - is simply superb. It'd be really easy to overdo such whimsical touches, yet the film avoids that adroitly.<br/><br/>Fun story, beautifully told. Even if you are bored by the rest of the movie, the flight of imagination that wanders though bank robbers and a war in Afghanistan (you'll know it when you see it, but you won't see it coming until it's there) is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Not quite a 10 - but I don't give 10s."

"TxMike","Null","1","7","23 March 2003"," ""Bretodeau! Not Bredoteau.""
","The only problem with the film, ""Amelie"", is that you can watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Audrey Tautou is just perfect, and she reminds me a lot of a young Leslie Caron. This film relies more on body and facial expressions than on actual dialog, and she does it amazingly well. I saw it on DVD, borrowed from my daughter, and both the picture and surround sound are first-rate. I recall one scene where Amelie was riding in a train, and the sound track made it seem like you are really on a French train, surrounding you with authentic sound. An almost perfect little film about an unusual girl who wants to help make the world a better place for a few of her friends.<br/><br/>June 2008 update: I have continued to watch this movie every 6 to 12 months and have enjoyed it every time. What a gem of a movie.<br/><br/>June 2013 update: Saw it again last night, still one of my favorites, never gets old!<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS follow - don't read if you haven't seen ""Amelie"" yet.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1997, but begins 23 years earlier showing in a fun fashion the conception, pregnancy, and birth of Amelie in about 30 seconds. She had an unusual childhood, her father a doctor, thought she had a heart condition, her mother died coming out of Notre Dame cathedral, Amelie grew up flashing a mirror out her window, wishing she had a brother or sister to play with. As did a little boy who was apparently her ""soul mate"", destined to meet when they were young adults.<br/><br/>Amelie's world is populated with unusual characters. The old painter with brittle bones who hasn't been outside his apartment in 20 years. The one-armed, half-wit grocery boy. The grocer who is rude to everyone. The lady whose husband had cheated on her and died in an accident 30 years earlier in South America. The customer at the restaurant who observes and tape records his former girlfriend. In 1997, upon hearing of Princess Di's death, she drops a spherical bottle cap which rolls to dislodge a bathroom tile, behind which she finds a boy's box of favorite toys, hidden for 40 years. She eventually returns it to the now 50s man (Bretodeau) and his reaction motivates her to become a person who helps others become happy.<br/><br/>She makes a lady in her restaurant and the rude customer believe the other is interested, and they eventually develop a romantic interest. She escorts an old blind man to the train station, all the while describing for him all the things he can't see. She fabricates a lost letter for the lady who lost her husband, indicating he was about to return to her, so as a happy person she could get on with her life. And, gets her dad to finally get out and see the world, after she has a stewardess friend take his gnome all over the world, and mailing him photographs of the gnome with landmarks in the background.<br/><br/>There is a thread of mystery running through the film, after Amelie discovers a picture album of recovered, torn, discarded photos. She eventually finds the owner, who is destined to be her soul mate from childhood, and both of them wonder about the nameless man with the bland expression in torn-up photos that are found all over the city. They formulate theories about him, but it turns out that he simply was the photo booth repair man and the photos were the test shots he made after each repair.<br/><br/>Just an overall delightful film, one of the very best in recent years, one that I can enjoy watching over and over."

","Jean-Pierre Jeunet had already established himself as a cult filmmaker with a very distinct visual and narrative style after he co-directed the two surreal, darkly funny 'Delicatessen' (1991) and 'La Cité Des Enfants Perdus' (1996) with his buddy Marc Caro, and he had even briefly ventured into Hollywood (to mixed results) with 'Alien Resurrection' (1997) when he hit his stride and found unexpected mainstream success with the amazing 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain'.<br/><br/>'Amélie' is a wonder; it's a firework of clever ideas, beautiful cinematography and a love letter to the city of Paris. In my opinion it's not really a mainstream film though, with Jeunet retaining his black humor as well as the surreal elements and distinct color grading from his previous films. But unlike in his two features with Marc Caro and his American movie, there's a warm, beating heart throughout the whole film, and the resulting mix of magical realism, comedy and romantic love story proves just irresistible.<br/><br/>On a pure filmmaking level, 'Amélie' is a masterpiece. The cinematography is gorgeous and consistently inventive, the pacing perfect, the score beautiful and the fantastic cast of actors a joy to watch - especially Audrey Tautou. This is the kind of romantic comedy that even nerds like me can geek out about and without a doubt one of the best films of the first two decades of the new millenium.<br/><br/>P"

This entire film is just one joy after joy after joy after joy.<br/><br/>I would like to suggest that I and the other 662 IMDb reviewers (as of today) who gave ""Amélie"" a rating of 10 stars should start a GoFundMe project or something like that - perhaps to open a clinic or start a hotline - dedicated to identifying and helping the 52 poor, miserable souls who gave the film a rating of 1 star find at least one moment of joy each day in simply being alive.<br/><br/>I would personally like to reach out to my German brother (we speak the same language: I live in a nearby country) whose justification for his rating of 1 star is that ""Amélie"" is not ""Fight Club.""

","Sometimes, you come across a film that you can relate to through such a personal, emotional, and even relatable level that it soon becomes a favorite of yours. Amelie is one of those films, as it manages to invoke a whimsical and optimistic charm from its titular character alone. The film itself remains the highest grossing French film released in America, and it's hard not to see why. As this is a vehicle for the delightful Audrey Tautou, the film depicts contemporary Parisian life in such a poetic fashion that it could make anyone change their life.<br/><br/>The story itself focuses on a shy waitress named Amelie who, upon reuniting a man with his lost toy box, decides to change the lives of those around her for the better, despite struggling with isolation. Later on, she begins having feelings for a man named Nino, resulting her to play some sort of set up to win his heart while fighting with her inner shyness. I think shyness is the key word to describe how relatable Amelie truly is. She means well and is looking out for those she knows, but still remains introverted and quirky, thus making it hard for her to relate to ""normal"" people, making her romance with Nino all the more unconventional. In addition, the first part of the film centers around Amelie's childhood, which perfectly highlights her spending time alone to be entertained herself, further emphasizing just how relatable the film can be to any introvert.<br/><br/>As for Audrey Tautou, she shines fantastically as Amelie, capturing her joyful albeit neurotic personality to such a lovable degree, and it's always fun to see her smiling. The other characters are charming in their own right, particularly Amelie's reclusive neighbor Raymond Dufayel with brittle bones who tries finding the key to perfecting his repainted copy of Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party. Other notable supporting characters are Amelie's co-workers, from the hypochondriacal Georgette, to the stern albeit compassionate Gina, to the tough albeit caring owner Suzanne, in addition to the repugnant Joseph and the failed writer Hipolito. Whether it'd be Nino or these aforementioned characters, all of them stand out from their own distinct quirks, like collecting discarded photos, popping bubble wrap, or even lusting over one another through sex, and it's great that Amelie sees nothing but the joy in all that.<br/><br/>Lastly, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet crafts a marvelous visual aesthetic ranging from playful camera techniques, compositional scenes, and even occasional computer animation, mostly for the creatures in Amelie's imagination. These methods help give the film a very tongue & cheek presence by design, and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel splendidly films Jeunet's crazy vision to tremendous heights. Not to mention, although the film is very funny from its sardonic humor and characters alone, possibly the best jokes come from Amelie's childhood, which subverts the most expectations through visual storytelling. The film truly knows when to have fun with itself, even through the visuals that perfectly define the dazzling world that Amelie sees in her daily life. <br/><br/>Needless to say, dazzling sums up Amelie perfectly well, not just because of how enchanting it is by tone and design, but also by how sympathetic it is. It's not often I've come across a film I can relate to given how introverted yet imaginative I myself am. If you yourself are an introvert or prefer to live life through the smallest and simplest of things, seek this magnificent beauty out and see whether or not it relates to you on a personal level or not. More often than not, I think it's better that we just forget about much of the world problems and just look on the simplicities of life. You never know what aspects you'll end up admiring."

My hopes & doubts of seeing another film as whimsically competent as this are equalised by my discontent of technologies interference in cheapening the process of falling in love with sterile forms of social media.

","""The fabulous fate of amélie poulain"" is not a film about life, but rather as life should be, showing the relativity of happiness, with a great technique and direction and a script aligned to the proposal of the film, we have one of those films that It will never get out of our heads, it does not win us in that beauty talk of simplicity, on the contrary, we see the beauty of the dreamers. Behold the story of Amélie (Audrey Tautou), a young woman growing up in a home of methodical parents, who anxiously awaited the time to leave the house, and when the moment arrives, she leads a simple life working as a waitress until she discovers love , Happiness and the pleasures of life. The script is very well aligned with the film's proposal, and is extremely methodical, all the characters receive background, even those who did not need it, but this is part of the style of the film and script, Amélie's journey is almost epic, since her Journey goes beyond self-satisfaction, there is a need to make each character's story epic if we change our points of view. It is very difficult to write in words the moral that the film deals, we can say that it is the importance of dreaming and imagining, life will never beat if we are not looking at it, because Amélie is never, she applies a filter and it is enough to see the best Of all, never facing adversity from the front, and even those who insist on ruining their perfect world, she finds a way, either doing good deeds to get inside her filter or punished without losing her humor, but it's not just This message that the film passes, we understand that passion is intrinsic to the human being, and we see it in the most diverse characters and in the most diverse models of passions, be it passion for what it does, platonic passion or even paranoia search for perfection or To understand something, which is still a passion, the search to bring happiness to others and even show the qualities and defects of each character, thus humanizing everyone regardless of its character, And showing that everyone has passion, and that makes life good, and even then, I still think, that I lack adjectives to describe more the moral treated in this film. Technically, the film is beautiful, his photograph is clear, his mix and sound editing are great, his soundtrack is maginifica and mixes between a cheerful and depressive scholar, making the viewer go through all possible feelings, even his special effects are Good, but the best thing for me is the editing of the movie that dictates a perfect rhythm, it is extremely fast, it presents a lot of characters and contexts, and in the end it seems that you have absorbed much beyond what is shown on screen, another high point It's the camera angles that the director uses, they're simply fabulous, and they work almost like a character bringing in views. In terms of acting, all the characters are well, with obvious emphasis, for the actress Audrey Tautou, owner of a remarkable and natural beauty, besides possessing a good dramatic charge, the zoom that is always given in his face, dictates the Dramatic content of the scene, and his malicious grin makes any message from the movie seem extremely real. The experienced Jean-Pierre Jeunet recovers from unsuccessful works in the past, and returning to French cinema the filmmaker applies a direction that borders on complete perfection. Finally, ""the fabulous fate of amélie poulain,"" is a beautiful and masterful film with the ability to delight and impress everyone. ""These are not easy times for dreamers."""

","One woman decides to change the world by changing the lives of the people she knows in this charming and romantic comic fantasy from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition, Amelie didn't attend school with other children, but spent most of her time in her room, where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine (Lorella Cravotta) died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight, and her father Raphael (Rufus) had limited contact with her, since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this, Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical, romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997, Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her, hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette (Isabelle Nanty), a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria, and Joseph (Dominique Pinon), an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment, she returns them to their former owner, Mr. Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou), sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel (Serge Merlin), an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle, thanks to a rare disease, that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris."

I was never disappointed so far, but with big expectations one cannot be easily amazed either. Director Jean- Pierre Jeunet already amazed me with fantastic post-apocalyptic surreal romantic dark-humored horror drama ""Delicatessen"" from 1991, then disappointed me with the 4th sequel in ""Alien"" franchise, and then he made an amazing comeback with ""Amélie""... If I didn't see ""Delicatessen"", I could not believe this movie was made by the same person responsible for ""Alien 4"" failure.<br/><br/>The story, acting, camera, colors, music... complete atmosphere left me speechless.

I have watched a lot of the films present in the IMDb top 250, but none seem to equal this one in terms of the impact it had on me. I have watched this film throughout my childhood and once more today. This movie to me never seems gets old- there always seems to be a life lesson that I did not quite grasp before. Maybe because I am French... I can relate to the setting and cultural references present in the movie. Nevertheless, Not only is the story line interesting (developed around the theme of fate), the acting and filming really is unique and spot on.

Amelie's father was a doctor, and her mother was a teacher.

","I adored this movie. I've only recently gotten into foreign film watching, but I'm so happy that I did. This film was just wonderful. It was so magnificently shot and the acting was on point. The simplistic aspect of each character made them feel real. The world created in this film is just a very quirky and colorful version of ours, and it'd be a joy to live in. One thing I thought especially interesting was the year that it took place in. Many stories tend to either go further back than what most young viewers remember or they stay in the here and now, but this one only took us back a few years to a still familiar time. And even though the main plot of this film is heartwarming enough on its own, the subplot between her and her father and the garden gnome is just magnificent and only slightly out of our world.

","Amélie Poulain was raised by eccentric parents who – erroneously believing that she had a heart defect – decided to home school her. To cope with her loneliness, Amélie developed an active imagination and a mischievous personality. After her mother is killed when a suicidal Québecoise tourist jumped from a church roof and landed on her, her father's withdrawal from society worsens. Amélie eventually decides to leave home and becomes a waitress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. Spurning romantic relationships after a few disappointing efforts, she finds contentment in simple pleasures and lets her imagination roam free.<br/><br/>On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Princess Diana, Amélie drops a plastic perfume-stopper and accidentally discovers an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Amélie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others.<br/><br/>After inquiring the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Amélie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who repaints Luncheon of the Boating Party by Pierre-Auguste Renoir every year.

","This was my first French film and the first time I've watched Amelie which has been due for a while. I had known it was quite popular, I've seen the cover of the movie very often but never really thought to watch it because there wasn't anything... extremely different or interesting about it based on the synopsis. I didn't really have high expectations for it though I know it is quite loved but for reasons I had no idea of.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved my time watching Amelie. So much about it. It very much surprised me from the very moment it started. It wasn't a movie I was expecting at all.<br/><br/>Characters: Amelie was definitely my favourite character. Despite the fact that she didn't have much dialogue, I loved the actress who played her, the fact that she was a genuinely nice person but wasn't afraid of making mean people pay for their actions as she did with Collignon.<br/><br/>I also liked Nino and the fact that he found joy in the little things like Amelie and their little detective puzzle work. I found him attractive and he seemed like an understanding and kind fellow.<br/><br/>Mr Dufayel was an interesting character. He wasn't exactly friendly, nor was he mean. He seemed to be someone with an endless number of stories and imagination but didn't take kindly to others saying or doing things that weren't his usual way or what he liked - so a little stubborn and doesn't take kindly to change which are characteristics seen in older characters quite often.<br/><br/>I'm glad we saw an ample amount of Lucien. I'm glad that customers were shown to disapprove of the way Collignon treated Lucien rather than just letting it go on or ignoring it completely. My favourite scene of his was when he managed the shop all on his own and was so happy and friendly to the customers.<br/><br/>The other characters were interesting but somewhat mediocre. I didn't particularly hate anyone. Georgette and Joseph weren't my favourites but I don't think they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>I almost forgot - apart from characters that could be seen, the narrator was the best part. Sometimes less is more and this was the case with the dialogue in Amelie. The narrator was wonderful in describing what was going on so more time could be focused on watching the characters and the other details on screen rather than trying to process much information from speech. From the very first few words, I was hooked. My interest was piqued. It sort of reminded me of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in that sense.<br/><br/>Just a note on speech - French is a beautiful language. I have heard people say it before and I have heard the language being spoken before but watching this movie made me so relaxed and warm. Perhaps that's just a result of the movie itself, I don't know.<br/><br/>Sound: Loved the music. It didn't take over any scenes, just a really good accompaniment. Things from the sound of the rain to when Amelie sinks her hand in a bag of beans or a chime of a bell. All done well.<br/><br/>Favourite part/s: that little 'follow the blue arrow(rabbit)' thing and the end. It was so satisfying. I had not noticed that not a word was spoken by the physical characters within the last ten minutes of the film. It was just so emotional and warm. Loved the ending.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Definitely watch this movie. Give this movie at least one chance. There isn't an extremely obvious complication or resolution, no dramatic scenes or anything like that. It was solid the whole way through and my interest was consistent for the majority of the movie. Rewatch value is high. Something I would put on the background as well just to hear the sound of the narrator and the language being spoken."

There were some hilarious scenes as well. Amelie is a strange character at times but also pretty relatable. <br/><br/>The major problem I had with this movie is the plot. It was all over the place. There were too many different stories squeezed into one. I was generally confused what the point of the whole movie was. While there were great scenes, some parts were so boring that I wanted to skip over them. <br/><br/>Overall, Amelie is lighthearted and pretty entertaining, but I guarantee you will yawn at least twice while watching the film."
"thielemaetti","10","0","1","22 June 2016"," If you feel down this Movie will bring you to Heaven
","Let's start with the best: Yann tiersen and his magic music. The mostly piano-based songs are so touching and truly beautiful that you can't watch this movie without loving the music. It is fitting to every single scene of the movie-supporting the feelings that Amelie is having. Audrey Tautou plays the character of Amelie Poulin, a mid-twenty waitress and outsider who is searching for love in her life. Randomly she finds a box in her apartment, hidden by a child many years ago. She tries everything to bring the box and the owner back together and when she does, she realizes that she wants to help people in life and that she wants to punish people who aren't behaving nice (especially to other persons). On this way Tautou plays excellent the role and of the dreamy woman without any plans in life just letting everything go. In the parts Amelie is sad or down Tautou manages great to change from her positive attitude to complete sadness and is the whole movie 100% authentic. When she is seeing smiling or happy it's like a constraint that you have to smile too. The other characters (mostly neighbors) are all clever designed and are able to give their roles some realness that I didn't expect. In these movie every role seems like someone you could see like this the next day on your way to work. It seems like this world created by Jeunet is not from a playbook-it's the real world. The dialogues are matching instantly to this. Very authentic story lines. In a movie based on the theme to find the small things in life that make you happy it is very necessary that the atmosphere is great. Here for example the team completely cleaned every spot in Paris they were using to give the atmosphere more ""magic"". And it works. After this movie I was more able to recognize the beauty in architecture, nature and people all around me in my daily life-just like Amelie is recognizing this.The intention completely works and the message is easily transmitted. And of course the best music every used in a movie. I have nothing bad to say. Great acting with a stunning leading Actress-local and realistic spots- clever story and dialogues.YANN TIERSEN. This is probably the best movie to give you a smile and one of the true masterpieces of this century."

","Well this is absolutely one of my favorite movies! The scenes, the actors are amazing and can make us feel an numerous quantity of feelings.'<br/><br/>Audrey Tatou is obviously a great actress! Besides the fact that she is a classy lady, she can represent like no one else, she is indeed perfect for this part, the movie wouldn't be the same if her role was played by someone else. This movie makes us fall in love with the french cinema and gives us the desire to travel to Paris.. <br/><br/>Another aspect very important is the soundtrack, that in this movie is absolutely beautiful and placed in the right moments. Everybody should watch it."

","Amelie is a charming feel-good film all about how you can make people happy by making others happy. It also explores a second theme of whilst it is important to make others happy, it's just as important to make sure you're happy as well. Stylistically the film is great. The film makes great use of stop-motion, which gives it an entertaining old-timey feel. There are also some great instances of humour, such as all of the strange people who inhabit Amelie's world. It's strange to think that somewhere, people like this really do exist somewhere or another. <br/><br/>Read my full review: http://goo.gl/Wfmbuu"

","I resisted this film for years for no good reason. I'm a guy and I'm not prioritizing my time for romantic comedies, but now that I have experienced it (more than once might I add), I consider it to be one of my top 10 favorites of all time. <br/><br/>It is the story of an outcast girl who finds meaning by doing crazy little favors for strangers. It's her contribution to the world that gives her stark life purpose. But what is so engaging about this film is the manner of humorous style, colorful characters, artful camera work, editing and overall creative genius that really sets it apart. It has an overall quirky personality that puts it in a category of its own. It is relentlessly droll and funny, and it confidently opens little charming surprises that are touching. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's a stretch but if you enjoyed ""Raising Arizona"" with Nick Cage by the Cohen brothers (another favorite, but not quite to this level), you will probably love this film for some of its similar originality and styling cues. I happen to be French so I have an extra appreciation for the nuances that the original dialogue brings, but the subtitles are well translated and my friends have all thanked me for turning them on to Amelie. This film is a gem."

","What a fun film! From the moment it begins. It is such an amazing experience to watch this movie. It is as visually pleasing as it is story wise, with an unbelievable music quality. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, set in my most favorite beautiful city of the world, Paris, and this movie will make you wish you were born in Paris. It is about this Parisian girl who is a waitress and very shy. she helps everyone to find happiness in life's smallest things but doesn't really care about her own's. but during everything she discovers her love. In this movie,the world is very similar to how I see it,(Our happiness is related to happiness of others). I think I have a lot of Amelie in me. in summary, it's a pleasant film, highly recommended."

","If I had to describe this movie in one word that would be: Colorful, joyful, warm, full of life (not one word exactly). I did not meet single person that hates this movie. You just have to love it. You have to love Amelie and her little quirky habits and everything about her. Audrey Tautou was just a perfect casting choice. She is Amelie without a moment of doubt. The rest of the cast is really great but she is divine. The story is simple and you can find yourself in it, but the way it's told makes it so special. Love and passion to make life better gives this movie a possibility to be watched over and over again as I did. If you feel down Amelie is always there to pick you up and help you cross the street."
"cowheysean","10","0","1","23 July 2015"," Personal Experiences of Amelie
","Personal Experiences of Amelie <br/><br/>Amelie is a beautiful story about a shy young woman who takes joy out of being a behind-the-scenes humanitarian. Her unique ways of bringing happiness to people anonymously provide an overwhelming sense of charm to the big screen. Even after stumbling across the love of her life, Amelie proves it to be too difficult to engage in a face-to-face interaction.<br/><br/>Amelie showed a few French New Wave characteristics throughout the film. For this writer, Amelie gave some appreciation toward director Francois Truffaut. Most notably, Truffaut was a pioneer for using natural light and shooting outdoors instead of on set. Director of Amelie, Jean-Pierre Juenet, constantly uses the outside world for filming locations. In addition to shooting outside, Truffaut once portrayed Paris as a perfect and fairytale-like atmosphere. According to IMDb, Juenet went to extraordinary lengths to clear trash, debris, and dirt before scenes in order to maintain that same fairytale feeling. <br/><br/>Every character in Amelie had great depth and detail. It seemed impossible to think that these characters were, in fact, fictional. The ""Glass Man,"" Lucien, and even the concierge and tape recorder man all had distinguished traits that made them unforgettable. The strangest and most effective form of the climax was the lack of dialogue between the two lead actors (Amelie and Nino). It was bold and entirely different but it kept the audience wanting Amelie and Nino to officially meet. <br/><br/>Amelie saw little gray in the world through her eyes. A black and white world was easier for Amelie as she judged the good vs. the bad people. The storefront owner was a condescending prick to his worker. Amelie went to extreme lengths to make his life miserable at home. For example, Amelie would exchange his night slippers for a similar pair but in a smaller size as well as switching the toothpaste tube with the foot cream tube. Even Amelie's father received the same treatment. Her father adored his garden gnome. With the help of her stewardess friend, Amelie was able to playfully terrorize her father with pictures of where the 'escaped' garden gnome has been. The end message was trying to have her father travel the world before it is too late. <br/><br/>This adorable film exploded with bright colors and projected inimitable personalities. The strong Christian undertone heard throughout the storyline was unmistakable especially with Amelie's humanitarian work. A film like Amelie reminds us how to really act towards one another. The simple concept of cause and effect, karma, and doing good deeds without the intention of recognition are the staples of life that should continually be practiced."

","Even though it's been 14 years since the premiere of ""Amélie"" and I've only watched it now for the first time, the quality of the movie was certainly worth the wait. The premise of the film is simple: Amelie, a young french girl, helps others, but at the same time starts forgetting about her personal life just to suddenly realize she's fallen in love. The movie makes the viewer see how little is necessary to be truly happy - Amelie is neither rich nor ambitious, she doesn't have many friends and lives a simple life, but by empathetic feelings towards others she satisfies not only her own wishes, but also those of the helped ones. The main romantic plot line is very sweet and will subdue even harsh critics by the complete innocence and purity it possesses. The cinematography is well done and seems fluid. The omniscient narrator and some of the seemingly illogical scenes leave a slight sense of surrealism, but it fits well into the groundwork of the remaining movie. Also - the music score of the film is gorgeous, I certainly anticipate listening to it over and over again. All in all the movie is very well made and is one of the most successful ""feel- good movies"" I've seen, but it doesn't bring anything game changing to the table and many similar movies can be found."

","The story, the acting the special effects, simply impassioned me deeply. It's all very charming, often amusing, and there is hardly a dull moment.Tautou is a remarkable young actress. Her wide-eyed, gamine look, reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn or Leslie Caron, gives Amelie an innocence and vulnerability that is so essential to make the story work. Not only is it a fawning love letter to the City of Light where it was shot, but the film is based on the comforting premise that the big city is just a small town when folks get to know each other. It is as deliciously romantic and ingeniously mischievous as cinema gets. Underlying the directorial derring-do is an enduring truth: Love really can conquer all."

","Magic adventures of Amelie <br/><br/>Growing up in life is something that everybody has or will pass over that stage. In the movie the main character, Amelie starts experimenting her first love adventures. Throughout the movie we can see that she is kind of trying to figure out how she really. She has a very hard time trying to deal with the real life. This is because of her parents, mostly her dad that since she was a child he always said she had mental problems or something in her brain. She lived a very isolated life since she was a child until she had a separate life from her dad. The narrator takes a very important job in the movie because he explains to the watcher what is happening and he also introduces the characters at the beginning of the movie. The movie is very well structured in the way that the movie has a good line tension and keeps the audience very interest in it. As other french movies, love is something very predominant in it. This movie is not just a love stories as other movies of love. It is like a young character trying to get into a relationship and finding the right person for it. They make the movie very interesting because it is not just about her love story but, she is also in the love adventures of other people. She helps other people like the guy in the café, where she works. Watching the movie in french makes the movie very original and romantic. The characters of the movie make a good roll on it but the actor of Amelie is outstanding. We can see that the character of her father is not important for the movie. The relationship between Amelie and her father has not been the best so the character in the movie is like a boring guy who lives in his own world. Reading the subtitles of the movie because it was in french was a different adventure from how I normally watch movies. Reading and hearing the french accent along also made like a magic touch to the movie in which the language makes the movie feel very romantic. <br/><br/>From my point of view, i really enjoys the movie in many ways. I will really recommend the movie but i will also say that it is true that the movie people of the age of 15 or older because there are several scenes in the movie that are not appropriate for younger child's."

","""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" that translates as ""The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain"" this is the title of the film. Since the moment we as the audience read this title we realize it is going to be a somewhat different and unique film. One feels the need to find out what this girls adventures will be.c is introduced as a peculiar little girl, who seems somewhat special in a sense. Since the first scene of the movie one as the audience immediately feels attracted to this movie. Which is a different type of movie rather than the typical Hollywood style one. The movie has a narrator which narrates and explains the events and the characters present. Amélie lives a really unique or rather weird childhood, where her father is a doctor and is really cold with her or more likely distant, and she is homeschooled and is taught by her mother whom is later killed in a terrible and unlikely situation. Amélie expects for her situation with her father to get better but it doesn't, so as soon as she is old enough she leaves home and sets off to live on her own and get to know all the things she was prived for when being a child. <br/><br/>Amélie sets her life goal to be helping people, she aspires to be some type of hero to people. As the movie unravels we get to know lots of characters, Amélie helps lots of this characters including Georgette the cigarette clerk in the coffe shop Amélie works in, she makes Georgette fall in love, then one of the most important characters in the film and who's purpose we learn towards the end of the movie is Nino who Amélie helps as well though he is later involved romantically with Amélie. The acting in general was great the two characters previously mentioned do a great job acting, since it is kind of a magical or fantastical film it is probably really difficult or more like a challenge to get into character with the characters being portrayed, so the actors playing this characters did a marvelous job.<br/><br/>I believe that the plot of the movie is this way because it has a further message rather tan Amélie wanting to help others. I believe she is scared and she is scared of her own problems and reality, which will also result in her lack of given love as a child. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to teenagers 15 and older, not younger due to some sex scenes present in the movie. Yet overall the movie is really age appropriate though it can be sometimes confusing to understand. Also there are some crude scenes like when the mom is killed by someone committing suicide. Yet the movie is really enjoyable. <br/><br/>My name is Maria Jesus Rodriguez, I am a Junior in Lincoln School Costa Rica. I watched this film in my film appreciation class and I really enjoyed it. I like theatre a lot therefore I was amused by this great and different film syle."
"Adwood29","7","0","2","17 December 2014"," The mysterious and unpredictable ""Zoro"" - Amélie
","Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain known simply as Amélie in English is a wonderful and sprite full story about a young woman named Amélie who is on a mission to bring happiness to people's lives and find her true love. As the title suggests it is the ""fabulous destiny"" of Amélie but is it really destiny?<br/><br/>I believe that it wasn't her destiny rather her way of trying to play ""hard to get"". Throughout the movie Amélie leaves clues that allow this man that she loves find her and make him love her by the little things that she does. She is making him work to find her and along the way solving the little mysteries that he wanted to discover. For example, the bald man that kept appearing up in his photo album and no one knew who he was. When Amélie broke the photo booth on purpose she led her love there and he found out that the mystery man was just the maintenance man. The face that her love expressed was priceless and although he didn't know who Amélie was he knew it was her.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie was a little hard to understand and was a little out of my taste. I know that this is a ""foreign"" movie but I still prefer the big name Hollywood productions. Now don't get my wrong this was a good movie it just wasn't for me. I think that people who are looking for a light hearted romantic comedy movie should defiantly watch this movie. It has the right amount of comedy in it to not make you lose track of the love story but just enough to give you that comedy relief that you need during an uncomfortable scene or long love scene. <br/><br/>I also think this is a good movie to watch if you are looking for something a little different. You will never find another movie like this in Hollywood. After I watched this movie it opened me up to another side of film and cinematography. The way that this film was producer is like nothing I have seen in a movie produced in a Hollywood film. The way they used animations as if it were a fairy tale was very unreal to me and at first thought it was kind of silly. Near the end though it seamed to have a great impact on the movie. It allowed me to realize you don't need to centralize a specific technique to one genre. If you are good enough you could make it work in any movie.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great film that obviously took a lot of time and practice and helped me open my eyes and mind to give these ""foreign"" films a shot. <br/><br/><ul><li>Adam</li></ul>"
"robert8888","8","0","2","17 December 2014"," ""Amelie"" will change the way you look at your life
","Everyone in their own lives and in their own ways have matured and changed for the better. Well, in this movie Amelie does that same exact think just that in a very peculiar way I think, and placing other's problems and lives first than hers. On this love adventure you will Amelie would do everything that is necessary for her to find love and figure out who she really is. Her normal daily life of skipping rocks and working in a coffee shop will have a huge turn upside down and that will change her life for the better. And that truth is that Amelie is such a normal person such as me or whoever is reading this, and I think that is what makes this movie very personal with the watcher. <br/><br/>The story of this film is portrayed in a very well matter, with the help of our fellow narrator who introduces the film very fast but in a very detailed way. Amelie Poulain was raised by her parents in France, and she was home-schooled by her mother ho was a teacher. Unfortunately for Amelie's family her mother died in an accident and that left Amelie alone with her father, and when she was old enough she left her house and moved to the city. In the city the narrator introduces many characters to us, for example, Amelie's co-workers, and neighbors. There are other characters of the movie like Nino who are not introduced at all by the narrator, they only just appear in the movie leaving the watcher wondering who the character is. This technique of giving small details on some characters is very typical of European cinema, and that is one thing we need to remember while watching the movie, the fact that is comes from a different culture. <br/><br/>I think that the cast for this movie was very well chosen because most of the characters, if not all, portrayed their roles perfectly. The characters are introduced by the narrator very vastly giving the watcher all of their characteristics, or some characters are not introduced until the end of the movie with actions from other characters. For example, the role of the main character, Amelie, is performed by Audrey Tautou and she does a perfect job on the role. Many times throughout the movie the watcher can see and feel Amelie's emotions and she does not express them clearly but based on her gestures and actions the watcher can imply how she feels. European movies are also known to make the watchers wonder and think, and that is an example of how it is done in Amelie. All of the characters seemed very natural in speech and manner I did not find even one character who did not convince me. the strong emotions are also very well done and acted by the other characters, not only Amelie. <br/><br/>Photography in the movie is also very well done and it is also done in a very peculiar and specific manner. There are different camera movements and shots in the movie but what is very interesting in this movie is the color. ""Amelie"" uses a lot the color yellow, and when I say a lot I mean it, the movie makes it look like if Amelie's world is yellow through her eyes. At the end of the movie the colors change and the movie starts to be filled with color, and that is because the color symbolizes Amelie's change in her life some would say and I might agree on that although I am not very sure.The photography of this movie helps it picture Paris in a way nobody has ever scene in it in a film. <br/><br/>I think that the settings were simple but they kind of helped the watcher focus in what they needed to pay attention because in some movies the settings can distract the watcher from the film itself. The settings of the movie help act out the scenes because they are very simple so the audience wouldn't get lost at any time, or confused with the scene. I really do not mind those simple scene because like I said before the movie comes from France and probably all of the directors and producers had to fund the sets. <br/><br/>The director of this movie was Jean-Pierre Jeunet and he really was key to the movies success. As I said before because of this movie coming from France maybe he had to put some money out of his pocket to make it possible to film it. He is the mastermind after all of those little details of the transitions (which are kind of weird when you see the move at first), the music, and the colors. I think that he could handle pretty well all types of scenes, the ones of love, the ones of comedy for example. The edition that the director made of this movie was also great and when you see the movie you will understand that there are many touches he adds for the movie to feel almost like a fairy tale. <br/><br/>There are many more reasons why you should see this movie, but the web page only lets me write a thousand words. I would give this movie a 4/5 stars and I really recommend it for watchers who want to see a foreign movie. Also I recommend it because when the movie finally ends and Amelie gets her life together, you start thinking about your own life and if you really know yourself. That thinking that happens at the end is different for everyone and who knows you might end up turning your life around like Amelie."
"gianlubomba","8","0","2","16 December 2014"," This review will go into the characters and scenes of the movie Amelie, and the reason for them
","Gianluca Bombardelli December 16, 2014<br/><br/>Was Amélies Destiny that Fabulous?<br/><br/>As soon as you see the smile of Amelie as a little girl taking pictures, you are in the mood to observe someone's life and her experiences. Then comes Amelie with her huge eyes looking at the city of Paris. Next she is pictured as the girl with the glass of water; a fragile glass that the spectator can compare with her life. You are ready to see a movie full of sentiment. The plot of the movie is how Amelie Poulain is raised in isolation from other children because her parents, especially her father who is a doctor, believe she was born with a heart defect. This loneliness is the cause of her vivid imagination. She is home-schooled by her mother, who unfortunately is killed in an accident. Finally Amelie decides to leave her home and becomes a waitress at Café des Deux Moulins in Montmartre, where she meets all sort of people. A person who stands out is Nino, with whom she begins a romantic relationship. With her vivid imagination she decides to help others as much as she can and succeeds in her efforts. The scene of the glass of water is explained here when Amelie tries to copy Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party showing her artistic part. To place the movie on its time, there is an allusion of Lady Diana's death on August 31, 1997. There are many characters in the picture especially because Amelie tries to help many people's lives, but the main ones are Amelie Poulain, played first by Flora Guiet and then by Audrey Tautou ,in the 2001 movie ,and Nino Quincampoix also played by Amaury Babault as young Nino and then by Mathuew Kassovitz. The characters in general are good but Audrey Tautou does an extraordinary job. Georgette, played by Isabelle Nanty, does a very good job too as a hypochondriac. On the other hand Rufus, as Raphael Poulain, Amelie's father, could have been a stronger character in my personal opinion, but maybe it was done on purpose by the director since his dad wasn't a big part in Amelie's life, instead was kind of an obstacle to her in order to grow when she was a kid. To watch this movie in French really places the spectators in the right place with the right language. French is romantic in itself; of course most of us have to read captions and this might cut the magic of the film. One of the aspects that catches our attention is the combination of practical scenes, like those in the subway and the imaginary ones like those of the ghosts. Perhaps the most appealing scene is when Amelie plays a cat and a mouse game with Nino around Paris because it reveals her childish character. When Amelie returns the album anonymously, once again we see her timid personality and this sends us back to her lonely childhood. In general there is nothing the spectator would dislike in the film for even the sex scenes are created with great professionalism. The biggest lesson I learned from the film is that simple things are important in life. Amelie does nothing extraordinary, yet with her simplicity, she helps many people. The contrast with Amelie's lonely childhood and Nino' s, full of friends, gives us a lesson that people might be different in many aspects, but love is the same feeling for everyone, no matter the age, the social or economic position.<br/><br/>The real name of the film is ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain"" that translates as ""The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain"". Just by reading the title of the film we know it will be fabulous. I will truly recommend the film for any audience above fifteen years old, not younger, due to sex and nude scenes and violent ones, as when a woman jumps from the roof of a church and kills another as she lands over her on the street. How people drink alcohol and consume drugs, especially around Montmartre, can also be considered not acceptable for a younger audience. The MPAA rating for the film is R. My personal grading of the film is 4 out of 5 stars. <br/><br/>It is interesting to tell the people who read this work on Amelie who wrote it. The author is a Gianluca Bombardelli, a junior student at Lincoln School in San Jose Costa Rica. Familiarized with French from his studies in Middle School it is delightful for him to hear the language, although not being able to understand all. The author is fan of sports, especially soccer and motocross. Many personal experiences in his life make ""Amelie"" such an appealing movie for him."
"josemaria-matamoros4-186-212364","6","0","2","15 December 2014"," Amelie Movie review
","**Spoilers** <br/><br/>Starting with the title i believe it was actually suitable to the movie. One of the reasons being that any other title would not be as good as this one. The writers name is Guillaume Laurant, for me is the first time i have heard of him and i really doubt that i have seen any other movies written by him. Now as a first impression of him i really enjoyed the way he set up everything because it wasn't like traditional in a sense so it was really enjoyable. I think for the most part the movie was believable except in some scenes where she would like booby trap the whole apartment or maybe when she called the payphone and just the right guy would answer the phone, but for the most part it is very believable. Speaking of the plot it was very intriguing if you will. It wasn't too complicated but not too simple it was just right.<br/><br/>Now starting with another topic the Actors. In the movie Amelie we see an excellent choice of actors. Why is this? well it is simple just with Amelie (the main character) you can see that she is basically the perfect actress for this. She just has so many facial expressions which enable us to see what she is trying to portray. Also the supporting actors are also so well chosen that they fit with Amelie so well that they work as a clock. everyone in sync with each-other and also this creates like the perfect mood. Now with this crew working so well together it enables them to to the movie scenes of humor or the serious parts very easily because they can switch roles just like that. <br/><br/>The characters were introduced to us in a very interesting way this being because the director decided to introduce every one in like the first few minutes of the movie. We know who they are what they do etc. so this creates like a basis where the movie starts developing from. Some of the emotions of the emotions i think were really well. But as always i believe they over did it in some scenes. In my opinion i think they really over did it when Amelie is watching the TV imagining it is her. That part was just like too over done. I mean the movie is really good at portraying emotions but in this scene for me it was just a little over done but overall the feelings that it shows through out the rest of the movie are really well shown. Also a thing that caught my attention was like how well the actors adapted to the script. They just seemed so fluid and so constant that it was really amazing. They all were really good at knowing their roles and how to show their roles. <br/><br/>The photographic view of the film i think that the director chose the camera angles very well, He did great use of the long shot were we could see like the whole city or the whole train station to give us an extraordinary perspective other than just showing us the main character walking around doing the same thing. it creates almost like a different feeling because we can get to like experience like we are there. He also was brilliant at the part of doing close ups. He would normally do them when something intense was happening, or where he really wanted to how some type of emotion. like when Amelie was talking to the guy she first gave his toy box. I personally think this counts as a close up because we can see very well how she is feeling due to her facial expressions we see that she is like very uncomfortable and kind of wanting to leave that place earlier.<br/><br/>Talking about the setting the setting i think created a different feeling that it would have created if it was done in for example new york or something. It really creates different feelings and i think for this type of movie Paris was an astounding place to film this complex yet simple movie. Something i noticed was that in many scenes it was like very full like there was too much going on. like in the haunted house, we have a clear vision of her directly but people tend to get distracted very easily and could not put attention to the main plot of the story due to that. This only happened in a couple of scenes and i personally got distracted but many people might not have the same problem. Another thing i was really intrigued by was that some scenes weren't exactly made to be understood right at the second. like for example when she is following the guy with the red book we don't understand why until it shows us later on. This was a very clever idea on behalf of the directors because it keeps you like with the desire to know more of what is happening. <br/><br/>Now finally the directing. I believe the directing of this movie was great. The Director Jean- Pierre Jeunet was able to balance the scenes perfectly. He knew how to add the perfect balance of humor, anger, and all of those. by doing this i believe that all the actors were well informed and well balanced in their acting because they always knew what to do and what not to. I think that the scenes were mostly very very well edited. <br/><br/>Overall i think this movie was really good despite the fact that i'm not much into these types of movies. it really maintained me entertained and the plot and all the story were really interesting so i do recommend this movie."

","Amélie (2001) is a charming, witty movie with a dry sense of humor and an exciting plot. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet allows his audience to be completely involved in the film as he includes asides and camera aspects that make us feel as though we are standing in with the characters, and the cast of Amélie was well thought out, each actor or actress perfectly suiting their roles.<br/><br/>Amélie, played by Audrey Tautou , is a girl with a mission. Upon finding a box of toys left behind a baseboard of her house, Amélie decides that she will return the box to whomever left it so many years ago. If that person is grateful, she will become an everyday do-gooder; if the person is not, ""so what."" As Amélie becomes sets out to do good for the people around her, she falls for Nino, played by Mathieu Kassovitz. Nino is a man of many charming qualities including his love of the human story, which draws Amélie to him even more. As the story of Amélie and Nino takes off, we learn a lot about the people with whom Amélie surrounds herself.<br/><br/>An idea that really drew me into the film was the idea the every individual has their own story. We see this in the way Nino collects discarded photobooth pictures, and how Georgette, the café clerk gets flustered every time she and Joseph, a usual, interact, and how Amélie's father lives to remember his late wife. Even her father's gnome has a story to tell, as he travels the world in her father's place! Amélie sets out to make those stories a little more enjoyable for the people she meets, which, in turn, creates her own story. This is something that people tend to forget, as our world is typically self-consumed.<br/><br/>I would most definitely recommend Amélie. It is a film people in their late teens or twenties would enjoy. I feel this way because, although it comes across as an almost independent romantic comedy, it has so much more depth than that. It challenges its audience to dig deeper both in thinking about the movie itself and the audience's own lives. Another reason I really enjoyed the film was that the director and characters possessed an ability to draw the viewers in, to not let them be bored with the movie, even though there was not much action."
"dwpollar","7","0","1","11 October 2014"," Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl...
","1st watched 10/11/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir=Jean-Pierre Jeunet): Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl named Amelie, played by Audrey Toutou, who attempts to turn her dreamlike life into reality through following a path of doing good deeds after finding a young boy's memory box behind a wall in her room. Her good deeds start happening after she delivers the memory box to the grown-up person --- who then pursues his ignored daughter and grandson. The complexity of this story and it's characters are actually too much to discuss in this short review – but I'll do my best. Her adventures start as a young child who loses her mother and is left with a father who does not relate to people, and therefore keeps her locked up as well until she is able to move away. She then tries to pursue life and love despite her faults and this movie portrays this journey. She works as a waitress in a local bar and is helped in this journey by an elderly painter who lives in her building. A mishmash of characters are introduced telling us their likes and dislikes showing us the director has a backstory for everyone of them. The one that Amelie eventually pursues is a man who has supposedly had the opposite experience in life by having too many people in it. He keeps a scrapbook of folks who take pictures in airport picture kiosk's and is obsessed with this. Her positive approach to branching out also benefits her in a personal way as she changes herself also -- before the end of the movie. This is more of a light comedy than a deep serious piece, but there is definitely meaning behind it the film. The dreamlike approach taken by the filmmaker makes it so you never know what's going to happen next and this is part of the joy in the film. This is a definite gem that should be treasured by moviegoer's throughout the world and hopefully opens the world up to this kind of cinema."

","Amélie, a cute, french, story about a shy, introverted girl who goes on a a life changing journey to help people and along way find love. This is my first french film so i am a little shocked by some parts of this film . Like when (spoiler alert) she dressed up in disguises because she was afraid to meet the man see loved. This to me was very weird and unrealistic to me. But i did love the funny moment like the part where she pulled a prank on the food stand owners. It funny and interesting to see how creative she get with it. But my favorite parts are the ending moments, like when the ""glass man"" leaves Amélie that message, and when she opens the door to go after the man, he already there about to knock on her door again. But my absolute favorite part is the very end when Amélie her now lover go on the bike ride. Liked how the picture shock as the seen went on. It was different and added in a strange way to the tender moments between the newly lovers. All in all, really enjoyed these movie! Two thumbs up!"

","The French are indeed strange. Amelie is about a girl who grew up emotionally disconnected from her parents and consequently lived in a private fantasy world. Alone in Paris, she works at a waitress at a cafe beneath the two windmills in Montmatre and basically keeps to herself. But things change with the death of Princess Di over in England - she discovers a box of old toys behind a tile in her apartment, hidden years ago by a former occupant. She tracks him down and surreptitiously returns it to him. Seeing the joy that it brings him, Amelie decides to intervene in people's lives in small, quirky ways. But given her introverted nature, she always does so in a way that allows her to remain behind the scenes. Until she falls in love that is.<br/><br/>Although I found Amelie weird and am nothing like her, I believe that people like her exist and I felt that I could understand her better as the film progressed. I didn't exactly like her character but she has a certain quirky charm and a dark sense of humour that I can appreciate. Given how things can go wrong so easily, her numerous successful interventions were perhaps slightly stretching belief, but this is something you only think about after the movie. <br/><br/>While I found the movie thoroughly strange (in terms of portraying city life and characters of a type that I have never heard of or experienced), I could appreciate it and I think most people will too. I really liked the mutual fascination of Amelie and the photobooth guy, and the suspense surrounding each of their encounters. While I don't quite buy into the idea of love at first sight, fascination at first sight is always appealing. I was annoyed by the ending though. But maybe that's French culture for you."

","Amélie is a playful, whimsical film, very quirky. Maybe a little too quirky for its own good. It has acquired a reputation as being among the most charming and inspiring films ever. That is overselling things quite a bit. Yes, the movie has its charms. It will probably leave you with a smile on your face. But the truth is it's just a cute little film, a pleasant diversion but really nothing more than that. Audrey Tautou does an excellent job in portraying the title character, it's easy to fall in love with Amélie Poulain. But this young woman will frustrate you too. She sets out to do good, to bring happiness to others. That's nice. But she goes about it in such a roundabout way, nothing is ever straightforward. At times you really do wish the character, and the film, would just get on with it. Amélie doing things in her own very unique way is what gives the film much of its charm. But there comes a point where it's all a bit much.<br/><br/>Amélie Poulain had a very sheltered childhood, she had no friends and unsurprisingly that has made her into a very socially awkward woman. She finds a man she might be interested in but is way too frightened to even introduce herself to him. Instead she concocts an elaborate scheme to make a tenuous connection with him. If there is one thing Amélie is good at it's concocting elaborate schemes. But will she ever overcome her fears and embrace the possibilities of love? Who knows? In the meantime she'll help others, spreading happiness the way only she can. The whole thing is very sweet, to the point the film almost drowns in sweetness. Tautou charms you all the way through but, charming though she is, she can't prevent the film from getting bogged down a bit. As Amélie's schemes play themselves out you get the sense the film is going in circles, not moving forward. It is a film of great imagination but imagination can only carry a film so far. There's not quite enough substance to pay off all the imagination. It all adds up to a reasonably entertaining, charming film. Not one of the most charming films ever, certainly not one of the most inspiring. But a film that should leave you feeling at the very least happy that you've seen it."

I loved the way that it's very artistic which makes it fun to follow. But as it goes on, it may also feel redundant at times. <br/><br/>You fall in love with the efforts made but in the end I felt uncanny. I like the story especially the small arcs in between. You'll enjoy Amelie's journey and laugh and smile along with her. But by the third to the end I felt that it lacked the stuffing needed for a good roast. Of course you will root for the romance because they are adorable, but the parley between the two will later on feel strange and overall just average. <br/><br/>I liked the movie especially the beginning sequence.

Every part of it was a lovely heart-warming portrayal of France and was a complete delight to watch. Amelie's character and personality was so cheerful and uplifting and another aspect of the film which really draws you in is just the plain fact that it is in French with English subtitles - I feel it really draws you in to pay more attention and French is such a beautiful flowing language it fits perfectly with the optimistic mood of the film.

After the beginning, it started to falter, and the movie didn't seem like it knew what it wanted to be. There was no real clear plot, so at times Amelie felt a bit pointless. Also, the actress who played Amelie was a bit creepy.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very well done. The color scheme was unique and made the movie stand out.<br/><br/>A bit of comedy here, a bit of romance here, some mystery over there.

","From the first blazing shots of Amélie, I knew that I was in for a two hour visual delight. As the film begins to tell its story, I realized I was in for a narrative delight as well. Add the delightful facial expressions from Audrey Tautou and you'll be scrambling for a synonym, but not finding one that quite sums up the film as well as delightful.<br/><br/>The popping feature of Amélie that makes it such an enjoyable experience is in which the manner it's told. Exaggerating the quirks of each character it introduces, Amélie expresses that everyone has weird things about their personality that make them their own distinct person. This allows the movie to be quite funny and slowly tug the audience in its corner.<br/><br/>Amélie has a lot to tell the audience, a lot to show us, and a lot of magic to create. It almost acts as a French fairy tale with the different visual techniques it uses to bring out intense emotions of the characters, or the precise camera angles. Amélie is about communication and affection. Amélie has been lacking affection since her childhood, therefore she lacks the communication skills to interact with anyone socially.<br/><br/>Though it may not be an accurate depiction of every day French life, Amélie passes by fast and whether it's your brain, eyes, or heart talking, you love each minute. Amélie undergoes some inconsistent tonal changes in Act Two, which temporarily separated me from the world I got to be apart of. Nevertheless, creativity bursting through France's café shops, Amélie respectable and fun!<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","The movie ""Amelie,"" was the first foreign film I have ever watched. 3 years ago, my friend and I were having a sleep over and she had rented the movie for us to watch. I didn't think I would enjoy it at all because it was a foreign French film, but after watching it I definitely had a change of heart.<br/><br/>In the movie, Amelie works as a waitress in a small pub and lives on her own in Paris. She is a very lovable character. Her personality is of a caring, helpful, intelligent, naive young woman. Her journey starts in her own bathroom when she finds a box of old sentimental items in her floorboard from before she lived in her apartment. Upon finding the box, she decides she will find the person who owned the box and return it to them. This begins her story and goal to do good deeds for the people she meets and talks to along the way, while accidentally falling in love.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked a lot about this movie. First of all, I enjoyed the storyline and how as the watcher you watch Amelie's character grow-up and watch her become braver and more daring. Watching her grow and change from being a simple/shy girl in the same routine of life into a lady who fights for what she wants is very inspirational to me. It is especially inspirational if you yourself feels as though you can relate to her character. I know I could.<br/><br/>Another aspect that I enjoyed during the movie was how the narrator of the movie would tell you small details about each character that Amelie knew or met while she roamed Paris. Usually in the movies I have watched, the characters likes or dislikes aren't of much importance. In ""Amelie,"" I felt like I could connect with every character as if I met them myself.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me was watching Amelie fall in love. The steps she took for Niro to notice her are unbelievably funny and cute. Amelie is scared to talk to him, so she plans a way for him to follow after her. Throughout the whole movie you are rooting for her to be brave and say something to Niro, but Amelie fears consume her. The ending is the best part.<br/><br/>I also love watching Amelie run around in the movie because you get to see so much of the city of Paris. I've only been to Canada, but one day I hope to travel to London or Paris to experience the people, food, and culture differences.<br/><br/>Although I liked the majority of the movie, the most difficult part for me to understand/read were the subtitles. Due to the fact that the movie is in French, the speech moves so much faster and is hard to keep up with. However, that was the only problem I had with the film.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this film to anyone of any age. It is humorous and quirky in all the right ways. It will capture your heart and you won't regret it."

","I watched Amélie with English subtitles, since I do not speak French. If I can connect and understand a movie so well, even when the dialogue spoken is in a different language, then that is the mark of true genius.<br/><br/>Although this is a foreign film, it didn't feel awkward or messy, like some other foreign films I've seen. Instead, it played out well with a moving soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. The shots of Paris were breathtaking, and the acting was very well done. Love was in the air in this film, with some very funny and erotic scenes entailing. The dialogue, although in French, was still very well-spoken and had a sharp wit to it. I don't want to give more away if I don't have to, so I'll just say don't take your kids to this film until they're at least 16 or so ;-)<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 9.3/10"
"rachelandfilms","9","0","1","26 June 2013"," Wonderful and charming - pure perfection in film form...
","The actual story is a simple one in the plain light of day, yet it is told in such a fabulous and complex way that you get caught up in the many narratives that evolve from Amélie's tale. Amélie is a quiet girl living a life of seclusion in her one bedroom flat with a bunch of neighbours whose lives she finds herself entangled in rather unwittingly. It is because of this that many of our charming subplots are borne and as Amélie endeavours to improve these lives and the lives of her co-workers she finds herself caught up in a romantic journey which will have you believing in true love. I would defy even the biggest cynic to come away from this movie without that fluttery little feeling making itself known in your stomach. Don't get me wrong though, this film doesn't portray love as something utterly perfect. There is no naiveté in the narrative, though there might be some in its main character played by the almost-too-perfect-to-be-real Audrey Tatou. <br/><br/>As the story plays out we learn about our characters through an uninvolved thirty-party narrator, who introduces each character with personal details along with their likes and dislikes. This narrative construct is not only hugely distinctive but also helps to endear us to each character and is an apt way of knitting together various subplots which each add an element to this story that leads to its charming conclusion and feels like a necessary lesson in life. What these lessons might be is up to the individual, though I think taking advantage of life is a theme inherent in this quirky film. <br/><br/>Aside from its unique narrative form Amélie also boasts quite a distinctive visual quality, which is perhaps a product of the narrative. Warm colours and vibrant backgrounds adorn this films setting and elevate the atmosphere to parallel its charming protagonist. The films aesthetic style has a timelessness about it reminiscent of the old- black-and-white-classics that remind you of grandparents who bemoan modern cinema and talk about the good ol' days ""back when movies were good and proper!"". I can't quite explain why I would make that analogy but it seems to fit with what I thought of the films visual quality from that gorgeous bob that Tatou sports to the understated glamour of her simple apartment and belongings. Something about this film just screams ""classic"", and I'm not just saying that due to hindsight. I swear! <br/><br/>If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this delightful film then pop on over to this website... (http://filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/amelie.html)"

Amelie used to be an unsocial girl,influenced from the impractical behavior of her father and immature death of her mother.She was left alone,taught and grown up in home..As she grows up she finds her life hectic and remains silent almost all the time,but loves the small things.She is lonely yet has her own type of artistic life,likes to play with stones,love to watch the flowing river . Apparently as the day passes by she discovers a small box filled with childhood memories of an anonymous.She then decides to give to the man belonging to it and watch his reaction,in a mean time she also starts feeling the need of love in her life.The reaction of the man changes her life.She transfers herself into a happy girl and FINDS HERSELF HAPPIER WHEN SHE HELPS AND JUSTIFIES,THE LIVES OF OTHERS.She is in fact a lullaby loving girl,believing in angels and dreams and often gets lost in her own dreams. Ultimately she too finds love of her life. Though the movie moves a bit slowly,it is completely justifiable to the marvelous direction.Director catches every small things in a very simple yet catchy way.We can clearly understand the lifestyle of every characters in the movie. As a whole i just say that it is a must watch movie of all times that says every little art in a life gives you satisfaction and life is to live for satisfaction."

","Having watched Barfi recently, it was hard to not see the similarities between the two movies in the way the soundtrack has been used and the depiction of some serious incidents in a lighter way. It was one of those sweet movies where you don't want anything bad to happen to the protagonist because he/she means no harm. It is essentially a movie about an introverted girl who is unlike others her same age. Set on the path to do good for others, she goes about fixing problems around her and in the process meets someone like her. The whole cat and mouse game between Amelie and Nino was very enjoyable. It got me thinking about how people are identified by their peculiarities and oddities more than what they do for a living or are like usually. It is a sugar coated story with a very adorable protagonist that one cannot dislike even if he/she tries to. Usually such movies don't resonate that strongly with me and I put them in the category of ""Cute and sweet"" without giving much thought to them. It is a tough world out there and that is why I find it tough to just flow with the impractical romanticism associated with such movies. There are just so many insecurities that manifest themselves in the real world in our thoughts, which is why the only such movies that I probably enjoy are the ones with loads of dialogue, like Woody Allen's, in which a neurotic protagonist ensures that all his insecurities are out there. How I would love to forget all issues that plague me and enjoy a love story vicariously but it's just not possible to do so without feeling rather sad and lonesome at the end of it. But then, I look hopefully towards the near future. Hopefully, next time I watch this movie, I will approve of the sugar coated texture of it. Right now, the purity and naivety of the characters was something I could not appreciate wholeheartedly. Great soundtrack."
"smith509-548-666167","6","0","2","6 December 2012"," Amelia Review
","***WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Amelie was a film that truly captured the beautiful scenery in Paris, France. The emotions expressed by the characters were fun to watch and there were a few comedic scenes to grab your attention. What I wished the film had done differently however, was the way they made the film look almost too imaginary rather than a real life perspective. There were two important ideas expressed in the film that I thought were great: the first was how the film made you reflect on life and see what really is important, and to make the most out of the time given to us. The second was that no matter what type of situation we may be in, or how far away we may feel from the rest of the world, there is always something to explore and change about ourselves. The first idea is seen when Amelie helps a blind man cross the road. While walking, she continues to explain to him everything she sees on the street; from a child laughing at a dog, to what kinds of food were being sold in the shop windows, while never telling the old man her name. This was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. It proved that no matter how little the gesture you do for someone is, like simply helping someone cross the road, that little bit goes a long way. Others will appreciate the help, and you will feel better about your own self. <br/><br/>French director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, has been known for his focus on romance and his extensive use of color and imagination, which he has truly portrayed in this film. I think his decision to cast Audrey Tautou, as the role of Amelie Poulain, was an excellent choice because she knew how to capture the audience right away. <br/><br/>What I thought was particularly French in the movie was the music. It was not like most of the music we hear in most American films. I think the French use more of an orchestra for their soundtracks and keep it classic, rather than in America where we create music through our technology."

Happily,once the narration has been put on mute,the writer's allow Amelie's enticing world to entwine the viewing.Smartly making the characters eccentric,but never knowingly ""kooky"" ,the writer's show Amelie break away from the sheltered life that Poulain has had since she was a child,as Amelie takes her resolution to heart of: ""bringing happiness to others"",which leads to Amelie meeting tremendously distinct individuals such as a man who collects discarded photos from a photo booth,an artist with brittle bones who does repaints of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Luncheon of the Boat Party,and a costumer,who always sits at Poulain's place of work, ( Café Des 2 Moulins) with a tape recorder.which he openly uses to loudly record his announce with a co-worker of Amelie's,who also used to be his lover.Painting the film in bold green,yellow and orange colours,director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brilliantly uses the colours to show the organic way that Amelie's friendships progresses,going from Poulain finding the box in a ""sun-lit"" yellow room,to meeting her unlikely love in a passionate,fully blossoming red room. Along with his excellent eye for colour,Jeunet also gives the film an enchanting fantasy atmosphere by having the camera move at a dazzling pace,as Amelie searches round Paris,to give the now fully grown boy,his long lost box of delights."

A childhood filled with neglect from her father because of her heart condition led to a lack of social interaction. After her mother passes away she moves to central Paris and starts work as a waitress. A new adventure arises in her life when she discovers a hidden treasure in her apartment. She is compelled to return the treasure to the rightful owner and decides that if the owner is filled with joy then she will continue out doing good deeds. Along the way of her journey she frequently passes by Nino Quincampoix and realizes she is in love. At this point she makes it a point to find a way to interact with him without ever talking to him. I feel that the main idea of this movie was to get a person to understand that love can be found anywhere whether you understand it or not. To not give up and to continue to pursue what makes you happy is the only important thing in life. This is shown throughout some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet other films. Films such as The City of Lost Children (1995), A Very Long Engagement (2005), and Delicatessen (1991). When an important item is lost that belongs to you many people search high and low for that important item. Love, a significant other, and passion are all worth looking for. This is shown throughout these movies in a very interesting and captivating way. A few of the different techniques were used in Amelie to make this movie a one of a kind. The different special effects that director Jeunet used helped to make the film feel more alive and awake. When Amelie helped out Dominique Bretodeau restore his childhood memories her heart lite up and the scene showed the large amount of energy glowing off her heart. I thought this was an awesome way to portray the happiness it brought Amelie. Throughout the entire movie the director added different scenes of different characters imagination. When Amelie was young and alone she would play doctor by herself and it would show you the creature she was playing with. There was also the time when Mr. Bretodeau was looking at one of his pictures and the four images started to talk to him as if it was real. Love is an essential part of life and without it a person will wilt away like a waterless flower. Make new connections and friends for this will give you longevity and a life filled with happiness."

","Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain (The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain) Release Date: 2001 By Sherry Neavear December 5, 2010 Amélie is a French film about an introverted young woman who overcomes some of her fears to take a risk at finding true romance. Audrey Tautou does a wonderful job portraying the young woman, Amélie. The pace of this film is fast, short and choppy scenes. The use of voice-over narration was a must and it blended well due to the lack of dialog in a majority of the scenes. The use of colors was used most effectively to evoke mood and emotion throughout the film. The colors were vivid, never muted, because nothing in Amélie's life was muted. Amélie is surrounded by dysfunctional people from birth. Her parents played by Rufus and Lorella Cravotta, were not the sensitive parents that small children thrive on. There are no scenes where either parent holds or hugs the child. Amélie is only six when her mother died in a freak accident. After the mother's death, the father withdraws even more and Amélie becomes even more introverted. The father, who was a retired army doctor, misdiagnosed his five year old daughter as having a heart defect. He declared her to be unfit for public school. She was left to amuse herself, which she does quite well because she had a vivid and wild imagination, which she carries into her adult life. In her early adult years, Amélie does move out of her father's house, moves into an apartment, and holds down a job, but somehow she finds herself surrounded by dysfunctional people everywhere she goes. Amélie befriends an elderly neighbor, Mr. Dyfayel play by Serge Merlin, who is known as the ""Glass Man"". Supposedly he has bones that are brittle as glass. Whenever Amélie is with Mr. Dyfayel the pace slows and they actually have meaningful conversations. He is very intuitive and tries to draw her out of her shell. I'd like to think that he was the father figure she never had. In the meantime, Amélie becomes intrigued with a young man, Nino played by Mathieu Kassovitz, who is collecting certain torn up photos that are found near photo booths in the train stations. It was love at first sight for her. She thinks of very clever and imaginative ways in which to have encounters with him; however, she avoids direct contact with him. It isn't until Mr. Dyfayel helps Amélie realize that if she does not take a risk, she will not find the happiness that she seeks. I recommend viewing the film at least three times before making a decision as to whether or not you like it. Each viewing will bring to light more details about just how wild Amélie's imagination can be."

The photography is outstanding, is so happy, and they don't have to say anything to make us feel good.<br/><br/>The plot is also very nice. To watch Amelie's plans and tricks is incredibly entertaining and funny. You don't really have to care about the message, although i'ts good, the movie just makes you fell happy, and if in ""American Beauty"" they tell us there's is so much beauty in the world, in ""Amelie"" they throw this beauty at us (like in the beginning where we see what different persons like to do, like throwing stones at the lake) The acting is also fantastic, all the character are charismatic and three-dimensional. Audrey Tautou deserves highlight, she's so happy but when she has to be emotional (like when she sees that the cat is making the noise, instead of Nino) <br/><br/>Verdict: This stylish, well acted, well directed foreign film shouldn't, by any reason, be missed."

Amelie is just one of those movies, that make you happy to be alive, make you love life. I consider Amelie the French ""Big Fish"". While different in many things,they do shine in capturing that sparkle that makes life beautiful. Love, beauty, people, whatever it may be,you can find it everywhere.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a terrific job with this movie. It's a masterpiece. Every scene,the music, the colors,it's the embodiment of life on film. Amelie is such an intriguing character, it makes you fall in love with her immediately. While her fabulous destiny may seem far from it to the ordinary mind,the mind that is trapped in the everyday rutine, that fails to see the beauty around us every moment of our life, it is a fabulous destiny nonetheless. It's all in perception and Amelie doesn't lack it. She transcends over the egotistical rutine of our lives and sees mystery in people most will consider dull,or with a few screws loose. Amelie is to me the life force waiting and lurking inside us,waiting to burst out. If one thing we can learn from this movie,it's to enjoy and live life,to open our eyes and see the world around us."

It was a magical experience that leaves the audience feel lighter, even if Amelie may seem like a bit of a stalker but that is forgotten cause of the film's charm and since the lead actress doesn't appear to be a psycho.

Amelie is a single woman, innocent and seemingly vulnerable, but she has her own curious sense of morality and embarks on a crusade to put other peoples lives to rights. From a bullied employee to a pair of lovesick friends, she sets the balance of their lives straight and, at the same time, comes to understand herself more completely.

","Every guy I know is secretly in love with this film, or more particularly with the character Audrey Tautou plays. I can certainly see why, and the same part of me that says ""get on the plane Bogart, what are you waiting for"", also secretly loves watching the (very small, I hasten to add) part of me that is Amelie.<br/><br/>But now that I've seen the film several times over the course of several years, maybe the magical realism is wearing thin, or maybe the tired cynicism of real-life romance makes the whole thing a bit implausible. By the end of the film the character starts seeming a tiny bit shallow, and I think if I was actually friends with the girl in real life I'd feel both constantly guilty and irritated at her inability to maintain a conversation. The characters are quirky in the same way that everyone in Paris is to some extent quirky, and all credit to the film maker for capturing that elusive quality, but at times it seems as if they are simply slotting into very established stereotypes of Parisian life which I'm not sure he really manages to animate - particularly the bistro scenes grated for me.<br/><br/>Since I spent six months being chatted up in exactly the same ""quirky"" way by 5 different guys a day (""vous avez les yeux d'une faune, vous me faites rever d'une autre vie"", yeah whatever dreamlover, long as you stop following me), maybe I'm biased and find it impossible to see past the dark side of all that terribly respectful flirting.<br/><br/>Still, the scenes where she helps the greengrocer's assistant are both very funny and very touching. <br/><br/>Overall, if you want some very stylised escapist romance with lots of whimsical wackiness thrown in, it'll do you fine.

"galileo3","5","0","4","13 July 2008"," An unorthodox, lovely little French film...
","Amelie (2001)<br/><br/>After hearing wide acclaim for Amelie I finally came across seeing this strange yet passionate film. My verdict: mixed. Why? I was not captivated, not interested enough, not impressed enough by the film's unconventional cinematic techniques and to be brutally honest I thought it dragged on a bit when we did really know its outcome. For me there just wasn't enough there to hail the film a masterpiece or whatever else. You may argue that it is a simple film? Perhaps, but still it's not that interesting.<br/><br/>It seems to me that whenever someone does something strange, like playing the film from end to beginning (Memento), weaving three stories in non-chronological order (Pulp Fiction) or wondering on about strange, pointless things for 2 hours we always praise such films, never stopping and thinking. One second, maybe I just watched some bullshit for 2 hours and not a masterpiece? Undeniably unorthodox films do sometimes work (Pulp Fiction) but the majority of the times they do fail...<br/><br/>However praise must go to the technical aspects of the film: cinematography, sound, editing, stage design and the screenplay which in many respects is very good but most importantly to the lovely and cute Audrey Tautou for creating a weird yet wonderfully colourful character. This film may have been a total disaster without an appropriate lead actress.<br/><br/>Modestly interesting, never groundbreaking.<br/><br/>5/10"
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","2","12 May 2008"," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","Having spent the best part of the nineties making dark, dank, visual nightmares, French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet began the new millennium with a film so seemingly light-hearted and sweat natured that it managed to captivate many viewers who would not normally appreciate a French-language film. Others however have found it somewhat alienating, with a small fraction seeming highly critical of the unashamed romanticism and moments of fantastical abstraction. However, to view Amelie (2001) as a simple frothy farce - a modern day fairy-story with a contemporary edge - is missing the point somewhat; neglecting the darker moments of the narrative and the prevailing feeling of alienation and melancholy that punctuates many of the more rose-tinted scenes.<br/><br/>If we question the use of style here, it becomes apparent that there are two singular interpretations that you can take in enjoying this film. The first is the most simple and immediate; the idea of an abstract fantasy, that envelopes the characters and presents the power of true love and imagination in all its colourful glory. The second interpretation is somewhat more difficult; the idea that the more imaginative elements are symptomatic of the loneliness and intense sadness felt by the central character as she attempts to navigate herself through life. By extension, the way we approach the film depends very much on the way we approach the central character, whose attempts at goodwill and the process of shaping the course of life to suit her own thoughts and feelings will either seem charming and playful, or obsessive and unhinged. When I first saw the film I took it at face value; I suppose, largely as a result of how different it was to the films that Jeunet had previously made with Marc Caro. However, after half a decade of watching and re-watching, it becomes incredibly clear that Amelie is a darker film than many would care to admit; one that features suicide, illness, the death of Princess Diana, loneliness, ennui, obsession and a brief depiction of the sex industry, distorted and abstracted by an incredibly child-like perspective.<br/><br/>You don't have to see it on such a level - with the immediate interpretation being just as much fun - but you can't help but think that the scene in which Amelie sits on the roof of her building and fantasises about the sexual-climaxes of almost every single couple in Paris is somewhat uncomfortable, especially since the character is supposedly twenty-two, and not fifteen! Likewise, the central character sees her own mother commit suicide, another character is bullied as a child, and then, of course, we have that other central character whose disability has made it impossible for him to leave the house for the vast majority of his adult life. For me, the film was more of a tear-jerker than something that made me leave the theatre with a warm smile on my face; with the melancholic music of Yann Tiersen - with its accordions, horns, strings and toy-pianos - perfectly capturing the essence of this character trapped between childhood and adult life, and left alienated as a result.<br/><br/>Even though everything in the film works out, to some extent, with the character ultimately achieving her goal, that final chord of the music and that odd glance to the camera seems pregnant with all kind of ideas of sadness and disappointment. Not disappointment in the situation, but disappointment in the inevitable realisation that life is never at a single constant; it has ups and downs with one fleeting moment of perfect joy often followed by the same kind of sadness and hurt that is all too familiar. As I said, this interpretation is merely personal. It doesn't take away from the experience that Amelie presents and the fantastic world that Jeunet is able to create. However, for me, this world works best as a piece of subjective abstraction. Obviously, those of us that have spent time in France know that their major cities look nothing like the one depicted here, and are in fact, closer to something like Pola X (1999) or In Praise of Love (2001). With this in mind, Amelie reminded me of Jean Luc Godard's first masterpiece Une femme est une femme (1961), with the colourful use of mise-en-scene, costumes and production design - not to mention the subtle juxtaposition of iconography and genre references - all creating a mood and a tone that works towards disguising the more sad and tragic elements of both the character and the film.<br/><br/>Regardless of how you choose to interpret the character, the central performance from Audrey Tautou is exceptionally rendered and very much advantageous to the success of the film and the mood that it instils us with. Her movements, rhythms and expressions are as bold and as colourful as the direction of Jeunet, and yet, even here we see a sense of tragedy, cynicism and disappointment that mirrors that of the actual story. Nonetheless, the film is a definite must see work, if not for the bold and intelligent direction of Jeunet then for the fine performances from the likes of Dominique Pinon, Jamel Debbouze, Isabelle Nanty, Serge Merlin, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, the gnome, etc. Whichever interpretation you choose to follow with Amelie, there is no denying that the film is continually interesting, quirky and imaginative, and proves beyond all else that there is still intelligence and individuality present in contemporary film."

","It is not that I don't like 'Amelie' and don't appreciate its charm and whimsy - I am yet to see the streets of Montmartre, Paris as magic as in the movie, and I've been to Paris and found it the most beautiful place in the world. It is that I don't find it fabulous, amazing, and original enough to grant its status of one of the greatest movies ever made according the multiple top lists. One of the IMDb reviewers described ""Amelie"" the best: ""sweet, sweet, sweet"" - and that triple sweetness was a bit too much for my taste, I guess. I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent.

She becomes the good fairy, hiding in the shadows as others dance for joy at a new lover, a lost loved one found, and a look at the world outside.<br/><br/>The movie is done in French with English subtitles. It was refreshing to watch this story about someone who simply longs to bring good to the world. Whenever one of her ""victims"" brims with happiness, Amelie's shy smile brightens up her face.

You want to jump on Amelie's shoulder and ride around with her on one of her adventures. This was a must-see movie for cinema lovers.

","Amelie or Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain (2001): Audrey Tatou, Rufus, Mathieu Kassovitz, Lorella Cravotta, Clotilde Mollet, Jame Debbouze, Isabelle Nanty, Claire Maurier, Urbain Cancelier, Maurice Benichou, Dominique Pinon, Michel Robin, Armelle, Flora Guiet, Claude Perron, Andre Dussollier, Fabienne Chaudat, Dominique Bettenfeld, Jacques Viala, Sophie Tellier, Gerald Weingand, Paul Dare, Valeriane De Villaneuve, Isis Peyrade, Raymonde Heudeline, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Jacques Thebault....Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Screenplay Guillaume Laurant.<br/><br/>When French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie was released in April of 2001 in the States, it became very popular, eventually becoming a lot like an instant foreign film classic. Even today, college French classes view this film to expose themselves to modern French culture. In truth, this film does hold up a mirror to city life in Paris, but it's not to be taken as absolute truth, especially because this film is straight out of a surrealist painting or a literary novel of meta-fiction/magic realism. Everything that happens to Amelie, to Amelie's social circle - her employer at the Cafe Deux Moulins, her co-workers, her boyfriend, her parents, her acquaintances - are ""magical"" incidents that seem to follow a pattern or ripple effect of good deeds/good kharma, or bad deeds/bad kharma. Amelie tells the story of a young, lonely French girl in the working-class Montmartre district of Paris. Her parents are bizarre and strangely detached from one another, from their daughter and from reality. Amelie, too, has inherited these qualities and she is a total free spirit, a pixie, frolicking from one end of Paris to another in search of pleasures and the chance to do a good deed. This humanitarian streak seems to come from her admiration of such figures as Princess Di, who in 2001 had been dead only about four years (she died in Paris in a car crash) and Mother Teresa who died around the same time. She discovers an diminutive small chest with photos of a young man who lived in her apartment in the 1950's. She sets out to find that man and return his photos. This is the beginning of a series of good deeds Amelie performs. Audrey Tatou is terrific in the role, but for the most part she is not really acting. Much of the character of Amelie is mute and silent, like she's either a silent film star or a weird sort of Parisian doll or mime. It was this role, however, that launched Audrey Tatou's career. Criticss and film lovers fell in love with her and even dubbed her the new Audrey Hepburn, and it's interesting to note how much she resembles the late Audrey Hepburn in physique and appearance. This comparison to Hebpurn is augmented by the final scene which finds Amelie and her new love riding on a motorcycle in Paris, surprisingly similar to the Vespa ride scene in ""Roman Holiday"". Recently, Ms. Tatou appeared opposite Tom Hanks in ""The Da Vinci Code"", yet again set in Paris. So here's the bottom line. This is a lovely, highly engaging film but it's a film that one can only enjoy as an acquired taste. To those who haven never seen a foreign film and have only watched American movies, watching Amelie as their first foreign film will be a bizarre and boring experience. The film exceeds the standard 2-hour length of most films and is hard to follow because so much is going on at once. Often, the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred in this film. This can be confusing and frustrating to some viewers. But even so, this film is great for various reasons. There is as much reality in this film as there is fantasy. The French denizens of the city work in amusement parks, cafes, clothing stores, book shops, etc much like in any other city, have psychological issues, have sex, use public phones with telecards like in real life, and behave like real people. But the magic is subtle and effects their lives, toys come to life, blind men are able to see, champagne glasses dance on their own, etc. A real winner is the lovely, authentically Parisian music - mostly accordion - by Yann Tiersen, and the outstanding, vibrant color cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel as well as the equally gorgeous art direction by Volker Schafer. It is a Paris with wonders to be found everywhere, a magical Paris straight out of an illustrated children's book. So, even if the film is weird and long, make Amelie one the foreign films you just have to see. Keep in mind that this film is rated R and the much of the material is strictly for adults, namely the nudity and sexuality depicted in a few scenes.

","This film is really a wonderful feel good movie. It is stylishly done and the message is one of happiness. In a world where there seems to be no do gooders and only people worrying about their own personal lives it is very meaningful to fallow the story of a young women who only wants to help others, and through that find love and better her life. I hope everyone has a chance to see this movie, if only to be touched by its content. This is one of my favorite movies right down to its Yan Tierssen sound track. Amelie is a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone and anyone who is old enough to take it seriously and the same time appreciate its light- hearted playfulness."

","Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, Le, better known in the USA as Amelie, is a stellar film by French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The story and dialogue itself is very smart, but what really did it for me was the usage of color and composition. This is truly a great lesson in cinematography. The main colors in the film are green, red, yellow, B/W (not technically a color but a lack of), and blue. While green and red are used most (which I think signifies Amelie's moods and her view of her world), yellow is also used frequently (signifying neutrality), with blue only used sporadically (it signifies an important event or object - i.e. Nino's bag). The shot choices which brings these colors to life are also top-notch - you can freeze frame each frame of the movie and it will ALL be fascinating just to stare at. Truly a visual masterpiece - highly recommended, 9 out of 10."

","European filmmakers produce a far more quirky, surprising and artistic vision than Hollywood directors, and this film is a fine example. The odd camera angles and movements, the enhanced colour (everything is bathed in a golden hue) and the focus on tiny character details wouldn't be found in anything coming out of America.<br/><br/>The film bears translation into English subtitles pretty well, with the subtle jokes and throwaway lines still intact (my favourite is the flippant ""If he was touched, she'd become a regular do-gooder. If not, too bad"").<br/><br/>Basically it's a comedy love story about two Parisian oddballs who fall for each other, with numerous subplots involving the other people Amelie meets and works with. It certainly isn't ""Pay It Forwards""; although Amelie changes brings magic to some people's lives, she meticulously plots the downfall of others.<br/><br/>It's almost worth a 10, but there are a few elements of the plot which don't quite seem to resolve - it's not quite clear whether the grocer becomes a reformed character or what the Glass Man's videos are for, and I'd have liked to know more about the failed writer.

","Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain, Le (2001).<br/><br/>Translated as Amelie from Montmartre. Direct translation: The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (well, I'm guessin' here). Actual known title: Amelie...Sheesh.<br/><br/>Set in Paris, the story features the main character Amelie (Audrey Tautou), a rather lonely but sweet and quite imaginative (read: weird) young woman. Through the invisible Narrator's eyes, we follow and silently applaud her as she does one good deed after another (if the receivers deserve it) and, sometimes, exacts her own brand of creative revenge (for herself and other underdogs). But always, she does these in secret. She is contented being some kind of secret modern-day Robin Hood and making others happy until she meets someone and realizes that she, too, needs her own miracle.<br/><br/>I do not exactly know how to categorize this movie. An adventure-mystery-comedy-fantasy-romantic story. Yes, in that order. Or if I may make it more general, it is a feel-good piece of art.<br/><br/>An original story, told in an engaging and different manner, the story takes us to the world of Amelie and the people around her. One does not have time to be bored even for a single second. Wonderful, interesting and very creative story-telling. Wonderful, interesting and very creative cinematography and stunning visuals. Wonderful, interesting and very creative protagonist. Wonderful, interesting and very creative Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>""Wonderful, interesting and very creative."" That sums it all up.

To prove to yourself that this really isn't a chick flick.<br/><br/>Okay, so a lot more girls than guys have seen it. The main character is female. There is romance included in the film's plot. These are not good reasons for gentlemen and masculine women not to see this movie. You won't regret it unless your heart is made of stone.<br/><br/>8. This film is very different from most other French films.<br/><br/>Okay, so I think the Dardenne brothers' ""The Son"" is vivid piece of not-for-pure-entertainment, realistic drama. For those of you who may disagree, you'll probably enjoy this - shall we say - more entertaining film a whole lot more than you did that one.<br/><br/>7. You can most likely identify with Amelie in some way.<br/><br/>Well, technically, we can all relate in some way with any character put to film, but I feel strongly that there is something special and different in Amelie's character that causes her to embody our own longings for love  in the lives of others and in our own lives.<br/><br/>6. To see why it was nominated for so many Oscars.<br/><br/>Five nominations for a foreign film? Practically unheard of.<br/><br/>5. To get angry at the fact that it didn't win any Oscars.<br/><br/>Five unanswered nominations? For such an amazing film? Come on now.<br/><br/>4. Yann Martel's beautiful score.<br/><br/>Martel's score, romantic with a hint of sadness and mingled with joy, gives the film a lot of its beauty.<br/><br/>3. Jeunet's inspired direction coupled with Delbonnel's lush cinematography.<br/><br/>Jeunet's unconventional camera movement and Delbonnel's use of color keep your attention.<br/><br/>2. The irresistibility of Audrey Tautou.<br/><br/>You can't help smiling while watching her performance and your love for Amelie grows because of how she plays the part.<br/><br/>1. The irresistibility of the film itself.<br/><br/>Even if this movie isn't perfect, you can't help thinking so when it's all said and done.<br/><br/>Its IMDb rating is 8.7 is still perhaps a bit high, but the critics' average of 6.9 is much too low. Approximately 8.5 would be the most accurate rating for this film, so maybe Portland Oregonian critic Shawn Levy gave the most truthful review.<br/><br/>At least give this one a try."

","This was a very charming film, it was very funny, right from the very start. Amelie grew up alone, she didn't go to school - due to a misdiagnosed heart defect, and had no friends. Thus she grew up in a fantasy world and has a rather active imagination. One day Amelie finds a box of treasures hidden by a little boy in the wall of her apartment, she decides to return it to him. This results in Amelie realising that her actions can influence people. she sets out setting up love connections, playing tricks on a mean neighbour and ends up falling in love herself. Paris comes off looking like a lovely place to live - though it always does in films, you never see the cruddy parts. It was a colourful wee film , most of the characters are a bit oddball. I really like it a lot; my friend Jeremy went to the movies twice to see it when it first came out.

","A brilliant French romantic comedy set in the 1970s which is very descriptive from start to finish especially with what everyone likes and doesn't like. It is also about a French couple named Amadine and Ralphael Poulain who had a child named ""Amelie"".<br/><br/>The funniest parts of this film were, when their pet goldfish named Blubber felt suicidal due to the home environment. THERE WAS SUCH A DRAMA! It made Amelie at 6 years old scream and it got on her mother's nerves! And another, a rather tragic one was when Amelie and her mother went to the church of Notredame to pray for her mother to have a little boy. And then, when they came out, God decided to send her ""Marguerite"", a tourist from Quebec who jumped off from the top of the church and killed Mrs.Poulain.<br/><br/>Five years later, she left her father and she became a waitress at the Two Windmills and on the 29th of August and 48 hours, she was going to meet someone special who was known as ""The Glass Man"" { Raymond Dufayel]. It was funny when she was interested to know how many people in the block of flats have sex, so she stood on the roof, listened and she said: ""15"". And another, was when Amelie was buying a newspaper and the newspaper woman says [ referring to Princess Diana's death]: ""So sad. A young, pretty princess for once"". And Amelie says: "" It's okay if she's old and ugly"" and then the newspaper woman says: "" Sure, look at Mother Theresa"".<br/><br/>I could remember when the shopkeeper Mr.Collignon was treating his employee Lucien so badly and she went into Collignon's apartment, swopped his slippers with small ones, swopped the toothpaste with foot cream in the bathroom, swopped around the door handles, spiked his Whiskey, messed up his clock and she put a nail through the bedside lamp's wire. Next day, when Collignon returned home. COLLIGNON, BIG MORON, DOWN THE JOHN! There is a message with that, shopkeeper's are very cruel to their employees.<br/><br/>Okay, to end the laughs, I will mention the last two. Amelie phoned up this joint about a Porno ad and she is asked if she is shaved because, they don't believe fur pies can sell.And she slams the phone down. And lastly, in the café, when Georgette and Joseph were having a good time in the toilets, everything began to go with the beats of each hump! BRAVO!!!<br/><br/>Now to end this review of mine, Amelie discovers the man of her dreams in a horror house at a fun fair who was Mr. Quincampoix, and then she sent him a few messages if he would like to meet and then, Mr.Dufayel calls her and told her to open her front door and when she did, there was the man of her dreams, Mr. Quincampoix. Then, they fell in love, spent a night together and the next day, they went off for a ride on a ""Mobylette""- A type of French bike."

","Amelie tells the story of an insecure girl who screws with people for fun. If you're okay with reading a good plenty of subtitles, and want something ""light"" to watch, this one'll help you get through your evening. There is plenty of creative, clever and stylized directing with loads of quick cuts to keep you from getting bored. However, I'll concede that shortening the run time a tid bit might have made this Kool-Aid go down a little smoother. Amelie's character is an interesting and secretive one thankfully, which means we at least get to spend the running time with someone other than a cookie-cutter bore. The ending is especially strong, and the movie in general is realistic and entertaining."
"diand_","8","0","2","1 August 2005"," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
","This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camera-work are key elements to this.<br/><br/>In the second part Amelie lives alone in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of ""Delicatessen"", except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.<br/><br/>Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.<br/><br/>The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like an absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates. The overall story is about those small moments in life where a particular good or bad choice defines your life: The tick of lost opportunity influenced by circumstances (here abstracted to Amélie's influence mainly) and later on your life defined by your memories of it (hence the collection box and the photographs). The element of time is important here: The painter, already commenting Amelie's life story and the story we are watching, filming the clock outside. Photographs in pieces and glued together are used to tell something about lives, Amélie uses the same photographs to find her lover. Overall the movie has an air of nostalgia all over it. It is a highly romantic movie in the proper context of romanticism (one aspect being that products of the popular imagination could equal or even surpass those of the educated; Jeunet being a far more popular and successful filmmaker than the big names of the French nouvelle vague nowadays is a nice parallel here).<br/><br/>Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.<br/><br/>What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd."
"bobbobwhite","9","0","3","19 July 2005"," When the magic works, it is truly magic
","Audrey Tautou is the cutest French actress since the other Audrey(OK, Hepburn was Belgian but spoke French) in Roman Holiday, and stole my heart with every funny look. For me, this French comedy had the most clever, quirky, and interesting human character story since La Cage Aux Folle. It twisted and turned constantly, showing us Amelie's lonely and odd life and the goofy lives of the other characters while charming us at every turn, but it always guided us back to Amelie's diligent and very creative attempts to get the man of her dreams, detailing the ingenious ways she used to finally reel him in to great happiness for both.<br/><br/>The scene direction was incomparable, the story line was wonderfully drawn, and Audrey Tautou has the most sparkling comedic looks and timing since Goldie Hawn. But, one thing stood above even these great attributes.....the cinematography was about the best I have seen in any film. The OZ-like colors, of course done digitally as they were cartoon-like exaggerations, were true art and made the film so much more magical and fantastic than it would have been just using the realistic colors of Paris. Camera angles and movement, shot selection, and lighting also were so creative, and I marveled at them just as I would looking at an old masters painting. It was that good.<br/><br/>French films are generally so humanly clever, and I never tire of watching them for their constant creative genius in showing us quirky ""French"" ways of obliquely seeing people's personal lives and their human foibles perhaps as through a little side window instead of through the big front door, as is usually done by Hollywood. This one was the absolute best I have seen in doing that. Don't miss this charmer."

","Amelie is a beautiful film, if there ever was one. Like its title, Amelie's fabulous life is effortlessly transferred onto a fabulous film. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's visual touches are all evident, but this time he added some heart to it, which has been missing since the brilliant Delicatessen. Audrey Tatou is the epitome of Paris chic, and Kassovitz is brilliant in his near silent role. Paris has rarely been this beautiful, without the tourists and usual romantic cliché sights. The surreal feeling to this film is provided by the brilliant cinematography and, for the cynics, the unrealistic attributes of each character. This feels like a Utopian Paris - no tourists, less people, and irresistibly romantic. Yet, I cannot think of anyone who might resist the temptation that is Amelie. Her life should be an inspiration, not in our daily lives, but in our dreams and fantasies. One thing, though. If only it were longer, so that I could have lost myself further in Amelie's beautiful world. Now, I'm off to pack my bags for Paris!"

The film flows gently from start to finish, never too fast, never too slow, never losing its way, never becoming self-indulgent or melodramatic. It is a simple story of a young girl finding love and along the way (and like an unseen angel) helping others including those who watch this film find their own happiness and contentment. Audrey Tautou is perfect in her role, wide eyed, innocent, whimsical, vulnerable her ability to carry this film along with her performance is amazing. If she was only to ever make one film this would be the one film to make. Watching Ameilie will provide a lift for even the most cynical of hearts, it works for me every time."

I can never watch a film full through unless I am in a movie theater, so I just pick up where I leave off. <br/><br/>Amelie takes place in Montmartre, France. Where Amelie (Audrey Tatou) lives in an interesting apartment with a odd artist neighbor (Serge Merlin) who as they say has ""Bones of Glass"". Amelie works in a restaurant with hypochondriac co-worker Gorgette (Isabelle Nanty), owner Suzanne (Claire Maurier), and waitress Gina (Clotilde Mollet)She also visits her father (Rufus) often. <br/><br/>One day, Amelie finds a tin box from a cut out place in her wall, and she dedicates herself to finding the owner. Finally, she finds the owner (Maurice Bénichou). After seeing the happiness she has caused him to have, she dedicates her life to helping people in the process, and oddly enough eventually falls in love with a young man called Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz).<br/><br/>Now I know I really didn't give a huge summary of the film, but I didn't want to spoil all of it for everone. Audrey Tatou gives her arguably her greatest performance. I love this film, because it is a very sweet film. It loves the good things of live like for instance love. <br/><br/>This movie has to be one of the top twenty love stories of all time in my opinion. It is definitely a feel good film. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great love story. Amelie is not necessarily a ""10"" film, but it is sure close to it. There are some things I didn't like (mostly the use of animation in the film though it was only for like thrity seconds.) However, Amelie is winning film with great performances, and it deserved that Foreign Language film Oscar.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain', it is quite possibly my favorite movie. However, the purpose of my posting is to find an answer. The accordion-sounding music that seems to be the theme of the movie [it plays on the options menu on the DVD]: what is it called? who wrote it? I've heard it in another movie [Goodbye Lenin!-which was also very good]and now must know more about it. The song has such a whimsical sound and suits the movie perfectly. If anyone who sees this is able to give me any information that would be wonderful. Or, if it was posted up on the site that would be even better. There is no soundtrack listing which disappointed me because it would have eliminated the need for me to post this comment [which was quite a process, if I may say so-and this has to be 10 lines long, hence my long-winded rambling]."

It looked like an ordinary romantic comedy, but with a wide-angle lens and cranked up chroma.<br/><br/>I decided to see it anyway.<br/><br/>This is the first ""positive message"" film that didn't make me feel like it was phony sugar-coated BS, trying to pass itself off as a moral by filling the background with violin music and Julia Roberts', or Meg Ryan's, or Sandra Bullock's surgically enhanced faces.<br/><br/>I've never felt so good about life after watching a film.

","From the first moment I knew Amélie wasn't part of the mass. The short description of her childhood in the beginning reminded me of Matilda, but the rest of the movie shows the main character Amélie if not quite mentally adult, at least grown up. She decides to start doing good things to people, inspired by princess Diana, though her means may be a bit strange. There are many side threads but in the latter half of the movie a relationship starts developing between Amélie and a man who collects thrown-away passport photos. There are many funny scenes you just have to see, though towards the end the film turned a bit boring. There were some surprises but mainly the end was predictable. The introduction of characters is what I liked the most. It's definitely done better in any film I've seen before. Backgrounds of Amélie and her parents have been told in lively fashion which makes them feel like real people.<br/><br/>SPOILER alert: Do not read the next sentence if you haven't seen the movie yet since I'd hate to spoil the surprise.<br/><br/>The best moment (weirdly) was when Amélie's mother was killed by a suicidal tourist dropping on her from the top of a cathedral, where they had been praying for God to give Amélie a little brother."

It is just like scenery of a village waking up by the orange sun in the morning. As you see the movie, whose canvas has been painted in red and green, you suddenly realized that everything has turn brighter. It is very interesting though. By using a specific color combination, the director is able to retain the feeling of brightness in viewer eye. You go out of Movie Theater and everything you see is much brighter.

","I've only read the first page of the comments, but I would like to add mine.<br/><br/>Amelie battles against the philosophical introspection way-of-life; living in her mind, in her dreams, rather than living life. This way-of-life is often associated with introverted; however, the movie makes the point that she is not the only type to suffer: people are dominated by their memories, past loves, history, Renoir. <br/><br/>The point of the movie is that living is far greater, mysterious and exciting than dwelling in the confines of our minds. Dreaming of a tango can never compare to dancing the tango.<br/><br/>Amelie in the end triumphs."

","I've seen this movie the first time it came out on DVD. My sister had rented it out of boredom. I wasn't really attracted with the cover and pictures and all. I'm not even into French or French films. But this one I really liked.<br/><br/>It was very weird at first. Maybe because it's too colorful for my taste? The main character Amelie was really weird too. The movie was cynnically funny (some people don't find it funny though). I like the relationship Amelie has with her father. I loved how she tries to help people as much as possible, yet fails to help her own self (which in many cases do happen to most of us). The mystery of the face in the picture was also quite cool to add in the plot.<br/><br/>The main thing I really TOTALLY loved about this film is the ending. I don't like romantic comedies much (ugh!), but this one was VERY, VERY cute and SO sweet. The part where Amelie finally faces her fear of detachment in a way was touching. (You know--- she likes the guy, tries to get him, denies it, yet fails to have him, gives up, but they still end up ""happy together"" anyway)... <br/><br/>It's a HAPPY film!

","I just visited Paris for the first time last year and I saw this movie not long after my return. It brings back the wonderful memories and thoughts I have had about Paris ever since I came back, and it is partly why I am planning a second trip later this fall. <br/><br/>I think Audrey Tautou was marvelous and that it is a sweet, funny, and romantic movie. It isn't often these days that a younger person will take it upon themselves to do something purely to help other people as Amalie did. She is a naive, yet somehow knowing girl - so pretty and sweet and thoughtful. I just love her! And she's good even when she's bad which is hilarious. I've seen this three times and I love it each and every time I see it. <br/><br/>I especially love the part about the ""Roaming Gnome"" that Travelocity has taken as it's own.

","I saw this film for the first time last year. Like most French comedy (including 'Les Visiteurs') it's quirky, and I like it! The plot is very simple and involves a shy French waitress (the Amelie of the title) surreptitiously making those around her happy. The parts I really like are the little nods to previous classic movies, including the part where she takes her revenge on the greengrocer and day-dreams about becoming 'Zorro' and carving a 'Z' on his door. Another interesting part is when she dons a headscarf and sunglasses (a la Audrey Hepburn in 'Charade') and leads Nino on a wild goose chase around Montmatre.

It is a love story but not like anything you have seen before. When I saw it, it made me thing a little about Lost in Translation. Because the girl and the guy in this movie are somewhat of loners and strangers to the city they live in. And they only function 100 percent when they are with each other. During the movie they play sort of a cat and mouse game, mainly because the girl is too scared to make direct contact with the guy. This movie is awesome, cute, funny and memorable.

"AurumStarFinder","9","0","1","14 July 2004"," Still unsure of what to say about this film
","Amelie is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Which is what makes it so extraordinary. <br/><br/>I hate most of the crap which spills out of Hollywood. I really do. For some reason they just can't seem to do anything original these days. Which is disappointing. Especially when it begins to rub off on those few exceptional artists who do manage to create pieces of pure talent. I'm sure that I'm not alone with this view. The best films, the ones which will stand the test of time and change, are the ones which are weird, far from normal, and usually completely take everyone by surprise. Films like the Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather - these films are extremely puzzling and leave you at a point where you're not too sure what to make of it. Or at least, that's where they left me.<br/><br/>Amelie is one of the few comedies that really has left me speechless and wide-eyed. There is something about the depiction of characters who are not normal (hate that word) and yet seem, now, to be real. Yet when you see Amelie, one of the thoughts that will occur to you is not that it felt real. But then I don't believe you could say that it isn't. Human beings are very strange creatures, and these characters are just a few select examples of our bizarre species.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reason why I love this film is because it gives me hope that there are a handful of people who mean well. Most of us don't: we live our lives entirely focused on our own well-beings. We are very selfish and greedy by nature. It feels kind of refreshing to see someone who looking out for her own pleasure by trying to give happiness to others. This is about as altruistic as the human race gets unfortunately and there are few who work in such ways. Which gives me some hope for us all, even if I've got no faith in us.<br/><br/>Or is it simply because it makes my inner child happy? No-one is fully grown up in this film. Amelie turns to her own imagination when life gets boring; Nino seeks to create his own family memories, it would seem; bubblewrap; finger-cracking; after all the years and seasons, that little teddy bear is still sitting in the flowerbed; even the cat likes to listen to children's stories! No-one's complete, which is, I imagine, how a great many of us feel. <br/><br/>So, if you think your inner child needs to be woken up a little, or if you're feeling pessimistic about life on this planet, or if you'd like to see something better than any comedy I've seen come out of Hollywood, follow the blue arrows and bring a five franc coin."

What I don't appreciate is people condemning it because of its high rating. This is a beautiful, heart-warming movie, in a time when all we can think about is slaughtering each other, and having the freedom of speech to not give a sh*t about anyone. Like Marty, while everyone is making epics, or $200 million wastes of time, Amelie tells a simple tale without embarrassment, using all of the director's visual flare, and bringing together a great cast. Audrey Tautou is gorgeous, her smile infectious, and her performance worthy of many awards. Funny, but in an unexpected way, charming, and well told, Amelie fully deserves its reputation. 8 out of 10"

In fact, if there can be said to be a quantifiable purpose to this movie, it is to show the magic hidden of everyday life -- something to which American Beauty aspired and at which it so horribly failed. The difference seems to be that the makers of American Beauty clearly had no idea what beauty *is*, while the makers of Amelie clearly do.<br/><br/>I've tried to write more and just deleted it; anything else I say will not do the movie justice.

"kida_fish","9","0","1","7 April 2004"," SMART ENTERTAINER
","*SLIGHT SPOILERS*<br/><br/>This is a modern-day fairy-tale of a simple city-girl, in a seemingly idyllic backdrop, which actually is ruffled is a lot of ways, due to its rather 'disturbed' characters, whose lives, while this beady-eyed waitress tries to solve, finds herself in a similar situation, where she herself ends up needing some help.<br/><br/>
AMELIE can be considered a story of stories, tied together by just a single link, in the form of a girl called Amelie. Living in her own shell, this girl discovers the Samaritan in her, when she successfully tracks down and gives the previous occupant of her apartment, a box containing objects of his childhood playthings that she accidentally finds in her house, and brings out the tears of joy in his eyes, as he reminisces his days of childhood, watching and feeling the contents of the box. This experience overwhelms her, and she decides that she would now on, do whatever she could, to straighten other people's lives, and herein lies the stories, which make the story of the movie.<br/><br/>
The movie is made up of bits and pieces, showing the rather weird nature of the various people, that Amelie tries to help. The magic of the movie lies in this aspect of how beautifully each character is depicted, with some handicap or the other disturbing their lives, which this lonely but good-willed girl tries to fix. Be it the 'obsessed' neighbor, who is more than happy to read out letters from her deal husband, or the painter, who is so touchy about how names are pronounced, or the bullying vegetable-vendor, always belittling his hapless assistant, or the loveless boyfriend and the loveless hotel-waitresses, or the young man, who sifts for torn photographs of people, and reassembles and sticks them in the album that he maintains of reassembled photos of people he doesn't even know, or even Amelie's own father, who is obsessed with his ceramic gnome, each one of them is so carefully and delicately defined, that it overshadows the ambiguity in the story, which is what it intends to do, in the first place.<br/><br/>
Though the story has a naïve fairy-tale-like feel to it, it actually turns out otherwise, by its messed up characters. Hence, the movie, far from being a sappy and drab tale of feel-good, is actually quite an interesting take on the most unusual and uncanny facets of the human nature. Moreover, the slick cinematography and the music-video like feel of the movie, coupled with the swanky voice-over comments make it not only a visually splendid movie, but also an exciting joyride, with a lot of areas worth pondering on.<br/><br/>AMELIE has a mischievous undertone, with a visually pleasing and amiable exterior. When one sees beyond the pleasing epidermis of the movie, it provides for interesting food for thought, when it comes to analyzing the bizarre characters in it. For its glossy appearance, or for its underlying unapparent starkness, or for its feel-good aura, or just for its wacky imagination, AMELIE is an entertainer with brains and brawns.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

","I went into Amelie with high expectations and was disappointed. I thought it was a good movie. I just didn't find it that amazing. To me it seemed as if it took elements of Love On the Run and Chungking Express but just messed it up. The whole picture thing just reminded me too much of Antoine Doniel and Sabine in Love on the Run and the movie lacked the energy and charm of Chungking Express for me.<br/><br/>I'm going to watch Amelie a third time to see if I get something new out of it.

","Amelie is one of my favorite movies ever. I love the whimsical story, the wonderful characters, great acting, and the overall message. This film also has beautiful cinematography and directing. And the background of Montmartre is simply gorgeous.<br/><br/>Amelie only loses out in two areas: sometimes the effort to convey the eccentricity of the characters seems a bit forced, and the pacing and length of the movie is a little too slow and a little too long. For some, another problem is the number of plot arcs and the many different characters. But for most, the personalities of the characters are interesting enough for one to differentiate between them.<br/><br/>I reccommend Amelie to pretty much anyone, though the message, emotions, situations, and humor of this movie will definitely evade children. Actually, most people under the age of 12 won't like this movie at all. Also, if you are looking for a romantic comedy a la How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days or 50 First Dates...well, Amelie is a lot deeper and more memorable than those kinds of romantic comedies. So if you are looking for quick laughs, do not see this movie, though it can be very funny. **** out of *****."

","This is a delightful romantic fantasy of love and comedy, of vivid color and some preposterous antics of love and friendship that will send mawkish tears down your cheeks while making you laugh out loud. If not, turn in your headset for a heart.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is Amélie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood. She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.<br/><br/>Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.<br/><br/>A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amélie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her. Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.<br/><br/>After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amélie all grown up. She still has no love in her life. But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment. It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile. Amélie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago. In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box. But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem. She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box. So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amélie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.<br/><br/>While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones. In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.<br/><br/>Favorite corny pun: ""Even artichokes have hearts."" Favorite elaborate joke: sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke: the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off. Favorite scheme: reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years. <br/><br/>The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados. There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amélie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.<br/><br/>Bottom line: very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"

","What a delightful, endearing movie this is.  I couldn't believe most of the comments I initially read on this were so negative.  I'm consistently amazed when people dismiss fictional characters as ""unbelievable.""  Where is it written that everything must be rooted in literalism and stick to the tedious confines of abject humanism?   Amelie is a joyous tale where everything is possible if one will only allow oneself to get out of one's own way.  <br/><br/>Visually it's a treat  it's every Parisian fantasy come to life with a score that fairly screams Paris. Director Jeunet captures everything with a deft touch and he is aided by a uniformly excellent cast  most notably in Audrey Tautou who is . . . (sigh) just about perfect.  I love you, Amelie!"

It is refreshing to see something different, a movie where all ends tie together in her microcosm of a world she thinks is so big.  I enjoy watching it with the english subtitles as well, usually something I don't like to do- but the movie is more elegant when spoken in french.  It is definitely worth a watch, because like the paintings in it the film is a work of art.

"mr_walsh","7","0","1","16 January 2004"," Very innovative, but ending somewhat tarnished it.
","(Spoilers, kind of)<br/><br/>I may seem overly conservative, but while I really enjoyed this movie, the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.  Here, we have this delightful, playful main character of Amelie.  But at the very end, her love is expressed by immediately jumping in bed with the person she's been pursuing, with a big smile on her face.  That to me seemed out of character for her.  I mean, this seems to happen more and more in movies anymore.  A movie which could have been a great PG / family movie gets bumped into the adult category because of a small amount of sex / language / nudity that adds nothing to the movie."

","I've been waiting a long time to see this film, but it was definitely worth the wait.  The cinematography, the music, the story, Audrey Tautou-all are beautiful.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou plays Amelie, a shy, introverted girl who decides to help others covertly.  Tautou reminded me so much of Audrey Hepburn in her portrayal.<br/><br/>However, I'd say the most interesting character was the ""Glass Man"", an old man whose bones are so brittle his furniture is padded; a man who paints a Renoir reproduction each year.<br/><br/>Overall, a 9/10 for stretching the story too long."

","To be honest I'm not really a fan of French movies - same with French music - however this movie is simply fascinating. The extremely charming and attractive leading role Amelie (Audrey Tautou), the brilliant acting and the intense universe created by the makers makes this movie stand out from the rest. It's not just the romance but also the comedy in this movie that tied me to the seat. For example take the ""toilet scene""... it made me laugh out like crazy :-) This is probably one of the funniest scenes ever.<br/><br/>So, my ratings are: story 9/10, cast 10/10, acting 10/10, romance 9.5/10, comedy 9/10 (decent, but not overcharged), cinematography 9/10, camera movement 9/10 (many great camera flights!), music 4/10.<br/><br/>My overall rating: 9/10 - WATCH IT! WATCH IT! WATCH IT!<br/><br/>I didnt give it 10 because I think the music is pretty annoying - especially the main theme - however it is that classic old kind of French folk that probably fits this movie perfectly even if I dont think so."

Hopefully more foreign films will find their way into the american conscious.  Hollywood needs a jolt to drive away from conventional movies. Movies like this help to realize that something that is not necessarily ""bankable"" can be really good then the next incarnation of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" or the next ""pumpkinhead."" Bravo to the entire production and cast of Amelie.  For those of us Americans who are literate and willing to take a chance, we thank you!"

"matthewpace","10","0","2","24 November 2003"," Why this is enchanting
","For those of you who havent seen this marvelous film, do not worry; I will not give anything away.  This movie is so wonderful because its everything that the common, modern, American film is not.  The filmmakers expiramented with techniques to show things as creatively as possible, not to point out the obvious.  For example, there is one scene where Amelie turns into water and splashes onto the floor, not because she does in the story, but rather to show her disappointment.  You do not see American films where digital effects highlight emotion as beautifully as this.  Another thing is the music, the soundtrack is beautiful, and captures the moment into a nice, pleasant song for the viewer.  Other geniously added things are the hilarious omniscient narrator, the amazing camera movement, the brilliant colors (espescially red (love, perhaps?)), and the wonderful story with its subplots and out of this world happiness.  The final sprinkles to this already delicious sundae is Audrey's beautiful, haunting, innocent smile.<br/><br/>This wonderfully crafted movie did change my life, and I am glad to say that my normal sad, lonely, quiet life has started to look more bright.  I would recommend watching this movie to anyone who is unhappy in any way with their life.  If you are perfectly content, please watch this movie, then make another one like it for those of us who need more boosts."
"Nidurino","9","0","2","10 November 2003"," Wonderful experience, this Amelie!
","Amelie is a young woman with innocent eyes and grand fantasy, who believes that her life's obligation is to help people in trouble.<br/><br/>In a way, that is only characteristic to Amelie, she begins the work of a good Samaritan - helping a blind man picture the surroundings, defending the sluggish salesman from his boss and helping the poor souls who are unhappy in love... Helping others, she is true master, who recklessly fight the greatest difficulties, but when the shine of love hits her face, her known self-esteem bursts in hundreds of pieces.<br/><br/>I can assure you, that Amelié is one of the most creative movies I have ever seen. This movie warms your heart, even the penguins in the cold Antarctic. The movie shines with great energy, which is unselfishly spread by fantastic Audrey Taoutou as wonderful Amelie. The photography of this movie is great, just as manuscript, acting and instruction. The music in Amelie is just a story for its self (Bosnian saying), i.e. it gives a special flavour to Parisian atmosphere.<br/><br/>
This movie is filled with small details and pieces which we all have experienced  at certain point in our lives, but never paid attention to them. I think that this movie deserved Oscar for Best Foreign Movie (which went to Bosnian ""No Man's Land""), because this was the best European (if not world's) movie in 2002. I mean, what can I say, the conclusion is and must be - Amelie is phenomenal work, showing that French and European film has a bright future. Every person in the world should see this movie and capture a glimpse of the universal beauty. Magnificent! Fantastic!!<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry for possible faults, English is not my native language."
"marinos theodore","10","0","2","9 November 2003"," Words can't describe it...
","First of all let's get one thing straight: Amelie is my favorite movie of all time and trust me i've seen many-many movies!!<br/><br/>So what is it all about? The movie tells us the story of Amelie from the moment she was conceived (in perhaps the most clever scene i've ever seen) 'till ,well, the present. Amelie lives in a very beautiful world filled with strange people, from her father who never goes out of the house and spends his time building some sort of mausoleum for her deceased mother to the jealous guy at ""Les Deux Moulins"" cafe everyone is unique and as far away from normal as you can imagine! Amelie is a waitress in the aforementioned cafe and at she finds pleasure at helping out everyone around her who needs her help and making them happy always in her own way. For example she punishes the grocer for being harsh to his retarted employee and in one of the best scenes i've ever seen she gives a blind man the tour of her neighborhood. But when she falls in love, she is unable to help herself and confess her love to Nino proving that although she tries to make everyone else happy, she doesn't have the guts to take the risk to try and make HERSELF happy.<br/><br/>
So what makes Amelie stand out? First of all its unique art direction. Everything is simply beautiful, from the streets of Monmarte to the design and decoration of her house everything is beautiful. The scenery combined with the Jean-Pierre's direction and Yan Tierssen's excellent soundtrack give the sense of being in a dream, not an absurd dream like a David Lynch movie but a beautiful from which you would never want to wake up... Then there is Amelie herself... Audrey Tautut is without doubt the most perfect woman. From the way she looks to the way she moves and talks, she is not acting trying to be Amelie,she IS Amelie, it's like the part was written especially for her even though she was selecte among thousands of other actresses... Then there's the direction which is perfect with a lot of clever touches throughout the film (such as showing us her beating heart when she meets Nino or the way the various flashbacks kick in) clearly this movie wouldn't be half as good if it weren't for all these factors plus, the music!! Never have i seen a most suiting soundtrack for a movie. In the end as you've probably assumed every little ellement and detail has been carefully selected, nothing is there by accident and nothing from a street poster to an actor feels like it shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>
Bottom line is that Amelie is more of an experience than a movie. The story is not original nor exciting but it's the world that it's set in and the way it is told that makes it special. You have to see it for yourselves, or rather experience it, to really understand it. It is art in its purest and most audience friendly form! Don't let the subtitles or the fact that the movie's in French scare you, give it a chance and as the tagline says it may change your lives!!"

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>This film is incredible - talk about instant good-mood!!!  Is it is departure for Jeunet as well?  I'm not sure, all I've seen of his work is ""Alien Ressurection"" and ""Delicatessen""!<br/><br/>It is the story of the lovely but introverted Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), who grew up as the only child of emotionally repressed parents, who wouldn't let her have a goldfish because its suicidal tendencies stressed them out too much.  She eventually leaves home, and when the film begins, she is a waitress in Montmatre in a cafe called the Two Windmills.<br/><br/>After finding a boy's old treasure, Amelie embarks on a quest to do good - anonymously - to those arround her.  She uses a garden gnome, a polaroid camera and the help of a stewardess friend to convince her father to travel the world.  She helps her hypochondriac co-worker to find love with a jealous, but passionate customer (played by Dominique Pignon from Delicatessen - he's hilarious!!).  She tapes images from television to show the world to The Glass Man, her neighbour who has brittle bones and can't see it for himself.<br/><br/>And along the way, she finds a photo album belonging to Nino (Matthieu Kassovitz), an eccentric young man who collects discarded passport photos from photomatic machines in the metro stations, and reassembles them.  He may just be her soulmate.  In order to bring him closer she engages him in her own brand of cat-and-mouse flirtation, yet is terrified of actually succeeding.  Nino, however, is determined to get to know her and put the game to an end.<br/><br/>More than anything, Ameilie looks beautiful as a film.  The cinematography is breathtaking,and you really believe that Paris is as beautiful as it looks (luckily it is!).  The aerial shots of nuns playing badminton at Sacre Ceour are amazing.  Audrey Tautou is a gorgeous heroine, and her supporting actors all contribute something unique.  Four and a half stars."

I was completely blown away! I absolutely adored it, though many of my friends don't enjoy it. They said it was a little too out there for them, but perhaps because I myself am a little ""out there"" it really spoke to me. I could absolutely relate to Amelie and I followed her journey avidly. All the odd little touches in this movie work together to make the film as a whole a brilliantly wonky film.

Amelie showed me that yourself has to be happy if you want to make other people happy. Amelie is searching for the right guy, just as normal people do every day and we think it's normal but in the movie I see it on a whole new way, a way that I haven't seen before. It showed me that deep, deep inside we know where to look but we never admit it. We say it's just another fantasy but her ""fantasy"" was the man she fell in love with before she met him face to face. There for I think that we are just to afraid to do anything about our fantasies and therefor many of us live in fear of something that we don't know what it is but in reality it's just in front of us the whole time."

","Having read such good reviews about this film but being a little wary of subtitles, it took me a while before I actually plucked up the courage to rent out 'Amelie'. A non-French speaker, I was pleasantly suprised that after no more than 15 minutes, the subtitles were conquered and in no way marred my experience of this exquisite film. 'Amelie' engages many emotions in the viewer, sympathy, empathy, sadness, happiness, and strangely, towards the end, exhilerating joy. How can this be? It was almost as though 'Amelie' herself had gifted me the enjoyment of this film! A great film for both the jaded and the life loving with a plentiful feel good buzz. Few films today run the interactive gamut of emotions like this to still make you feel a unique and special person. Touching and inspiring. I could go on and on but I don't want to start sounding like a motivational speaker!<br/><br/>

","Not a movie I expect you Americans to understand, because there is, as I understand very little or no French ancestry in th US, and whichever huguenots went to the US were soon lost in the American dream. In SA we have a great French heritage and many families can be traced back a LONG way and a lot of French culture, anecdotes, proverbs, satire and heritage has survived.<br/><br/>Maybe that is one of the movies I enjoyed the most. I have never been to France, so I don't know how realistic the movie is, but then again, this is a movie about Utopian views and one shouldn't put the thought too far out of mind.<br/><br/>I thought the soundtrack was really very good too and I thought the director used it very effectively. I just wish I was more fluent in French because I caught a word and a phrase here and there, and it was much funnier than the subtitles.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to find some more French movies!!!"

","""I like looking back at people in cinema while they're watching the movie..."". What can I say about Amélie story as it's my preferred film ever, including all genres, all countries and costs of productions. I mean doesn't really matter how much money was necessary to get those realistic effects in Titanic, Water World or Matrix... Then we go to cinema and pay same prices for all films. I paid about 4 euros an evening in November of 2001 and didn't need any special effects. A friend of mine had told me about but never expected it could be such an impressing pot. Amélie Poulain only needed some daily objects and lots of imagination to build a real story perfectly narrated. Simply loved the sense of humor (the way Amélie's mum dies), photography, the mediation of narrator and original winks (as that man who appears from the culvert...). I think such an optimistic point of view on the movie is really interesting... ""A fabled destiny for you also depends on you!!!"" as sometimes we forget that. Of course that way of making descriptions of people is unique!!!!! So since then, SHE could consider MYSELF a person who likes discovering simple films (and surprising ones at same time) just a normal day with no big expectations. Life's red and green!!!!!

"C2FThom","10","0","2","28 September 2003"," Heartwarming and enchanting, but enlightening as well...
","It's easy to see why so many people like Amélie.  The film is absolutely beautiful, and as has been noted time and again, it plays like a modern day fairy tale.  It seems, though, that some people can't understand how it's made its place at #20 in the IMDb's top films list.  So, rather than discuss the general merits of the film, as many have done, I'm going to try and address the reasons, in specific, it's reached this level of popularity.<br/><br/>One of the most common write-offs about Amélie is that this is a ""romantic comedy,"" and romantic comedies must by their nature be inferior to other films.  Granted, there is a lot of support for this mode of thought, particularly in the form of very cliché, fluffy romantic comedies, the type you see Meg Ryan in so much.  They're fun and they're sweet, but ultimately forgettable.  But Amélie does not fit this mold.  It's about love, definitely, but it's not about the typical self-centered notions of finding that person who ""completes"" her.  On the contrary, she really discovers love through doing good things for others, affecting their lives.  She feels gratified for doing so, but for reasons she can't really understand, she's still left feeling empty.  When she stumbles upon Nino, her actions are quite playful and curious, but even when she begins to realize he might be that ""special someone"", she refuses to act on her desires, because such self-serving acts are against her nature.  The lovers' eventual union only occurs after her neighbors, those people whose lives she's touched, conspire to return her favors.  Thus, in the end, everyone who's found love or made happy has done so thanks to the generosity of others.<br/><br/>One of the other major complaints is about the pacing of the film, particularly that it drags in its final act.  This is understandable as it could've been packaged more neatly with a few cut scenes at the end, but I understand Jeunet's intentions and would rather keep the film as is than chop it up for salability.  Amélie and Nino aren't delayed from getting together simply so that Dufayel can make his inspirational little speech via her VCR.  No, Amélie is absolutely petrified about taking chances and especially doing so for herself, and with such an attitude, she would never find happiness.  Jeunet really drives this point in with several repeated and failed attempts.  Some people find it unnecessary and are inclined to say, ""I get it already!""  But for those who can most closely relate--who just find it so hard to work for their own benefit--the inclusions of these scenes really adds to the effect, and drives the points home that good deeds will eventually be reciprocated, and that you must be willing to make yourself happy.<br/><br/>There are so many reasons why I love this film and it'd be impossible to lift them all, but I beg you to give the film a chance.  If you don't like it, I'm sorry and a bit saddened.  There may just be a chance, though, you'll think like I that Amélie belongs higher on the list than #20."

","Audrey Tautou is Amélie Poulain, a pretty young girl in Paris who's lonely and emotionally withdrawn.  She works in a cafe and watches the world go by and sees how everyone else is lonely too.<br/><br/>One day she happens upon a small tin box hidden in the wall by the little boy who lived in the apartment many years ago.  It contains toys, pictures, and other mementos of his youth.  She wonders what it would be like if he were to see these things again, so she tracks him down and arranges for him to discover his tin box in a phone booth.  He's overjoyed and shaken from his life's sadness, and it hits her - she can step into other people's lives in secret and make them happy.<br/><br/>So she sets out to help those around her.  The lonely woman downstairs who misses her husband, the lovestruck man who hangs out at her cafe, the mousy girl working behind the counter, the frustrated artist downstairs, the man in the Metro who collects torn pictures people throw away.<br/><br/>My favorite is her father, who's given up on life since his wife died and who lives alone as a recluse for the most part.  Amélie steals his garden gnome and gives it to a stewardess friend, who takes it around the world with her and mails him pictures of the gnome having a good time everywhere. It shakes him up and he decides to travel to all the places he's wanted to visit but never had the nerve to do alone.<br/><br/>But Amélie hasn't taken care of her own needs, her own loneliness.  She's fallen for the young boy in the Metro who collects pictures, but she's afraid to approach him.  Amélie gives him hints she's interested, but she can't break the barriers she's put up between herself and the outside world and doesn't allow herself to embrace him.<br/><br/>Finally, with a little help from the artist downstairs who's figured out it's Amélie who's secretly been behind all these ""miracles,"" she rushes to the young man as he's seeking her out too and they fall in love and seemingly live happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's a love story about two lonely people finding each other, but it has a humorous slant to it.  Amélie is an impish character with bright eyes and a cheerful smile who goes through life trying to find the best in everything. Her boyfriend is also a romantic as he searches for the clue to the mystery of the man in the photos he puts together.  <br/><br/>The film is well done and has some interesting features in the cinematography that border on surreal.  Pictures talking to people, cats with funny expressions, the lamp talking to the picture frame, people coming out of nowhere and making comments.  It's sort of like what she imagines not what's really happening, and it adds to the delightful aura of this most excellent film.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best films that's come out in awhile."
"qtaran111","Null","0","2","22 September 2003"," Fabuleux indeed!
","Wonderful, magical and delicious in every detail.  From the very beginning, describing Amélie's conception, to the end showing her blossoming, this is a gem of a movie.  Taking the typical Jeunet fantasy/hyper-real slant on life, this film has a real unique gallic charm.  The cinematography is superb and the rich colours and detail help to flesh out Amélie's comic strip universe. Perhaps this is the antithesis of the dark world described in Delicatessen. And Paris has never looked so beautiful (even the Metro looks clean!) Superb.  Can only the French do cinema like this?"
"EyeDunno","10","0","2","13 September 2003"," Look Past the Unattractive Box!
","Almost 50% of the voters gave Amelie a perfect score, about twice as many people who voted ""9"" for this film. I was one of the majority, but I want to give you some insight to help you find more to understand about Amelie.<br/><br/>I first heard of this movie after seeing a less- than- attractive cover in a DVD rental store. A woman said that she was hesitant to watch Amelie because of the pale look of her character on the box (in the movie, she's not pale in any scene). I decided to rent the DVD after reading enough positive reviews here.<br/><br/>From the opening scene to the movie's conclusion, Amelie drew me into its world. View this movie with an open mind and don't take it seriously. It's a very light- hearted film, even though wheels on the plot power forward by a tragic event. <br/><br/>Amelie is a well- written, acted, scripted, and produced movie. And as the credits rolled at the end, I wanted to see more of Amelie, who was a wonderful and genuine character, one you wished lived in your own neighborhood. And I also believe that both women and men would really enjoy this. Most guys would fall in love with Amelie's eyes, and more women would enjoy the sensitive style of creatively showing a woman's emotions. But I get the sense that a few women may not care for Amelie's character, honestly.<br/><br/>The original music (no lyrics) of composer Yann Tiersen will stay in your head, even if you can't get past the subtitles. Tiersen did a fabulous job of creating a score that suits every scene it's played in. The audio is rich and expansive, and can be enjoyed with even the most basic speakers.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" makes me wish that I had learned French, and I envy anyone who understands the language for being able to understand the dialog without having to read a translation. It can be a little difficult to have to watch two things at once -- subtitles and a movie -- because early on, you'll feel like you're missing the movie everytime you have to read the translation. But trust me on this, ""Amelie from Montmartre"" is a movie that you'll enjoy watching again and again. It's a rare treat to find a movie that doesn't get ""tired."" And as you watch ""Amelie"" again, you'll enjoy more of the cinematography and the lush, saturated colorful scenes.<br/><br/>The DVD has many different options to dive into, which is a great thing since you'll probably fall in love with ""Amelie."" One thing I would like to address is a criticism of too much sexuality in the film. First, North American culture is very conservative compared to the French, who view sexuality as another thing to enjoy in life. U.S. filmmakers may not understand the sensitivity in which director Jean- Pierre Jeunet filmed the sexual scenes, which were not at all gratuitous. I found it odd that someone suggested there was too much sexuality when 15 couples were shown engaging (creatively framed) at around 1/2 second each. Amelie was torn by her desire for companionship and intimacy. Her fears are unnatural in such an open- minded country where sexuality is not considered perverse or dirty.<br/><br/>PS- For lovers of traditional blues, watch for a B&W clip on the television of an elderly one- legged man tap dancing midway through the movie. His name is ""Peg Leg"" Sam (Jackson), and there are two CDs of music that this late singer recorded, ""Kickin' It"" and ""Early in the Morning."" Well worth the search."

Everything Amelie does is with GOODNESS as its motivation...even her somewhat questionable antics (such as her tinkering in Collignon's apartment).  The ""letter"" incident others have mentioned was done to cause HAPPINESS--and closure--in a sad, lonely woman's life.  How can that be bad?!<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you haven't seen this movie...do!!  It's wonderful from start to finish.  (Note to self: You haven't watched ""Amelie"" lately.

Tired of her passionless world, she decides to do ""good"" for strangers.  With the positive outcome of her initial philantropic deed, she moves onto other friends and peers in need, and in so doing is able to free her own introvert nature, burst out of her fantasy bubble, and find passion for herself.  To sum up this film in a word, it would be ""cute"" - everything, ranging from the lead actress all the way down to the editing style, bursts off the screen in a shout of ""cuteness.""  Despite its happy go lucky nature, the story is balanced with realistic glimpses into characters' lives (ie; the tale of the man who likes to eat his chicken and the discovery of his ""treasure box"").  Furthermore, the story falls a tiny bit short with Ally Mcbeal type special effect silliness and certain points where the film just doesn't seem to advance.

Amelie, as the full title suggests, takes place in France. But not quite the France you may know. The France in Amelie is borderline between surreal and real, making the story of Amelie much like a fairy-tale. The main character, Amelie, is struggling to find her place in a world in which she does not seem to fit in. She feels finally at peace with her life when she finally feels she has found her goal in life...changing people's lives for the better.

If you're into quirky characters and oddball romance you'll love this.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that there was WAY TOO MUCH voice-over narration, especially noticeable in the first half of the film. This was almost bothersome. I would've preferred to HEAR the characters on screen (do the narrating) instead of having everything described and explained by some (invisible) old guy I don't care about."

","Amelie is a quirky romantic comedy.  It is refreshing to see those two words together.  One of my favorite things about this movie is how it manages to be bizarre, unique, and surreal but still deals with real life issues.  Issues that are so close to my heart, however, and I do not know if everyone can connect to the story.  I think this piece of literature exemplifies everything I've studied in my World Literature class and that is why it speaks to me.  First of all, it revolves around the ""artist figure."" Amelie is an artist, disconnected from society but wanting to impact it. That is why I identify with her so much, because she is a shy individual and she learns that she can't keep letting her chances for happiness pass her by.  It is great that she is helping those around her, but you can't truly help others until you help yourself.  That beautiful, heartfelt central message is what had me in tears.  Good literature (and movies) give you an outpouring of mixed emotions which leave you not quite knowing what to think (and gives you a lot to think about after its over). The technical aspects of the film are quite brilliant.  The script has believable dialogue.  All of the characters and interesting and well rounded (The glass man being my favorite).  Everything fits together in a perfect piece.  The cinematography is quite stunning.  Each camera pan and swoop is just breathtaking.  The colors add to the fantasy of the story.  All in all, from the performances, to the storyline, to the look of the movie is shear brilliance."

I can just say that the whole movie was absolutely stunning. This movie can cheer you up, even when you're enormously depressed. Audrey Tatou (Amélie) performs really well and makes you smile with her childish cuteness. One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!"
"HenryHextonEsq","9","0","2","7 May 2003"," Very charming Parisian antics.
","I can see exactly how this film appeared as such a breath of fresh air to mainstream film-goers, riddled with the alternating crudity and blandness of American romantic-comedies, and the non-existence of a British template. Hopefully, the astounding success of this film will encourage people to look out for films from other countries.<br/><br/>It should be remarked that ""Amelie"" is quite an artificial sort of French film; it plays its French-ness and difference as a trump card. The Paris conveyed is a beautiful cinematic conjuring trick - not to say that the city isn't a fine place, but its joie de vivre here seems so exaggerated that it takes on the depth of a sculpted cartoon. Visually, this can do no other than beguile you; the essence of innocence and early summery romance are captured in this film. It is a picture fully geared towards an international audience, as well as a domestic one; offering sheer escapist bonhomie and archetypal gallic qualities. It has the mark of intellect and 'Art' in its wonderful composition, and in the cast of characters - the wise, comic old artist enraptured by his Renoir. Yet, mundanity is given a gleeful pinch of whimsy with the old garden gnome subplot and the photograph album's resolution.<br/><br/>The only really central character in this stylized tableaux is Amelie Poulain, played by Audrey Tautou. Tautou does carry it; investing this almost superhuman, slightly manic and melancholy pixie with a great deal of charm. Part attractively coy, part knowingly wry and mischievous, she's like a perfect confection, and we of course know she'll end up with some romance in her life. This is Paris, after all. This is dealt with well, as it comes to her almost despite herself; her nimble do-gooding proves her to be very much the ideal worthy person we ourselves aspire to be. The other actors largely give pictorially effective, comic cameos; as players in this feelgood procession of events; Audrey Tautou has to add some gravity and maintain the mood of levity. A difficult task well carried out by the actress; the moments that most move are when Amelie is too coy to take the romantic initiative - she does have things to learn, despite her general excellence as a person.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is a perfectly crafted and poised popular film; perhaps overly calculated. But, a definite spot of enjoyable old-style entertainment, that will go down well with pretty much everyone with a romantic soul. It's an idealistic view of French-ness that cannot fail to appeal in these Hollywood-homogenized times.<br/><br/>Rating:- ****/*****"

You root for the character almost from the beginning of the story as you see her terrible childhood, and see her loneliness only increase with time.  And instead of thinking of herself she thinks of others in an attempt to fill the void in her life.  But it does not last for long and she begins to see that her life isnt all that she wants it to be. And her attraction to Nino is quite apparent.  And you see that he is very much like her. . . a dreamer.  Audrey Tautou is absolutely magnificent in her role.  She exudes this sort of kindness and thrill for life but with a loneliness keeping her life from being perfect.  And the rest of the movie is filled with characters seemingly pulled right off the street and into the movie. . . not shells of characters with no depth like in most movie.

","""Amelie"" is one of those films whose theme more or less boils down to ""Live Your Life!""  It's kind of an amorphous sentiment (how exactly does one live anymore than they already are?), one which is very hard to pull off without feeling pretentious or overly sappy.  Thankfully, ""Amelie"" pulls it off.<br/><br/>Part of the reason for this is Audrey Tautou.  As the title character, a woman who was starved for emotion and companionship most of her life but who manages to retain a tenderness in spite of the fact, Tautou displays a mix of innocence and cleverness, shyness and daring, which makes the character work.  Her Amelie is believable as a woman who wants to make other people happy but can't bring herself to connect with them directly.  This leads her on a variety of amusing and surreally complex escapades, including leading a man on a wild goose chase to restore a cherished photo album to him, or serving comeuppance to a mean-spirited grocer by sneaking into his house and altering small but significant details in his furnishings.<br/><br/>The owner of the photo album is Nino, who ultimately becomes Amelie's love interest.  The album itself contains not family photographs, but pictures strangers discard outside instant photo booths.  The album is a prominent image in a film where isolation and voyeurism are the key motifs (the film is set shortly after the tragic death of Princess Diana, who in the realm of ""life as a spectator sport"" was one of the biggest games in town).  The symbolism here is wonderfully nuanced but occasionally heavy-handed, as in the case of a recluse known as ""The Glass Man"" who functions as Amelie's concious.  Other characters include a hypochondriac, a bitter customer at the cafe where Amelie works, and Amelie's father, all of whom fit into the overall theme of embracing life.  Some figure it out, some don't--finding out which is which is a journey worth taking."

But Amelie can't bring herself to take the same steps to break free of her own unhappy solitude. Even as her plans for everyone else bear fruit (occasionally in unexpected ways), she struggles to overcome her paralyzing fears. But she would do well to consider that she has no monopoly on scheming for the benefit of others!<br/><br/>Even ignoring the French dialog and English subtitles, this is obviously not an American movie. Its quirky characters are often simultaneously boorish and charming. Its storyline jumps from whimsical to depressing to silly to wrenchingly sad, with occasional heartwarming flourishes. But this American viewer found it quite entertaining, even while he was squirming as he identified a bit too closely with the lonely heroine.<br/><br/>One of my favorite elements was how Amelie's overactive imagination finds expression in the course of her ordinary daily life. (It's similar to the trippiness of ""Ally McBeal"", but with less slapstick and more heart.) I was also amused when Amelie found herself watching an English video clip which was, of course, subtitled in French, and I momentarily lost track of what language I was actually following!<br/><br/>All in all, it's a wonderful movie, and well worth the accolades lauded upon it."

There is no excess footage and no scenes that need to be taken out (like the ""robot factory"" scene in Star Wars Episode II). Even the casual movie-goer will notice the attention to detail, especially in the use of the colors green, red, and blue that visually gives the movie more of a feeling that it is a work of art rather than just another movie. The cinematography is so fantastic that some of the camera shots almost overshadow and distract from what is being filmed. As I have often seen, the literal translation of the title is not used. The box says 'Amelie', the subtitle says 'Amelie from Monmartre', and the actual translation is 'The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain'. Yes, this movie is a love story, and no, it is not normal. It is about a strange girl who loves helping others, but has trouble helping herself and how she is instantly drawn to a strange boy who works at a carnival and a porn shop and goes around Paris collecting torn up photographs.

","Director/Writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one the most inventive story tellers of our time. When I saw his movie The City of Lost Children, I thought he must have seen one of my crazier nightmares. City is visually dark and monochromatic to support a dark affect. But with Amelie, Jeunet has created a joyful work of art -- and that in itself is an amazing achievement: Angst is cheap; Joy is a real challenge.<br/><br/>Amelie successfully weaves a number of true stories and urban myths (e.g., recovered letters change lives when finally delivered years later, and lawn ornaments send travel photos back to bewildered owners) around the protagonist. The imaginative Amelie of Montmartre goes through life testing every event for her destiny (`if he dips his finger in the sugar, he understands me'), and thus life is magical.<br/><br/>Jeunet strives to control every aspect of the medium to create his intended effect: He uses animation, beautiful camera moves, and digitally saturated colors (compare to Baran -- 'the grayest love story ever told' -rw), as well as light-hearted, folk-like music to accentuate the fairy-tale aspects of the story.<br/><br/>Most reviewers declared Amelie the feel-good movie of 2001, but I actually cried at the end -- I mean, come on, the fantasy of 'true love' is... well... tragic, isn't it? Ahh well... put your rational brain on hold and remember how, as a child, you once thought magic was possible."

","before seeing amelie i would have thought that the first essential element would be a strong story or screenplay.  apparently i was wrong.<br/><br/>amelie has a very simple story.  a young parisian girl decides to go around helping others without seeking recognition, and is simultaneously able to overcome her fears and find love.  this sounds like standard, trite romantic comedy fare. i used to think so. i was wrong.<br/><br/>the first thing this movie has going for it is an incredibly engaging performance from audrey tautou (who by the way i am now in love with). minus all the other fabulous things about the film, her performance alone makes this an enthralling movie.<br/><br/>the second very strong aspect of this film is the cinematography, for which it was nominated for an academy award and somehow (shame on the academy) lost to fellowship of the ring. the first scene of amelie skipping stones on the canal is one of the most incredible i have ever seen.<br/><br/>the third strong aspect of this film is the color.  the green everywhere, with contrasting red peppered throughout, and all the other vibrant colors make this movie an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>all these things, combined with a great sense of humor and a truly (as sap py as it may sound) touching story, make amelie a fantastic movie that everyone should see. i cannot imagine anybody, save the most coldhearted individual, not enjoying this. 4/4"

"skipsizemore","9","0","2","16 February 2003"," One of those rare films that can fairly be called ""enchanting""
","Let me start by saying all of the negative things that I have to say, just to get them out of the way.  First, I agree with the last reviewer that there is perhaps a bit too much sex in the film.  If they would strike about three scenes, this would be a movie that (like The Princess Bride) I could recommend to absolutely anyone, even my mother or my pastor, with total confidence.  Only one of the sex-related scenes really adds humor and advances the story (a couple make love in a public restroom, causing things to bounce around outside, a replay of a scene from the equally marvelous Delicatessen, by the same director).<br/><br/>Secondly, the film really does rely too much on voice-over narration. Sometimes what the narrator is saying is obvious, sometimes it's just a quick way to move us on to the next scene.  Sometimes, admittedly, it works very well.  But in a film that does such a wonderful job of telling the story in a creative way (using talking photographs and a gesturing statue, for example), it seems to me that more could have been done to spare us the voice-over in may places.  If I had wanted a book on tape I would've rented one!<br/><br/>Now that said, this really is a marvelous gem of a film.  The quirky humor is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and the story keeps one guessing.  Unlike the last reviewer, I was not bothered by the dangling story lines; it seemed to me that these were just vignettes designed to draw me in to the world of Amelie.  It would have been very ""Hollywood"" to tie them all up in a neat package in the last ten minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Visually, too, the film is stunning.  Everything one sees is carefully placed to be evocative and stylized.  Most of the colors are washed-out, so that every once in a while a bright object will catch the eye at a strategic moment.<br/><br/>All of the minor characters are fun, well-scripted and used to good effect in advancing the story.  But the character of Amelie really makes or breaks the film.  If, like me and most others, you find her to be charming, beautiful, and sweet, you'll probably love the film.  If she reminds you of someone who used to make fun of you in high school, it'll be a long two hours.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>If you like Amelie, I would certainly recommend that you check out Delicatessen.  It's much darker, and somewhat hard to find, but the humor is just as wild and the visuals even more striking."

","It's hard for me to describe how much I love this film. Absolutely everything is perfect about it. It's set in my favourite city in the world and manages to make it look even more beautiful than it actually is. The cinematography is absolutely amazing. The most stunning shot i have ever seen in a film is the one where Amelie skims stones along the canal where the camera goes right over her head and the whole screen virtually explodes in a cascade of colour. The plot is a universally pleasing one. ""Cute hippy girl tries to make the world a better place by making people happy, and in turn finds happiness herself"" and what the hell is wrong with that?<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Yann Tiersen is beautiful and sad and is perfect background music for when you're chilling out and thinking about life. If everyone got over the fact that subtitles do not mean a film is bad just because they have to read (which is never a bad thing) they would discover a shocking brilliant film (and a stunningly beautiful lead actress).It's funny, it's sweet, it's weird, it's abstract, it's beautiful and ultimately it makes life worth living, if only for a little while."

"tributarystu","7","0","2","4 February 2003"," Too much suspense hurts the action
","I expected pretty much from this film and despite the fact that I can't say I am displeased, I do have to say that I am a little disappointed.<br/><br/>  Jeunet made a good impression through Alien 4, which was interesting despite being the fourth movie in the series. With Amelie he played and I can't say he did a bad job, but there are some things which I am not happy with. <br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>  The choice of the leading actress was one of the best things of the movie. She has a very expressive face and such is needed to portray a person who lives in her own universe. Isolated, solitary, without much human contact...she creates a unique, pleasant but unhappy character. I wondered what her desire to help people might mean. It is not something she does because she feels fulfilled by it. I guess she does it because she does not have anything else to do and because she hopes to meet her prince charming, as she actually does. <br/><br/>  At first it was enchanting...her way to fix things and make justice. Then it became a little confusing. Amelie is a shy person, that is certain by the way she goes around with ""her man"". She is not sure what to do and this leads to an annoying part of the film. It's all slow and things turn in ways they shouldn't, so that the movie loses some of its charm. I think too much suspense hurts the action in this case.   The movie isn't what I'd call a comedy. It's a movie with some funny scenes, but not a comedy. It's a drama and a romance movie. That's what it is. <br/><br/>   The painting that the old man has, with the girl, is seen by Amelie as the representation of her own life, but she does not dare to say it out loud. The man does notice it though and he tries to do what Amelie had done to many: help her.    The characters are quite interesting, each and every one of them, but I don't really have everything clear in my mind and I am not sure if it is worth discussing the characters more than I have done already. Of course, her loved one is quite similar to her, but it was obvious they fit since the first time we saw them in the same image. A little bit strange was the picture thing, with the ""invisible man"". I understood that the idea was something like this: a man who fears not to be forgotten takes his pictures but then throws them away...we find out though that it actually was a repairman and not such a complex person. Should I understand that things are sometimes more simple than they seem?<br/><br/>
   After the whole middle part of the movie drags us along in Amelie's game with her love, the end is a little bit unnatural. It comes in such a way that it leaves you(left me anyway) asking why so much unnecessary stuff? There were some nice computer made scenes in the movie, of which I can not complain. They didn't quite have any effect on me. T The beginning of the movie was quite shocking, as was the whole movie actually: I expected something different. <br/><br/>    All things find an explanation in the movie, so there is not much more to discuss about. In my opinion things could've been better.<br/><br/>  There's this funny thing I noticed...most of the newer films(last 3-4 years maximum) which are in the top 20 movies here, are definitely strange. Memento and Amelie confirm this.I can only say LoTR got lost somehow in this maze of movies which lie at the top of the viewer's preferences.<br/><br/>    Amelie is an interesting movie, but it does have its negative aspects as I've said. I can't give it a nine, hardly an eight fifty. More like 8/10."

","Some people don't seem to like this movie; however, it is beautifully directed and fully stimulates the mind.  If you didn't (or don't think you will) like this movie try watching it again (or for the first time) and consider what you are given.  Absorb the entire situation and ask yourself why the situations, dialogue, editing and (for gods sake!!) colors are the way they are.  Why is Amélie's room red?  What does that mean?  How does it reflect the part of her character that isn't plainly given?  If you love art, even if you kind of like art, and can understand that not every thing you see is what it is (symbolism does exist in movies!!) then you should enjoy this film.  Even if you aren't into art, and you just decide that the director and writer just randomly picked colors for scenes, you should still like this movie because it's happy.  There's nothing wrong with an artistic movie that is happy.  Also, if you are fluent in French or can understand even a little bit it helps (everything is subtitled don't worry) the reason being is that you get to hear the inflection, the ferocity, the joy, the sadness --everything!  Anyone can read dialogue, but when you get to hear and watch and just take in what these great actors and actresses are giving us it can really overwhelm you.  That's enough--bottom line WATCH IT, if you don't like it call me an idiot on here later but you'd better be ready to support your argument."
"rps-2","9","0","2","3 February 2003"," Wonderful characters in a wonderful movie
","A fairy tale for adults? A fable? An off the wall comedy? A love story? All these and more! This is a wonderfully refreshing and original movie. Amelie is the girl every man has loved at some time in his life. She is surrounded by a wonderfully drawn cast of characters. There are clever, creative film effects that stay in perspective. The producers wisely didn't allow themselves to get carried away by gimmicks and effects as so many do. A bonus is the splendid photography in  and around Paris and especially of French railway stations and trains. Nor, despite the happy ending, does this fit into the standard Hollywood genre. It is European and French to the last frame. 2003 is young as I write this but I doubt I will see much else this year that will be as good!"
"Metaphor123","10","0","2","25 January 2003"," A delightful treat
","Like Hallstrom's 'Chocolat', 'Amelie' is a wicked, beautiful indulgence. Every single shot is like an oil panting, bursting with colour and energy and mystery.<br/><br/>What more can be said about a film already heaped with so many accolades its busting at the seams? Rarely is a film so outstanding in so many aspects. The most immediate reward for the audience is the cinematography - bold, lush, fecund. It has been suggested out that the Paris portrayed in 'Amelie' does not exist, but those people are wrong. The Paris in 'Amelie' is a place lovingly crafted into existence by the director, the cinematographer, the composer, the editor, the actors. For a few brief moments, we are allowed to live in a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Jeunet uses the camera to emphasize emotion already on screen, not to create them. Like the opening of 'The Royal Tenenbaums', a narrator introduces us to the characters that will shape the film, and shape our heroine, Amelie. Amelie appears to take in the world with wide-eyed innocence, but the audience can see the mischievnous that lies beneath. She is instantly adorable.<br/><br/>So much of the film is remarkable because of the look. Yet, like any good film, the heart of the film is the story and the characters. It is here that the film becomes magical instead of merely excellent, a film that treads the line between whimsy and heartache, of hope and hopelessness, of toil and reward with remarkable aplomb. Jeunet is a magician, and 'Amelie' is the act that brings the house down."

Many people give it bad reviews because of the manufactured sense of the movie, but those people don't use their imagination.  They don't see how Amelie does things because she is shy, not because of some mental defect that causes her to help people.  Amelie decides to make people happy.  It all starts with a little boys treasure box from the '50s.  She must make others happy to make herself so until she meets Nino.  She is the ultimate in sweetness and the actress who portrays her has an old world shine, like Audrey Hepburn.  This movie makes you smile and laugh and feel good.

","Why is this movie so good? Because everything is looking so simple easy and natural. You let you lead by your emotions. You laugh, cry, dream ... and after two hours, you ask why this should stop. Audrey Tautou is not acting, she IS Amelie. Everything is almost perfect in this movie. Photography, rhythm, dialogues, music, soundtrack (Listen to the small noises that ends the scenes like a final dot). Because we are in the 21 th century there are many computer-generated effects in this movie, but they are so well made that you cannot see them. The animal looking clouds are so funny! By the way, the goldfish is computer generated and looks far much better than this ugly and ridiculous Yoda (I want the puppet back !!!)... Despite the ""Non Oscar"", this is finally the proof that you can make an (almost) worldwide success with a simple story and an (almost) low budget movie. Remarks I read a lot about the PG rating for this movie. Be aware that in France everyone who was in age to understand what the story was about could see this movie. You can note that in most of European countries the film was allowed for 7 to 12 year old spectators. In France, many less than 10 Childs went to the theatre with their parents to watch this fine and funny story! The scene some write about was to put in the film because it is a French movie, but because making love is a natural act, and killing his neighbor with a rifle is not. This scene is also a kind of trademark of Jeunet and a remember to his famous scene in his other excellent film Delicatessen. Those who watched this movie will understand."

In _Emma_, it's her step-half-brother-or-something, in _Amelie_, it's a kid who used to get beat up in school who she ""cute-meets"" while walking through a Paris railroad station.<br/><br/>But enough Film School criticism!

"tizzi22","9","0","3","2 January 2003"," Another work of art, painted by Jeunet et al
","I have been a fan of Jeunet for years, ever since I saw Delicatessen on the Independent Film Channel.  Jeunet has been a master storyteller, illustrating his stories brilliantly with dark, rich colors.  ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is no exception. Instead of giving the typical synapsis that has already been repeated in the prior posts, I will tell why this film along with the others have given me such an affinity for Jeunet's work. The films Delicatessen, La Cité des Enfants Perdus, and Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain are dark movies.  The colors are dark and each character has a flaw, but there is always the protagonist that has a bright color to them and brings light to the story.  Whether it's Louison the clown, One the strongman, or Amélie the dreamer, they all bring a sense of light and hope into the lives of the other characters. The cinematography of these films is also rich and beautiful.  The scenes can be dark and ancient-looking and still be gorgeous.  What might otherwise seem scary looks like wisened beauty that plays as the perfect background to the story such as the box full of memories and the hole where it was found or a photo album full of distorted or torn pictures pieced together, but not quite to their original state. Another characteristic of Jeunet's movies that I like are the facial expressions of his characters.  While a minor detail, they add so much to the film.  Look back at the expression on Amélie's face when she holds up the spoon that she uses for cracking the top surface of her creme brulée, the look on Dufreyal's face in his video.  On Nino's face when he first encounters Amélie.  Of young Amélie when she has to say goodbye to her only childhood friend at the bridge.  Of Blubber as he looks up at Amélie sadly (who would have thought a goldfish could look so sad and betrayed). Jeunet's films are also known for their sounds.  Of voices, sound effects, and of course, the beautiful music he chooses as the backdrop for his stories.  Yann Tiersen's music matches the mood of its characters who are classic French with a touch of modern quirkiness.  It consists of the accordion matched with rhythms that are both haunting and charming, of bells that sound with the innocent, child-like ideals of Amélie, and holds moods that play up those being expressed in the scenes in which they are played. Jeunet has turned his film into a beautiful display of art that works on many different levels with varying shades of nuance.  He has proven again of just how much of an artist he is through the people he chosen to create his vision and how beautifully he has orchestrated these elements into creating his newest masterpiece ""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"".<br/><br/>
Un Fabuleux Destin indeed."
"Ackybono420","10","0","2","31 December 2002"," This film makes me want to make people happy.
","Amélie is a beautifully made movie that conveys the joy of the characters almost to the point of allowing the audience to feel it themselves. Despite being somewhat of a 'chick flick' I believe this film put a smile on anyone's face, man or woman.  I generally loathe watching a movie entirely in subtitles and I know practically no French whatsoever, but it came so highly recommended to me that I decided to disregard my usual tastes.  I realized very early on in the movie that the way these people spoke French (particularly the narrator, André Dussollier) was so pleasant to listen to that being dubbed over in English simply would not have done the original dialogue justice.  The manner in which Amélie finds her destiny (bringing happiness to others) was cleverly laid out in an original sequence of events that leaves you thinking.  However, you soon have to move your thoughts on to other things to try to piece together the various clues given to you as she goes about each day with her secret motive.  She surprises you time and time again by coming up with increasingly ingenious ways to bring joy to complete strangers.  While this movie isn't for every person's tastes, I will say this much from my personal experience: Guys, watch this one with the object of your affection and her heart will be yours."

One of the best scenes: Nino sitting in the booth ad Amelie behind him writing the menu on the board and he turns around and insists she is the girl in the picture but the coward in her takes over and insists that that is not her and the look on her face as she walks away is priceless."

","Light, whimsical, funny, and touching, Amélie turned out to be a rare subtitled movie that I completely forgot was subtitled.  I was so engrossed by the story and the acting (especially the lovely, sprite-like Audrey Tautou in the eponymous role) that the subtitles bothered me not one whit. <br/><br/>
I won't recap the plot, but I will tell you that despite the R rating, I felt like almost anyone with the patience for the subtitles could watch this movie. I don't get too uptight about nudity -- I think violence is much more harmful to older children than nudity.  This sweet film comes from the heart, similar to Greek Wedding, but without the schmaltz and the ethnic humor (although I still loved Greek Wedding).  It gets a bit slow in spots, and it becomes a little overcontrived towards the end, but its heart is always in the right place.<br/><br/>Le film, c'est magnifique.  8 out of 10."

","Please go and see it for yourself; this is what cinema was intended to be: funny, visually challenging, moving. Amélie brought tears to my eyes. It is such a complete movie with humour, content, a message and warmth. And above all, it's been brought to you, the viewer, in the most fascinating and artistical way. Jeunet brings Paris into our living rooms like nobody else did before: with extraordinary actors, images and music. So unlike his previous movies with their dark atmosphere. But above all, it's a movie about imagination. Amélie is a girl endowed with an overactive imagination and she -unlike most of us- kept that gift when growing up. As an adult woman, she looks at our world like a child. She wonders. It's just that capacity, of staying naieve, of being able to be surprised, of not being blasé that we often envy children. And indeed, don't look any further. This is not an action movie, not a thriller or an epic adventure story. It's just, THE MOVIE, that might put a real smile on your face."

I must say i was expecting a bit more, in terms of plot development, which tends to follow a predictable line, but i was truly *AMAZED* at the beautiful cinematography and art direction of the movie. Also most of the movie is very clever and quirky, which i loved, the only thing that kept me from ""giving"" it a perfect 10 was that it drags a bit towards the end, and the predictable plotline/ending. Otherwise, its PERFECT. Also, i thought the sex scenes (particularly the orgasm montage and the bathroom scene) couldve been trimmed a bit, giving the movie a PG-13 rating which wouldve been more deserving IMO, as they really served no purpose at all to the plot, but hey, its a french movie after all. :)<br/><br/>All in all, beautiful visuals, beautiful and great actress, beautiful music, etc."

","With Amelie, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a director best known in North America for the fourth film in the Alien Legacy, Alien Ressurection, truly comes into his own with this veritable masterwork of delightful characters, circumstances and of course, the beautiful Montmatre back drop.  Audrey Tautou is delightful as the shy, but astoundingly charming Amelie Poulain, a woman who changes the lives of those around her.  Some cynics or people with a particular distaste for French cinema will probably not like this, but otherwise this is a movie well worth your time."

"magnoliaX82","10","0","2","11 December 2002"," Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain, Le (2001) [Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet]
","It's Oscar night: I watch the television attentively, knowing that every award is going to be a disappointment, but praying for a miracle. It's time to announce the Best Foreign Film of the Year. ""And the Oscar goes to... No Man's Land?"" I'm speechless. But, then again, I should have seen it coming a mile away. After all, almost every film on my top-ten list of the year -- Memento, The Royal Tenenbaums, Ghost World, and The Man Who Wasn't There -- had either been completely ignored by the Academy or over-shadowed by a more politically correct competitor. The same went for Amelie, which is undoubtedly the best foreign film in years and one of my all-time favorites. I skimmed over a review of Amelie on Amazon.com and, if I recall correctly, the author responsible for it had described it as a ""French cartoon."" For some this may seem accurate. But in my humble opinion, Amelie is far more emotional than the over-hyped No Man's Land could ever dream of being. Perhaps I'm saying this because I can relate so well to the title character, or maybe it's because I can't stand to watch an actress as loveable as Audrey Tautou cry. But regardless what it is, Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius (even though I'm still trying to figure out how he could have been the same guy responsible for Alien: Resurrection). In Amelie he has crafted a beautiful, humorous, and extremely romantic story that truly qualified for its Best Screenplay nomination (although Memento was the only one good enough to actually deserve winning it). The acting is excellent -- as well as the direction -- but the real magic of Amelie lies in the soundtrack. Combining accordions, harmonicas, and strings, Yann Tiersen crafted one of the most unique and marvelous scores I've ever heard. As for the cinematography, while some may be irritated by the amount of green in the picture, I felt it was a perfect compliment to the film's mood. To sum it up in just a few words -- if this is at all possible -- I cannot describe how much I love this movie, except to say that I'm happy to love it as much as I do. And not many people can say that about anything.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","Somehow I find it more difficult to comment on movies I liked.  Perhaps this is because praise is harder to put into words than complaints, and merit is often less tangible.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is a movie I would highly recommend.  I know, I know: it's already been labeled an international hit, but this is one of those rare occasions when a movie deserves the praise it has been showered with.<br/><br/>It's fresh, original, beautifully shot, and features a memorable score that helps create its very special atmosphere.  It leaves you with a wonderful feeling, like ""an orange-coloured day"", when nature is in bloom and harmony, inviting you to the celebration of life.  It endows your memory with a picture album of those colourful, dynamic, artistic, often poetic sequences of which it is composed.<br/><br/>""Amelie"" is not a simple fairytale, as some might think.  There's a bit of everything in it: romance, mystery, philosophy, brilliant humour and whimsy. It touches upon many issues, but never ""in your face"".  Obviously, it wasn't meant to mirror reality, so don't try to find flaws here.  And I wouldn't encourage viewers to question some of Amelie's actions from the moral standpoint.  Doing so would be taking the film too seriously, instead of just enjoying its mischievous twinkle.<br/><br/>The plot is well-woven and a pleasure to follow.  I've seen the movie several times, and it hasn't yet lost any of its charm.  It isn't perfect, at times overly sentimental, but I would generously give it 9/10, for all of the above and for making my day. :)"

","This movie is beyond great.  From the fantastic direction of Jean Pierre Jeunet to the illuminating leading lady--the beautiful Audrey Tautou (who is the next Audrey Hepburn)this movie is flawless.  It is about a shy,inquisitive,selfless young woman named Amelie Poulain.  Amelie occupies her life by making other people in her small town happy, but she is so busy making other peoples lives meaningful that she forgets about herself, and it takes an agoraphobic man with a fragile bone structure to help her believe that she too counts as a human being on this earth and deserves happiness, and the love of a lonely young man who collects torn up photos from the bottom of photo booths, to help Amelie start thinking about herself. If you buy the DVD, I would advise to read the English subtitles and turn the English dialog back to French because it spoils the whole ambiance of this magnificent tale, because the voices of the actors help bring its watcher into this movie."

When I heard of this movie, I knew from the very beginning that I was in for a real treat; that no way would I be disappointed. There was no doubt that I would love this movie. And I did. Granted ""Amélie"" was much more upbeat than either of the aforementioned (darker) movies, but Jeunet's lovable eccentricity is woven into the film nonetheless. I am waiting (im)patiently for his next gem of a movie. If you want a wonderfully uplifing movie that will move you and make you laugh, rent this film. Hell, rent it no matter what.

"mlevans","9","0","2","18 October 2002"," I'm keeping an eye out for an Amelie in MY neighborhood!
","Being no scholar of French cinema, I cannot place Jean-Pierre Juenet's Amelie in the proper scale or historic contest among French films. Being a film lover, though, I know it places very highly on my own personal list.<br/><br/>Juenet, whose style reminds me of two of my other favorite contemporary directors, Lasse Hallstrom and Wes Anderson, combines wonderful visual imagery and colors, interesting camera angles and editing and a fun pace throughout the film, to bring home a big container of fun. No one can call Amelie a 'dark' film-although, I suppose, that argument could be made in one sense. Overall, the Juenet's work is bright and glowing with innocent optimism, tempered with just a dash of well-meaning cynicism.<br/><br/>
I won't go into the plot here and hope to avoid spoilers, but the story is an uplifting one of a young waitress, devoid of emotional support as a child, who stumbles upon a special gift of sharing as a young woman. Like many of Hallstrom and Anderson's characters, Amelie starts out emotionally stunted, due to a lack of warmth from her father and neurotic behavior by her mother. Unlike many of the Norwegian and American's characters, however, Amelie gradually breaks out of her shell, helping others, and finally confronts her own personal emotional glass ceiling.<br/><br/>Audrey Tatou is adorable as Amelie, sexy, shy, clever, cowardly, daring and-above all-real. You probably have an Amelie living on YOUR block. (I know I'm keeping MY owns open on MINE!) The rest of the cast is outstanding, too, including Serge Merlin as the elderly `glass-boned' painter and apartment building sage.<br/><br/>I had heard the film mentioned often, but had never seen a trailer or read much about it. I have to admit that, just looking at the front and back of the video box (with Tatou's China doll-white face on the front and the Santa Claus figure on the back, I wasn't sure if it was a live-actor film or a claymation project. I know now! lol<br/><br/>Playful, a tad precocious, yet poignant, Amelie might be the best 2001 movie. This is quite a compliment coming from a huge fan of Hallstrom's The Shipping News and Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. It deserves its praise."

","I'm not one for foreign films. OK, I'm from the Netherlands, so technically just about everything I watch is foreign but you know what I mean. I hate it when I don't know what's being said. Sure, you've got subtitles, and context and non-verbal communication usually helps you on a bit but you still don't really know how the lines are being delivered. Plus you got your eyes shooting back and forth from picture to subtitle the whole time, it's exhausting. Now I saw Lola Rennt (German movie, it's English title is ""Run Lola Run!"") and Fucking Amal (Swedish) and the occasional Manga flick but aside from these cases, I find myself repelled by movietitles I can't even pronounce. Foreign films just ain't my bag.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>When I left my local theater after seeing Amelie, I felt truly...well, happy. Serene, even. I felt like performing random acts of kindness wherever I went. Of course this feeling passed, but it doesn't take away how powerful this movie really is. It's a fairy tale for grown-ups, full of magic, humour, true love, treasure hunts, and all the small, trivial things that make life worth living. I can't believe it's from that bloke who made Alien: Resurrection. This guy's brilliant. He's got cinematography from the level of Fight Club, a truly lovable and unique script and actors who seem born into their roles. Half hour into the movie, I didn't even notice the French anymore. I'm a changed man. I think anyone who says foreign movies ain't worth the effort, have never seen the right ones. The door is open for me now.

"K-Slicer","10","0","1","9 September 2002"," Great Love Story in every sense of the word
","I really liked this movie.  I think this is the best film from France that I have seen since ""The Bridge"" and ""Ridicule"".  The characters and story were complex, offbeat, and quirky.  Audrey Tautou did exceptionally well as the very introverted but very willing do-gooder Amelie.  She had a lot of love for her fellow human beings and in the process she falls in love with a fellow introvert and quirky photo collector named Nino.  It is a great love story in every sense of the word.  I wish Audrey Tautou could have been nominated for an Oscar but the film was nominated five times over, so it wasn't a total downer. Overall, ""Amelie"" rocks!  I give this film a 10 out of 10!"
"csm23","Null","0","1","9 September 2002"," Brilliant
","After watching Amelie for the first time, I thought it was the best film of 2001.  After viewing it again a second time, with even more appreciation, I have come to believe that it's one of the best films -- ever.  And it's French!  My God, Who would have believed it?<br/><br/>Amelie is a woman who lives in a fantasy world.  Conditioned to behave this way in her childhood  -- deprived of playmates, slung between a neurotic mother and an iceberg father -- Amelie prefers to dream, a personality trait that blossoms full-flower in adulthood.   Amelie habitually retreats into the private world of her imagination, where she plays, like a lonely child without any friends.  <br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking:  this is another boring movie about family dysfunction and its long-term consequences, The Price of Tides with a French accent.  But I'm delighted to inform you that it's not.  In fact, it's the very the antithesis of such films.  And it's a work of uncommon brilliance for that same reason:  it takes Amelie's charming but mildly self-destructive idiosyncrasies -- her tendency to dream and remain an introvert, to `mess up her life' with stratagems, play-acting, and meddling, habits unavoidably formed in the bosom of her family -- and shows how wonderful they are.  That's right, wonderful.  <br/><br/>Throughout the film, she is helped into the real world by the affectionate counsel of an archetypal `wise old man;' but, along the way, her preference for fantasy over reality is treated with the grace and generosity of a culture that considers human failure inevitable, perhaps even necessary;  a culture with the courage to say, simply, `that's life.'<br/><br/>
`I love the word fail',' the barroom author says in an important but easily overlooked scene.  It's human destiny, he insists.  Doing his best `sidewalk Socrates,' he adds:  `Life is but a draft, a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.'  It's the perfect, ingenious set up for the question facing Amelie:  Will she fail, allowing herself to merge with the ebb and flow of universal woe, or will she (through love  it's so French!) overcome her common destiny to fail?  <br/><br/>I won't spoil it for you.  Find out for yourself."

","I could probably write a novel here, but I'll keep it fairly short and sweet, since what I have to say about this movie is unequivocal. It took my breath away. Beauty abounds in this film...it wraps all around you and you want to stay in Amelie's world long after the closing credits roll. It is a journey rich in character, color, texture, scenery, human frailty and glory. Audrey Toutou is captivating, and perfect in her role (not to mention impossibly beautiful). The director has created an innovative film in style and substance, a real gem that will stand the test of time. I can hardly imagine loving a movie more than I loved the passionate Amelie."

"fluffy_thealien","10","0","1","29 August 2002"," The ULTIMATE in feel-good movies!
","Very few movies these days have the ability to make you feel good after watching it! Amelie From Montmarte is one of these films. Jean Pierre Jeunet has produced one of the best films of the year and is the ultimate in feel-good cinema. Amelie Poulain's world is one of fantasy and we are instantly pulled into her world. Jeunet's vision of this world within Paris was created by the most beautiful cinematography done by Bruno Delbonnel. It is not the most torturously hard to follow of films but that's just the beauty of it. When you finish watching this film you too feel like going out and helping people all around you.<br/><br/>It will make you cry (though not very often) laugh out loud and just make you feel so warm inside that you wish that the film wouldn't end. This is probably my favourite movie of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys life's simple pleasures or is just has a love for a good film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","All French films, to me, are the same, but ""Amelie"" is a wonderful distillation with something new: Audrey Tautou's astonishing performance in the title role.  Nothing feels false or forced.  The cynics who don't like this film lack the imagination to approach it on a different level: one can see it as a testament to cultural malaise, the boredom which comes from living in the Paris of today, each character is trapped in a prison of his or her own making, do they escape or learn to accept the smallness of their lives?  Romantics will have no use for such interpretations, of course.  The story is magical.  The writing and camera work is superb.  Those who hate this film are either jealous or made of stone."
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","0","1","27 August 2002"," A fairy tale...
","It is useless to sum up this movie's storyline in words - here, a (moving) picture truly DOES say more than a thousand words. Why? Because this movie is an experience, a magical ride in the theme park of today's cinemas, a fairy tale for adults with all the charme and romanticism we experienced as children revived for a few brief minutes in our adult lives.<br/><br/>Such is a difficult achievement. The vibrant colours, the soundtrack, the narration all help, but ultimately, without the performance of Audrey Tautou, this movie would have been quite different, and most likely a lot less successful. It takes her naive face, her impish smile and a good deal of acting to bring to life one of the more memorable characters created in the last few years.<br/><br/>But all that aside, Amelie remains the one thing we are so rarely treated to: A good night story for adults. Without the swashbuckling adventures of ""Princess Bride"" or the tear inducing despair of ""What dreams may come"", it makes us feel like children. A rewarding experience!<br/><br/>a truly great achievement..."

","Some will say they didn't enjoy Amelie : not enough tragedy, not enough stunts, too much of a Paris city that never existed (not so true for me, it depends of the eyes you have to judge this), too much gentleness. But those people are the ones who enjoy nothing more than not to be happy, they might be what in France we call ""enfants gâtés"" : who don't know the price of a fair smile, one of the things usually nobody never gives to nobody for nothing, one of the things people keep for them, selfish we are... What Jeunet gives us here is a reason to smile for a few minutes, and that is very very much, so don't be shy, don't refuse the joy that is given here, let it work as it is intented to work, do this or don't buy the DVD. It is rare that a movie acts as a perfect universe, where you have nothing to add or to remove. Some Capra movies do it for me, Croutching tiger hidden dragon or Hayao Miyazaky movies (Chihiro) too... and so does Amelie. This means it is one of that movies you can watch again and again and again, taking pleasure in the same places, not in missed details. You heard all about it I guess : charming, cute,... it is, and that is funny to see how deeply it is when such feelings are usually not considered as very deep : no passion, no tragedy, no bloody revenge, nothing that makes the heart go 250 bpm. Amelie will easely make you forgot most of the recent ""blockbusters"", this is one of the kind that lasts, one of the kind you can buy in DVD without fear of any disapointment."

"bix171","6","0","1","7 August 2002"," Recommended And Forgotten At The Same Time!
","Though it's easily recommendable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's trifle is just as easily forgettable. Try as he might, Jeunet isn't able to create anything remotely indelible in this sweet story of a wistful young woman (Audrey Tautou) who attempts to make the people who inhabit her world happier; when she comes across a book of strange portrait photography, she sets out to connect with the photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz). Jeunet pulls out all the animated and digital stops at his disposal and while it's never less than lovely to gaze at, it has the qualities of a comedy sketch television show (indeed, it has the feel of a low-key French Monty Python) and when the mysterious old man in the apartment below that appears in every French romance starts to become a major character, you know there isn't much point in paying close attention. Some might find this simple but densely-packed feature charming in its innocence (and goodness knows we need more films like this that have no use for violence) but others might be immune to its charms because of its one-dimensional presentation. It's a film for which it's quite possible to enjoy yet have absolutely no opinion."

A film that concentrates on lifes simplest pleasures, such as popping the bubbles in bubblewrap, or skimming stones. It evokes our childhood pleasures and wraps them around the viewer, simplifying the conventional worries we have in our adult lives. Amelie's position in imdb top 250 films had intrigued me for ages, and now I have finally seen it, I agree that it thoroughly deserves its place. The film intertwines with itself, in an intelligent sophisticated manner, and is delivered to the audience with such effortless simplicity, that you become completely immersed in Neverland!<br/><br/>Amelie is a gem of a movie, and solid proof that France is at the forefront of imagination and storytelling, within the cinematic world!"

Amelie is an beautiful but introverted young woman, hardly noticed by her co-workers at the diner where she works, or by her neighbours in her appartment block. Amelie likes skimming stones on a (french canal name) canal.<br/><br/>Through a moment of chance she finds a child's small steel toybox hidden in her appartment wall, and sets out to return it to the owner, some fifty years after she estimates it was placed there.<br/><br/>Her search is sucessful and she anonymously returns the toybox to the man that was the child who placed the toybox in the wall cavity. She realises then she can do anonymous acts of kindness to friends and strangers alive and gain some sense of wholeness in her life, and subsequently discovers love.<br/><br/>I am strongly reminded of Tom Twiker's Run Lola Run with the snippets of peoples live that are inserted throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There is no obscene language, no violence and no gratuitous sex scenes. There is nudity and a candidness that it often not seen in other mainstream movies which only serves to make Amelie more appealing.<br/><br/>The music is magical, and gives a very light hearted and fairytale feel to the movie. It's also strongly reminesent of the music from City of Lost Children.<br/><br/>I loved Amelie. Amelie is played by Audrie Tautou who is gorgeous and looks like a china doll. She has perfect alabaster skin and very dark eyes and hair. She plays the roll of Amelie with an ease that belies her age (younger than me...sigh). She also has this closed mouth smile which conveys so much emotion in a small gesture. When she finally gets her man the sensuality in the kiss is unbelievable, and so lacking from the ""lets see what you had for breakfast"" hollywood kisses.<br/><br/>Look out for Dominique Pinon too (the clone from city).<br/><br/>I loved Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"

","When watching foreign language films, I like to experience them in their native language rather than in the English-dubbed version. If it is dubbed, it takes away the sense of originality and beauty that was intended to be portrayed to the audience in the original script. It allows for the performances to be more accurate and at the same time, more enjoyable. In Amelie, we are taken through the lifestyle of a woman with a huge imagination who in reality is only a waitress at a small French coffee shop. We are taught to believe that she does not care about the huge things in life, which in this film is Princess Diana's death, and that she only cares about the people around her. Throughout the film, she tries to help them improve their lives and in the process, try to improve her own. It is a beautiful portrait of the human spirit and how one person can make a difference in another person's life. Amelie was played by a lovely French actress named Audrey Tatou, whom in my opinion should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for this movie. She is able to successfully portray a shy woman who is willing to do anything to see her friends happy. Amelie uses clever tactics to enlighten the people she loves and irritate the people she hates. However, until the very end of the movie, her shy personality prevents her from experiencing happiness of her own. Amelie is indeed one of the best films you'll see this year and is a witty, delightful, and well-written romantic comedy. Also, the camera angles that we see in this film are spectacular and allow for us to capture the essence of Amelie's imagination. The camera is able to portray to the audience Amelie's hungriness for love and her longing to live in a seemingly perfect world. That is something that all people around the world long to have as their life. <br/><br/>Lenny's Grade: ****"

In Amelie, we are taken through the lifestyle of a woman with a huge imagination who in reality is only a waitress at a small French coffee shop. We are taught to believe that she does not care about the huge things in life, which in this film is Princess Diana's death, and that she only cares about the people around her. Throughout the film, she tries to help them improve their lives and in the process, try to improve her own. It is a beautiful portrait of the human spirit and how one person can make a difference in another person's life. Amelie was played by a lovely French actress named Audrey Tatou, whom in my opinion should have garnered a Best Actress nomination for this movie. She is able to successfully portray a shy woman who is willing to do anything to see her friends happy. Amelie uses clever tactics to enlighten the people she loves and irritate the people she hates. However, until the very end of the movie, her shy personality prevents her from experiencing happiness of her own. Amelie is indeed one of the best films you'll see this year and is a witty, delightful, and well-written romantic comedy. Also, the camera angles that we see in this film are spectacular and allow for us to capture the essence of Amelie's imagination. The camera is able to portray to the audience Amelie's hungriness for love and her longing to live in a seemingly perfect world. That is something that all people around the world long to have as their life."
"Dilip","10","0","1","3 August 2002"," Lovely fairy tale of a film - one of the most fun, zany, captivating, charming, and magical movies I've seen!
","""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"", or simply ""Amélie"" as it's known here in the States, is one of the most fun, zany, captivating, charming, and magical movies I've seen.  I saw it ""cold"", not knowing anything about it, on a flight home from London in late July 2002, and liked it so much that I plan to see it on the big screen and also to buy it as my first DVD!<br/><br/>The film takes place in Paris and, though the folks speak with French accents, the dialogue in the American version is in English. A breathless narrator explains in a matter-of-fact style how Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is born into a family where the only physical contact she gets is from her father's monitoring her heartbeat; how her Mother dies in a freak suicide that unwittingly kills the unsuspecting Mother as well; the backgrounds of eccentric characters; and narrates on and off as necessary.<br/><br/>Amélie is a quiet and lovable character from the moment we see her as a child.  Her childhood is covered quickly and the film is mainly set in Paris with Amélie in her, I suppose, 20s, working as a waitress.  Her innocent charm, those oh-so-large eyes, the curious characters, and her desire to anonymously help others (and the webs she weaves to accomplish this) all make for a delighful film.<br/><br/>Don't miss this fairy tale of a film!  It has something for everybody - intriguing plot with an underlying quirky humor, fascinating characters, good soundtrack, and a heartwarming story. I'm surprised the film garnered an ""R"" rating; I can't see what would be offensive in the least even for a teenager or pre-teen (except possibly one well-done scene where the rhythms of a couple's sexual union are aurally evidenced in the cafe).  I would give it a 9.5 or 9.6 out of 10!"

There was just nothing to make me say wow nor was there a scene that I cared about seeing twice.<br/><br/>

","I don't know if everybody out there has the same feelin', but I've been hearing some people say that this movie, based on Jeunet's prior work, is just a happy one. Yes, so? I don't understand what's wrong with that. Not everything made under his name has to be made with a surreal, dark atmosphere. I really enjoyed Amelie as much as I did Delicatessen and The city of lost children, and the whole aesthetics of Alien: resurrection. Who gives a damn if this one is only for making you feel good?; we should be grateful instead for that simple reason. No matter what, I really enjoyed this movie as far as finding myself leaving the theatre very lighthearted and smiling. Filmmaker Jean Pierre Jeunet has become one of my cinema heroes now, just because of his fearless, relentless and wide open vision."
"spaceman___spiff","10","0","1","29 July 2002"," the best French romantic comedy you've ever seen, minus the usual pretension
","Take the best French romantic comedy you've ever seen, remove all of the usual pretension, add a career-making charismatic performance by Audrey Tatou, up-to-date and creative visual effects, and a director who obviously APPRECIATES some of the United States' better cinema (the influence of a film like Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" is obvious in ""Amélie"", for example) and you haven't even begun to describe this film.<br/><br/>It sounds funny to say this about the country which pretty much trademarked ""romance"", but many French films lack heart.  They are about love in either a very cold or a very hot way.  ""Amélie"" is neither--it's warm.  It's about affection, and imagination, and simple kindness, and it might coax a tear from even the most jaded heart by the last shot of the film.<br/><br/>One thing which might be confusing to some is that the film is adult in the way that virtually all French films are (the... er... sex act is shown), and yet at the same time the film is structured like a children's storybook fairy tale.  That seems to be completely intentional, since one of its subthemes is certain that ""innocence"" has very little to do with sex.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of a dubbed English track, English speakers willing to actually exercise their eyes and read subtitles will NOT feel that it is that ""foreign"", except for the tendency of people in this film to allow the title character to continuously get away with breaking and entering (all for a good cause, I assure you).<br/><br/>Amélie is definitely something different, and worthwhile."

What a delight -- whimsical, sweet, heart-wrenching and pure wonderment.  I cannot wait for this film to be available on DVD, as it is among my favorite films ever. It's sad that America can't seem to produce such enlightening and life-affirming entertainment as this, and I pray they don't attempt an infamous ""re-make"" -- ""Amelie"" is perfect in every way as it is."
"easmith03","9","0","1","26 July 2002"," Very satisfying
","I watched this movie on DVD, and really enjoyed it.  Amelie, the main character in the film, is painfully shy and introverted.  However, upon feeling the satisfaction of doing a good deed for a stranger she sets out to do more good deeds for others.  There is some great subtle humor, but not any real belly laughs.  Likewise, there are some sentimental moments, but nothing to really draw tears.  The version I saw was in French with English sub-titles.  I found this a little distracting.  The film also uses some interesting techniques to convey the feelings and thoughts of the actors. The characters in the film have kind of sparse dialog, there is a voice-over to fill in the gaps, but the film has many short ""dream like"" or surreal scenes that fill in the characters thoughts and emotions.  For example in one scene when Amelie comes face to face with a man she has a crush on, as she walks away, she actually turns into a puddle of water and splashs on the floor, kind of Alley McBeal style.  Sometimes there are little dreams played out briefly just in a corner of the screen.  I found this unique for a film, and thought they added conveying the emotion of the characters in the film. The film has a different look, style, pace to it from movies I'm used to seeing.  Maybe because it is French, or maybe just because it is a different kind of film.  This unique look is something that I enjoyed about the movie. I found a couple of spots where the story seemed a bit slow, but all in all, I found it to be really entertaining, and left me feeling quite satisfied."

","I have always wondered why at the Oscars, certain kind of films never get any Oscar, or even a nomination. That is especially when it comes to Science Fiction, Comedy, Kids' stuff and Horror.<br/><br/>But I know, a real good comedy is hard to find. Mostly they are fun for a small group of people, who understand the typical humor of the country where the movie comes from.<br/><br/>Comedies from England, always do great in Europe, as soon as they arrive in the USA, they get censored (...) Comedies from America at the other hand, seem to get stuck in humor so simple that I get bored after 5 minutes. You won't find them in my top 100 of best movies.<br/><br/>Watching Amelie is like you discover a new kind of chocolate that tastes even better than the best praline you already tasted from Belgium. It is almost impossible. From the first minute this movie starts you are not only 'amused' tempted to laugh out loud in the cinema, but you constantly feel related to Amelie. It's just the little things that are happening. The ways she teases the boss of the grocery, it is what we did when we were kids or would LOVE to do even though we are grown up. In the meantime, the film keeps tight with the line of the story, the lives of the carracters, and the way Amelie changes their life.<br/><br/>I never had a weak heart for French movies, but this one makes me love France, and makes me love Amelie."

I have found with my family and friends that either you are head over heels in love with this film, or you really hate it. I simply can not understand how anyone can hate it.<br/><br/>This is the story of a sheltered lonely girl who grows up only to shelter herself away from others UNTIL she makes a discovery, and then everything changes. She starts to do good for others and in the end has something good happen to herself. It's sweet, fun, quirky and charming. It's filmed in a kind of muted colours. A look that was a product of the 90's(to which I am getting fed up with). The off the wall characters are reminiscent of STRICTLY BALLROOM or BIG EDEN. <br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is a welcome face in films. She is as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn, at least to me. I have seen her before in HAPPENSTANCE and enjoyed her performance there, BUT HERE, she really shines. I am looking forward to seeing her in more films. Mathieu Kassovitz is a oddly cute actor who has done both French and American films. I hope he gets better roles like this from now on. <br/><br/>This is a real gem of a film like PRELUDE TO A KISS or SHALL WE DANCE. I wished it had won something at the Oscars but oh well. I highly recommend this film and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."
"somamoons","10","0","2","22 July 2002"," My new favorite movie
","At it's heart, this film is about a ""detail-oriented"" girl that refuses to grow up. Because of an isolated childhood she has difficulty relating to other people. Thus, by adulthood she doesn't bother trying to form relationships. She lives in her own fantasy world and is perfectly fine with it. But after contacting two quirky neighbors, who have also lived (somewhat depressing) isolated lives, she begins to question her decision. With some prodding by one of these neighbors, she has to decide to make the leap and ""grow up"" or stay lonely forever.<br/><br/>Truthfully I went into this movie expecting a little bit less. I read so many reviews that said it was an ""un-deep"" love story, that I expected an artsy French version of a Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks film. But how many Ryan/Hanks films have you seen that involve so many blunt jokes about sex (counting orgasms, people working in porn shops, ""fur pie doesn't sell""...)? This is definitely a sophisticated comedy, far surpassing any Ryan/Hanks film by miles. It's also one of my new favorite movies of all time. Audrey Tautou is stunning, the quirky little additions (gnomes, records made of syrup, photo booths) make me laugh, and the direction is pure eye candy. If you haven't seen this film, go get it now!"

This movie is so<br/><br/>rich in detail and character that it doesn't need to beg to be<br/><br/>watched more than once, it charms you into wanting to seeing it<br/><br/>again.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre in general and yet there<br/><br/>isn't a single moment in this film I didn't like.<br/><br/>I think the director/co-writer has been working his way up to<br/><br/>something like this. It seems to be a completely undiluted vision. I only hope he has more to give us, because this one is going to<br/><br/>be hard to top.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that the Academy once again didn't have a clue<br/><br/>when they not only didn't nominate this for the main best picture<br/><br/>category but it didn't even win best foreign film. Why was Crouching tiger Hidden Dragon nominated the year<br/><br/>before in the main best picture category and not this in 2001?<br/><br/> I love dark depressing films and yet this film is so great that it<br/><br/>makes its way into my list of favorites. it is the epitome of a feel<br/><br/>good movie, without being cheap or sugary. Pure fun.<br/><br/>Exactly what movies should do. It makes you think. It makes you<br/><br/>happy. It makes you forget your troubles for two hours and renews<br/><br/>your faith (temporarily) in humanity. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>Well maybe accurate subtitles. The just released DVD has fairly inaccurate subtitles. I counted a<br/><br/>least five mistakes in the English subtitles. For example, Amelie<br/><br/>phones Nino and tells him to turn to page 56 (or something to the<br/><br/>effect) but the subtitle reads ""turn to Page St"" What the hell does that mean? Another is there are numerous references to Lady Diana's death. The grocer is talking about the alcohol level in the driver of her car<br/><br/>when it crashed. However the subtitles read. ""The trucker had an<br/><br/>alcohol level of ..."" Now we have no idea that they are talking about Diana's chauffeur,<br/><br/>you can clearly hear the grocer saying chauffeur. Chauffeur is not<br/><br/>trucker in English. The meaning of that line is lost. unless you<br/><br/>know a little French. Unfortunately, my French is not good enough<br/><br/>to pick out all the other possible mistranslations. It's very<br/><br/>disheartening to suspect  you might be missing more because<br/><br/>some dumb ass translator wasn't doing their job right. French is<br/><br/>an easy language to translate into English. It's not like Japanese<br/><br/>or Russian. So why the errors? <br/><br/>Who knows. Maybe so they can re-release a better version later<br/><br/>and make everyone buy it again.<br/><br/>Anyways. great film. Still worth buying on DVD."

No, we don't need an orchestra bursting out in a musical finale. No, we don't need two people falling into each others arms immediately. No! No! No!

Whether the title character (played with wide-eyed whimsy by Aurdrey Tautou) is having her heart examined by her physician father, skipping stones across a canal, playing matchmaker for lonely hearts, reuniting worn down old men with their innocent past, or even torturing those who deserve it, the direction and acting keep the movie rapidly moving along with such emotion, exuberance, and charm that one forgets he is watching a movie and gets completely drawn in.  All this despite the fantastical nature of the film and its characters.  It is rare that a film can be so charming and affecting without being overly sentimental.

","Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a winsome young woman who works as a waitress in a small Parisian bistro. Raised by a nervous mother and a doctor father (Rufus), the only attention she was given as a child was when he would give her an annual medical check-up. This fleeting display of love would make her heart beat so fast that her parents believed she was sick, too sick to go to school, so Amelie created her own fantasy world, filled with danger and adventure. Amelie glides through her adult life unaware that the loneliness she carried as a child is slowly building inside her, until one day, after hearing of the death of Princess Diana, Amelie decides she must do something to help herself.<br/><br/>This she does, by helping other people. After finding a small box hidden in the wall of her apartment, Amelie decides she will find the original owner and return it to them. This she does anonymously Watching from afar, Amelie sees the overjoyed impact this has on the old man, who is reunited with his prized childhood possessions, and from this, she is hooked, hooked on helping the people closest to her. However, when Amelie sees an old friend, who as a child was an outcast similar to herself, Amelie's beating heart once again goes into overdrive. The man is Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz). Nino works for the most part in a sex shop in the lower part of town, but his major hobby is collecting the discarded pictures from public photo booths, and assembling the images in his scrapbook.<br/><br/>Both Amelie and Nino would appear to be made for each other, but still Amelie is unable to approach him. Instead she decides to follow him around; playing mental games similar to the ones she played on the people whose lives she was able to sort out. All of this is secondary however to Jeunet's striking depiction of Paris as a rose-tinted, candy cane world, in which the clouds are shaped like bunnies and love conquers all. It is through this empty majesty of photography, production design, and one of the most adorably different leading ladies in the from of Tautou, that we allow ourselves to be pulled into this world.<br/><br/>The film coasts along from one good deed to another, with one glorious shot after another, so detailed in its execution that just thinking about a scene later will make you wont to re-experience the film all over again. Certainly there are some minor flaws to the film, a little to sugary in some places, but nothing too distracting, and it certainly isn't the dumbing down of foreign cinema that some critics hailed it as. Amelie is nothing more than a sweet natured film about, for the most, a sweet natured character, and is a film so entertaining and enjoyable, that after viewing Amelie once you will no doubt be intoxicated by the joy that the film transmits. 5/5"

Poulain certainly has a charm comparable to that goddess from Roman Holiday... We get so inside her head as she tries to fool around with other people's lives that we are hypnotized...while this may work less with some men, this movie certainly has a charm with women who identify with Amelie's universal position.  But the film does more than just lead you along, it gives you so much from point to point.  I don't dare ruin it.  It is lovely from the very start with Amelie's childhood..."

","Oh my! I have yet to see a more beautiful love letter to film lovers and/or a city (Paris). After seeing this in the theater, I walked out with the biggest and most satisfying grin I've worn in a very, very long time. A few weeks later, I got my eager hands on a widescreen bootleg copy (don't worry, I'm buying a copy just as soon as the DVD is released here in U.S.) and was amazed at how many sequences I had forgotten. The film is stuffed with so many great scenes, it's no wonder. Nearly every second of this movie is beautifully photographed, very funny or touching, or just so amazing and inventive that you lose yourself to the progression of events. Usually, it is all of these things.<br/><br/>I am not someone who gives good reviews to all movies. Far from it. Sometimes I think I should refer to myself as a film-hater, as there are so many more movies I hate than love. Then something like Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain comes along and I love it so much I momentarily forget about crap like Snow Dogs or Princess Diaries or even - gasp - Glitter. This movie makes every bad piece of wasted celluloid almost worthwhile if it that's how the course of events has to be to produce something as awe-inspiring as the character and life of Amelie. (Yes, I realize that the above named movies were all from Hollywood, but France has its share of stinkers too.)<br/><br/>I love this movie and even the fact that it's kind-of a Romantic Comedy cannot dissuade my enjoyment or the big smile I wear (when I'm not laughing out loud) every time I watch it.<br/><br/>You have to see it. Double plus good!"

","It is usually the American studios taking over European movies and themes for remake. This film goes the opposite way. All the theme and environment is very much like 'American Beauty' or 'The Best You Can Get'. An innocent introspected waitress becomes the blessed angel for the lives of people around, and all goes as in Hollywood until she meets her destined half. Then, can she help herself and fix her own destiny? The stuff works amazingly, the combination of American plot and technique with the Paris chic, and French characters creates the ground for good acting and enjoyable cinematography. You will hardly forget the superb eyes of the main character. I enjoyed this movie!"

However, there was one subplot in this film that I found absolutely brilliant and very memorable: the face in the torn photos.  This stone-faced shaven man had his picture taken all over instaphoto booths and then ripped his own pictures: why?  As they ask, is he afraid he will forget what he looks like?  Or some ghost haunting the subways and trains of Montmartre? The revelation about who this guy is and why he did what he did is so PERFECT, so damn genius, that it alone made me grin more than the rest of the film's magnificent acting, special FX, narration, and cinematography.

","I'm not a lover of French cinema. I'm am a half-liker of Art House Cinema. But this movie is great, in a limited capacity.<br/><br/>I can see why some art-house goers did not like ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"", since it doesn't bear any of the art-house characteristics (depressing message about the hopelessnes of life, detailed sex, and characters that die in the rain of an overdose of some drug).<br/><br/>This movie is a whimsical delight for the eye and ear, while having the message ""that if you do good things you would be rewarded"" karma-type nonsense. Much better than a movie about dance marathon on the Titanic while it is sinking and being looked on by other ships who don't want to help them. (Yes, there's no movie like that, but you never know what the French might do!). <br/><br/>The art of the movie in how it is put together. Each shot was planned to the last dot, sketched. There's no rugged post-production slow motion, no bad special effects. The planning had to be done to a T! <br/><br/>For instance: one scene, four ID photos start talking to one of the characters. And the photos are all the same person. And then they start arguing with each other! Yikes. How do you plan something like that?<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent, the sound effects weird, the pacing bizarre, the characters are bizarre, yet human in a looney way. Fun, fun, fun. Maybe be just slightly too perverse to take seriously (sex-jokes never seem to make you take movies seriously; why do you think the Monty Python movies never won any Oscars?).<br/><br/>It depicts Montmatre as a beautiful district in the heart of Paris (in reality they had to paint some houses to cover up graffiti) where dreams come true and outcasts meet. I suggest you go see it if you don't want a headache because of ""Mulholland Drive"" or a tear for ""In the Bedroom""."

"craigboney","9","0","1","16 October 2001"," Mindblowingly imaginative, magical but a bit overlong
","Amelie is a beautiful film.  Visually it is absolutely stunning, with some marvelous sequences that delight the eye; the story is wonderful, quite well balanced although (only very) occasionally becoming saccharine.<br/><br/>The first third introduces you to Amelie as a child and her family. This is superbly done, at a frenetic pace with delicious jaunty humour and is truly inspiring to watch.  Particularly good is the development of the characters; many have endearing quirks which are wonderfully explained in a comical quasi-documentary style.  'Amelie' is perfect in every way up to and including Amelie's first good deed, a moment which is truly wonderful to experience and as life affirming as anything I've seen since The Straight Story.  <br/><br/>After this, the movie is a little less inspiring, detailing the peripheral people in Amelie's town and their lives.  Were it not for the momentum lost in this section, this would undoubtedly be a 10/10 picture.  Some of the repeated jokes (gnomes, confusing grocers) begin to lose their edge.  The feel of the film here becomes more reminiscent of 'Delicatessen', also directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.<br/><br/>However, the final third picks up on shy Amelie's quest for love and regains some of the vigour previously lost.  Audrey Tautou is brilliant in the title role, and it's good to see Matthieu Kassovitz (writer and director of La Haine) in the wonderful role of Nino.  All credit, it's a lot harder too make a good 'feelgood' film than a cynical one, and Jeunet has succeeded with aplomb here.<br/><br/>9/10."

It seemed odd, but I was curious to see how that turned out, so in spite of my general mistrust of French films, which are all too often dull and pointless, I watched Amelie.<br/><br/>Yes, it is sweet and charming, but it's also wildly imaginative and original, full of clever ideas and stylish direction.

Audrey Tautou (Amélie) steals the show and my heart from the very beginning, her unique world something that seems so near, like a piece of my mind and soul being played right before my astonished eyes.  Her Paris setting a playground for her (and the audience's) imagination, Amélie seems to have the Midas touch when it comes to setting right in her small, cheerful world. Whether it's setting up unexpected romance or simply keeping an old man company, her kindness, wit, spirit, physical and inner beauty radiates off the screen and fills me with hope in kinship, in love, and in all of humanity.  What a soundtrack too, Yann Tiersen breathes such energy into this film, providing the canvas so to speak, so that Audrey Tautou, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the rest of this terrific cast may paint this romantic masterpiece.

","Amelie's not a movie about learning to be good, as many critics said. And is not a romantic movie too, in my opinion; not yet an optimistic movie. Amelie is a movie on how to SURVIVE; the story is not romantic, nor optimistic, but very very PESSIMISTIC. It's a WONDERFUL movie. It is also VERY REALISTIC: the real sense of the movie is, as some filosophers said, that the world is not good or bad himself, but is OUR ACTION that makes it bad or good. In this case, it's only Amelie action that makes his world a little better. Only this. Just see the definition of ""falling in love"" that the coffee owner gives to Amelie: it is VERY debunking. You'll probabilly never heard something similar in any American movie. The ones that criticize that surely not perfect movie must remember that there's not many other movies around that can be compared with this.

","Jeunet's tricksy and quite charming ode to romance and an oddly sanitised Paris walks a thin line between being delightful and being a little irritating. The imagination of the story's telling and the cinematic zest that it possesses help to cover up its somewhat excessive length and the incessant loveliness of it all.  Even the brittle bone disease of one of the characters and Amelie's occasionally commented on melancholia get short shrift as the sunshine and light of the whole film bulldoze through anything that may upset the viewer.

It's so ""je ne sais quoi"" - I felt somewhat helpless and surrounded by this unstoppable pace.<br/><br/>
The music is great and helps push the film along, lift it up and attain pure harmony. The cinematography is lush. The characters imaginative. It is a story about relationships beyond all else - Amelie and her father, her father and her mother, Amelie with her boyfriend, the two in the coffee shop, the first man she heps and his daughter, the caretaker with her deceased husband, the grocer and his assistant, the assistant and the painter, the painter and Amelie... the list is endless.<br/><br/>It works so well because it has a subtlety lacking in English language films. It's not that it can be taken on many levels; it was almost as if it didn't need to be taken on any level! I was confused where to take it and in the end just let it tread its path. It is hard to exactly analyse what brings this up fro merely good to great but it's as if the screen is alive with physical ""pheromones"" that pull you in, make you watch.<br/><br/>So the painter seems to know a bit too much about Amelie at the start and the person who lived in her flat in the 50s, he can't paint the middle girl because she evades him, yet she is a coward (a depiction of Amelie). The tapes she sends him have no concrete explanation... you think of many purposes. Yet in all this weirdness you don't stop to question (too much) you just let it take you along on the journey.<br/><br/>This is a rich, colourful and loving child of Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

The movie was real art, it could remind people their long-time-ago forgotten emotions; but Amélie would only be the half of it is now, without the music it contains. The songs are so carefully placed in the movie, so that it can effect you any time. The scene where BredoTeau(yep, BredoTeau, just like Toto) find his box in the phone cell, plays La Dispute, or when Amélie makes the cake while crying and thinking about Nino, plays La Valse d'Amélie... These songs are real art, Too. But thanks to Jeunet, which heard about Yann Tiersen between the shoots and asked him for a soundtrack"

","Out of 10 people who goes to see ""Amelie"", 10 will come out smiling. Such is the power and allure of this gem of a movie. ""Sweet, quirky, funny, romantic, magical, colourful...."" the list of superlatives just goes on and on.<br/><br/> Finally, one film truly deserves whatever accolades thrown its way. What's more, some of the praises were heaped onto this French romantic comedy by people who seldom see subtitled movies. Its therefore not surprising that ""Amelie"" has since become the longest running French film in recent Singaporean history. Opened in Dec 19 2001, it played to packed houses all the way till mid March this year. Such is the magical common touch ""Amelie"" has on the pulse of many movie goers.<br/><br/> Amelie Poulain, our immensely likable lead character, was a shy neurotic waitress living her uneventful life in a ""Postcard Paris"". Then on an eventfully catastrophic day, Amelie made an enlightened decision - she would become a do-gooder. But this mentally twisted creature doesn't want to be just any straight-forward guardian angel. She seemed also hell-bent on amusing herself(and the audience) by devising indirect plans to help her unknowing subjects along the way. But amidst all her saintly good deeds, who is gonna help Amelie, a tortured soul herself?<br/><br/> A film like ""Amelie"" is a priced rarity. Its dramatic/ comedic balance is so delicately struck that you unwittingly find yourself swept along the way and gradually sucked in by its honey centred premise.<br/><br/> Perhaps due to the unfortunate events since Sep 11, Amelie has unintentionally evolved into a global phenomenon. People viewed it as a comfort picture supplying much needed antidotal escapism in these troubled times. Its idealised and innocent take on love and humanity is also a timely reminder for us all to reassess how our real world is shaping up even as we speak.<br/><br/> But of course, there will always be sour cynics out there, who think films have to be raw & brutal to truly qualify as art. This feel good French fable may thus come off as being too fluffy an entry for their approval.<br/><br/> Thankfully, the majority of us is just looking for some upliftingly good time, while allowing ourselves to be touched by some movie magic along the way. And we need look no further than ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain""."

","I loved this movie. I loved it's imagery, I loved it's message. I think this movie's content can be put into one statement. It's about getting over yourself, doing something that you've never did before, taking a big risk - and becoming a lucky person, finding your destination in life. I think everybody has experienced such a situation in life before, what I mean is that you feel that your life needs changes, that you feel what you have to do in a certain situation, that you feel that it is just ONE step ahead and it would be easy to do it. But on the other hand it makes you scared, makes you unable to move or to speak. This is what everybody's problem is in the movie, these characters are all losers but in their heart they know that they can defeat all this. But they are unable to do this little step to find their luck. Their need a little help from outside. Amelie gives them some help. Amelie is a person that knows this decision, helps other people but runs away from her own problem.  But all in all we knew that this step must be done by yourself, this is why Amelie succeeds. At the end she just did it. It was so easy just open the door, but it was so difficult for her. She needs the help of that old guy but all in all it's herself that opens the door.

Every character in this film has a story to tell, not one of them is left in the dark or un-developed.<br/><br/>Audrey Tautou is a goddess! Those eyes! That smile! I laughed with her and cried with her.<br/><br/>How will Jean-Pierre Jeunet top this? Then again, Amelie topped Delicatessen which is still up there with my all time favourites (We'll ignore Alien Resurrection, I think). There is so much use of colour in Jeunet's Paris, fair enough it isn't a true reflection of the city but hey! this is a fantasy world where love rules!!!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet you simply have to hunt it out, I guarantee you will love it. And don't be put off by the subtitles, after 5 minutes you forget they are there anyway.<br/><br/>It's rare for me to go so over the top with praise (especially for a romantic comedy) but this is truly a magnificent film and deserves no less than 10 out of 10."
"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","9","0","1","1 April 2002"," Made me walk out with a huge almost ear-to-ear smile on my face
","With all the praise this movie has already received, my comments run the risk of sounding completely redundant. I'll try to keep it interesting anyway. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is well known for his collaborations with Marc Caro, the results of which are displayed in the visually lavish but emotionally empty films of Delicatessen and The City Of Lost Children. They are fairytale films set in fantastical worlds. They are also dark movies. Both of which I enjoy. What made the films overcome their lack of emotion for me was the strong atmosphere. And with Amelie, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has brought his skill to create such an atmpshere to a brighter kind of fairytale. And even a cynical moviegoer such as myself must admit it works wonders.<br/><br/>The characters of Amelie inhabit some world located between the full fantasy world of Jeunets previous efforts and a real place. Paris, as seen in Amelie, isn't the real place. And many of the characters aren't real people. They aren't allowed to develop into real people. These are the main elements Jeunet brings along from his earlier films. On the other hand, he's determined to create a main character with whom it's easier to identify with than his usual protagonists, and even though Amelie is an introverted eccentric, she never becomes any less than a believable human being. Most of this is of course thanks to the brilliant performance by Audrey Toutou. She's an unusually charismatic presence in this film. And while she may be the heart, soul and title character of the film, the rest of the cast root their archetypes in real human emotion, creating a set of figures easy to connect with on an emotional level. Jeunet has understood, fairytales aren't merely about the magical woods, big dragons or the intellectual interpretation of its meanings, they're about empathizing with the characters.<br/><br/>Jeunet also tries hard to bring some innovation into the genre of the romantic comedy. He does this by inserting streaks of fantasy, humour that actually is funny (the suicide fish, anyone?) and every cinematic trick in the book. Indeed, stylistically a film Amelie is strongly connected to is Fight Club. It takes the visual audacity of that film, but replaces its darkness and its cynicism by bright, vibrant colours and sheer happiness. And because it's so honest and so incredibly funny, this feelgooder did something no Hollywood feelgooder could ever do: it actually made me feel good. Good examples of extraordinary use of cinematic trickery abound in Amelie. But just when you think his box of tricks is going to overwhelm the underlying emotional story, Jeunet captures the emotion perfectly. Easiest example: the wonderfully understated kissing scene. And Jeunet has also discovered to use his trickery for more than creating atmosphere; he now uses them as storytelling tools.<br/><br/>Now, amidst the truckloads of positive review for Amelie, there were a few detractors. The main points of criticism: sentimentality and right-wing propaganda/racism. The point about Amelie being sentimental is, I feel, utter rubbish. Yes, it's a happy film, and no, it has no cynicism about it whatsoever. But does Jeunet ever allow sickly saccharine cliches to enter the equation? Does false emotion ever take over? Definitely not. His Paris may be an imagined or rather fondly remembered one and not even related to the existing place, but's it's a fairytale to begin with, like his previous films. It doesn't aim for realism. What Jeunet wants to do is reaffirm your belief in the fact that true love is out there and that little things can make a difference. All he wants you to do is to walk out of your cinema with a big happy smile on your face. Avoiding the harsher sides of daily life in order to achieve this is not sentimentality, it's optimism. The second complaint involves apparent racism in the film, for while its Paris may be part fantasy, why are ethnic groups left out to such an extent (the real Paris like all huge cities is a melting pot of cultures)? Honestly, this never ever occured to me while watching the film. There may be a rich vein of nostalgia throughout, a kind of conservative longing for simpler times gone by, for sure, but this is hardly enough to connect it to right-wing propaganda and certainly not racism. And he or she who looks closely WILL notice ethnic minorities in Jeunets Paris, that they are not among the protagonists was doubtlessly not something the makers were very conscious about. It's about hiring the right people for the jobs, about creating an environment for the character of Amelie that may not be realistic but must be believable in a way. It's not about equal opportunity. So for me, these critics tried to find flaws a little too desperately.<br/><br/>Amelie, c'est parfait, then? No, for me, it wasn't perfect either. But the flaws I can find are so tediously irrelevant for the enjoyment of this film they're hardly worth discussing. Still, a slight annoyance was that Amelie sometimes doesn't do well (although she means it well). In a scene Collignon is nearly electrocuted. There's something judgemental and unproductive in her actions against him. Funny and motivated they may be, for me they didn't work as do-gooding. Does that detract from its entertainment value? Not really.<br/><br/>And since there's actually a lot more to it than a simple romcom (there's the Lady Di angle, plus all the wonderful underlying stories about chance, destiny and taking actions to guide' both, and a lot of extras, like, say, the scene in which Amelie watches the reaction to her death or summarizing characters in likes and dislikes) I believe this really is one of the best films I've seen the last few years. In one word: wonderful.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

","In this creative comedy several subplots (the father and his dwarf, the neighbor and his painting, the 2 fruitstand workers, the restaurant employee and her admirer) weave their way cleverly together as the central question about Amelie's romance wends its way to a resolution.  All the characters are oddly real 3-dimensional people, so they seem like caricatures (in the way most of us are caricatures of the perfect symmetry of Hollywood's beautiful people).  Both Amelies (the little girl and the young woman) are charmingly quirky--it would be hard to not fall in love with Audrey Tautou. This movie might not be for someone who needs a standard plot or hates subtitles, but if a clever plot, creative screenplay, imaginative director, wonderfully amusing complex characters, and charming star are enough, you will probably love this movie as much as I did."

"taikman","9","0","1","5 March 2002"," A charming and beautifully shot modern fairytale.
","Simply delightful.<br/><br/>'Amelie' is the highest grossing French film of all time, and it's been nominated for many awards: this is not surprising, as it's almost irrestitably charming. The story follows the title character, Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), who had a childhood so miserable that Blubber, her goldfish, attemped to commit suicide. No, it's not depressing: instead it's rather quirkily funny. The story is narrated in an offhand way, which makes the almost surreal things that happen all the more amusing. If I can be so boring as to throw in a literature reference, I think the writer must have been a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Thousand Years of Solitude' - the style, a mixture of nostalgia, fantasy, melancholy, romance and comedy, is similar.<br/><br/>Amelie grows up to be a shy, odd young woman but her life changes one day when, in a typical contrast of tragedy and happiness, she hears the news that Princess Di has died, accidently dislodges a panel in her flat and discovers hidden behind it an old box of mementos from a child in the 1950s. She decides to track down the owner and, if he is happy to see the mementos of his childhood, devote herself to improving the lives of those she knows and likes. He is, and she does - but in bizarre and secret ways. Amelie is, as her friend 'The Glass Man' says, 'fond of strategems'. For example when she was 6 she got revenge on a cruel neighbour by climbing up on his roof during a World Cup soccer game and disconnecting his aerial every time France look like they're going to score. She gets more subtle with age.<br/><br/>The movie is about more than this though, as Amelie falls in love with Nino, another weird loner. She doesn't the courage to approach him, so she goes through the most convoluted process of getting his attention and meeting him. Her messing about is both frustrating and very funny.<br/><br/>The movie relies heavily on the elfin Tautou, who is one of those women (such as say, Kate Winslet) who are very sexy because their beauty is unconventional. She, and the rest of the film, are wonderful  to watch - the camerawork is superb and most scenes are shot with a slightly golden filter that heightens the fairytale atmosphere. And because it's in French, the most lyrical of languages, and has excellent music, it's a pleasure to listen to as well.<br/><br/>If you don't come out of it feeling better about life, stir a little less cynicism into your morning coffee.<br/><br/>RATING: 9/10<br/><br/>Tane"

All this, spread on a Seurat-like pointillistic canvas of fresh music that evokes Satie at his best. Take Paris as it always appears two or three days after you have been away for a while, throw in the charm and wit of a tasteful comedy, add the sweet thrill of playing pranks on a misery character and stir for 90 minutes in flowy parisian music, and voilà! Amelie is served."

","I hereby forgive Jeunet for his horrific trip to the Hollywood dungheap called ""Alien 4"", since just in time, before getting too contaminated, he has retraced his steps back to France and made the type of movie again that we all enjoyed so much before, even though this obviously is quite a step away as well from both Delicatessen and La cité des enfants perdus. Audrey Tatou (and no, she's no bloody Audrey Hepburn, Americans always try to claim something as their own; get a life and lose that inferiority complex, however well deserved) is simply magical in this movie and I only hope she can make movies after this without being identified with this part. Jeunet's direction is flawless and while his past movies leaned a bit towards stringing together a series of visual ideas, this time his creativity is completely subservient to the story and that's why this is his best film to date. Anybody who doesn't like this movie should check their heartbeat, because I'm sure they will find it missing."

","I find it extremely interesting that critics that criticize this movie for being ""oversentimental"" and ""glorifying a perspective of Paris that doesn't exist""  seem to miss the point as far as what the movie is truly all about: simple compassion for a fellow human being.  In this movie you not only see that from the title role, but also from the ""Glass Man"" that finally convinces her to come out of her shell and risk it all to pursue a man that she loves. You also see Amelie help out the people in her life, from a blind man to a simple grocer's assistant, to her father and, most importantly, helping herself.  This movie demonstrates a dose of kindness and compassion that this world desperately needs.<br/><br/>I'm not a sentimentalist or a goodie to shoes.  Sheesh, I'm a cynic when it comes to romantic comedies.  However, Jean Pierre Jeunet demonstrates an intelligence when it comes to showing the theme of inter-relationships. He did this with ""Delicatessan"" and ""City of Lost Children"", but those films had the science fiction genre mixed in with the equation.  With ""Amelie"", he demonstrates his ability as an incredible storyteller of many genres.  I just hope Academy members recognize it's value in one of its 5 nominations that it richly deserves; especially in original screenplay and foreign film."

","This is indeed one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  Coming from my long time favorite director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is separated from Caro, and the difference shows.  This movie indeed can not be compared to the previous works of Jeunet, because it is an entirely different movie altogether.  It includes all the tiny details of Jeunet's precise ideas, and creates an amazing story of passion, love, and sex, though as three different things.  Amélie herself is terribly captivating and amusing as she carefully and meticulously tracks down her, as you may call it, soulmate, although I think she would have an entirely other word for it.  But make no mistake, this is no simple love story.  It is amazingly clever and exciting, and very very funny.  Of course, don't watch it expecting another City of Lost Children, it is far from the dark, hidden worlds of the hidden lair of the dreamless genius.  To the contrary everything is open for all to see, and there are no secrets here.  And so, to take the easy way out, I can say no more but see it yourself."

","It's so great to see those reactions about Amelie. I'm French (so sorry for my bad Anglish!) and I'm glad that American people like French cinema, because it's worth to be famous, as well as European cinema. Some great movies have been made this year and Amelie is one of them.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I can't understand why some of you compare Amelie to Life is beautiful ! It's amazing (and stupid)to compare those two movie because they're completely different. Is it because they're Europeans? Well, it's not a reason. Jeunet's movies and Benigni's movies are completely different. I can't imagine Benigni realizing Delicatessen ! I'm glad to be French and European, because I love cinema, and i have the possibility to see every kind of movies. In United-States, people seems not to have the possibility to see others movies but American movies. Am I wrong? Just because they are not distribuated in U.S.A. It's unfair, and fortunately this system starts to change. ( but it's not thanks to Jean-Marie Messier, the boss of Vivendi-Universal who tries to change the identity of the French cinema).<br/><br/>About Audrey Tautou, I recommend you to see ""Vénus Beauté (institut)"" (I only know the french title), in which she's wonderful, once again.<br/><br/>About Mathieu Kassovitz, this great director and actor, there is a movie which is on the french screens since this week (so not before a while in U.S.) called ""Amen"" by Costa-Gavras. It's a masterpiece, dealing with the silence of the Vatican about the Shoah during the second world war. Really great.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish Amelie won an Oscar, but if it isn't the case, it's not a big deal because there are many wonderful movie this year. ""No man's land"" for example. It deserves as well as Amelie to win this Oscar.<br/><br/>And if you have the possibility to watch those movies, just go ahead: ""The navigators"" by Ken Loach (England), ""La chambre du fils"" by Nanni Moretti (Italy). And instead to watch Vanilla sky (which sucks) go to see the original movie called ""Open your eyes"" by Alejandro Amenabar. It's 100 times better.<br/><br/>About the Oscars, I might be wrong, but I think that Mulholland Drive by David Lynch is not nominated. It's unfair, for a movie like that. It's one of my fave americans movies (and one of the most loved by french people) of 2001. With Traffic , Requiem For a Dream, The Fellowship of the ring, Moulin Rouge (which is an Australian movie, I know), and The Others. Just some great movies! I wish American cinema made more great movies like that, instead of making bull**** like ""Planet of the apes"", ""Pearl harbour"" or ""Tomb raider"".<br/><br/>I hope it will happen more often for an european movie to be liked by american people. There are so much great european movies that Americans do not know... yet."

The first time you'll probably be reading the subtitles too much to notice the wonderful visual feast that the movie provides, and the second time you'll be too caught up in the visuals to catch the amazing score that Yann Tiersen provides.

","I remember hearing a review of this film on the radio, the review was about as long as this movie. The critic liked the movie, I think, its hard to tell sometimes with them, but what I definitely felt was that he held back and couldn't throw in for it completely. His main complaint was the cinematic tricks which he said were overdone. I disagree. He also felt that the director blasts your psyche with images that are so poignantly memorable, you forget them. Or that is probably my interpretation of what he said after I just viewed this film, either way I agree with him. While watching it I was truly amazed by the beauty and thought of what I was witnessing. But its like an afternoon at the art museum, its all so much your brain simply wont register it and you wind up forgetting most of what you see. The story is a simple French love tale. Truly, that's all there is when you peel away the modernism and breathtaking cinematography. Its also the camera filming an ongoing battle of what's more enthralling, the Parisian backdrop or the heroine's beauty. Its a battle worth viewing. As someone who at times throws up his hands at the ever changing world and sees a Western Europe trying so hard to be American, this movie is all France. Its long, and halfway through you may find yourself checking your watch and groan just a wee bit. But when it ends, you'll forget it and want to do it all over again.

All the director has done is apply a slick veneer of TV-commercial techniques to a very old story, emphasizing trendy camerawork and fancy cutting. There are giggles throughout, and you'd have to be an awful curmudgeon not to like it, but less sugar might have actually made it tastier.

","So this is a film that is going down a storm in France, with over three million spectators in its four month run. most of the comments here seem to describe it as a poetic fairy tale with brilliant editing and camera work, which is all true. It is also a film that works to praise the poetic and the magical inthe ordinary. Amelie is not a princess, nor does she need to be to achieve her destiny. The film seems to centre on the quest of the individual for their identity, humourously played upon in the whole passport photograph sequence. A secure identity is conferred by a heterosexual relationship. So, a lovely film with some moving moments and memorable scenes but ultimately a very conventional moral. Slightly disturbing perhaps that in the 21st century, Billy Elliott, the other great cinematic individual made good achieves his success in a career, albeit an unconventional one, whereas the female Amelie still has a man to make her whole. Not saying I didn't feel for her when he walked out (brilliantly portrayed by her turning into water) just that this film is not so radically different from anything Hollywood turns out as the emphasis on its Frenchness in the other comments might suggest."

It's hard to imagine a cutest, more cunning and more up-to-date film. Take any sequence and you'll have a good commercial, present, past and future. The girl is the archetypal french maiden we all have see in Cacharel ads. The sequence in which the quadruple photo talks is actually an existing commercial (for the Region sardinia, check out sardinian coat of arms and you'll understand). The sequence of  the old russian movie with subtitles actually talking of something else has been overused by creatives everywhere. It's not a matter of copying, it's a matter of manipulating an enormous collage of images and situations that grows every day in communication around us. And what about the travelling dwarf (I've seen it in a children book), and the blue arrows scenes that I'm ready to swear we'll see next year in a commercial at Cannes?

","Jean-Pierre Jeunet does a remarkable job, pieceing together stolen artifacts from thousand other stories, books, films and anecdotes to one remembarable film that will still be one of the best ten years from now!<br/><br/>One word sums the film up: Destiny. And the french title has the words ""fantastic destiny"" in its title. It is a very nice and charming piece of work, but with plenty of dark humour, extreme details and references to several other films. Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain tells us to help each other, be nice and not be frightend and really catch the opportunity when it (so rarley) comes around.<br/><br/>Even though the film seems to get nice reviews, I am stunned that noone mentioned that Jeunet has stolen so much from other works! I can't remember what film/story it is, but the traveling gnome for one is not Jeunet's idea. And that's not the only thing...<br/><br/>However, Jeunet is wise to steal from the masters, since this film works better than the originals he took the ideas from (I didn't even remember the name of the film above).<br/><br/>Most people will see this film once and think its either good or very good. Some will say it stinks, since its french, and may be a bit too long or to deep for them. But I think this is a film that one do best to see several times. The movie itself speaks of details and how importent they are - even Amélie herself sees the details when she is watching a movie - so maybe Jeunet has something more to tell us with this movie than what is told the first time.<br/><br/>Whatever may be said about this movie, it is a film that will surely be remembered for a very long time. It is absolutely Jeunet's finest work, and I doubt that he can ever top this.<br/><br/>I am glad that it was made in France. They have a very different view on these kind of films than for instance the US, UK or Sweden has. And to go from Alien 4 to Amélie - that is art!<br/><br/>I gave this film a 10 of 10 on the IMDb-scale. It has only one low point, and that is when we reach the obligatory ""all looks lost point"", and Amélie feels sad for herself and see her life not turn out as she planned. That part comes a bit sudden and it feels misplaced. But that part is so small and the rest of the movie lifts it up so much that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>This movie could not have been better than it already is. See it and feel warm.

Well, this film is majestic and intriguing, but not for the quantity of visual effects used (which are plenty, very well done and very well placed in a time-space and script outline), nor for the shocking or violence-based manner of filming (not present here and frequently found in many ""box office hit"" productions, mainly in the U.S., although this way of ""dazzling"" film making is starting to make its way in Europe, not without major flops or hits - unreguarding the quality of the film contents). It is the subtlety with which the film came to life which shows an alternative - but not ""out of this world"" - way of filming, with a plain, yet excellent script, a very moving and concise sound track made by Yann Tiersen (a young and very promising artist, as I listen!), which is always in the mood of Monmartre - and you should visit the city listening to this sound track, if you may... -, brilliant, almost surreal colors, and very good techniques either in montage or photography... as far as the technical part is concerned. As far as the script is concerned, I can only speak for myself, thinking about the endless hours I spent watching my surroundings and thinking about what people do, how they act, what brings certain thoughts to their minds, laughing at myself for having thought or done certain things, being CURIOUS... and that's what it is all about, I guess... curiosity, holding to small pieces of what we learned throughout living, having small things to protect for ourselves, small thoughts, being with one foot on the ground, and the head within clouds, and feel like everything is found, not pursued, because all things found are also part of what we wanted to find, or else they wouldn't be given the importance they have for us... all of this is touching, and Beautiful, as in ""full of Beauty""...

The contrast between the oddly nostalgic mood of Paris life confronted with the digitally-colored pictures and the cutting-edge visual effects win our favour little by little. Then each sequence appears to be a pure enjoyment, each scene looking like a perfect expressionist work of art. While The constant humor prevents the film from being too serious, the interaction between the camera and the actors (especially Amélie and Nino)is so sensual that it can't but mesmerize the most indifferent viewer. Jeunet has made a visually-stunning romance by imagining a fantasy world of its own that really serves the story line.<br/><br/>Second the CONTENT : This whimsical romance achieves to call you into question while it still leaves you with an enigmatic feel-good attitude !! Our lovable AMELIE is hurt by life as are all the ""dysfunctional"" characters around her. AMELIE's shyness and loneliness could have made her a victim. Instead, she eventually decides to interfere in other people's lives by exercising justice. But by doing so, she will confront her biggest enemy, HERSELF !

","I loved the movie.  I expected I would.  But, as much as I did, I have to say that I was disappointed.  (please don't throw anything at me yet, let me explain)  I'm a big fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet - even Alien Resurrection, I was with him all the way on that.  But after seeing Amelie and getting over that giddy feeling it gives you, I noticed  what one might call crutches. Amelie is great at disguising it's huge plot holes with Audrey Tautou's and her character's world cuteness but nevertheless, no matter how camouflaged, they are still there.  I won't explain further by giving away plot things but this movie makes a lot of assumptions on the audience and the characters.  One (vague) example is the introduction of a very key character very late (in my opinion) in the story and a connection with that character and Amelie that, even in this fantastic world, is not believable and just comes across as an example of slackness in the screenplay.  There are very many more instances like this but I won't get into them.<br/><br/>However, I still gave the movie an 8 because Jeunet is the god of visuals and LUSCIOUS is a nice adjective to describe the look of the film."

","The world of Amelie Poulain(very good Audrey Tanton, who captured the essence of her character) is weird. She see herself as someone who help people. Sometime she helps someone to find love, fulfill a dream or just help to solve a mystery which involve photo's and if needed she take revenge on someone who is too cruel to someone els. And all the time she is also looking for love for herself. <br/><br/>If it sounds weird to you wait until you see the film because the film is presented through the eyes of Amelie and if you liked her you would like the film. If, however you did not like her, you would find the film very irritating. And that is the strong point of the film and also its weakest point. Director Jeunet liked Amelie very much. He sympathize with her and embrace her point of view fully. That is not a bad thing because in doing so he make us identify with her and with her action. I liked the film but there are viewers who will find the film too annoying precisely because there is no distance between them and the main character. There is no judgment at all on what she does, there is no moral judgment of right or wrong. Her actions are accepted with no questions. There is another point that for me was a big plus. I like the way Jeunet present Paris in the film. Paris is very much a part of the film. It seems that the film could not have taken place in another city. At the end of the film I wanted to go straight to Paris.<br/><br/>Yes it is a weird film and yet I have found myself enjoying it.

I'll begin by saying that the film is hilarious.  HILARIOUS.  I laughed a lot during this film, at both the slapstick comedy and the more quirky comedy, and there was a lot of that.  Some people may not like it, but it worked like a charm for me.<br/><br/>Moving right along, I think it's quite a thing that most comments explain how this is a ""non-existent Paris."" Who cares? It was a joy to see Paris looking the way it did in this film.  If it looked any different, the dynamic of the film would have been completely warped.  The use of colors is incredible, and yes, the cinematography was really something.  I think it surpasses ""Vanilla Sky"" for the most innovative cinematography of the year.<br/><br/>Jean-Pierre Jeunet made ""Alien: Resurrection,"" and I really can't imagine how that is possible.  Even that film had something intriguing about it, but his work in this film is so superior, on every level.  His direction is just so correctly done; every punchline, every weird image, the delivery of it all was like...he really went in for the kill, you know? It was done just right.<br/><br/>My ONE PROBLEM: the last 5-10 minutes.  I didn't really walk out of their feeling light and airy as I was hoping to.  Actually, the end was a bit disappointing. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Why did they even bother introducing that waitress as someone who had an interest in Nino? It just made us wonder, it had no function in the telling of the story.  I would have walked out of the theatre MUCH happier if the film had just ended in the coffee shop, with a shot of Amelie and Nino smiling at each other, or holding each other, or something sweet like that.  The possibility of losing him was annoying and unnecessary.  The high that the rest of the film gave me was too good to be brought down like that.  <br/><br/>I guess, now that I think about it, that ending really upset me.  The rest of the movie is SO wonderful, and they went and did that nonsense. (Funny I call it nonsense, considering it was the only truly realistic part of the film.  But watching a film with so much fantasy, I begin to believe it. Reality is NOT something I want to be bothered with.)<br/><br/>Still, the film is such a pleasure.  Watch it.

","It would be nice to be able to review this film without using the words `fluffy', `French' and `confection' but it is all of these, set in a idealised `Gigi' style Paris where the only thing lying on the pavement is ripped-up photos from the ubiquitious instant photo booths. Ostensibly set in the present day, it's more like the Paris of fifties Hollywood  you expect Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn to appear and burst into song at any moment.<br/><br/>The star, Audrey Tatou, is more than a little reminiscent of the earlier Audrey, but she propels the action to a much greater extent. Her character Amélie is naïve (to a degree) and shy, and works as a waiter in a café, but is adept at executing practical jokes. She is imbued with a desire to do good and manages to combine the techniques of joking with righting various injustices she sees about her. Things become more complicated when she becomes attracted to a young man with the rather strange hobby of collecting discarded photo-booth pictures. Her penchant for jokes and games becomes an obstacle to the relationship. Things work out in the end, of course, but there's lots of rushing about in streets and railway stations before the final kiss.<br/><br/>The last French film I saw was `La Ville est Tranquille'. A very different film, it nonetheless had the same lightness of touch. Both give us the French as the directors would like us to see them, with a love of life that transcends petty concerns. It is unlikely that a German director would produce something similar, though perhaps an Italian one might. `Amélie' is full of comic turns  the hypochondriac tobacco booth saleslady, the elderly housebound painter, the bullying grocer and his put-upon assistant, the other staff and customers of Amélie's café, her concierge and various other street characters, yet it is very much Audrey Tatou's movie. She has an elfin charm that makes her look innocent even when engaged in sex and eyes any man could drown in.<br/><br/>A souflé but a sweet one."

","I'm always surprised to see how movies like 'Amélie'or ""American Beauty"" can become so favorite and be accepted by people as the ultimate feelgood movies.... is this the kind of excitement and fantasy people need in their lives nowadays? If someone would be in his/her real life 10% of what Amélie is supposed to be in the film, then all the tricks she does on the film would look boring and as if they are based on the tips found in teenager magazines. Not to mention that their fantasy limit remains as mainstream as possible not to spoil the happy end everyone knows HAS to come. Everybody watching the movie feels good and secretely wants to be like Amelie, while in truth he/she only is like the guy that gets the box back: this movie puts in a small box all the things that made you feel good back then, the ones you obviously forgot in the way, needing now boxes to put you back in trail. So, to summarise: if you need such movies to feel good, you will feel good with this movie. If on the contrary you ARE the kind of person that does tricks to the neighbours you don't like and does good things to the neighbours you like, well you will agree with me that Amélie is left way behind in fantasy and tricks..... So, as a comedy and technically speaking, it's highly satisfying. But for the feelgood stuff, lessons of life etc. I have one advise: don't see the movie, but get a stone NOW and throw it to your neighbour's window, the one you hate most. Then you will have the effect the movie tries to achieve (but doesn't since it stays too much on the surface), and maybe even feel good afterwards. Feel good for real, not like in the movies, or in Amélie's head. a 3 out of 5 (also for the nice haircut and the beautiful French cuisine equipment)"

It still is. One day she decides to change the life of the people around her. And perhaps her own as well. This is the plot to a good natured, beautiful and engaging movie, which conquered its audiences by being itself, and nothing more. This was a project dreamed by Jeunet long ago, and it shows the level of dedication that all the creative team put on this movie.

","I have not been French cinema's best friend. I do like movies from the French Wave, but their newer movies are rarely interesting. Mostly these films portray the political problems the country is struggling with, and this is always done with extreme and painful realism. It is a liberation to have Jeunet in the midst of this. The co-director (with Marc Caro) of the two masterpieces Delicatessen (1991) and The City of Lost Children (1995) chose a different path this time. This story is very sweet, but it is done with extreme technical insight and originality. In other words, although it is another concept, it is still a recognizable Jeunet film. Jeunet is alongside Tom Tykwer and Danny Boyle forming the new European wave of brilliantly skilled directors with great visions. <br/><br/>The film is a crowd pleaser, but not the way we are used to. It has been compared to Forrest Gump, mainly because of the naive and warmhearted lead character, but it is not choosing the simple path. You will have to be open-minded to new ideas and experimenting with the art form to like this movie, and it seems like people are since the film is met with standing ovations wherever it is screened. As a sidenote, Forrest Gump is still a slightly better film.<br/><br/>The lead role is played by the fabulous Audrey Tautou, who is destined for a big future after this. She plays with such cuteness and charm that it is impossible not to compare her with her name sister Audrey Hepburn.<br/><br/>
Amelie has been mentioned for Oscars nominations already. I think it will surely get a nod for best foreign movie, but it deserves to get the recognition that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon got. Amelie is a much better pick than any martial arts film.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

","The one thing about Amelie that really sticks with me is the magic I felt after viewing it.  Warm hearted and clever this film does not come off as 'cute' like many of the droids of American ""chic-flicks"" that come across major viewing screens a year.  One major difference between this film and those American flicks we love to hate, is Amelie is not afraid of being bold.  Don't expect a baby head coming out of a womb in the first few scenes of any Julia Roberts movie.  Amelie takes different directions with texture, writing, and style never cutting out what may be considered taboo. Wonderfully funny and amusing it never runs out of steam to keep the audience entertained.  Audrey Tautou performance is memorable, the rest of the cast is dead on, sometimes a little cliché but not overboard.   Amelie is worthwhile to anyone who wants to leave the theater smiling."
"WCS02","9","0","1","19 December 2001"," The most perfect film I've seen this year. Watch it with your heart wide open.
","Amelie is a magnificent comedy about life.  It's about following your heart in pursuit of true love; it's about helping others to discover themselves  for better or for worse  to improve their own lives; and it's a `how to' course about mobilizing the dysfunctionality in your life to make the world a better place.  All of that and it's an original (*) to boot.<br/><br/>Amelie is about the art of living.  Art surrounds us, yet many believe it is only to be found in museums, galleries and the souls of the artistic.  There is art in every one of us.  Amelie attracts it like a magnet.<br/><br/>(*) One critical footnote on the originality pitch.  There was one minor sequence borrowed from a Parade Magazine (Sunday Newspaper, several years back) article where someone borrowed' a garden decoration, took it on vacation and returned it afterwards.  That aside, thoroughly original.<br/><br/>Amelie is a wonderful and beautiful actress named Audrey Tautou who is going to be awfully busy in the decades upcoming.  The cast around is superb to boot.<br/><br/>The most perfect film I've seen this year.  Watch it with your heart wide open.  9 / 10."
"Diand","7","0","1","3 June 2001"," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
","This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camerawork are key elements to this.<br/><br/>In the second part Amelie lives on her own in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of ""Delicatessen"", except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.<br/><br/>Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.<br/><br/>The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like an absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates.<br/><br/>Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.<br/><br/>What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd."

","The laughter behind Claude Perrron's beautiful face comes from Hitchocks ""To Catch A Theaf"", whilst the plot is a parody of ""Rare Window"": there are also refferings to Indiana Jones and other spielbergs films. The film represents a tendency in  French film in the last ten years: to defend the ordinary man in contrast to Hollywood-films. One cheat cut: when Amelie sees that Dufayel and she have the same meal and when she turnes backs to the kitchen table, the paste is cold to fat andd cheese mill is in different possition...

"jaidedfeire","9","0","1","2 December 2001"," Beautiful, enchanting... but not ""perfect""
","Of course I left the Ritz (oh how I love the Ritz - if you are in Philadelphia, it is the only theater you need go to) with a huge goofy smile on my face. This film is MEANT to make you feel giddy. The meanies are comically punished and the quirky heroine Amelie finally finds her perfect match. Amelie gives the world hope for beauty, soulmates, and everything that is simply destined to turn out right. However, close as it may come to perfection, it is not quite there. Oh, yes, we may like to allow the last 2/3 of the movie to blind us to the 1st... but in reality - admit it, the fidget factor came into play. The first 5 minutes are great, but then the film sort of digresses while the audience waits for the actual plot to begin and for Amelie to emerge in her discovery of the world. It's not the real world, but who cares? That's what makes this movie so great! Oh yes, that and the imitation of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois couleurs: Rouge. (Notice the color of EVERYTHING in Amelie's apartment as well as the majority of her wardrobe, not to mention the characteristics of her relationship with Collignon which is very much like Valentine and The Judge) In any case, don't think the mise-en-scene is an accident. Especially not those Audrey Hepburn glasses Audrey Tautou dons in the ""follow the arrows"" sequence. Those glasses are a deliberately placed prop. Jean-Pierre Jeunet obviously wants you to make the comparison and then think you were clever in doing so. Am I saying this is a bad thing? NO! We want to be manipulated into this. It's too fun and too true not to be. Amelie is indeed a clever and delightful manipulation of reality. As close to pure cinematic enjoyment as you can get. And so wonderfully French!"

","Amelie was really great entertainment and filmed in a style that is unfortunately too rare nowadays.<br/><br/>The lead character shone throughout and the whole cast portrayed a story which was a joy to witness.<br/><br/>I was put off a bit by the subtitles and, at the back of my mind, I can't help feeling I would love to see an English version but this should not detract from what was a fine piece of work.<br/><br/>Well done everyone concerned ......... 9 out of 10"

","Exactly what French Film needs these days.<br/><br/>Amelie is a heroine who thinks outside of herself and is able to help herself out in the process.<br/><br/>Very few movies are constructed in the level of detail that this film was ""realised"".  It really should be ranked for films of all time."
"Robbo-7","5","0","3","26 November 2001"," cute film -- not a masterpiece
","I'd have found this movie more palatable with average-looking people rather than models, but I suppose it's more natural for movie-goers to root for really good-looking people. This film taps into our fantasy is that the dreamers are out there, somewhere, hoping that we'll see that they're not just physically gorgeous, but also quirky, thoughtul, inventive, and ready to embrace and nurture our own lovable quirks. Still, I'm surprised that IMDB users have ranked this film so absurdly high on the all-time list. C'est la vie!<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story's cleverness and twists, and there's a nice message about avoiding voyeuristic titillation and living one's own life, but by the end the project felt hollow and overly long. I agree with an earlier commentor that Marc Caro's influence might have helped this venture by providing a little more darkness. I loved ""Delicatessan"" several years ago -- think I'll rent it again and refresh my memory."
"stensson","5","0","3","24 November 2001"," Like it yes, but does one have to love it?
","Everybody says this film is wonderful and it certainly has its charm, mostly because of Audrey Tautou in the main part. But what starts really well (considering the story of her childhood) and what goes on building an excitement and much expectations in the following half hour, can't live up to this.<br/><br/>This is at least 30 minutes too long. The people are funny to watch, but they aren't really humans, just charicatures. This is a child story with eroticism but not really grown up love. The cinema audiences reactions are a little too pretold and foreseen. This is a little bit too calculated.<br/><br/>But it is indeed very clever in many ways, but really one can't alltogether understand so many peoples devotion. Are they really so tired of all evilness shown in most films of today?"
"jmbattle","Null","0","1","21 November 2001"," Magnificent!
","This film serves as a demonstration of everything that is good about the French film industry.<br/><br/>With 'Amelie', Jeunet has created the ultimate feel-good film, and in Audrey Tautou, has surely cast one of the most strikingly beautiful actresses to grace French cinema screens in years.<br/><br/>Perhaps not quite as surreal as Jeunet's previous works - this film would be an ideal introduction to French cinema for those who usually rely on Hollywood pap for their entertainment.  Yet for the seasoned foreign film enthusiast, 'Amelie' is special - and certainly original - enough to set it apart from the glut of (largely excellent) French romantic-comedies.<br/><br/>
But for the appalling 'Alien IV', Jeunet would have a trio of splendid, near-perfect films - but then 'Resurrection' was an American release, so perhaps critics will overlook that one anyway..."
"hartmutw","9","0","1","19 November 2001"," A non-subtle but enchanting fairy tale
","This movie isn't one that will get you thinking or touch you deeply. It is pure emotional indulgence: 2 hours of fun and longing for this artificial yet not entirely unreal world.<br/><br/>As already in 'Delicatessen' and 'City of the lost children', Jeunet artfully mixes surreal elements and sublime colouring with the normal life, hence creating a dense atmosphere filled with humor and charm.<br/><br/>This film's abundance of little but oh so nice ideas is its brand: From smile to chuckle, an endless number of gags makes you wonder why other big budget mainstream comedies aren't half as funny. There's no scene outlining human emotions simplier and better than the one where Amelie turns to a waterfall after not daring to talk to her dream guy.<br/><br/>That's what makes this movie so unresistable, however not 'great' in a classical sense. But that's what cinema is about as well."
"Geofbob","Null","0","1","18 November 2001"," If only the fairytale ending had come a little sooner
","This is an enjoyable, winning exercise in whimsy for most of its two hours, but would have been even better with 15 minutes or so lopped off. Audrey Tautou is enchanting as adult Amélie who, having lacked affection and interest from her parents when she was young, is wary of the world, but nevertheless tries to make it a better place by surreptitious interventions in her neighbours' lives. Mathieu Kassovitz plays Nino, an equally odd-ball character and would-be conceptual artist, whose current project involves collecting photos discarded near railway station photo-booths. Both are engaged in putting other peoples' lives together, but eventually realise that those in greatest need are themselves.<br/><br/>Perhaps the funniest part of the movie is the opening sequence, where in quick fire documentary style, with a voiceover, we are shown Amélie's emotionally deprived childhood, with a solemn Flora Guiet playing the heroine as an 8 year old. Some of grown-up Amélie's exploits are also engaging, especially sending her father's garden gnome on a world tour; and her returning to an old man a box of playthings he had hidden away as a youngster.But in his quest for originality co-writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet has Amélie play some extremely malicious tricks on a local nasty grocer, which seem unnecessarily out of her character, and add little to the movie.<br/><br/>The scenes in the café where Amélie works - with a set of harmless eccentrics only found in movies - are amusing to begin with, but like the film as a whole go on a bit too long. I for one got rather impatient as Amélie and Nino bungled date after date, and was hugely relieved when they finally fell into each other's arms. I am unsure what the overall message of the movie is, except that old chestnut - love will find a way.<br/><br/>Possibly the real and uncredited star of the movie is Paris, which is beautiful in reality, but even more magical when digitally enhanced. Incidentally, it may seem curious to some viewers that Jeunet has hero Nino work in a sexshop, and that he revives that old cliché - the kindhearted tart who loves her work (though he carefully doesn't show us the client she's entertaining)."
"smakawhat","8","0","1","14 November 2001"," Charming, good in its simplicity
","I went to see Amelie and was quite surprised by the amount of buzz it generated.  I am a big movie nut and see a lot of foreign films, instead of the regular Hollywood stuff [which I do see as well].  However, this little picture seems to be taking over.  I went to the theatre here (early as always) and found out that people were even buying tickets for the next day.<br/><br/>I would describe this film as a coloured washout view of Paris about an adorable qwerky woman who decides that her destiny in life is to make other people happy, adding a dash of Run Lola Run hyper intensity.  She, like all other people in the film is weird.  There are no ordinary people in this film at all which makes it that more interesting, and there are comical moments.<br/><br/>I think most people seeing this film are drawn to its simplicity and think that its unique, its really inspiring to them.  For me it's a good film (no not the best of the year [see my thoughts on Memento, Mulholland Drive, and Sexy Beast, who knows I may see something even better still]) but I think It's one of those films that will force people who wouldn't see alternative theatre, to see something different [and maybe stick with it].<br/><br/>The film does get a little slow, and has an overly romanticized view of Paris and Parisians.  But you don't mind, even the cafe that Amelie works in reminds me so much of the cafe's I use to sit in when I was on a trip to Portugal.  The movie is definitely a feel good film, and probably the best feel good movie of the year.<br/><br/>Tautou is just enchanting as well and the movie has great magical scenes such as when she remarks to the audience how when she goes to the movies, she turns around sometimes to see the smiles on everybody's faces.  The camera pans back showing the audience in joy.  It's that feeling you connect with after seeing this film.<br/><br/>Overly sentimental??, perhaps, best film of the year??  No  A film worth seeing,  `Definitely'<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10."

","LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMELIE POULAIN, or AMELIE, as us Americans refer to it, is the charming story of a woman named Amelie (Audrey Tautou) living in France and attempting to improve the lives of those around her. We are first told of Amelie's upbringing, then shown her living her life, if somewhat unhappily, in Paris. Then we are shown Amelie's attempts to improve her friends' lives, and eventually her found love.<br/><br/>AMELIE is a very charming, imaginative, and well-told story. Though the premise isn't exactly special, the execution really does improve upon the plot. It is well-directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and all of the acting is realistic and believable, mentionable the title role, played wonderfully by Audrey Tautou. She manages to capture all of the innocence, yet knowledge, of Amelie and play her to a tee.<br/><br/>A few parts of the movie seem unnecessary and drawn out, but the movie is for the most part very fun and sweet, while thought-provoking and compelling. An impressive little French film. 8/10."
