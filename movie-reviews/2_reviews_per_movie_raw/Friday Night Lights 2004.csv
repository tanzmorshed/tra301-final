"trillian28","9","93","120","7 December 2004"," A sports movie worthy of non-sports people
","This movie is not what you might expect. It is not your typical sports movie, where a disparate team comes together to triumph over adversity as the music swells with a dumb sense of pride. This is a movie about people, kind of like Seabiscuit that way, except less happy and with no horses.<br/><br/>This movie is about Odessa, a medium-sized town in Texas with no economy and nothing to do besides obsess about high school football. It is a town where they pay the football coach twice as much as their teachers, where a boy's best chance out is to get a football scholarship to a faraway college, and where these boys are under so much pressure to win because the town seems unable to succeed at anything else.<br/><br/>A movie like this depends on its actors, because it is a character drama at its core. Much noise has been made of Billy Bob, and how he gives a great performance, and this is very true, but he is not the only star in this movie. The boys all do a great job too, especially Lucas Black. I have never noticed this actor before, but he is so intense as Mike Winchell that he makes you really feel for him. The other boys, including Derek Luke and Jay Hernandez, are also note-perfect.<br/><br/>There is a great moment at the end, after their final game, when they talk about what they are going to do next. They haven't graduated yet, but it is already over for them. There is a sense that nothing else matters. Subtitles tell us what happens to everyone. It is sometimes funny, often tragic, and always ironic, and you leave the movie feeling like you've met some new people who are very real."
"zatz-1","Null","58","80","9 February 2005"," The Real Varsity Blues
","This is a very dark sports movie. It's about fanaticism, the great weight of importance certain people place on sports. Sports fans often regard their teams as extensions of themselves. In ""Friday Night Lights,"" the entire town of Odessa, Texas collectively puts their town's reputation on the shoulders of a high school football team. It's basically the same exact plot as ""Varsity Blues,"" except a serious version of high school football in small town Texas.<br/><br/>One thing the movie does extremely well is taking hackneyed plots of the individual players (because it's all been done before) and putting them all in the background. So the plots play out not in a cheesy, inspirational, in-your-face way. Instead, they are just there with only as much attention as the viewer wants to put on them. The great aspects of sports are enough to keep us interested and makes the movie incredibly real.<br/><br/>The only character whose plot is really focused on is Boobie, the cocky running back who is injured and tries to defy his own injury. This is a plot in sports movies that has been focused on somewhat - the injured player. But never before has the pain been so real and so powerful.<br/><br/>This movie is heart-wrenching. Sports movies usually have so many moments of redemption and cheesy happiness that often feel false. This movie only has one such moment and it is incredibly powerful. Nothing about this movie is Hollywood. Billy Bob Thorton gives a great, understated performance as the coach, a man who is simply internal, who can do nothing but sit back and watch events unfold, knowing full well the impact that each game has on himself and his family. All the actors playing the football players do a good job, especially the guy who plays Boobie.<br/><br/>Don't expect this movie to uplift you. But it will show you an interesting side of sports you may have never considered. And, in the end, it shows exactly what is great about sports, and it has nothing to do with winning or making a career out of the game. It's about giving all you have for a teammate."
"espenshade55","8","76","112","10 October 2004"," The Best Sports movie ever made
","This movie was phenomenal in every way. It had incredible performances under a great director with a fantastic story to back it up.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a high school football team in Texas through the course of their 1988 season. Billy Bob Thorton played the coach of the team and give the best performance I've ever seen him give. The film was directed by Peter Berg who gave it a unique film style. He managed to tell this story in a very beautiful way.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw gives a great debut performance of an ex-high school football player who has become the drunken abusive father of one of the players currently on the team. He was almost unrecodnizable in this role and he portrayed it well. He, and the rest of the cast for that matter deserve a lot of credit.<br/><br/>This is the only football film I have ever seen that has done justice to what it feels like to play football in high school. I played under Friday night lights myself, that time of my life ended just a year ago and it still holds fresh in my memory. And because of that I can tell you how accurately this film portray's the sense of brotherhood and friendship that is felt by every team, at least every good football team.<br/><br/>Whether you ever played under Friday night lights yourself or not anyone should be able to appreciate this film."
"jabell","10","52","81","9 October 2004"," Excellent Look at a Small Town's Football Madness
","To be honest, I went to this movie primarily to see Christian Kane, but the reviews had been excellent. I expected a cross between All the Right Moves and Remember the Titans, but it was nothing like the second, which was about two coaches forced to make their teams blend into one while avoiding racial problems. There were elements of All the Right Moves, though, as several of the young men expressed their desire to get out of Odessa through football, but the movie focused on several of them rather than just one. Its best companion piece in my opinion is the Texas Cheerleader Murder, which shows the same football madness from the other gender as they will do anything to be cheerleaders! <br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton was excellent as the coach, facing pressure on all sides to win the state championship. An excellent touch was the large number of for sale signs on his lawn after his team was blown away in the game following Boobie's injury. The community put pressure on the boys as well, everyone who owned a state championship ring from prior years pushing them in the kids' faces. Tim McGraw was a revelation as Brian's abusive father, and the actress who was Mike Winchell's mother gave a brilliant performance.<br/><br/>All of the young actors were excellent, especially Derek Luke as the unfortunate Boobie. He made the audience feel his pain and frustration. Lucas Black, who had done such a marvelous job in American Gothic, has a face that reflects his pain as he faces all of his tribulations, which include the pressure of suddenly becoming the team's best hope when Boobie is out and of having a mother with mental and/or emotional problems. Every one of them is a gem.<br/><br/>The cinematography was outstanding, and the shots of the town and the bleak surroundings certainly demonstrated why the kids wanted to get away. Despair hung in the air, with people clinging to their moments of glory as the only happy days of their entire lives. This was its primary likeness to All the Right Moves, although the hated home town was a Pennsylvania steel town (Johnstown, PA, which I escaped from myself), not a Texas prairie city.<br/><br/>And what made things even more intense was that this was a true story. Showing the boys' fates at the end was an excellent conclusion.<br/><br/>And Christian Kane? I knew he only had a cameo, as he had told Peter Berg that he'd love to be in the movie and would take any part there was. He was the man in the restaurant/bar who asked Mike Winchell if he'd take a picture with him & his kid. He was long-haired, unshaven, and, to be honest, if I'd seen him this way first, I'd never have given him a second look. He did a good job as a ""good ole boy,"" though!"
"eric262003","8","4","4","11 March 2018"," A Sports Film With a Touch of Humanity
","Set in Odessa, Texas in the year 1988, ""Friday Night Lights"" centres around a town in Texas who's thriving to make it into the state finals. But the issues go way beyond the gridiron, as players are faced with personal issues as we cross-examine them through the benefits of sports and the triumphs and setbacks that comes with the package while the whole town wants this team to win like their lives are depending on them.<br/><br/>This is not the cliched underdog story with the selected team we're forced to root for to go all the way. The big rewards are the events that led to the team winning which is more reflective in storytelling and feels more refreshing in its premise. There are moments that are melancholy and humane, intense and surreal, hopeless and triumphant. Sure this film seems to be the perfect companion for sports lovers, but if you're not fanatical about sports, there's plenty more to like about this film. The human issues depicted in this movie has equally poignant moments than compared to the action on the football field.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Peter Berg who co-starred with Linda Fiorentino in ""The Last Seduction"", utilizes his power to tell an intriguing story while pulling no punches about it. Sure the settings of this film is in the late 1980's, you wouldn't really know the difference with its modern outlook. The cuts are quick-paced, the hand-held shots are quick-tempered, but it works effectively due to the point of view that comes behind it all. Berg wants us to a part of his world contrary to the ones we live in. His concentration is not about the actual game but the dramatic scenes that lead prior to the climactic game like it was a memory we can reminisce to our grandchildren when we get older.<br/><br/>While filmed on stock angles, the film truly feels just like a flashback. The period details are enough to this film a more storied effect in its presentation making this archaic technique all the more sufficient. The film does succeed giving the background that 1980's vibe with costumes, clothing and props that were prominent to the time period this film is set in. A firm example is that the female costars are sporting the typical big thick haired pompadour that was apropos for the 1980's.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton adds to the authenticity as a sports a look that is similar to that of a young Jimmy Swaggert as Coach Gary Gaines who combines the willfulness to win while playing an important role in his young player's lives. He can really turn the role of his personality as he can be volatile in one moment and then compassionate in another.<br/><br/>Coach Gaines has a lot on his mind as he's placed in a disposition of very talented players, but are still green, but he hopes to change that with their need for speed. One of the prominent characters on the gridiron is a young man named Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a arrogant player who plans to make it big. Those plans come in question when an injury sidelines him. Boobie now has to think from the outside while looking on while sitting out while seeking other options in life outside of football.<br/><br/>Though Berg and screenwriters Buzz Bissinger snd David Aaron Cohen lures into caring about which team is going to win, does not mean the characters themselves feel the same way. Therefore, we get the better understanding of how obsessive the town is in its dependence not how the team is playing, just as long as they win the state championship. Every other time, the life in that town is one long, cynical slog, but the championship season, the town lights up brighter than the neon lights of Sin City. The stress factor is on these kids as they strive to make these memories all the more worthwhile while trying to appease to the drab, unmotivated adults which lacks in any healthy relations.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw who plays Billingsley, an abusive father to one of the players gives an unhealthy reprimand to his son that this game will mean more to him than anything he's ever going to achieve in life. Granted he's right sine like so many others in that town who's one-track-mind fixation is all that's coming to them. The execution to that frame in mind is handled brilliantly. When Gaines drives home after being ostracized over the radio, he's confronted by two local townspeople threatening his job if his team doesn't win. Gee no rest for the weary?<br/><br/>Even though as adults they'll remember this event as long as they live, the kids they were back then were left feeling miserable, frustrated and stressed out not from the coach or their regiment or even, let alone the game, but by the townsfolk who forced them to excel, not through their hard work, but by their own personal pride. The tension is bestowed upon Lucas Black's performance as the star quarterback and Garrett Hedlund shines as the young Billingsley. Although masked as a football film, the drama of this story is about a football team drafted into a metaphorical war zone obsessed by the neurotic pleasures of the citizens of Odessa, Texas."
"pulpface","9","59","100","21 February 2005"," A review by a football player
","""Gentlemen. The hopes and dreams of an entire town are riding on your shoulders. You may never matter more than you do right now. It's time.""Coach Gary Carter addressing his team.<br/><br/>For years, the Buzz Bissinger's book ""Friday Nights Lights"" has been proclaimed as the greatest football book ever written. The story is about the 1988 Permian Panthers from Odessa, Texas. In the book, Bissinger illustrates how much high school football effects a town in West Texas that has basically nothing to live for. Almost everyone in Odessa is poor, train tracks divide the town the white and black communities and the school system is below average, yet on Friday Nights (as the tag-line of the movie says) ""Hope comes alive"".<br/><br/>The thing that I like most about the movie was the it didn't go away from the book too much and the movie tried to imply the same themes as the book did. Anyway, let's get to the actual movie now.<br/><br/>Unlike most sports movies where the viewer is spending about two-thirds of the movie trying to figure out who all the characters are, ""Lights"" actually does a good job in identifying all the characters. For example, you will know who ""Boobie"" Miles is (the Panthers' star running back) right when the movie starts. Another unique thing about ""Lights"" is that when watching, it feels like the viewer is watching a documentary, because movie does a great job on including detail on the attitude the town and players carry throughout the story and highlights from EVERY game are shown (something that never happens in sports movies).<br/><br/>The characters in ""Lights"" make the movie great, especially ""Boobie"" Miles (played by Derek Luke). Boobie is not only the best runner on the team, he is probably the best running back in the state. On one play, he broke three tackles and burned two other defenders. The only thing that faster than his legs is...his mouth. He makes Terrell Owens and Freddie Mitchell look modest. Whenever a member of the media talks to him, he proclaims that he is God gift to football and how God made Boobie beautiful and all that junk. When asked about his grades he replies ""I'm an athlete, I make straight A's"". Boobie is obviously not smart, when he was reading one of his recruitment letters from the University of Southern California, he sounded like a five-year old. Football and his uncle L.V. are the only two things that Boobie has going for him.<br/><br/>The main character of the movie is Coach Gary Carter (played by Billie Bob Thornton). Coach Carter's job is not an easy one. Throughout the movie, he is constantly bugged by boosters and supports telling him that he should imply this scheme or this player should play this position, Coach Carter just ignores them, but he knows that expectations are very high in Odessa (especially if they are the favorites to go the Texas Bowl).<br/><br/>Another character(s) that make the movie great is Don Billingsley (played by Garrett Hedlund) and his father Charles (played by country superstar Tim McGraw). Don probably feels the pressure of playing for the Panthers more than anyone because his dad as on a state championship team for the Panthers and his dad is also an alcoholic. During the first practice of the season when Don fumbled the ball, Charles came running out of the stands and when yelling at his son about ""some little fumble"". Don is ashamed by his father which is why he probably the biggest playboy on the team as well. However, Don is one tough kid (as evident in the final game).<br/><br/>Football is the only thing that Odessa cares about, after a loss a person calls-in a local radio station to say ""there's too much learning going on at that school!"" On Friday Nights, all the businesses are closed, the Ratliff Stadium (where the Panthers play) is packed an hour before kickoff and everyone is wearing black and white.<br/><br/>The game scenes are the best part of the movie. Some of the hits are so hard, it would put Terry Tate to shame, especially in the final game of the story. That game scene was the best I have ever saw because it captured everything that goes on during a football game (trash talk, adjustments, dirty play, emotion, etc.) Where does Friday Night Lights among football movies? Personally, I think it's the best football movie of all time. I have played football for nine years and I have seen about every single football movie ever made and I will have to say that this film truly captures what football REALLY is. If you are a sports fan, you will love this movie.<br/><br/>GRADE: 9.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>FOOTBALL GRADE: TOUCHDOWN with the 2-point conversion"
"andrewCmcauliffe","9","7","9","5 February 2006"," Friday Night Explosions in the Lights
","When I first heard of this movie, I immediately let it go under my radar because I am not a big fan of sports movies. However, I am a huge fan of the Texas band Explosions in the Sky and when I heard a few months ago that they scored most of the soundtrack for Friday Night Lights, it was compulsory that I check it out.<br/><br/>It turns out that I freaking love this movie. The cinematography is nicely done, comprising wide, sweeping shots of Texas plains, oil-rigs, and football fields. The colors come through nicely (the white and black of the jerseys is particularly nice). As I already mentioned, I am not a big sports fan, but from what I could tell, the football sequences were well done and quite intense.<br/><br/>The acting is superbly executed by most in the film. However, there are still one or two times when one of the players' lines is delivered with that all-too-well-known teen-acting cheesiness that almost makes me cringe a little. Those times aside, the acting works wonderfully.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned, the reason why I initially watched this movie, was because Explosions in the Sky did the score. In my opinion, every song that they wrote (or adapted from previously written songs) for this movie lends beautifully to the content. Their lush soundscapes play nicely alongside the beautiful fields of Texas (no surprise, since TX is their home). Their crescendo-laden rock happens also to fit perfectly with slow-motion sequences (which there are plenty of in Friday Night Lights).<br/><br/>I am sure that almost all of the other reviews here have touched on the fact that this football movie does not play like other football movies (with all of the regular sport movie clichés). Because of this, I won't go into that. My thoughts are, if you like football (and also enjoy genuinely good cinema) OR if you aren't really a big fan of football (and also enjoy genuinely good cinema), you will probably dig Friday Night Lights.<br/><br/>So go and buy the DVD; and while you are at the store, pick up an Explosions in the Sky CD."
"tpfeifer-48153","10","5","6","31 May 2017"," Great Film
","Based on the award winning book by H.G. Bissinger, Friday Night Lights provides the audience with an inside look at the magnitude of high school football in Texas. The film follows several players, as well as the head coach, as the Permian Panthers attempt to win the State Championship during the 1988 season. The roles of Mike Winchell and Don Billingsley are portrayed well by Lucas Black and Garrett Hedlund. Through their performances, Black and Hedlund were able to show the pressure and stress that football players felt. At one point in the film, one football player says, ""relax we're seventeen"" and Billingsley responds, ""do you feel seventeen?"". This quote emphasizes how in Texas, high school football players are held to higher standards than most teenagers. The best performance came from Billy Bob Thornton though, as he played Head Coach Gary Gaines. Thornton does a great job in showing the anxiety of a football coach in Texas. It was cool to see Billy Bob Thornton and Lucas Black together again, eight years after they starred in Sling Blade. The film is directed well throughout, but the final scene stood out the most to me. The scene consists of three football players standing in the parking lot of the stadium a couple days after their last high school game ever. As the players bid farewell to their careers, you can see how a huge part of their lives is over. High school football really isn't like it is in Texas anywhere else. Through excellent directing and acting, the film is successful in highlighting the enormous impact that high school football has on small towns in Texas."
"scottstevo","10","44","81","4 January 2006"," I played West Texas Football, NCAA, and NFL
","I am not a professional movie reviewer. And I did not play for Permian. <br/><br/>I have seen many great high school football movies including Remember the Titans, All The Right Moves, Radio, Varsity Blues and others and there is nothing better than non-fiction. My high school coach made us read this book during summer ball and I can honestly state that this is what West Texas High School Football is all about. No matter what the ""Movie Review Nerds"" say, this is great story. Watch it, watch it again and buy the DVD for your kids. Teach these values to your kids. Forget about preconceived notions about the actors.<br/><br/>THIS IS WHAT FOOTBALL IS ALL ABOUT!!"
"hoodcsa","5","23","39","17 October 2006"," An incomplete pass
","There are some nice touches here, things like the idiots calling in on the radio shows and ""for sale"" signs on the family's lawn after a loss. But overall I was disappointed. I haven't read the book so I don't know how to compare it with the film, but on its on the movie left me flat. Billy Bob underplays his part nicely, but I NEVER got a sense that this was a veteran high school football coach at one of the more high pressure, high profile programs in Texas. I love that actor who played the QB, but again never saw him as a player of the caliber he was supposed to be. Mostly, he just screwed up. The way Permian suddenly started playing well in the playoffs didn't make any sense. The assistant coaches were non-entities (as they almost always are in football movies.) Would a high school coach not check with a star player's doctor himself if there was an injury question? The flashy black tailback (Booby) and the quiet but powerful black lineman (Preacher) are almost stock characters, though both are well acted. Actually the most interesting character was the Hispanic defensive back, but the movie didn't do anything with him. The climactic game was highly dubious. It's hard to imagine a team being that physically dominant and then suddenly getting pounded for the last two quarters, Again, I didn't read the book, but the movie overplayed Carter's viciousness. Don't refs in Texas throw flags for that stuff? There were more things in this film I liked and more I disliked, but overall it was a disappointment. The great high school football movie remains to be made. I guess I'll have to write it myself."
"ShadowGldtr","Null","17","29","4 February 2005"," Some Historical Faults, but none the less, a very good movie
","Spoilers included Yes I know that there are many flaws in the movie. Bobbie was actually hurt in a scrimmage, Ivory was actually a linebacker, Chavez was a tight end, and Don's dad was actually not abusive as it was portrayed. Also, some equipment that was shown was introduced in 2003 way before the Permain saga began.<br/><br/>BUT, i forgave all that. You don't watch a movie to be nit picky, you watch it to be entertained and entertained you will be. This is the best football movie since Remember the Titans. The basic story is in a 1988 Odessa, Texas, their High School team, the Permian Panthers were looked to win the State Championship in division 5A which is one great accomplishment. The story is told through a gritty view of the whole Texas Football Culture.<br/><br/>It shows how real Texas towns act. Every Friday night, the boys suit up and the lights go on. Everyone comes and cheers on your team, and people get drilled on the field. That IS what Texas HS Football is. It's a religion. I especially loved the segment on the preseason because it does show what it looks like to be on the ""team"". I do wished they showed the two a days. The games themselves are very well done as they do use the jersey's and fields for the teams. I did like that. I also liked the story about Chavez being the only one who could get out of Odessa because that is how some of these small towns are(I know Odessa isn't small but bear with me). You have to be very athletic and very smart to get out of them. Also, Ivory Christian character did stay to the source material as he was very shy. Boobie was a boaster and Michael was one of those types of people. I thought Billy Bob did a great job as the coach.<br/><br/>Now onto what i didn't like. I didn't like how they made the State Championship West vs East because it's actually North vs South. Also, the whole fight between Don Billegnsly's dad and him was way to melodramatic and did take time. Also, Michael's mom was kinda of too cheerful for someone who was suppose to be very sick. Especially during the championship game.<br/><br/>Over all, i loved this movie, but I can see why some might not like it. i still highly recommend it."
"Scottiep52","Null","7","10","20 January 2005"," Nothing Like the book
","I read the book before seeing the movie. And i must say the book was ten times better than the movie. The movie never captured the emotion of the book. And the movie didn't delve into the issues outside of football such as education and whatnot. All in all i was pretty disappointed in the movie. And the team never did make the finals they lost in the semi finals to a team that survived their star players flunking out. Ivory Christian and Brian Chavez were not really identified with. The story was mostly about Winchell Billingsley and Boobie. What about Ivory and Chavez? If your going to make a movie about a book at least try and have some similairties with it. The game wasn't played in the Astrodome either!!! The game was played on a rainy day at the University of Texas.<br/><br/>2.5/5"
"captain_astronaut","Null","17","30","27 February 2005"," Not so good
","The problem with Friday Night Lights is that the filmmakers let technique get in the way of story telling. Peter Berg employed the same camera style he used on his failed show Wonderland. Multiple hand held cameras constantly shaking around with short snap zooms. It becomes annoying and takes me out of the moment I want to pay attention to. I didn't care about any of these people, because I wasn't sure who I was looking at or supposed to pay attention to. I didn't know Billy Bob had a daughter until an hour and 17 minutes into the movie. Is that important? Probably not, but she was there to deliver a line about the family needing to move again. I didn't care, because I didn't know anything about his family. Either stick with the main characters and main story or figure a way to fit it all in with out annoying technique. Miracle is a good example of a successful sports movie making. It was not gimmicky and we followed a lot more people. It didn't jump up and down and say ""Look how clever I am!"" I'm also displeased that the story was changed from the semi-finals to the finals. Can the audience only enjoy the movie if the team is playing the big game? Reality and truth can be a lot more interesting than pandering if you have skilled writing and directing. I like Peter Berg as an actor, but he still doesn't impress me as a film maker."
"mmckaibab","1","23","44","12 February 2005"," One hell of a sports cliché fest
","***Spoilers below*** <br/><br/>For the life of me I don't understand how so many folks are so ga-ga over this turkey. For me this was a complete snooze-fest until around half-way through when it got entertaining simply because it was so much fun counting up all the old, tired sports clichés they managed to cram into it.<br/><br/>1. First, there's the setting: small-town, nowheresville Odessa, where high school football is the True Religion, all the kids are desperate to get out, and the football players are the local Gods who get all the free food, booze and sex they want. And, oh yes, there are also the Beautiful Sunset Shots and the Soaring Aerial Views of parts of the town, especially the football field, that tip us off to the fact that something beautiful is really going on under this bleak surface.<br/><br/>2. There's the troubled quarterback with the single mom (who may be seriously ill). Early in the season he's a pretty mediocre player but, when adversity strikes, he steps up and becomes the team leader with skills only slightly less impressive than Troy Aikman's.<br/><br/>3. There's the kid abused by his father and his father's athletic dreams who also, when everything is on the line, suddenly becomes one of the team's stars. He also gets to listen to his father, in a fit of remorse, lecture him on making the most of his senior year because it's all downhill from there and these are the best memories he'll ever have.<br/><br/>4. There's the strutting minority star player with dreams of riding his athleticism to fame and fortune who suffers a serious injury, tries to come back too soon (through the negligent inaction of his coach and his beloved father-figure Uncle), and has his career ended. To drive the point home, the film-makers show us the star sitting dejectedly after his injury watching a group of trash collectors going about their jobs.<br/><br/>5. There's the solid, silent defensive star who has spoken hardly a word, but during half-time of the Big Game he suddenly gives the inspirational speech that fires up the team.<br/><br/>6. There's the calm coach in the center of the storm who, again during half-time of the Big Game, gives the ""it's not about the scoreboard, it's all about what's in your heart, it's all about love, and you're all winners"" speech. This despite the fact that he has previously (and negligently) ignored what he really knows about his star's serious injury and allows him to play because he wants to win so badly.<br/><br/>**Spoiler follows** <br/><br/>7. Then there's the Big Game itself in which Our Heroic Team gets pummeled by the Bad Guys (including flagrant fouls and one incredibly bad officiating call that make the crisis even worse)in the first half only to suddenly find a way to claw their way back (with accompanying swelling music) to one final last-second try that gloriously fails. Then, for the next several minutes we watch in slow motion shot after shot (from different angles of course) of the stars kneeling in noble defeat next to that football just a few agonizing inches from the goal line.<br/><br/>Then there are the Big Steals from Hoosiers:<br/><br/>1. The ""Davids"" from Odessa end up in the Big Game playing the ""Goliaths"" from Dallas Carter.<br/><br/>2. The entire town of Odessa apparently closes down and the entire populace drives across the state of Texas in a long convoy.<br/><br/>3. The ""I love you guys"" speech transplanted from the coach to the troubled quarterback.<br/><br/>Unless you're looking for a primer on how NOT to make a unique sports film, I'd suggest you avoid this turkey."
"kalvinr11","3","17","32","13 September 2005"," Excessive Camera Movement = Bad
","I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not one time when the camera was still - ever. On close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself/herself wondering what just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing. To me, this was a basically terrible movie, wrecked by a camera man with ADHD, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot."
"mistresskiki","1","22","44","10 February 2005"," This movie sucked.
","It was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (doesn't the time-clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in Texas football games?) and not so much redemption (So Your Dad Beats the Crap out of You? Well, do something right for once and then he will Love You and make it all worthwhile).<br/><br/>Either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship OR make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead, this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple yards short. The book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that.<br/><br/>Instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important--the QB calling his sibling to take care of the mother--whatever happened with that? Because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she's not crazy anymore? Its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack.

","The reason Varsity Blues is so much like Friday Night Lights is b/c VB is a fictional story which was written 10 years after the true story of FNL took place in Odessa, TX in 1988.<br/><br/>The game faces worn by the players in FNL are genuine. The ""Religion"" of High School Football gave them no other choice. H.G. Bissinger spent almost an entire year with his family in 1988 in Odessa, TX. He essentially became a part of the community and team in documenting and then writing his book Friday Night Lights. He said that due to depressed economic conditions, lack of higher education, and good paying jobs, the communities in West Texas looked upon the high school football programs as saviors from reality."

","This film centers around a high school football team in West Texas known as the Odessa-Permian Panthers who have set a standard of excellence that remains difficult for anybody else to surpass on the football field. However, with this success has come such a rabid devotion to this team by the local residents that an enormous amount of pressure is put upon everyone associated with the team in the process. So much so that the local residents and alumni not only expect a victory each and every time the team takes the field but they also demand it--or else! And this puts the new coach ""Gary Gaines"" (Billy Bob Thornton) in an especially difficult postion which only gets worse after he loses his star running back ""Boobie Miles"" (Derek Luke) to a season ending knee injury in the very first game. And things really get bad when he not only loses this game but another one not too long afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although there was some artistic license taken with the historical accuracy here and there, the film follows the basic plot of the book and makes for an enjoyable movie experience overall. I especially liked the manner in which the director (Peter Berg) managed to capture the West Texas environment as vividly as he did. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all those who might be looking for a film of this type."
"dmc42c","6","12","23","6 September 2005"," Adequate Football film, but generic and disappointing.
","I have to say first of all that I had high expectations for this movie. I heard it was supposed to be a very realistic film about high school football. Having heard that, I had in mind a high school equivalent of a movie like Any Given Sunday, which I felt was amazing in representing on-field play and (I imagine) very good about off-the-field goings on. I must say that FNL didn't represent High School football the way I remember it. I played for a fairly small school (about 500 students) in a small but supportive town of 6000. I remember we had about 2000 spectators for one game. The kind of football represented in Friday Night Lights is the kind that may be authentic for the large and rabid Texas town in which it is set, but a brand which seems to me closer to college football than the high school football that I and probably most others remember playing.<br/><br/>I think the weakest part of the movie was the character development. By the end, you could tell that certain players were supposed to have been main characters, but yet you're left with a very empty and superficial understanding of who they are. For example, there was one character (who I won't name to avoid any kind of spoiler) who we find out in text at the end went on to a very prestigious profession, and yet we had been left with no particular impression that he was smart or ambitious from the movie to that point. In fact, I felt that I knew almost nothing about the character at all. I did feel a connection to one character, Don Billingsly, although I thought even that was a bit underdone, and to the quarterback Mike Winchell to a lesser extent.<br/><br/>The on-field and other football aspects of the film were alright, although I think a bit generic. They are not particularly inspired though, and don't convey the raw emotion and excitement of being on the field particularly well. I don't know, but I am left to suspect that the director and/or cinematographer may not have experienced high school football themselves.<br/><br/>All that being said, it was still a decent movie. I don't feel I wasted my time in watching it or anything, but it certainly did fall short of expectations, and certainly is not of the same caliber as Any Given Sunday, or even The Program."
"anonymous12","3","13","26","31 December 2004"," Disappointing.....
","This movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done. The main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie.<br/><br/>1) Boobie Miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at Texas Tech. This means he won't get anything done during the season at all and Chris Comer comes up sooner on the team.<br/><br/>2) The game against Marshall was lost at Marshall. The team depicted as Marshall was actually Midland High one of Permian's main rivals and here is the proof- Marshall High is the Mavericks colored Scarlet and Silver, Midland High is the Bulldogs colored Purple and Gold. Look at the jerseys and you will see who it is. Also the real Marshall High's football roster is overwhelmingly Black, the team shown was racially mixed like Midland High. <br/><br/>3) Permian only loses to Midland Lee by one point in district play. Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian. These are the teams that set up the coin toss as such.<br/><br/>4) Boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to Chris Comer and after not getting any playing time in the Midland Lee game, he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again. <br/><br/>5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who wore #85 not a Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition, Boobie wore #35 and Ivory Christian wore #62. <br/><br/>6) The coaches end up liking Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too, this is in part why Boobie quits the team. <br/><br/>7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial stadium where UT plays in the state semi-finals not the state finals. Carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player.<br/><br/>The acting is done pretty well but if you read the book, you will see these flaws are pretty true. I am also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of Dallas Carter's football team. The team according to the book is as large, monstrous, talented, and black as the movie shows. People say it is a racist depiction but reading the book, you see a true depiction of the team. The story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3.5/10."
"Paige-2","Null","14","29","23 January 2005"," Not as good as the book.
","I just don't see how anyone who didn't read the book could follow the story at all. The book was so watered down, and the story is almost unrecognizable. We saw precious little of Booby Miles' complexity or the pressures around him over which he had no control. We saw almost nothing of Chavez, one of the very few players who actually made something of himself, or what effect the high school football experience had on his success in life. And the other players ... their personal lives were so affected by what happened that single season, and it was pretty much ignored. There was so much background about the frenzy that Mojo generated (and still generates) in Odessa that just wasn't shown.<br/><br/>That being said, I can see why the people in Odessa so disapproved of the book and loved the movie. The movie doesn't show the rather affectionate, yet unflattering picture that Buzz Bissinger painted of the town. Instead, it only showed the stereotypical hype of small town football. After seeing the movie, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the book."

","I had to leave the theater, just over half way through it. The film was shot poorly, and the so called in game effect, literally made me sick. I wasn't the only one effected by it, during the film, I witnessed at least 4 people get up and leave. Weather they went for drinks or bathroom breaks, seems unethical. My husband was also another one effected by the movement of the camera, he didn't get sick. He only, thankfully, received a migraine. Non the less, a movie should not be made to make you sick unless its a horror film. Thats my opinion any how. I've never really been a fan of football films, and this movie not only reminded me why I've never liked or appreciated them, but it reassured me, that I still don't care for them.

","I rented this movie primarily on the strengths of Billy Bob Thornton. I think he takes on consistently good roles. This movie had a lot to offer in terms of plot. Rural Texas is big on football, often more so than on academics. The plot point came out in the movie, but seemed to be glossed over to a large degree.<br/><br/>One of the subplots also deals with the relationship between a father, a past high school football champ, and his son who has the opportunity to become a state champ. It is a contentious relationship, but the movie failed to explore that relationship beyond a superficial level.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest distraction in this film is the awful directing by Peter Berg of the football action sequences. They were very unrealistic and ""over the top"" so that they seemed more like a John Madden video game than a high school football game.<br/><br/>The acting was good and the plot was sufficient to prevent this from being a truly horrible film. If you are a sports movie fan, there is a likelihood that you will like this movie much better than I did.

If you can ignore the filming style and gratuitous spitting of blood - every one but the coach spits blood in this picture (the players, sideline photographers, etc) - a good story is hidden in this poorly executed picture somewhere...

"smichaels84","3","11","22","7 November 2004"," One of the worst movies in recent years
","I have to say that I thought that not only was this film possibly the WORST sports film ever, but that it was one of the worst movies I have ever had the pain of seeing. Especially in the theater. It ranks right up there with Godzilla '98, Alien 4, and of course, Armageddon.<br/><br/>My reasons for saying this are not unfounded. It is a terrible movie in several respects. First is that all of the characters in the film are like static cardboard stand-ups that basically stay exactly the same (personality-wise) for the whole movie. Sure, they are based on real people and Peter Berg & company probably wanted to be as accurate as possible but this might be the one movie that makes you understand why some other films contain events depicted ""for dramatization purposes only"". If you adapt real-life in a boring and unattached way, it does not make for a good movie.<br/><br/>Of course, there are many other complaints in all departments. Subplots in the film are either alluded to and never explained (as in the QB's supposedly ill mother) or introduced and dropped (as in the same QB's phone conversation with an unknown/unseen sibling about their mother). No football game depicted, save perhaps for the final anticlimactic championship, takes up more than a minute and a half of screen time, and during that time all we see is a bunch of nondescript catching, running, and tackling complete with surround sound thuds and crashes. We see no plays actually being executed, only referenced by the obligatory radio commentators placed into bad sports movies like this to give you the illusion that something is actually going on when it is really closer to a free-for-all.<br/><br/>Yes, the cinematography was also horrible. I might have just been looking at an old print but it looked terribly overexposed in some kind of attempt to make it look more like 1988 (when it takes place). It also suffered from the same faults that NYPD Blue has always suffered from and that is the caffeine-charged camera operator who cannot help zooming in and out and moving up, down, side to side during almost all shots. I am aware that this was probably Berg's attempt to be ""arty"", but he is actually much much less talented than he thinks he is. This is also evidenced by his co-screen writing credit, which makes him partly responsible for one of the most terribly underdeveloped scripts I've ever seen put on film.<br/><br/>With this film, Peter Berg indeed begins to cement his position as one of the worst modern directors, in my opinion. ""Very Bad Things"" was also a horrible film, and one look at his upcoming features (""Hip Hop Cops""?!) does nothing to quell my fears of his ineptitude. In summary, this is indeed NOT one of the best sports films of all time, but is actually one of the WORST FILMS EVER, let alone one of the worst to debut in the Box Office Top 3."

","I always had a soft spot for sport movies. I felt this movie was exceptional. In a small town inside of Texas, high school football is the most important event. When the Permian High Panthers loses its main star Boobie Miles, all hope is lost. It is up to newly appointed coach Gary Gaines to flare that hope again. The movie was shot in documentary-style. Similar to a reality show. It gives a realistic feel to the movie which helped the movie a lot. It distinguished itself from the other sport movies. It brings us closer to the team.<br/><br/>What I loved the most in this movie is the sense of importance they brought to the football match. Everyone lived their everyday lives in the poor town without passion. Drinking beers, driving trucks, working in a gas station. But when it comes to the football match, It lights up their excitement like a firecracker. It seems as if the football match was their only source of happiness. They acknowledge this as well as the players. The seniors were doing their final year as a football player. They know they weren't good enough to go pro, and surely they weren't smart enough nor rich enough to pursue higher education. This was as good as it gets. That was why every match felt very exciting and heartbreaking to watch."
"night_radio","8","3","4","7 November 2008"," A sports film with a different heart than most.
","It's rare that a film makes it's subject one of (if not the most popular) sporting events in America and takes such a different direction than it's safer counterparts such as ""Any Given Sunday"", or ""Remember the Titans"". ""Friday Night Lights"" steps out from under that thumb and makes it's own path.<br/><br/>We can look back to sporting gems like ""Raging Bull"", or ""This Sporting Life"" - even if they are on two different ends of the spectrum, they chose a path and perspective that is rarely shown in sporting films and they did it with grace and precision. What makes a film like ""Friday Night Lights"" work is that all of the cast seems so adapted into their roles that we believe this is who they are, and when they have their own scenes of personal breakdown (as many do in this film) we do not think they are just actors giving a self indulgent performance or hogging screen time. These people are great at what they do, and they are directed very well throughout.<br/><br/>The mood is set by a score composed by Explosions In The Sky, for what is a very depressing and almost sadist film in regards to Football. It may be dreary for many to handle, which explains much distaste for the film. I've heard it called self indulgent, over directed, over acted, but when you understand what these kids and adults are going through and try to understand their perspective, it can really hit home. High School Football is their life, it is everyone in the towns life, and they don't think twice about why it is that way. It just always has been. There is no looking back, and you have to toughen up to endure what comes with that. Everyone plays the personal scenes of inevitable breakdown with grace and understanding, and those scenes make the film what it is.<br/><br/>Derek Luke as Boobie Miles is a standout for sure, playing his role in times of building the cliché of himself up and really acting when times get tough for himself. He rockets out of his scenes, as does (strangely enough) Tim McGraw. He plays the abusive Father of one of the High School stars, who happened to win the State Championship and was beaten by his own Father when he was a teen. He is raw and no holds barred in every one of his scenes, and was a pleasant surprise to watch. The acting from every angle is strong.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" main downfall is that it is a sad story with no happy ending. It is hard to sell these films. Most movie-goers do not want to sit and watch a story that leaves them emotionally drained. This is not the fault of the film makers or anyone involved in the film, it is just a tendency of the public, and a matter of taste or lack of substance in preference to art."

I've seen this a 1000 times and it never gets old. Football is the heartbeat of the South and if u never played it's something that can't b explained , it's an obsession for high school boys that teaches life skills you can take with you forever.

This movie is one of the best movies of all time IMO, but I love this game and this is as close to point on as it can get, but if you don't like football then you'll never understand. To write a review for Friday Night Lights negatively is ridiculous, just do a survey ask 100 people who love football and if 99 don't say they love this movie that other one is lying.

Some try to be dramatic, but most fail because unless a person is playing a sport they often don't feel the tension, the struggle, the pain, or the elation. Where most others fail, Friday Night Lights soars.<br/><br/>Peter Berg does a wonderful job using the shaky-cam technique to create a documentary type of feel to the movie. We see the characters in their daily lives as if we are walking side by side with them. This is especially effective considering the plight many of those people feel. They all want to escape. Through football they can. Berg captures this. <br/><br/>The acting is extremely balanced. Even Tim McGraw surprises. Derek Luke is exceptional tackling(no pun intended) a tragic superstar.

"oshram-3","3","10","20","10 October 2004"," A mediocre Varsity Blues
","I find football a far more interesting sport than baseball, but for some reason baseball gets much better films (there is no equivalent of The Natural or Field of Dreams for football. Football fans get crap like Rudy). Friday Night Lights, unfortunately, does nothing to break that tradition.<br/><br/>The movie follows the book by Buzz Bissinger and touts to be based on a real story, but oddly enough for such claims the movie has less emotional impact than another movie I found similar, Varsity Blues. Lights follows the story of a high school football team from Odessa, Texas as they make their way to the state championship in 1988.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that there's no central character. We're given a potentially interesting ensemble, but no one to connect with. Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) isn't particularly deep; he's neither likable, like Gene Hackman from Hoosiers, nor talented but venal, like Robert Voight from Varsity Blues. He's just sort of there, in theory the leader of the team but actually having very little impact whatsoever (other than to broadcast the unorthodox ending). Likewise with players Mike (Lucas Black), Don (Garrett Hedlund), and Chavez (the almost always reliable Jay Hernandez); we get glimpses into their lives (well, okay, not Chavez's, at all) but only glimpses, not anything near enough to make them engaging characters. And what we are given is pretty rote: Mike has problems with his mother, who might or might not be losing her mind; Don's dad (country singer Tim McGraw) is an overbearing and often drunk former high school football star (which we saw done to far better effect, again, in Varsity Blues); and so on. We aren't given any meat to these characters, except for one guy, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and Boobie is such a jerk it's impossible to like him.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the team's 1988 season, taking them from their first game straight through to the championship. Most of the game footage is acceptable but not overly exciting, and we get no special sense of any player's skill or weaknesses. Only when we get to the final game in the Astrodome does the pace step up; the second half of the game is portrayed in vivid style, exciting, and the movie comes to life and becomes riveting for about fifteen minutes. But that's a really long buildup for so little payoff, even if the plot does go in a slightly unexpected direction at the very end.<br/><br/>The performances are all adequate but hardly anything exciting. I was impressed by McGraw in one scene, where we find out why he is the way he is; but everyone else gives good solid performances. No one stands out, and no one is particularly bad. Firmly middle of the road.<br/><br/>Although I should probably take this movie on its own merits, there are so many similarities to Varsity Blues (one wonders if they weren't inspired by Bissinger's book a little) that it's frankly hard not to make the comparison, and Blues does a much better job with almost the same material (including remembering to round out its principals into actual characters). Lights is only so-so; worth maybe a rental on a bored Friday night, though I'm not sorry I saw the final ball game. But it's a definite pass on the big screen. If you want to see this story told in a much more interesting and entertaining way, rent Varsity Blues."

Sadly, the only way to make a good sports film is to find something that actually happened or possibly shoot the film in a way that is unfamiliar in its context. FNL failed on both accounts. Not only was this film a blatant rip-off of Michael Mann's visual acuity, this film also failed to mention the 'Based on a True Story' tag was utterly false. There were many little details that were in the film that actually happened in the book, but the racism, the separation of the classes, and the economic strife that was in the book didn't come to life on the screen. Instead, the over used story lines that were portrayed in the film became something of a bore, and the nice cinematography couldn't save this film. I found it rather dull and a sad betrayal of the truth. And what is even sadder, Buzz Bissinger has sold his soul just to make a buck off the book by calling the movie accurate. So who cares if Odessa can't acknowledge it's racist past? Can we ever not acknowledge the Germans were Nazis? The tinkering of the truth was the real issue for me in why I despised this film, because let's face it, the truth would have been a lot more interesting. Read the book and you'll find out why."

I saw the all-star getting hurt long before the game. I figured maybe they'd wait for him to collapse until, ya know, the game before the ""big one"" but I guess the first game is good enough.<br/><br/>The parental relationships were also very clichéd, with the dominating drunk father (I will say McGraw impressed me, however), and the boy who wants to stay and help his (ailing?) mother.<br/><br/>I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes, and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field. I thought ""ok, now how does this work into the plot again?"" Maybe I missed the point, beyond ""Well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet"" point.<br/><br/>The sports action had some good points, but most of it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs! And I wasn't so sure about the continuity of the winding-down clock in the final game.<br/><br/>I guess I could see this movie winning the ESPY for best sports film if it was the only one released.

In the movie Permian was shown beating Amarillo in the 4th round of the playoffs (again, they beat Amarillo in the 1st round in the book/real life). In the book/real life the beat the Lamar Vikings in the 4th round of the playoffs. The only playoff game that was portrayed accurately was the 3rd round win over the Irving Nimitz Vikings.<br/><br/>12. The movie showed Permian losing to Dallas Carter 34-26 in the 5th round of the playoffs, the state championship. In the book/real life Permian lost to Dallas Carter 14-9 in the 5th round of the playoffs, the state semifinals. The movie portrayed Permian being stopped on the 1 foot line with no time left. In the book/real life the game ended on an incomplete pass. <br/><br/>13. The movie showed Permian and Dallas Carter officials meeting in Midland deciding where to play the game, agreeing to play the game in the Houston Astrodome. In the book/real life they agreed to play the game at the Univ of Texas Stadium in Austin. <br/><br/>14. The movie showed the star running back who was hurt at the beginning of the movie, Boobie Miles, quitting the team and then rejoining the team for the trip to play Dallas Carter to cheer the team on, showing him forming a special bond with his teammates. In the book/real life, Miles quit the team, never rejoined it, and listened to the game on the radio back in Odessa.<br/><br/>15. The movie portrayed one team captain, Ivory Christian, as a defensive end. In the book/real life he was a linebacker.<br/><br/>16. The movie portrayed another team captain, Chavez, as a defensive back. In the book/real life he was a tight end.<br/><br/>There are numerous other examples of inaccuracies in the movie and erroneous portrayals of what actually occurred in the book/real life. Some of the other posters have already commented on many of them. In addition the movie used a bunch of actors obviously in their mid 20s to portray the Permian players. The Dallas Carter players in the movie all appeared to be in their 20s and 30s. These high school players in real life were mostly 16-17 years old. It looks ridiculous to have actors in their 20s and 30s playing a bunch of 16-17 year olds. The movie portrays Odessa as a small town. Its not- its a city of 100,000. And anyone on here who refers to Odessa as a small town is completely ignorant to the fact its not. The movie also overly and negatively stereotyped the citizens of Odessa as a bunch of ignorant, racist rednecks. That's typical stereotyping by Hollywood liberals of small city folks and southerners. Some of the real people portrayed in the movie probably even have grounds for defamation of character lawsuits. <br/><br/>Its a joke that this movie was called based on a true story, and this is coming from someone who lived in small city Texas for several years and followed Texas high school football. It should have been called what it was-a mostly fictional movie. The movie was typical Hollywood garbage. As usual, whenever Hollywood tries to make a movie based on a true event, they always intentionally and unintentionally get their facts wrong, alter events, and make up stuff that didn't happen. Its not worth even paying $4-5 to rent from Blockbuster. The book, on the other hand, is worth the read."

","As like most non-fiction books adapted for the big screen, the movie leaves out much of the essence of the book. I did like the fact that they didn't ""hollywood"" the ending, but much of the characters lives were left out for more of the football action. <br/><br/>All in all a good view, but I recommend reading the book as well. I think the 10 year anniversary edition of the book, which went into great detail on where the kids were now was also an addition that the movie should have included.

There are many of them and some reviewers have already done an excellent job of pointing them out, so I feel no need to repeat them. This is not a movie altering fiction, this is a movie changing facts and events that really did happen. None of my three movie companions had read the book and they all enjoyed the movie more than I, who wondered how these changes were making the story better. In case anyone is confused, the author was following the team during this season, he did not simply choose afterword to write about that season. Bissinger wrote a great book, but was extremely fortunate that the season he chose to follow the team turned out to be one full of interesting twists. I hope everyone enjoys the movie, and if you did, I strongly encourage you to read the book!"

","This film, unfortunately looks like it was pieced together, agonized over, and shots thrown in just for the heck of it...very disjointed. The character development is almost nil. The main protagonists have NO backstory. They are presented AS IS and you fill in the spaces. Afterwards you will ask yourself, where was that guy's mother? How come the abusive father makes a 180 at the end of the film? What motivates the coach? ETC.,ETC. I thought, O.K. just enjoy it for the football segments, but those were hard to watch, with twitchy, fast-moving camera work, ridiculous foley work with bone-cracking sounds, grunting like bulls in heat, and collisions that sound like somebody dropping ton-weight sacks of grain off a building! The entire film looks like when you sharpen your digital images just one step too many - grainy and extremely defined. I guess they were going for a kind of documentary look but it came across as just plain annoying to look at. The colors, too, were washed out like weak tea and the extreme close-ups are interesting if you want to count the pores on Billy Bob Thornton's face (frankly, I don't)."

The only saving grace (unfortunately not saving enough) is that the film shows the empty nature faced by the far majority in sports. <br/><br/>This film is more of a portrayal of life in a narrow-minded Texas town than it is about football. Perhaps that was the intent. However, many sports fans are going to be surprised while sociologists applaud. Friday Night Lights tries to do too much by telling the story of the town and of the team. There really wasn't enough depth into either. <br/><br/>Save your money... see this one when it's on DVD.

Because you cannot tell what parts of this are true (an TV interview with one of the players told me his father was not as portrayed in the movie) then one must assume many of the subplots and life stories (other than subtitles at the end) were created for this movie. They probably fictionalized the finish to the game.This is a typical soap opera. But it is worse. This is the kind of Hollywood fodder that conservatives thrive on.

"christian123","6","5","9","2 May 2005"," Great Sports Drama
","Friday Night Lights is a very entertaining sports drama that captures the real life energy of football. The town of Odessa, Texas has seen better times, struggling with closing businesses and poverty, but those problems seem to disappear every Friday night, as the community rallies around its local high school football team, the Permian Panthers, as led by Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton). Friday Night Lights follows the 1988 season in the Panthers' quest to get to the State Championship. The plot sounds pretty good and the execution is also very good. Even though you have heard the story a bunch of times, this film still manages to keep you interested. I don't know how the story happened so I can't comment if Hollywood changed a lot of things. Even if they did, the film is nicely executed and very entertaining to watch. The acting was very good as they captured the energy and effort the real life players put into the game. The best was Billy Bob Thornton as Gary Gaines and he played the role very effectively. Tim McGraw was great as Charles Billingsley and I wasn't even expecting him to be that good. Derek Luke does a good job playing Boobie Miles and makes up for being in Spartan. Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez and Lucas Black all play players on the team. They each play their roles well and I think the best out of them is Lucas Black. Peter Berg does a good job of directing, making the movie feel and look exciting. He also directed The Rundown which was pretty good as well. The film is full of clichés but that has become unavoidable for all sport movies. Its also kind of short for this type of film at only 118 minutes long and that goes by fast as this is a very nice film to watch. The ending was also unexpected since usually the underdog wins but not in this film. The character development wasn't very good either. I still felt for the characters since I was very into the film but it may be hard for others. This movie is also better then Miracle and Remember the Titans. In the end, this is a very nice sports drams that's defiantly worth checking out. Rating 8/10, not only for football fans but for the average movie goer as well."

If that's the only way modern directors have to portray chaotic events, then they need to go back to film school. (et tu, The Bourne Supremacy?) Furthermore, the film failed to make me care about any of the characters. The main thing I learned about the kids...they're ugly when they eat. Friday Nights Lights is about kids, (lacking storyline characterization) living in a football obsessed town, learning how to win at football. Remember The Titans is about kids, (deeply defined), living in a football obsessed town, learning how to win at life. No comparison."

There was not one person in that city who knew or cared about anything else except American football. That's stupidity at its best: ""I'm stupid and proud of it."" I have not found a single character to care about in this film. I felt a little sorry for the kids but those kids would grow up to be just like the adults in that town: stupid and proud of it. I would also like to say that some of the 'headlines' I saw or heard in this film are amazingly moronic and some actually dangerous: ""Whatever it takes"" ""There's too much learning in school"" - bad grammar too. ""I've got straight A's... because football is everything"" And the constant 'melody' of the film: ""This is the only year of your life that matters"". Really?!!! Why don't they just kill themselves after high school then?! I admit that I don't like American football at all. But I always enjoyed sports films and it never mattered what sport. There have been plenty of movies about American football that I enjoyed... for entertainment value, not for the sport. This is the first film about sports that I ever considered just taking the DVD out of the player and throw it away after 30 minutes. If you are an American who likes to have beer hanging out of his cap then you will definitely enjoy this movie. If you speak moronic you will also enjoy this film. If not stay away from it!!! 1/10"
"tedster_98","5","6","12","13 January 2007"," OK, but some serious issues
","Good story - could have developed more around characters. The sexual activities portrayed with the teenagers really detracted from a film, and further sent a statement with viewers that this was OK activity. Not enough was developed about the history or legacy of the school and why should the viewer care about the school in the first place. Having lived in El Paso for 7 years which is a Texas stones throw from Odessa - I could understand the boredom and desolation. A lot of the film centered around Boobie Miles yet the anti-climax was grossly undeveloped and left the viewers really wondering what happened to him and the other players after the final game and before graduation. Another example is the player with the sick mother. A lot of the film explains his concern for leaving her to join the world, yet the viewer is let down when nothing is done to explain what happens in the future. This was supposed to be a football and real-life reality movie yet too much was focused on football and not enough on the life. It was a cheap American Graffiti style ending. Overall a good film, but not great."
"radioriot","2","6","12","29 May 2006"," Child Abuse Glorified
","""Lights"" was shot the way I was afraid it would be.. glorifying this type of ""all out"" High School football rather than condemning it. The Book was written to show how ""out of control"" football has gotten in Texas. But the movie seemed to justify even the abusive parents. A parent decks his son and the coaches just watch and wait for the abuse to end, then they go right back to practice. In a book the author can editorialize, but in a movie they must take action or the viewer thinks that the abuse is o'k. Too many sports fans I know thought this movie was great and wished all High Schools had football programs like Texas. Their attitude was: ""I'm better than you because I played football"" and that is just so sad. Sports has gotten out of control in America. I love sports, but I don't plan my life around. I don't live for the next game. I can watch a movie or go play Golf then check the scores later. I don't tape games to watch later. Spend time with your families not with million dollar sports stars. I like Billy Bob Thornton but even he couldn't save this movie for me. I have not met one person who felt the movie condemned ""all out sports"". But that was why the book was written! The book was written to show how High School football in Texas is nothing more than child abuse... Cohen and Berg re-wrote it to glorify abuse and Hollywoodize it. If this is how most football programs in Texas are run, they should be shut down. And I think most Texas football programs are still run this way or close to it. How sad that a kid would think he is worthless because he dropped a pass."

","I'm at a loss. This entire movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg film for football. The camera cutting, the pace, all so copied. I thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. Yes, we all know Southerners like football and beauty pageants. Must we be inundated with it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talent assembled in the style of Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the film. You didn't get the characters. It was character driven, but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part. The one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player. Why is he so silent? What's his deal? Did we really need the scene with him ""proving"" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. It just made no sense. <br/><br/>And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their ""conceivable"" problems, darnit. We got nothing. We got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that Mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer (Lee). Why didn't you follow that story? What were we to get out of this one? The movie led you along, but didn't lead you anywhere. I just felt like something was missing. It felt like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies led you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie. The actor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his issues? <br/><br/>And the other team in the play-offs...are we to believe those are high school teens? Those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s. Who were they trying to kid? I know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. Nothing pieced together. The characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was showcased. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee."

It is not reflective of the ""religion"" that is West Texas football and the characters are shallow...thinly developed and make the whole event look like a brutal and half wit filled gladiator match. Trust me folks...it isn't and the only person in this whole movie that is remotely believable and not a well worn out soap opera character is the Permian head Coach played by Billy Bob Thorton. I'm sorry he will always be the slasher from ""Sling blade"" to me,.... and perhaps it is a credit to his art as an actor...that his last great performance still lingers in one's mind. His little buddy from ""Sling Blade"" is now the hard luck quarterback in ""Lights"" and except for some really lame dialogue that he is forced to say by really poor writing...he was passable in the role. <br/><br/>I was in attendance at the actual Dallas Carter/ Odessa Permian game in the Astro Dome in 1988 and...this rendition of the game is an insult to the Dallas Carter team and panders to the Mojo mystique of the Permian team in extreme excess. If I were one of the African Americans from Dallas Carter I would be repulsed as to how they were depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>But the movie will make a few bucks and perhaps someone will decide that they should do the ""Brownwood Lions"" story and I might get to be on Good Morning America....but if you are from Texas and ""Know"" what the tradition actually is in our state...skip this one and wait for the Gordon Wood Story...now that would be interesting...to a few of us anyway"

","Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around high-school football in a small Texas town. <br/><br/>One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing. It's about growing up, letting go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing perspective and gaining it. It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond, but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole town on your shoulders when you're only 17. <br/><br/>Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the long aerial views of the empty Texas plains. <br/><br/>It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too – a few plot lines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiar from other films. And I understand those that say the film displays a superior attitude towards these small town people. But I found those weaker moments fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and filmmaking."

If I'm wrong about this, please feel free to correct me, but I believe OHS also plays in the town stadium, and the ""Home of the Permian Panthers"" sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at Permian. I would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year, OHS vs Permian.

","Often times a reviewer will claim that they had to look away from a film, and this usually is a good thing. For example having to look away from a horror film out of fear, or look away from a tear jerker because one does not want to cry. But when I say ""I had to look away from ""Friday Night Lights"" I am not complimenting the film.<br/><br/>The move opens in a very indie-film hand held camera way, with jerky cuts and a lone guitar on the soundtrack. It is swirling and interesting, with the only focus being a man running to the first day of football practice. I thought at first that this was interesting, a clever way to get attention at the beginning of the film, but the jerky camera and lone guitar on the soundtrack did not go away. The camera, obviously a hand-held for that ever so trendy ""documentary realness,"" never stops moving. It is always swirling, zooming in on peoples faces for no apparent reason and did I mention that the camera is always moving? This creates not a documentary feel, but several waves of intense nausea. I in fact felt so ill several times that I had to look away and focus on a rug in order to regain my balance.<br/><br/>I saw this film at a free screening and it was not worth the money. Every character that you would expect to see in a sports movie is here, every last cliché. The smart kid who just wants to college and his heart is not in the game; the cocky super-athlete who is cut down in his prime by injury and the third ring player who comes out of nowhere to save the day when the cocky player is injured.<br/><br/>The clichés do not stop with the characters. The film fulfills every cliché it possibly can and includes ridiculously predictable plot elements. I will not say who wins the ""Big Game,"" but trust me that by the time the ""Big Game"" comes to be, you will already know who wins and who loses and chances are you will not care.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" has one story line that felt a little ""Lifetime Television for Women,"" but it was this story that gave me the only sense of real human emotion. It is the story of a boy whose overbearing father was once a State Football champ, and that was his lifes high lite. He is now a drunk who forces his son to live up to his past glory, with several fights and achingly touching moments along the way. Their final meeting after ""The Big Game"" is the crown jewel in the movie and the only ending that gives an adequate sense of closure to a character.<br/><br/>Despite its one redeeming factor, ""Friday Night Lights"" remains hopelessly flawed. The direction is vomit inducing (literally, I almost had to run for the bathroom twice,) and some of the dialog is not only trite, but borders on racist. I know the movie is based on true events, but the people in this world created by ""Friday Night Lights"" simply do not act human. They take no joy in their physical abilities and there are almost no shots of a single character being happy. The people in this film exist only to act morose and to bring drama, they are never allowed to exist, we are forbidden from getting to know them beyond their dramatic football lives.<br/><br/>If you must see this movie, don't. Go rent ""Varsity Blues,"" it is a High School football movie set in small town Texas (just like ""Friday NIght Lights"") and it even has the same characters as this film. The only difference is that in ""Varsity Blues"" people have fun, they exist as characters not just cliché dramatists.<br/><br/>As for the football scenes hailed as ""brilliant"" and ""realistic,"" they are impossible to watch because of they way they are filmed. A sports movie should make you want to watch the game, not look away for fear of saying ""Hello"" to your already consumed popcorn."

They did a good job of depicting this.<br/><br/>For many that have experienced playing in a ""football community"" this movie will hit home. It happens way too much and most never even make it to college to play. <br/><br/>It also got into the racial issues that are faced. Dallas Carter vs Odessa-Permian puts this into perspective. Many today will argue that the game was stolen from Odessa-Permian. The movie depicts Dallas Carter in a negative light - cheap shots, dirty players, etc. Dallas Carter has some good players on that team and Odessa-Permian was over matched in talent and ability. But they played with a lot of heart and per the movie came close to potentially winning."

","I was totally disappointed by this movie. After hearing SI called it a classic, etc. I held my breathe, but was looking forward to a good movie on a GREAT topic.<br/><br/>I've been a football fan my whole life, and having experienced Ohio HS football, I know that HS FB can be great! But this movie missed the mark. It's totally Hollywood. Scores and even teams played were not what that 1988 team did. The movie is filled with choreographed footage, that would have made Rocky vs. Mr T proud. All fake. Too bad.<br/><br/>If you're a FB junkie, enjoy, it doesn't stink, but it's only a ""3 or 4"". If you're not into FB, you're better off with a rerun of Seinfeld.<br/><br/>If you want to see a ""true"" HS Football movie that follows the truth, try ""GO TIGERS"". A low budget, but well done documentary"

I believe the people in this town are bizarre, even if this is accurate. All they think is football, football, football? Come on! There is more to life people!! In one pep talk we had to endure, the coach told his team that they were ""protectors of their town"", from what??!! Protectors from ""things that really matter""? Because when it comes down to it people, football is just a GAME. But for some reason it gets treated with fanaticism. If this was a chess team would this movie be taken as seriously?

"harrylosborne","7","2","3","19 January 2020"," A far more finished product than you would believe
","I saw the television show of the same name around five years ago, and remember loving it: a genuine, down-to-earth production on rural football, featuring big names like Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton and Jesse Plemons. This big-screen version might not have the same starpower (although does feature Billy Bob Thornton), but I actually think that's for the better: this film is simple, it's real, and it tells a story well. Frankly, Hollywood could use some more of this to cut through the swathes of overproduced rubbish being pumped out weekly.<br/><br/>The story is pretty linear - a high school football team in Texas trying to win a championship. They are a good team, but winning is never easy. Based on H.G. Bissinger's book, the stark realities of a depressed town buoyed by football are probably more real than you'd like to believe; it is even sadder to think that for these players, those final seasons probably did mark the highpoint of many of their lives. The team is full of unusual characters, starting with the boisterous running back Booby Miles (Derek Luke), but helmed by the reserved quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black). Ultimately, they are all friends, but the bright lights of football sometimes muddle the mind.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, it doesn't really matter whether they won or lost, who played well or failed to perform. You watch because the characters convince you how much sports means to them, especially considering a lot don't have much to strive for after their season ends. The story doesn't rely on a leading man to have a great performance; they are a team, and this is one of the only sports films I've seen that really seems to understand what that means."

","**WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW!!!**<br/><br/>I guess if 'Friday Night Lights' came out a few years ago, I could appreciate it more. When I saw the trailer months ago I just shrugged it off as yet ANOTHER football movie. It's all been done before, how many football movies do we need? In the past 5 years we've had Remember The Titans, Any Given Sunday and Varsity Blues....go back further and there was The Program...and even a football comedy flick (Unnecessary Roughness). Same premise here: small town obsessed with their football, overprotective parents living through their high school athlete sons, hoping they get the glory of 'winning state'. It comes off as all the same to me. Billy Bob did what he had to do here...and Derek Luke just can't seem to rise above the 'supporting actor' status. This is the second movie where I've seen his character basically incapacitated within the first hour of a movie where he's one of the main stars of the film (the other being 'Spartan', where his character was the victim of one of the most unexpected and shocking deaths ever in film). Outside of Antoine Fisher, one really has to wonder if he'll ever get the leading role in a worthwhile film again.<br/><br/>What I found funny was the fact that I sat in the theater for 2 hours with this team; watching them go through their respective battles/dramas in their lives......just for them to lose in the state championship game in the final seconds by inches (I must admit that was pretty tough to witness), and then to get a subtitle saying that Billy Bob coached them again next year and won the state title going undefeated. I guess that 'winning' season was too boring of a story, huh? But I get it, they still 'won' here...off the field in their own respective lives, in essence 'becoming perfect' in the words of Billy Bob. Eh. 'Friday Night Lights' is an okay flick, nothing special; but don't expect anything new here...I honestly don't know how anyone can.<br/><br/>** out of **** stars."

"sam_smithreview","9","1","1","2 May 2016"," One of the best sports movies
","Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around high-school football in a small Texas town. <br/><br/>One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing. It's about growing up, letting go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing perspective and gaining it. It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond, but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole town on your shoulders when you're only 17. <br/><br/>Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the long aerial views of the empty Texas plains. <br/><br/>A movie like this depends on its actors, because it is a character drama at its core. Much noise has been made of Billy Bob, and how he gives a great performance, and this is very true, but he is not the only star in this movie. The boys all do a great job too, especially Lucas Black. I have never noticed this actor before, but he is so intense as Mike Winchell that he makes you really feel for him. The other boys, including Derek Luke and Jay Hernandez, are also note- perfect.<br/><br/>Few plot twists feel too familiar from other films. I understand those that say the film displays a superior attitude towards these small town people. But I found those weaker moments fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and film making."

","There have not been many movies that I have critiqued in a bad way. But, Firday Night Lights strayed too far away from the book in too many ways. I know you can't do everything as the book tells it, but for the books' sake, get the freaking' game right! 1. The game was not played in the Astrodome. The game was played a Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas in the rain. The last play was an incomplete pass, not a QB scramble to the one yard line. And above all, it wasn't the 5A Championship Game, it was the Semi-Final game. 2. The tie-breaking coin toss was on the radio. The coin toss was not televised. Mike did not go with Coach Gaines the the coin flip, the team listened to the broadcast while returning from a football game on the bus radio. <br/><br/>This movie could have been so much better. The book is wonderful. Permian has a tremendous football heritage. I don't think the movie told the story of the town, the school, the fans or the football team as well as it should have. There was so much more that could have been told. I would have gladly sat through a 2 1/2 or 3 hour movie for more of the story to be told.<br/><br/>There are several other things wrong with this movie as compared to the book. Read the book and imagine the story in your head. The visions in your mind will far out-do the movie."
"MojoMomma","Null","4","9","13 October 2004"," Based on a true story does not mean it is a documentary...
","I watched the 1988 season unfold from the 1st game until Permian played Dallas Carter in Austin at UT on that rainy afternoon.<br/><br/>I'm sorry theSundance14 but you did not attend the actual state game against Dallas Carter at the AstroDome because it did not happen. Please, let me quote you...I was in attendance at the actual Dallas Carter/ Odessa Permian game in the Astro Dome in 1988..... Just for the record. Permian played Dallas Carter for semi-finals in AUSTIN at UT. Dallas Carter played Converse Judson for State. Dallas Carter was stripped of their title because the school had broken eligibility rules. They forfeited all of their playoff games and Converse Judson was declared State Champions. <br/><br/>Peter Berg definitely took a creative license when it came to recreating the 1988 season and the relationship between Don and Charlie Billingsly. But then again, if we wanted it word for word it would have been called a documentary. Documentaries are something that ends up on the History Channel late a night. Plus, they don't sell tickets. <br/><br/>If you go to this movie expecting it to be a mirror of the 1988 season, then you will be very disappointed. Watch the movie for entertainment, read the book for something near the truth. Remember, the book is written through the eyes of a man(not a native Texan) who lived in Odessa one year and decided to write about something he thought would sell him books and put him on the best seller list. He succeeded. I've always heard if you want to sell books, write about something controversial. If you want to sell movie tickets, if have to make a movie that touches the audiences emotions. Looks like Peter Berg did that. Go to the ESPN website and they have a comparison of the real life events and the movie events. <br/><br/>It's sad that the whole nation seems to think Odessa is some backwards town that thinks of nothing else than football and how football will allow our children to leave this dusty little town. Some of us choose to to stay here. Some of us choose to raise our children here. It is a shame people will never know the ""real"" citizens of Odessa."
"gelman@attglobal.net","3","3","6","6 December 2010"," Much Over-rated
","I never read the book, which got good reviews. I've never seen the TV series which generated a lot of buzz. But the movie -- well, it's a great disappointment. There are lots of places where high school football is a symbol of local pride and where the fans and the boosters are as heavily invested in their team's success as any big city is in its pro team. High school football is pretty intense in Ohio and Pennsylvania but, it's widely said, that high school football is nowhere as big a deal as it is in Texas. Perhaps it's because there ain't much to do in small Texas towns on Friday night and we might as well mosey down to the ""stadium"" (actually a field with bleachers on both sides) and watch the local boys play their arch rivals. It seems as if every opponent is an arch rival. And it ain't about the game. It ain't about the sport. It's all about winning. Permian High School in Odessa, Texas, is the school and Billy Bob Thornton is the coach who better, by God, win or they'll kick his ass out of town. This is supposed to be a true story and for all I know it is. But except for the exceptionally talented running back who expects to be a star at a Division I university and a pro after college, the kids aren't of much interest, despite strenuous efforts to make them so. What happens to the star running back is the only interesting element in the story, and I won't spoil it for anyone who decides to watch this boring film. Hard, even vicious tackling can be seen on TV every Saturday, Sunday, Monday - - and in plenty of cases on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday too. Now there's a channel that's all NFL football all the time. I can only watch so much of it, and this wasn't it. Besides, we forgot the popcorn and soda"
"Kevin_Maness","5","3","6","16 October 2005"," disturbed by the racist overtones
","(I guess there's kind of a spoiler here, if you couldn't predict from the very beginning of the movie that the scrappy, small Permian team would end up facing the massive Dallas Carter team in the State Championships.) <br/><br/>First, I'll say the awful thing--the book was better. This is rarely a fair criticism of a movie, but in this case I have to mention it because I think the conversion of the book into this movie results in the racism that I will mention later. The book was a nuanced, often-surprising character study of nearly a dozen Permian players. But the movie, due to the constraints of the medium, becomes a superficial skim-over of a half-dozen Permian players. Where the book was a critique of Permian culture in Odessa (and, by extension of sports culture in the US), the movie is just another sports movie, and not a particularly good one at that.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is why the depiction of the Dallas Carter team is so disturbingly racist. In a book, you can deal with the racial conflict underlying the Permian-Dallas Carter game in some depth and subtlety. In the movie, not so much.<br/><br/>First of all, the meeting in which representatives of the football teams meet to negotiate a playing field, the black representatives of the Dallas Carter team are made to look ridiculous and paranoid in their concern that the site is fair to their team and that the officiating crew include black officials. Their paranoia is established in contrast to Billy Bob's sardonically ""reasonable"" suggestions that ""zebras are black & white"" and that ""zebras have as many white stripes as black stripes."" What does this even mean? Is he arguing for even racial composition of the officiating staff or that the ethnicity of the officials doesn't matter? Regardless, at the end of the meeting the Great White Negotiator comes up with the seemingly inspired suggestion that the game be held at the Astrodome. Obviously, if this coach had been around during the Civil Rights movement, so much violence and conflict could have been averted (that's sarcasm).<br/><br/>Second, and more important, the representation of the Dallas Carter team was appalling. They are not merely Permian's opponents in the State Championships--they are the force of EVIL incarnate, and, not coincidentally, they are ALL BLACK! Yes, yes, I know that the team really was all black in actual life, but the filmmakers are not content to leave that alone. They must also render the Dallas Carter players inhuman. Already, the race card has been played in the meeting I mention above, so the filmmakers have primed us to see race as an issue in the meeting between Permian and Dallas Carter. It could have been handled more interestingly by showing the kind of racial conflict the Carter players had to live through, the inequalities facing Carter students, etc. In other words, racial stereotypes could have been challenged. Instead, they are reinforced.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we are repeatedly shown that the Carter players are huge. When they play Permian, we see that, certainly, in slow motion, low-angle shots designed to make the players look more fearsome. But we also get to see that they are brutally violent and beast-like in their aggression. Furthermore, they cheat. And, as any racist white person would have predicted, the black official makes the only bona-fide bad call in the game, and it goes in Carter's favor. Not only that, but the Carter players are not simply black--they are dark-skinned, and some of them sport long hair and hip-hop attitudes, as if to emphasize that these guys are not the innocuous, loud-mouth, jester (another long-standing stereotype of black males in film and literature), Booby Miles--they are really bad guys. I can't help but say that the Carter players embody the ""black buck"" stereotype of the violent, black male, as seen throughout the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's sad to me that this is still the fall-back mode of racial representation in 2005. So much more could have been done here, but the filmmakers were too lazy, and in resorting to the ""easy"" path of racist representation, they reinforce age-old racist stereotypes of black people (and black athletes) in America."
"dickerson_10","1","3","7","15 January 2005"," ""One of the greatest sports stores ever told ... ""
",""" ... so let's completely rewrite it."" <br/><br/>This is easily one of the most over-hyped movies of all time. Universal Pictures really went all out of this movie in terms of marketing -- odds are if you watched any TV this year you saw the various TV spots for this movie about 5000 times. Many of them touting the ""positive"" reviews this movie got and ALL of them pointing out that it is based on ""one of the greatest sports stories ever told.""<br/><br/>Which raises the question of why they completely re-wrote the story. While several reviewers (including the author of the book) claim the movie is ""accurate"", the truth of the matter is, if you changed the name of the school and the players, and renamed the movie, no one would recognize it. Maybe some people would see parallels with Boobie's story, but not by the ending. And they would all be wondering who that QB's crazy mom was supposed to be and why the MLB never talked.<br/><br/>The movie waffles between trying to be your typical popcorn football action movie (Varsity Blues), and some kind of hard-hitting drama. It fails at both. There's no suspense during the games because everyone has seen this formula a million times. And the major drama points in the movie (Don Billingsley's relationship with his alcoholic father, Mike Winchell's insane mom) are both totally ineffective and totally made-up by the writers. The book was powerful because it didn't flinch in telling two rather sad stories (Boobie and Mike). The movie removes all emotional impact by re-writing these stories to be more acceptable to mainstream viewers.<br/><br/>Why does this movie fail so bad? Because it fails to capture what high school football is all about. The close relationship with the fans and the players. The fans are proud mothers and fathers, brothers, girlfriends, friends, former players, and members of the community. There is a whole lot more emotional investment by the crowd at a high school football game than there is at an NFL or college game. The book went through a lot of trouble to tell the story of these die-hard Permian fans. But the movie portrays them as dumb rednecks. Which raises the question during the movie, why would you even WANT to play high school football if it were really like that?<br/><br/>0.0 out of 10 stars. Peter Berg should commit suicide for ruining such a great book. Varsity Blues was a far superior movie in the sense that at least it was entertaining, and didn't use the book's name as a crutch to sell tickets.<br/><br/>As a side note, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the positive reviews on here were by Universal Pictures employees. They spent so much on TV ads trying to manipulate people into thinking it was a great movie, why not get some free publicity? I know Amazon.com had a TON of negative reviews, and now the customer review section for this movie has been ELIMINATED on there. I've NEVER seen that happen before."
"lawprof","8","3","7","27 October 2004"," Sad, Depressing, Well Told Tale of Texas H.S. Football Passion Run Amok
","[Disclaimer: I have no interest in sports and know virtually nothing about football.]<br/><br/>High school football has come to the big screen in the past couple of years in two forms. One is Coca-Cola's rousing, high production values commercial, ""Football Town, USA,"" suffered through by untold millions of moviegoers. In this bouncy, spirited attempt at thirst-creating, people of all ages and races come together for a weekend football game played by competitive but fair and clean-cut youths. Winning is important but community esprit, cemented naturally by a shared passion for the nation's best selling cola drink, is paramount.<br/><br/>Then there are films based on true events like ""Remember the Titans"" and the now showing ""Friday Night Lights."" ""Remember the Titans,"" a good flick, focuses on the experience of a black coach taking over a team in a southern town still gripped by an epoch of legalized racial discrimination. The coach comes out a winner: he's high school football's version of ""They Call Me Mr. Tibbs.""<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" faithfully follows the book of the same name by H. G. Bissinger, a bestseller and a very good read. Bissinger spent a year tracking the Odessa, Texas Permian High School Panthers, a team that had done very well in previous years. Not a typical sports book, Bissinger acted more as an investigative reporter looking at a microcosm of the role of high school football in American community life. He accurately portrayed Odessa for what it is: a city perennially on the cusp of economic disaster, riven by racial antagonism and with an obsessive interest, make that a fanatical devotion, to securing brief moments of communal glory through the blood (often literally) and guts of teens whose success in life may well reach, then and now, its apex in the stadium.<br/><br/>Bissinger's book might have been a national bestseller but his appearances at Odessa bookstores were canceled because of apparently serious threats to his life. So maybe the locals didn't care for the book.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton is superb, convincing and committed as Coach Gary Gaines who in 1998 tried to take his Panthers to the state finals to become the champs, ""to win State."" His Gaines is alternately brooding and encouraging, supportive and snarling as he puts his kids through a training regimen far longer than what Marine recruits go through and only marginally less taxing.<br/><br/>Gaines's team lives in a surreal world where at every twist and turn locals from trailer trash to state troopers to politicos accost them and wish them well while making it clear they they HAVE ""to win State."" Gaines can't go to Wal-Mart without being stopped by people with power who make it clear that the coach's livelihood depends on winning. Parents and relatives drive their teens to win, no matter what, partly because a championship may bring a winning scholarship and release from the uncertainty of an Odessa future.<br/><br/>Girls casually sleep with these ""heroes"" who must cope with expectations they can't be sure of meeting. All the young actors [see the IMDb.com main page for this film for their names] reflect confusion alternating with confidence. But the mania of the Odessa community is both gripping and appalling. Seventeen-year-old football players are interviewed by the news media and peppered with questions at the level of grim seriousness generally associated with reporters challenging public figures.<br/><br/>Director Peter Berg kept ""Friday Night Lights"" from eliding into a boringly typical sports film by devoting much time to the individual lives, some very unhappy, of the team members. Special kudos go to veteran cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler whose tight, quick, focused shots of Gaines and his players generate a continuing tension. In the critical half-time locker room scene which could have been a familiar stereotype, Berg goes rapidly back and forth between the Panthers and their rivals, the Carters. The effect is to emblazon the universality of the football experience for all the players. Gaines's pep talk is saved from conventional triteness by Thornton's deep immersion in his role.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" avoids racial divisiveness in Odessa - the book deals with that quite well. Here the Panthers, an integrated team, seem to have no race-based tensions. The Carters, their final rivals, is an all-black team and there's brief allusion to the reality of the permeation of bigotry in Texas high school sports but it's really irrelevant to the main story.<br/><br/>Recently, Billy Bob Thornton appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart where he related the experiences of his sports coach father. Thornton opined that the extreme community interest in high school sports and in winning as the only acceptable outcome is a reality he knew about first-hand. <br/><br/>Gaines is a sympathetic figure as he tries to guide his players but Thornton also invests the character with an apparent, uncomfortable and unacknowledged recognition that he also colludes with the community ethos that sadly makes high school sports the apex of the team members' lives. It shouldn't be that way. Perhaps we need a ""No Football Player Left Behind"" spirit if not a law.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Rack-Focus","6","3","7","10 October 2004"," Varsity Blues for Adults
","SUMMARY: Friday Night Lights (FNL) plays like a Varsity Blues (1999) remake from the adult viewpoint. Unfortunately, showing high school football through the eyes of coaches, parents, and townies is less interesting than showing it through the eyes of teens.<br/><br/>Plot line: Both FNL and VB share similar stories. Both are set in depressed Texas towns (Odessa, in FNL's case) that live for high school football. Hopes are high as both movies begin. Each team has a potential NFL pro, but a key injury forces the team to step up.<br/><br/>The casts are similar. Billy Bob Thornton is the domineering coach, though with considerably more compassion than Jon Voight. Lucas Black has the James Van Der Beek role of the quarterback whose heart may lie elsewhere. Ryanne Duzich is the popular girl, who like Ali Larter, wants to hook up with someone who will take away.<br/><br/>WEAKNESSES: The film has two major weaknesses. First, the players' are underdeveloped. Their main role in is to react to adults and so they almost always appear with their game faces on. As a result, it's hard to root for them. Do they really want to be champions? Or are they just playing because it's their job?<br/><br/>The film's other weakness is that it limited by a reality. Since no one would write about a losing team, we assume the Permian Panthers will play for a championship, so there is little suspense until the end. The film also tries to present too many points of view  coach, players, former players, rich townies, poor townies, etc. This dilutes the emotional impact of each tale. Some stories only get a quick scene or two.<br/><br/>STRENGTHS: That said, the film does have strong points. The football action is true to life and hard hitting. The main adult characters, including Billy Bob Thornton and Tim McGraw, are excellent and Derek Luke is the one player remembering. He delivers an outstanding emotionally charged performance, and his shirtless NFL-type body is truly a sight to behold."
"djdavig","Null","4","11","15 November 2004"," Best High School Sports Movie Ever Made
","I've seen just about every sports movie ever made in America and FNL was better than any other high school movie, by far. I'm sure it is not as good as the book (they never are), but after seeing it three times, its power grew on me each and every time. Some of the scenes were as powerful as any I have ever seen in ANY movie and the acting was outstanding across the board. <br/><br/>I could not help but break down while watching one of the young men come to grips with losing everything he had ever worked for or dreamed about in his life, only to become one of the main inspirations for his team's achievements, through all of the adversity they had faced together. It also serves as a stark reminder to all young athletes of the value of an education when the big dreams don't come through. <br/><br/>Most inspirational of all to me was the relationship between Coach Gaines (Thornton) and one of his troubled team leaders. In two conversations with the introverted young man, both off school grounds, the coach not only helped him to see his own personal problem clearly... ""My mind's not right"", but then gave him the solution to it that was well within the players grasp....""If you can get by that one thing, you're going to seriously fly son!"" and ""Ain't no curses"". Coaching and mentoring doesn't get better than that and it should serve as a great example to coaches and mentors everywhere.<br/><br/>Lastly, I didn't realize it until the third time I saw it, that the movie chronicled a huge change in the coach's philosophy as well. He started out just as gung ho as the local townfolk, as the fired-up new coach, and did not realize what their ""win at all costs"" attitude was doing to him, his family, and to his players. He decided during the conversation with the sheriff/main booster that they all needed to change the way they defined success and achievement. The look on the sheriff's face when he called his bluff was priceless. Then he led them through it by example. The motivational half-time speech given by him was one that so affected me in my current life that I'm sure I will never forget it and will pass it on whenever I can....""Be perfect.....in your heart!"". You couldn't take a teenager or young adult to a better movie. They should give it away to every school."

","Normally I'm quite fond of sports films. I actually have a real soft spot for them, so I tend to forgive them for any weaknesses and inconsistencies, more so than any other type of movie. ""Friday Night Lights"" however just didn't do anything for me at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps I missed something but what exactly was supposed to make this movie its story such an interesting one? Seriously, I just didn't see anything special about any of the characters or anything that made this story an unique one, from a sports perspective. Stories like this happen every year, in every branch of sport, on every level, everywhere in the world.<br/><br/>So sports-wise this movie isn't a very interesting one to watch but also its characters and the rest of the story, revolving around them, just isn't that very interesting or original. I never got the feeling I got to know any of the characters, since they were really lacking some good depth, no matter how good the actors all are. It also made me not really care for any of them, or what was going to happen next in the story. But it's a sports movie, so the story is of course sort of predictable anyway to begin with.<br/><br/>I still think director Peter Berg did a good job with the material he had at hands. I liked the whole visual approach and style of film-making for this movie. It had a fast pace, with lots of quick cuts and hand-held camera-work. The whole style still kept me watching and also made this movie a still mostly watchable one, though it just isn't anything special at all.<br/><br/>It's a typical American movie, so perhaps this movie is better to watch if you're actually an American and especially when you're into American football as well of course. I just didn't do anything for me at all, though I can actually enjoy and appreciate American football on television. I just rather watch a real match than this movie, ever again.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"MySportsComplex","5","2","4","4 March 2011"," Melrose Place on a Football Field
","When asked about this film by another sports fan, I couldn't help but and say that, to me Friday Night Lights is little more than Melrose Place of a football field. Or maybe the better put, the last time this film came out, it was called Varsity Blues.<br/><br/>Go figure, Billy Bob Thornton is a Texas high school football at Permian High; a school with a huge stadium and a bigger tradition for football. Permian's coach who, like every high school football coach in every film about football, has as his task coaching the underdogs to the state championship. The herd of football boys practice, play, win, and win more, then get interviewed by local media and generally get put on a pedestal as the sole means of inspiration for a small Texas town.<br/><br/>In chatting about this film, a friend of mine put it this way: ""I never knew how big high school football is in Texas"". That may be true, but football is big everywhere in the United States, so who cares? Why does Texas get special recognition for loving football, I wonder.<br/><br/>Carrying the film's predictability further, the successful season for coach and the boys leads them to play the top team in the state. Egos inflame and partying leads to some unruly behavior amidst the backdrop of social disparity and minor racial tensions.<br/><br/>More predictable --given today's trash TV and the need to do what you can to keep people watching-- is the amount of open sexuality and hook ups availed to these high school football players. After all, according to this film, high school football players claim instant celebrity status and have the physique of 26 year old men. Of course, only in a special place like Texas.<br/><br/>Sure there's a place in popular American film for a movie like Friday Night Lights, and an appetite among moviegoers. And the trashy, kitchy veneer is a standard part of the sales kit. Much of this appetite comes from America's love of film and sport both, and especially when movies and football are combined. However, the makers of the film seem to think that slick southern accents and ""go get 'em"" speeches stapled to pretty boys strutting around like NFL pros is something that is supposed to lift us up for life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while the thrill of the football play is there in the film --for die hard football fans-- the whole of Friday Night Lights is a canned, predictable stock movie we've seen a hundred times before.<br/><br/>written by Andy Frye, MySportsComplex.blogspot.com"

","This shows an excellent story of the high school lives of small town Texas kids and the love of football they all share together. The kids ban together to win a state football championship. They grew up together and live their hopes and dreams through playing football. Most cannot get out of the small town with academics and look to football as an escape method. They continually work and struggle with one common goal in mind. Billy Bob Thorton gives a great performance as the head coach and shows how most students use their coach as another parent to mentor them through the tough times of growing up. This film takes you on a journey through mental and physical toughness and prepares you for a chance to take an adventure into the world of sports and relive your childhood through the eyes of the ambitious high school athletes in America."
"Buddy-51","6","2","4","19 October 2005"," Friday Night Lite - but enjoyable anyway
","The best thing about ""Friday Night Lights"" is how it exposes the small town obsession with high school football. In Odessa, Texas, where the story is set, businesses shut down and radio sports commentators opine with the pretentious air of political pundits when the Permian Panthers take to the field. Now this is some serious football country, as the mood of the town fluctuates with the win/loss record of the team and family dynamics follow along with the ebb and flow of the season. It may be that somebody down there in Odessa just seriously needs to get a life.<br/><br/>Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, the film recounts the 1988 season when Coach Gary Gaines, despite the loss of his best player, still managed to carry his team to the state championships.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the storyline and characters in the film are not always as interesting as the setting and milieu. The drama is occasionally lacking and many of the characters rank as little more than hoary sports movie clichés: the supportive coach's wife; the abusive, alcoholic father trying to relive his high school glory days through his son; the cocky star player humbled by the exigencies of a cruel fate. Yet, the film has assets that help it to overcome some of the weaknesses of the script. Billy Bob Thornton plays Gaines as a thoughtful, even-tempered individual who knows what it takes to win but understands that life does not begin and end on the football field. His inspirational locker room speech towards the close is restrained, pointed and well delivered. In fact, the coach seems far less obsessed with winning than many of the ordinary folks he runs into - and has to take unsolicited advice from - on a daily basis. It is that pressure to win at all costs - placed not only on the boys but on the coach as well - that the movie dramatizes so effectively. The film also makes it clear that, for many of these boys, football is the only ticket they will ever have out of small town America.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" isn't nearly as compelling and involving as ""Remember the Titans,"" but die-hard football fans won't be complaining.<br/><br/>POSTSCRIPT (2014). Little did I imagine at the time I wrote this review that ""Friday Night Lights"" would one day become my favorite TV series of all time."

"Coffee_in_the_Clink","7","0","0","11 April 2020"," Rousing drama; hard-hitting but nothing exceptional
","The strongest thing that ""Friday Night Lights"" has going for it is the excellent sense of place and time that is created. The dust-caked and sun-scorched world of Odessa, Texas, is brilliantly portrayed. Director Peter Berg does a commendable job in creating this, and also takes considerable care and consideration to the subject matter, making this a very rousing drama that evokes a pivotal time in these young men's lives. There is not a whole lot that could have been done with the story to make it any more than just another sports film concerning the trials and tribulations of the underdogs, in this instance the Permian High School football team in 1988, attempting to go all the way and win State, with the heavy pressure of the football-obsessed town weighing down on them. The performances, for the most part, are adequate, with Billy Bob Thornton taking the lead as the team's coach. Thornton included, some of the cast just looked unsure of themselves in this. Particularly in the emotional scenes and team-talks, which came out a little over-wrought at times. Apart from that, the football scenes are very well done. The hits are hard and the camera-work revels in the blood, sweat and tears."

","4/4/18. If you like football movies, then you will probably like this one. It's based on a true story about a Texas high school football team during the year BEFORE they went on to win the state championship. It follows 5 senior players as they try to play their best to win for the coach. However, my favorite football movie is Varsity Blues, which came out 5 years before this movie. While VB was fiction, it pretty much depicted the same kind of issues that were depicted here. And, because it was fiction you do get the chance to cheer for the underdogs who had the worst coach ever (Voight) on the silver screen. Watch VB and I am sure you will agree that VB is much more inspirational and spot on in depicting the southern football culture in which men view football as their masculinity at play."

","I was so impressed by the intensity and passion of LONE SURVIVOR that I immediately went out of my way to find a copy of Peter Berg's earlier film, Friday NIGHT LIGHTS. Naturally I expected a good film, but I was figuring basically this would just be another REMEMBER THE TITANS -- a family-friendly film about young men learning sportsmanship and life lessons while playing a rough but basically harmless game.<br/><br/>I was totally wrong about what I saw. It turned out to be intense, gut-wrenching adult drama, with darkness and small-town cruelty and despair so intense that it rivaled THE LAST PICTURE SHOW or even a surrealistic nightmare picture like BLUE VELVET.<br/><br/>Most good movies, even classics like LONE SURVIVOR, tend to start slow and spend fifteen or twenty minutes introducing the characters before the action begins. The thing that makes Friday NIGHT LIGHTS so exhilarating and terrifying is that you plunge right into the season along with the athletes. There's no time to figure out who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, what dangers are lurking up ahead. The pace never flags, and you feel blindsided every time something horrible or freakish happens to one of these young men, on or off the field. There are none of the scenes movies usually use to ""explain"" the coach or the adults in town. You just have to figure it out as you go along.<br/><br/>The football in this movie is more powerful and realistic than I have ever seen in any other film. There's no way to predict who the heroes will be, or which player will suddenly find himself thrust into the limelight. And the same with devastating injuries, failures, and humiliation. There simply is no let up, all season long. Moreover, not one of the young actors seems to be ""acting."" They all behave as if they're here to play football, not to emote for the camera.<br/><br/>Now, I give this movie ten stars. Peter Berg is a genius at the mechanics of film making and then some. But I was aware of some disturbing elements or at least some themes that might be misinterpreted. Other critics mention the large number of sports clichés, but for me the issue was a matter of persistent (if possibly unconscious) stereotyping of the black and white athletes. With some notable and important exceptions, the following trends seemed to prevail: Black athletes are stereotyped as having incredible physical speed and strength, yet they tend to be self-centered childish, boastful, and unable to grasp concepts like self-discipline and hard work. They don't study the game, don't work at learning, and don't practice to improve. When they meet setbacks, they collapse.<br/><br/>White athletes are stereotyped as being smaller and slower, yet gifted with phenomenal strength of character and humility. They never give in no matter how many hits they take, on or off the field. They play on pure heart, and as a matter of principle are always willing to push themselves that much harder precisely because they lack the massive strength and speed of the ""other"" guys.<br/><br/>You'll also notice that the white athletes are always being portrayed as fighting for some noble, abstract goal -- respect from the town, love from a distant father, recognition for moral worth. The black athletes just seem to run and jump for the fun of it, or because they're just born that way, or because having money and being famous is all they know of being valued or important.<br/><br/>I don't believe for one moment that any of this was intentional, but there is a sense that these attitudes were present if not prevalent in the minds of the filmmakers as they made Friday NIGHT LIGHTS. Ultimately, however, in the final game, the true message comes across, and it is one of brotherhood and moral growth shared by all."

","It's tough to compete against movies in a similar genre (Rudy, Varsity Blues, Remember the Titans, Any Given Sunday, etc), however I strongly believe that this movie is set apart from some of it's predecessors.<br/><br/>In a time where cities and towns alike view high school football as a religion, the story revolves mainly on 5 football players and their coach. Peter Berg depicts the story, based on the book by H.G Bissinger, of the high school football 1988 season of the Odessa, Texas Panthers. The underlying focus is undeniable: a constant pressure from an entire town to be the best at any cost; whatever it takes. But at what price? Berg paints his beautifully cinematic vision of the triumphs, downfalls and a memorable ending that has you cheering for the Permian Panthers and swaying in empathy to the pulsing guitar riffs of Explosions in the Sky.<br/><br/>To my surprise it had every level of greatness: from a stellar break out cast- marking the beginning of Tim McGraw's and Garrett Hedlund's acting career. To a very favorable and impassioned speech by ""Preacher"" (Lee Jordan). Preacher, whose quiet demeanor is set ablaze in an effort to push his teammates onward. An excellent sound track (courtesy of Explosions in the Sky) that gives every scene an emotion, further than one could expect, where the you can see McGraw's character flourish as he strives with his inner demons to find a balance between teaching his son ""how to be a man"" but realizing he found his own way through the season. Most importantly it has a very compelling story line; it's not your ""typical -happy-ending-for-the-team"" movie. And that is indeed why I love it so much - you feel for the character's lives and how much they are affected by their decisions, each gaining something or suffering a loss.<br/><br/>Lastly my two cents: every coach should take note; even though they attempt to sweep it under the rug, do not revolve every play after one player. The outcome may not be worth it.<br/><br/>As someone who isn't too fond of football, but plays rugby- I can truthfully admit from the first time I saw this movie, I was hooked. For a sports movie, it has everything I look for in a great film.<br/><br/>In short: a film to be crowned a classic sports movie."

The movie is based on a super popular book and chronicles the entire 1988 season of the Permian High Panthers.<br/><br/>Its been filmed almost documentary style, so that at times the camera work is shaky (always hard hitting) and you really get to know all the characters involved on and off the field (players, coaches, mothers, fathers, pastors, boosters, fans and families struggling with ongoing personal conflicts.) These boys all want to escape their small town and the pressure placed on them from family and the townsfolk is enormous, with the general theme being that this fight for the state championship will be the most important thing they ever do with their lives.<br/><br/>There are some great performances here, Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines is kinda mind-blowing, he is just so good. I mean all he really does is spout off football-isms but wow, he also conveys so much more. And Tim McGraw was a huge surprise here as an abusive alcoholic, reliving his glory days father to one of the players (complete A-hole). Lucas Black also impressed as did the storyline following Boobie and his Uncle, just heartbreaking. Up there as one of the best sports movies I've seen. 11/5/14"

","Being french (did I hear French? where is the guillotine?) I watched this movie as I am a great fan of both Peter Berg and Billy Bob Thornton (especially as a coach in a comedy or a drama). I am a stranger to American football as it is not on TV in Europe in spite of a few attempts.<br/><br/>For a foreigner, it is such a great experience to watch this movie as it shows a few things that are so different to our world in ol' Europe and how sport, its history and how it is integrated into culture in some countries such as England or the US. <br/><br/>It is interesting also in a sense that it shows that in poor areas of the US, the American dream is only possible through getting in a college and may be in a sport team and one is at the mercy of a potential debilitating injury. <br/><br/>The pressure of ""old hands"" players who know best on the coach, the people outside of the game who also think they know is marvellous. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you do not know anything about American culture and its sport, it is probably one of the best movie to watch."

","Based on H.G. Bissinger's book, which profiled the economically depressed town of Odessa, Texas and their heroic high school football team, The Permian High Panthers. I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. Football fans will like it. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times. These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc. are not very focused on at all here.

So there's this small town with nothing going on and football is their only salvation so they take it seriously. They down right obsess over it. All the adults live vicariously through the high school football players and the players do their best to deal with the immense pressure and stress placed on them to win championships.<br/><br/>Thornton did an amazing job but Lucas Black was the star of the show. His performance was powerful and impressive. He displayed so much intensity and conviction that I was with him every step of the way. As a matter of fact all of the main characters did an amazing job.

","As an ex-player and deep fan of the book, I can truly say that Friday Night Lights captured the emotions of the players and the fans from the ""small"" town of Odessa. It evokes sentiment during every second and, just like in the book, makes the viewer an instant die-hard fan, a member of Odessa's community of Permian supporters. <br/><br/>The actors chosen for their respective roles played their parts brilliantly. Hats off especially to Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Derek Luke, and Garrett Hedlund for their performances. Everyone was totally bonded with their character and did not let go. <br/><br/>While the makers did a terrific job in selecting the cast and writing each scene, there were some major issues that interfered with me delving completely into Permian High School, fall 1988. I do not want to sound like a movie sin counter, but I could not look over a lot of the following things.<br/><br/>To start off, there was no reason whatsoever for the changes made to the players. Absolutely none. It transformed the story way too much. Brian Chavez was put on defense and had his number changed to 4, an insult to his legacy, in my mind; Ivory Christian was shown to be weak at the beginning and was moved to defensive end as number 90; Boobie Miles had his number changed to 45. They also altered some scores and games that took place. And the list goes on and on. There is no purpose in me dragging on about all the revisions because they can quite simply be Googled. <br/><br/>Moving on, the in-your-face anachronism of 21st century cars was quite careless. People were dressed like it was early November for the September 29th game. The zipping about and shaking of the camera, while confusing but suitable for game scenes, was inappropriate for scenes in which a steady shot would easily permit the viewer to grasp what was going on. And last for the list of criticisms, the Rebels game deserved more on-screen time and should have shown the defense playing as well. It made it seem like the Panthers were being absolutely demolished when in fact it was a close game thanks to the defense. <br/><br/>I know a large portion of this was dedicated to complaints. But, the flaws stuck out like a sore thumb against the perfection that was the rest of the film. The fact that they only made me dock 2 points says a lot about the quality of the movie. It will pull you in and make you understand and feel what it really is like to be a part of a high school football team in a merciless town. Watched and written 04/13/2014."

","In my opinion, one of the most entertaining sports movies is Friday Night Lights. Many factors were taken into consideration when making my choice. The most important is obviously the plot as a whole. Others, such as rating, actors, and visual appeal, were also evaluated. <br/><br/>The rating of this film is PG-13, but is suited for all ages. Take out one scene with some sexual content and this movie is appropriate for the whole family. As with all sports movies, there are a few curse words, but that is somewhat necessary to show the raw emotion of a sport like football. <br/><br/>The actors make this film. Billy Bob Thornton plays the role perfectly of the Head Coach Gary Gaines. He also acted in Armageddon and Eagle Eye, but this is, by far, his best performance. To compliment Billy, they have Lucas Black. You might recognize him from Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, but that is sub-par compared to his showing in this film. He plays the quarterback and shows great leadership qualities. When Boobie gets hurt he must lead the team to the state title game. He begins as an average player, but puts the team on his back and becomes an extraordinary player.<br/><br/>The Visual Appeal of this movie is better than average for sports movies. Unlike the other popular football titles such as: We Are Marshall, Remember the Titans, and Varsity Blues; Friday Night Lights truly captures the spirit and emotion of football. The small town atmosphere of high school football is shown perfectly in this film. It shows the intense desire and need to win. You can actually feel the big hits and emotion while watching this film. <br/><br/>Lastly, the plot is outstanding. It takes you an emotional roller coaster throughout and makes you beg for more at the end of the movie. It captivates the adversity a team must go through when their star player gets injured. They must come together as a team instead of relying on one player. It shows the importance of winning in a small town and the everyday challenges football players face. If there was one complaint I had about this movie it would be the ending. To watch this team go through so many trials and tests and then blow it all at the end is a huge let down; however, this only adds to the authenticity and harsh reality of competitive sports. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie has it all. The film has great actors, plot, and visual appeal. It is definitely one I would recommend you purchase because you will want to watch it numerous times. It never gets old and makes a great movie everyone will enjoy, even if you aren't a sports fan. The emotion, drama, and team aspect will draw you in and leave you on the edge of your seat."

","Friday Night Lights is a 2004 film based on H.G.Bissinger's award winning book of the same name. The true story revolves around the 1988 high school football team Permian Panthers of the small football-crazy town of Odessa, Texas. After losing their star player, Boobie Miles, to a career-ending injury in the very first game of the season, all hope seems to be lost. The coach, Gary Gaines, together with a team full of 17 year olds, now have the responsibility to satisfy the hunger of the town by winning the State Championships.<br/><br/>Peter Berg's Friday Night Lights is not a film on American soccer. It is a film about the players, the coaches, and most importantly in this case, the obsession of the fans of a soccer team. When a 'loyal' fan talks to the coach about winning the State Championships, you can feel that the manner in which he almost demands results is life threatening. So much so, that even if light-heartedly, there are considerations of shifting houses in case of failure. This is a movie about a team which is overburdened by fan pressure, pressure from the press, and in some cases even from their families. When you see a father beat up his son because he has missed a pass, you know they mean business. Football is all that they've got. And the very manner in which the film is made, concentrating on the personal struggles of the entire team together, as well as on the players individually, and their very very influential coach, is worthy of praise.<br/><br/>With worthy performances from Billy Bob Thornton, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and Tim McGraw; a knockout background score which comfortably shifts from prayers to rock music; and, some magical camera work (Read: The State Finals at the Astrodome!), Friday Night Lights is a film worth watching. I'm a big fan of American Football movies, whether it is Denzel Washington's Remember The Titans or Adam Sandler's very funny The Longest Yard. None more than Friday Night Lights..<br/><br/>8/10."

","This is a great movie that is based on a true story. One of the main reasons I love this movie is because they lose in the end unlike all those other Hollywooded-up sports movies. The cast was done pretty well although they don't look anything like the real counterparts. Derek Luke is great as the cocky ""Boobie"" Miles. Ivory Christian is a great character and I like how he becomes vocal at the end when everybody needs it most<br/><br/>A Classic<br/><br/>Also: Isn't that the real James ""Boobie"" Miles at the Dallas-Carter game in the locker room right beside Derek Luke (Boobie Miles in the movie)?"

There's some family issues (ill mother, abusive father) but these are common to many movies and do not make a movie.<br/><br/>Any sense of interesting insight into the people's lives is lost due to the mundane plot content and the slo-mo, shaky cam style that is infecting Hollywood; it doesn't make things feel real, on the contrary it makes them feel over-directed.<br/><br/>Only the last few minutes of the movie work on any level, driving home the point that our great moments in life are fleeting.

","First of All...I read this book back in HS and it may be the best sports book ever written. I'll go ahead and start with what I liked about the movie. The cinematography is excellent. THe football scenes are excellent. THe acting is above average. Now, I know what the scores are on IMDb for this(7.2) AND Varsity Blues(5.something).... and I also realize that FNL is a far better film when it comes to production value... but I have to say... I was more entertained and honestly enjoyed Varsity Blues more than I did FNL. Even though I hear it all the time,....this was one of the first times that I said, ""the book was much better""..... How can that be?...Liking VB better? By piling in as much of the books' subplots as possible.... by not focusing on specific characters(which resulted in underdevelopment)... FNL left me with an uneasy, unsatisfied feeling as a movie-goer. Is it dramatic....yes... is it more realistic than VB...YEs...and it should be considering its' based on true events... Unlike the book, I thought the film failed miserably in showing the true obsession that IS Permian football.....as well leaving the viewer COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED with the characters. As for the coaches in both VB and FNL.... Jon Voigt's acting was masterful compared to Thornton.... One is made better than the other and that's obvious.... but one is more enjoyable than the other....at least for this viewer. This is the ""babel"" of sports movies... beautiful... great quality overall... but just left me with that blah feeling... In my opinion....7.2 is a ""quality"" sympathy vote. Stays true to the book but comes off as a jumbled mess. 54/100"

","Football films frighten me. I despised Any Given Sunday, and was bored to tears by Remember The Titans. I don't like football and never have. Despite some emotional performances and some great action sports scenes I found Friday Night Lights not much different.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of small town Odessa Texas who's passion lies in their football team The Permian High Panthers. The boys of the Panthers seem to have no other future other than Football, they live and breath it and they need to be successful in order to get out of the poverty stricken town. Coach Gary Gaines is determined to take his team to the State Championship by inspiring his team. He works hard at bringing his team together after the loss of their star player Boobie Miles. The film doesn't rely a lot on plot both rather just shows us a season in the lives of this team from this fanatical town.<br/><br/>If High School football was ever actually this fanatic, that's scary and sad. Everyone is over the top crazy insane about this team and football. There is some subplots very minor with different members of the team and just when you get into it, they cut back to the guys playing football. Peter Berg does a decent job directing the action and creates some really tense and brutal scenes with the actual plays but unless you're a football fan I really think this movie will bore you. I won't call it a bad movie because I don't like football. I thought it was just okay. 6/10"
"rickeyboy80","1","4","12","12 October 2004"," NOT AT ALL FACTUAL
","OK, this movie follows the book perfectly in that Odessa Permian players do have a big black P on the sides of their helmets and Odessa Permian is in West Texas, but other than that ... Actually, as someone who is very familiar with story behind ""The Rookie,"" another movie about a West Texas story, I know that Hollywood takes creative license with the facts. What Hollywood did with this movie was not creative license so much as flat out lying and in some cases slander and defamation. The book, Friday Night Lights, is a perfect story: Why mess with a perfect story? I've read the book numerous times and saw that team play 3 times, including the Dallas Carter game. I watched this so-called movie in absolute amazement of the number of the factual errors. I understand there is going to be small changes and I can deal with the number and position changes of the key players, I can even tolerate silly facts such as players and band members wearing lettermen jackets and wool caps in the MIDDLE OF September ... for those unaware of that silliness, it's only 90 degrees in September. And since when does Permian play district games in September? I can tolerate the errors such as Permian playing Marshall at Ratliff Stadium (the game was in Marshall). I understand the need to change scores and certain game situations to make the movie be more exciting.<br/><br/>But to change critical facts is irresponsible and stupid.<br/><br/>Obviously, the people who wrote and produced this movie did not read the book, not even the prolouge. Then they would know that James ""Boobie"" Miles not only did not play in the Midland Lee game, but that he quit the team that next week. He NEVER returned to the team in any way shape or form, certainly not as some great inspiration before the Dallas Carter game. Speaking of, Miles was injured in a scrimmage against Amarillo High, not in the first game of the season. And to insinuate that Gary Gaines would have no clue of Miles' medical status, that he would simply take L.V.'s and Boobie's words for it, is insulting to Gaines, a respectable and renown coach in this state.<br/><br/>The Dallas Carter game in the movie was an abomination. Coach Freddie James is a well-respected coach in this state, too, and to paint him as a villain is ludicrous. If I was James, and they called him by name in the movie, I would seek legal action. ... Yes, Dallas Carter was brash and talked a lot of noise, but it was not gang-land school nor was it any dirtier of a team than Permian. The racial irresponsibility this movie showed -- the typical cliché of lilly white vs. dirty black -- is ridiculous. ... The score was wrong (14-9 was the actual final) and the way the game played out was wrong (Permian actually led 9-7 entering the fourth quarter) and Permian never got close to winning the game in the final minute.<br/><br/>Speaking of the playoffs, the three teams involved in the coin flip were MIDLAND HIGH, Midland Lee and Permian ... well, the movie got 2 right. Why is Abilene Cooper substituted for Midland High? Since when did Dallas Jesuit play Permian in the 1988 playoffs? Since when did San Angelo Central make the playoffs that year, and wouldn't it be damn hard for San Angelo Central to play Permian in the playoffs if THEY'RE FROM THE SAME DISTRICT AND CENTRAL WENT 2-8 that season? Did four teams from District 4-5A make the playoffs that year? For the record, in reality Permian played Amarillo Tascosa, El Paso Andress, Irving Nimitz, Arlington Lamar and Dallas Carter in the playoffs. The Panthers played Dallas Carter in the state semifinals in Austin, not in the state final in the Astrodome. Nevermind that Carter was stripped of state title for UIL violations and the title given to Converse Judson.<br/><br/>Another gross error that is inexcusable is that this movie portrays the relationship between Charlies and Donnie Billingsly as abusive. THAT WAS NOT WRITTEN ABOUT NOR DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF THAT BEING TRUE. In fact, Charlie Billingsly has sent emails to friends, family and others that that was NOT THE CASE. If I'm the Billingslys, Gaines, and especially James, I seek legal action against the producers and writers. They tried to ""8-Mile"" this movie and it was a fiasco. <br/><br/>Other errors: Brian Chavez wore 85 and was a defensive end, not safety; Ivory Christian wore 62 and was a linebacker; Boobie Miles wore 35; Chris Comer wore 45; where the hell was Jerrod McDougle, the fifth player featured in the book; since when did Permian practice at Ratliff Stadium; since when did Abilene High beat Permian that year (Permian lost to Marshall and Midland Lee in the regular season, both in one-point games).<br/><br/>I did not go to Permian, but I love high school football and really wanted this movie to be great. Sadly, it's a big stinking pile of lies and inaccuracies that most of the country won't ever know about unless they read the book.<br/><br/>In its defense, the movie is incredibly true about the characters of the players and the way football is treated in Odessa, but ...<br/><br/>One thing I wonder about: Why not just treat this movie like Hoosiers was treated. Take a real event (Milan's state title in the early 50s), create a movie with fictional characters (Jimmy Chitwood) based on the real players and create drama and scenes based on the real action. OR, treat this movie like Miracle. Take a real event (the Miracle on Ice hockey team), tell the story as accurate and perfectly as possible. Both of those are great movies. What Friday Night Lights did was a combination of both and came away with something only marginally better than Johnny Be Good. You made a mockery of a great book."
"KUAlum26","Null","2","5","27 February 2008"," Texas high school football,warts and all
","What impressed me from the get-go about this movie is the fact that it appears,on first glance,as a ordinary Football movie--a high school football movie in pigskin mad Texas,no less--but upon further examination,this is actually much more of a darker,much much less romanticized(or trivialized)treatment of the game and the people who play,coach and support(parents,family,or just community).<br/><br/>Permian High School,nicknamed Mojo,in economically-pressed(though it's never really examined in the film,the viewer only gets the general impression of it) Odessa,Texas, has a football program that has a rich and fairly long history of success,so winning is treated as something of a birthright to anybody living in the city limits and even beyond. All the young men who play it know it,the whole school knows it and the coaches know it,particularly the head coach,one Gary Gaines(Billy Bob Thornton,whose performance is smart and subtle),a stern,insecure and ego-driven man who feels the pressure to win head-on. His job is so tantamount to his livelihood that he's under perpetual threat of being fired for every loss his teams incur(one example: after a particularly damaging loss,""For Sale"" signs are posted in his front lawn as a Not-so-subtle reminder).<br/><br/>With American football teams normally fielding anywhere from thirty to upwards of fifty players,the story-lines have to be condensed to a handful of personas for focus. They are mostly exemplified in the stories of Mike Winchell(Lucas Black),the put-upon QB with a very sick mother who has hopes of playing collegiately;Boobie Miles(Derek Luke),a brash stud Running Back,who goes from being a lock for big-time college football and beyond to being a nearly hobbled and fully hobbled team supporter;and Don Billingsley(Garret Hedlund),the shy and perceivably under-performing son of a local playing legend(Tim McGraw,excellent!)whose drowning his sorrows in booze when he's not verbally or physically abusing his son. There are other stories,but the movie concentrates mostly on the ascent of the team through a rough but rewarding 1988 season,which culminates in a date with brash,physically daunting Dallas CArter high school.<br/><br/>Director Peter Berg seems to dig action and full-surrounding shots of his subjects,capturing every element of pain,grit,frustration,anger,sweat and elation(among other things). HAving not read the best-selling 1990 book by H.G. Bissinger,I have to assume that David Aaron Cohen's screenplay is culled from a chapter-by-chapter,blow-by-blow documentation that is somewhat detached but always true. My subject line comes from the fact that,unlike many sports movies,the coaches,the players and most everyone involved(even down to the broadcasters) are not treated as noble,inspiring or even cute archetypes but more as imperfect,flesh-and-blood people who make mistakes,have prejudices and feed their egos and insecurities. The objective of the movie seems to be not to these people into heroes or examples but rather make Texas football as real and formidable. I have yet to sit through an episode of the well-received NBC TV series based on the movie,but I feel like if it has even half of the grit and honesty as the film,it should be quite good,too."
"kory311-1","7","2","5","19 September 2005"," Pretty Good Movie, but inconsistent
","This was a pretty good movie, as sports movies go, but I had a few problems that most of you will think are minor, but they really got on my nerves throughout the movie. My problem with this movie was continuity. This movie was supposed to take place in 1988 (or 1987 I think) but who in 1988 was wearing Oakley brand shields on their face masks? What high school football team was wearing UnderArmour brand compression shirts under their jerseys, and brand new (circa 2003) Nike football shoes in 1988? I know most of you are going to say, ""who cares about this"", and I understand the marketing used for the movie, but if the movie takes place in 1988, make the equipment consistent with 1988. It was a good movie, seemed realistic to football in small town Texas where football rules (easy to see when the whole town closes down for home games). It was pretty consistent with the book save for a few differences. Good movie, but if you are picky (like me, I guess) you might have a few problems to pick out."

","This movie is all about football. Its based on a true story about a 1988 high school football team in Texas who is expected by the town to win states.Unlike Remember the Titans there is no other story. It doesn't have any extra plot elements like the racial differences. Also it was a little hard to follow - unlike in Remember the Titans where you see a little bit about each game in the normal season Friday Night Lights shows three games of the regular season. So you're supposed to assume that they played as well as other teams. I was very disappointed in this movie because it had been rated highly. It shows how much football means to the town. The story was very boring because there were no dynamic characters. You got to know the main characters a little bit. It didn't evoke any emotion from me whatsoever watching it. Its hard to relate to the characters because none of them have a personality. I would definitely NOT recommend this unless you only want to watch football."
"jhthorp","10","2","5","18 February 2005"," Just My Views On The Movie
","The movie Friday Night Lights is a very dramatically intense movie. It is very emotionally involved. A few people out there may see the movie as a mere disappointment, due to their previous readings of the books. This is what really ticks me off; I think anyone who bases the quality of a movie off a book is very one-sided. Nothing can be perfectly copied without being distorted or modified offset from the actual. These changes are in our everyday lives and are a part of everything. Nobody can duplicate text into a motion picture so perfect that it will even catch those whom have read the book. I'm sorry, but not even the Lord of The Rings series accurately portrayed the book, even though it was very close to doing so.<br/><br/>The biggest impact that this movie will create and display is the mere fact that High School football brings a ton of emotion to a small town. I can display this because I played with a team that was ""everyone for everything"". We spent the entire season working out together, playing together and becoming a team in unison. This is shown in Friday Night Lights by the scene when the entire team is together in the weight room growing stronger. The weakest link on the team at this time was their star running-back, who was no team player at all and decided that the team could ONLY win by relying on him and his ability to run and play well. We did not let diversity take any sort of a toll on us. The teams in the movie refused to allow change in the momentum or change in playing style affect them. They stuck it out and pulled themselves into the state championship without their best player. My team was as close as those in Friday Night Lights. My team ended up losing in the state semi-finals, after winning our first EVER district championship for the school's history and first EVER state quarter-finals for the school. We were a team, we were one. We lost the game in the last 30 seconds of the fourth quarter. The last loss was so harsh, that at least half of the team including me walked out of the locker room with tears pouring from our eyes. This happened in Friday Night Lights also. The team lost the game by a slim margin right at the end and was severely heart broken. This feeling was like having the life taken from us and then our hearts stop pumping. So to tie this back into the movie, High School football is very emotional. This movie is clearly an emotional piece of artwork. It covers enough of momentum changers during a football game to get the point across on how small towns can be affected by a sport.<br/><br/>When the star running back gets injured, the stadium goes silent. When the quarterback gets nailed, the stadium gets taken by surprise. When the team loses, it's like their pride has receded from them. Football players are just as emotional as everyone in the stands, but their emotions are amplified several times more. The only way to ever feel the emotions that football players on a very close-knit team feel is to experience it for your self. This movie is very powerful to anyone who has feelings. I believe that this movie is very well acted and portrayed, which once more there is people out there who believe the movie was poorly acted, written and portrayed. I just want to say that that's your opinion, keep it and express it to anyone else."

","Am I the only one who hated this movie? The characters were flat (though Garrett Hedlund was surprisingly effective) and if the movie is any indication of the actual story I will NEVER read it. Billy Bob Thornton absolutely sucks, there is no other way to say it. He wasn't a tragic hero, he wasn't a normal football coach, he was a whiny, watery eyed loser who couldn't convince me with his pseudo-football language. I was on the sidelines of every football game when I was in high school and honestly the only convincing part of the movie is the sidelines and the almost religion the players experience there. None of the character truly stood out (except the afore mentioned Hedlund) and movie is depressing.<br/><br/>I really looked forward to this movie. What a let down. It was so similar to Varsity Blues but not as enjoyable. I didn't feel for the players or the coach and no one else was likable or unlikeable. Dull, drab, flat. I wouldn't watch it again for money.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie the subtitle tells you that the coach led next years team to the state championship... why couldn't the movie be about that?"
"sixtwentysix","10","2","5","1 November 2004"," A mosaic of human flaws and perfection.
","This is a film that strives to be ""perfect"".<br/><br/>This is a mosaic of human vignettes and stories woven into a tale of a team in turn shown as a metaphor for life. OK, well actually, this drama was about a West Texas high school football team in the late 80's but something about it rings so true to so many walks of life you can't help but see deeper meaning in it's messages. It's about a striving, pressure, the lonely nature of responsibility, hardships, overcoming challenges in life, greater goals and the power found in life philosophy put to use.<br/><br/>Top flight acting is abound with the usual quality Thornton provides playing a subdued Coach Gary Gaines with a quite dignity, but the real standouts come in the form of Lucas Black and Derek Luke in their roles respectively as QB and HB. One with stoic fearful dignity and another with flawed talented swagger, you really start to make connection on many different levels with the characters. This film could be a star making role for either of these young men.<br/><br/>Obviously after seeing this movie I would say, the production values are very high with excellent editing, cinematography and writing. You can almost taste the dusty roads and feel the dirty town of Odessa under your fingernails when the film is over. A certain amount of sadness and dignity surrounds the players where pressure above all has drained any kind of enjoyment from the game. The town is the protagonist, drawing the life out of its high school team in a vampiric nature feeding on the Panthers paths to glory. It can be at times depressing. Odessa, is told in the film to be a place to escape or be forever trapped in the browning pages of ancient history, seeking that fall season fix of football dominance. The film keeps a tight storyline by focusing on only a few key players but does have an expansive feel, epic in nature.<br/><br/>The film does not capture the depth of the book, the race issues, the academic logistics and the overall mania of MOJO, however that would be impossible without making this into a television series or at least a much deeper storyline. Not without trying though, it does take its swipes and endeavors to stay close with the source material for most of the film. The film definitely however avoids most sports cliché, but it truly is impossible to have a prolific sports film without a bit of cliché' just due to the repetitive nature of sports in general and the vast number of sports films available. It has been noted that a large amount of artistic license was taken with the Billingsly family, score of the final game, relationships, glossing over the racist nature of the town, the Carter negotiations and game and changing the final play to give it more overall cinematic impact. Hey, I'm fine with that, that's why the opening scene says ""BASED on a true story"". You have to get people in the door to tell your story. FNL tells a beautiful one. The movie ends with a grace that is oddly satisfying without being Hollywood, something tough to find in a sports film.<br/><br/>This movie succeeds where so many other films like this have failed by giving you a human bond with the characters. While it sounds entirely cliché, this movie had some very deep and inspirational moments not just for football but for life in general, I recommend it to anyone, I would add however you would be better served by the book, but I'm being realistic here! A highly underrated film, this is a piece that could be watched by a family, sports fan but above all anyone that enjoys well crafted film. 10/10"

It is often a tense scary place. Mojo madness is something unlike anyone can imagine unless they have lived it. The cross-city rivals between Midland Lee and Odessa Permian are vicious (something the movie didn't hit on but tells a lot about the story also). The movie also left a lot of the book out. Having grown up with all of this in my life, the movie was a great way to look back and reflect. Teams really do overplay their players to injury. It is really that bloody and yeah Odessa is that ugly landscape wise (although it has grown considerably since 1988. The writers got very close to what the actual coaches looked like. They even got the right band uniforms. My husband's comment was ""I don't think there is anywhere else in the world that actually watches a coin toss for high school football on TV"" (this was one scene of the movie. I think unlike some football movies Friday Night Lights did not ""drama"" the sports like some movies do. You didn't see much of their personal life because they pretty much eat, sleep and breathe football. <br/><br/>Also -- I am not sure those who have not lived sports of this intensity can comprehend the scene where Gaines came back from the game they lost and had ""for sale"" signs in his front yard.

","Ever since Peter Bogdanovich, in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, provided a comic view of a small town's total involvement in the fortunes of a high school football team (remember the verbal abuse the locals heaped on Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms when they lost the 'big game'?), Hollywood has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to make the 'definitive' small town/football film.<br/><br/>Director Peter Berg has finally done it, with Friday NIGHT LIGHTS!<br/><br/>Based on H. G. Bissinger's best-selling tale of the 1988 season of the Odessa (Texas) High School 'Permian Panthers', the film unflinchingly paints a vivid canvas of a school and community obsessed with winning, as football provides the only release from poverty and desperation. While the concept is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's earlier ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, Berg doesn't glamorize the hero or tie things up, neatly, at the climax; in real life, while victories are savored, they are, at best, a temporary 'high'...while defeats can drive rational people into irrational frenzies. The Panthers' fortunes are such a crutch to Odessa's emotional well-being, that each game becomes a narcotic 'fix' for the entire community...a situation potentially dangerous for the players, and their coaches.<br/><br/>While Billy Bob Thornton has received the bulk of media attention, as the stern but fair head coach (with glowing reviews for BAD SANTA, and THE ALAMO, Thornton is having a career-defining year!), the film is really an ensemble work, with stand-out performances by Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and, surprisingly, singer Tim McGraw (as Hedlund's 'reliving past glories' father). The entire cast is exceptional, avoiding the easy pitfalls of simply playing stereotypes.<br/><br/>At times brutal and gritty, at times nearly surrealistic, Friday NIGHT LIGHTS refuses to fall into the clichés that marred REMEMBER THE TITANS, VARSITY BLUES and THE PROGRAM, eschewing the artsy but smug self-righteousness of Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN Sunday, as well.<br/><br/>This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town.<br/><br/>I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender.<br/><br/>Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!"

","Perfectly encapsulating not only the high stakes sport that is American college football but the trials, triumphs and all in between for those growing up in an environment that builds pressure upon shoulders not yet acclimatised to the highs and lows of adult life, Peter Berg's frenetic and heartfelt Friday Night Lights is a stunningly crafted example of the power of sporting themed movies and a career highpoint for many involved.<br/><br/>Based upon H.G. Bissinger's book which is itself centred around the real life Permian High Panthers football team that was the heart and soul of the small Texan town of Odessa in the late 1980's, Friday Night Lights is not merely built for an excuse to deliver action packed staging's of football matches but is built to allow heartfelt and important messages to play out around it, so much so that this moderately financially successful film spawned the well liked Emmy winning TV series of the same name.<br/><br/>Berg (who at the time was better known as a character actor in films like Cop Land and Smokin Aces) displays a natural talent as a story teller here, as well as a fine orchestrator of his young actors (who almost pass as 17/18 year olds) and as we're introduced to the Panthers team from Billy Bob Thornton's well-meaning and measured Coach Gaines, Lucas Black's conflicted quarter back Mike Winchell, Garret Hedlund's pressured Don Billingsley and Derek Luke's flashy star playmaker Boobie Miles, it's easy to be pulled into this world of eventual pettiness and goal driven attitudes that consumes all those that inhabit it.<br/><br/>These characters feel alive, cut from reality, the town they live in eats, drinks and thrives off them and their sport and Friday Night Lights showcases a realistic view of what the college football scene represents to those that follow it. There's the young men who have had their chance to build their life upon one successful year, those that have found success in the arena and now struggle to live out of it and those that merely find themselves driven by the idea of the team's success, an outlet if you like to allow them to forget their woes. It's in this broad spectrum of characters and snippets of Odessa life that we get that sets Friday Night Lights aside from other films of its ilk and become something more, something truly special.<br/><br/>Much more than a mere sports movie, Friday Night Lights is quintessential viewing for movie lovers even if sport is but a foreign occurrence to them. From Berg, the fantastic soundtrack by Explosions in the Sky through to Billy Bob Thornton and an impressive young (at the time) cast with standout turns from Black, Hedlund and Luke, Friday Night Lights saw the nigh on perfect culmination of material and participants come together to deliver one of, it not the best sport movies ever made.<br/><br/>5 coin tosses out of 5"

This line was said by the coach Gary Carter played by Billy Bob Thornton, who in my opinion did a great job portraying that tough football coach. This says so much about the movie itself because it's true these are high school boys who feel so much pressure every Friday night when they step onto that turf. Odessa, Texas loves their football and they expect so much from these young men. This film also shows the high price people are willing to pay in order to excel at all costs. For example, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) who in the home opener receives a hard hit that possibly could end his high school career. Boobie decides to continue playing even though the pain is too much, the next game he receives a low blow hit to the same spot that will end all the chances he had to play pro football.<br/><br/>Peter Berg the director of this pg-13 film was demonstrating how much one thing can mean to so many people and also how far people will go for the love of that one thing. He does a great job of capturing the primary message of the film across to its viewers. In the movie it's all about the love of the game, but in reality this applies to so many things in life. We strive to succeed and in doing so we sometimes fall but still we will go as far as we have too in order to reach our goal because it's something we love. These high school boys literally bled and broke bones to win a game it's the passion that's the reason we do things.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" is definitely one of my top ten favorite movies. It has good actors who all do a great job in portraying what they are supposed to. The dialogue was easy to follow and it's not like every other sports film there is something about this one that makes it different to the others. I'd give it 4 ½ stars out of 5."
"Shattered_Wake","8","1","2","3 January 2009"," Friday Night Lights - A very good modern sports film
","Nearly five years have passed since 'Friday Night Lights' was released and it still maintains its status as one of the best sports movies of the 2000s.<br/><br/>The story isn't anything new or original, but it is true. Not only of the Permian Panthers, but of many teams around the country, and I think that's where the greatness of this film lies. Anyone who has gone to high school where football was a 'big deal' (it was right up with breathing in my high school) can relate to this film.<br/><br/>The film is one that delivers real emotion and power without getting overly sappy. It uses the subject matter and the player emotions to deliver unto its viewers the feeling of triumph through the most difficult of situations.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a genuinely good film that will make you actually feel something without it being too forced, check out 'Friday Night Lights.' <br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10.<br/><br/>-AP3-"
"Jigsaw_At_The_Disco","10","1","2","26 October 2008"," Friday Night Lights -- A Couragous Touchdown
","Prepare yourself. Friday Night Lights is one of the most incredible sports movies to ever hit the movie screen.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thorton stars as the head coach for the Permian High Panthers, a football team that the town of Odessa, Texas depends their lives on. His performance will literally knock you out of your chair as he delivers line after line in a way you've never seen him deliver before. But it's hard to keep your attention on just him when you have actors alongside him who are just as great. The cast mentioned features Tim McGraw who gives us a monstrous performance as the abusive father of Don Billingsley who is played by Garrett Hedlund, a receiver. Then you have Derek Luke, the halfback for the team, and Lucas Black, the team's quarterback. I could list out the names of every actor and depict each of their incredible performances but I just don't have enough room to write.<br/><br/>Peter Burg directs the film with a style that seems to be hated by most film critics, however it's almost as if it's meant for this genre and Burg uses it in such a talented and superb way that it stands out from all the others who have tried to make it work before. Everything from the setting to the lighting is all part of the magic which is, Burg's fantastic directing.<br/><br/>The scriptwriting stands out like the color pink in a black & white film, with moving quotes and excellent speeches on every corner. Sports movies just can't work without a great script and Friday Night Lights delivers one of the best. I recommend this film to all coaches who need inspiration and to all football players that can relate to the characters being portrayed. On that note I recommend this to everyone who just needs to watch a great movie, even if you don't know what the hell football is.<br/><br/>In the end, Friday Night Lights isn't just a football movie and truly gets the point across better then any film ever will, the point being, it's not about winning, it's the fact that you tried your best that counts. <br/><br/>I'll end my review by saying, Friday Night Lights brings a whole new definition to five stars and is by far my new favorite movie.<br/><br/>*****/*****"
"artrip02","8","1","2","13 July 2008"," An obsession to win
","The film Friday Night Lights is more than just a great sports film it is also a great snapshot of life in America and our obsession with winning in sports. The film is based on the novel written by H.G Bissenger and it is based on the 1988 Permian Panther football team. The film follows the team from the opening day of practice to the state championship game in the fall.<br/><br/>At times you get the sense you are watching a documentary when viewing Friday Night Lights. Many scenes are shot where the camera takes an objective point of view. The audience simply observes the action as if looking in from a window almost as a voyeur would do. This adds a sense of sympathy to the players as you feel the pressure being laid upon them by parents,coaches, townsfolk etc. Indeed, everywhere the players go they are asked ""You gonna take state?"" Doesn't anyone care about grades in school or being a good person? In this film it does not seem so. The whole town is obsessed with winning state.<br/><br/>Several scenes from the film reinforce the obsession to winning. In almost every shot of people driving there is a sports talk radio show discussing the ups and downs of the Permian Panthers. This sports talk seems to hang over the town as a constant drone.<br/><br/>In another scene three football players are sitting at an outdoor fast-food restaurant, a guy of about thirty with his wife and baby approach the players and ask to get a picture of his daughter with the next ""state champion quarterback"". As the father walks away he flashes his own state championship ring and says ""get yourself one of these"", he also says that this period of life will pass you by quickly and from here on out it is just ""babies and memories"". You get the feeling that this mans best years of his life were when he played football and won in high school. This is a bleak and depressing thought.<br/><br/>Why I think this film is great is because it does not glamorize the town or the towns people. It is very realistic in it's depiction of the homes and lifestyles of the people of Odessa. It also is not your traditional Hollywood sports film, unlike films like Hoosiers, or The longest Yard this film does not have a typical happy, Hollywood ending. Without giving away too much I will say the ending left me very satisfied because it demonstrated maturity in the main characters. They grew as people in the end and some realized that winning isn't everything.<br/><br/>The head coach of the Permian Panthers is Coach Gary Gaines played by the very talented Billy Bob Thornton. I say very talented because of films like Slingblade and A Simple Plan, not ""Mr. Woodcock"". In Friday Night Lights he plays a coach that has a desire to win but seems sort of like an outsider to the regulars of the town. In one scene after losing a game he arrives home to find numerous ""for sale"" signs in his yard. Again the point is very clear win or move on out of Odessa.<br/><br/>Friday Night Lights has a great soundtrack with ""old school"" rap songs from the 1980's. Many of the football sequences are some of the best I have seen on film. The scene when the Panthers walk out onto the field of the Houston Astrodome for the state championship gets even me pumped up and ready to don a helmet and try to ""take state"".<br/><br/>I realize that Friday Night Lights will never when an Oscar but the performances are solid, the story intriguing, and the action is fast paced. I truly laughed and cried (a little). Therefore I give it 3.5 state rings (out of four)."
"blitzhard56","8","1","2","22 July 2007"," About more than just football
","This movie is not so much about football as it is a small, economically depressed town in west Texas and its relationship with a high school football team. <br/><br/>In short, the team is all the town has. It's all that they know. Local stores close shop to attend the games, the kids walk around emulating the players and wearing their jerseys, and talk radio revolves around high school football. Life is good when the team wins, and not so good when it loses. Every facet of the town is effected by it.<br/><br/>Being a football fan, though, in order for a 'football movie' to be truly great it must at least make sense when it comes to the technical stuff. And this movie sure does. The terminology, the equipment, the coaches, the fans -- all of it looks and feels real. <br/><br/>As far as the acting, Billy Bob Thornton turned in a solid performance as Coach Gaines. To me, though, the scene stealer was Tim McGraw. It was amazing to see his relationship with his son come full circle the way it did. <br/><br/>Finally, what pushes this movie into category of one of the finest sports movies of all time is its score. Great ambient music by 'Explosions in the Sky' perfectly captured the bittersweet euphoria and pain of the story. <br/><br/>Highly recommended and not just solely for football fans."
"paulmamak","7","1","2","22 June 2007"," A journey taken where you discover the true meaning of ""Football""
","This film emphasises what it takes to win and the characters that were portrayed in this film highlights what sacrifices and obstacles must be undertaken to obtain success. This film therefore takes the subject of Football to a completely new level by not only playing it for the love of the game, but using it to obtain future success and respect.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton's role as the coach was truly one of his best acting performances seen to date. This is seen when he delivered motivating and rigorous tactics as well as inflicting moods of anger and frustration. In scenes such as at the side line during games and the speeches he gave in the locker room. He also used his character to inflict sympathy, such as when he became involved with Mike Winchell (Quarter Back) when Mike was having regrets due to the relationship he had with his mother. As well as with Boobie Miles and his uncle after his accident. He also gains sympathy for his character as it is shown the pressure that he is under in order to bring the boys to triumph. As you learn from his family that he has coached more than one team throughout his career, which has caused him as his family to locate to areas all over America. <br/><br/>Lucas Black's character (Mike Winchell) was not like the usual stereotypical Quarter Back jock, but he brought to this role a serious role, who lived for football, but was also troubled about what obtaining success would do between the relationship between him and his mother. As the film progresses you see how his gift for football becomes more of a reality, by the way he leads the team formations as well as throwing some amazing passes to enable a successful game to be played to their advantage.<br/><br/>Garrett Hedlund's role (Don Billingsly) depicted mainly the honour that was acquired between his successful ex-football father (Tim McGraw). Throughout the film you feel the tension between the two as Garrett's father embarrasses Garrett in front of the other football players and one of the girls he is with. Garrett proves himself to his father in the final though by continuing to play even with an injured shoulder. Don Billingsly truly emphasised the hatred and frustration obtained between cold hearted fathers and has proved his great quality as an actor.<br/><br/>Derek Luke (Boobie Miles) deserves the most credit in this film by providing a moving performance as the star player that has to give up what he lives for ""football"", due to injuring himself on the field. At the start of the film you see that he is the person that will bring the team to victory, he therefore put a lot of cockiness into his character, full of wit and energy (even a one point imitating Bill Cosby), as well as giving his character a sense of being invincible. When being told that he no longer play football you see this character going from his immortal self to the sensitive character that he truly is, in one of the most powerful scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Despite the characters, the film was well directed showing some of the most gruelling scenes that can be experienced on the football field to scenes where little dialogue was read."
"ReelCheese","6","1","2","29 December 2006"," Style Over Substance
","""Friday Night Lights"" is perhaps the flashiest sports film ever made. With its rapid-fire cutting and artsy angles, it at times borders on visual genius. The performances are equally lively, with Billy Bob Thornton shining as the small town high school football coach who shifts seamlessly from patting backs to shouting at faces. His roster, meanwhile, is sprinkled with young talents like Derek Luke as Boobie Miles, the spoiled next big thing, and Lucas Black as Mike Winchell, the introverted team leader.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, other aspects of ""Friday Night Lights"" hover around the average mark. The story offers little in the way of originality, except for perhaps the ending (if you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it for you). It's basically your typical high-school-sports-team-carrying-great-expectations tale. Director Peter Berg tries covering as many worthwhile human angles as he can. A star player must deal with the end of his career. The coach is shunned by fans taking the game way too seriously. Young men must balance the confusion of early adulthood with the stress of being sports icons. Again, it's nothing we haven't seen before (""Hoosiers"" and ""The Program"" come to mind).<br/><br/>Although it's based on the true story of Texas's Permian High Panthers, ""Friday Night Lights"" has a decidedly Hollywoodish feel. Perhaps out of necessity -- cramming an entire book into two hours is a gargantuan task -- the characters seem too oversimplified to be real. The Panthers are a diverse bunch, but they're also clichéd: he's the troubled one, he's the one who has trouble with girls, he's the one from a broken home. And while Berg's directorial style is electric, it hampers his ability to capture a small town feel so crucial to the film succeeding.<br/><br/>Those behind ""Friday Night Lights"" deserve an ""A"" for effort, something you certainly can't say about every film. But what it delivers in style it generally lacks in substance."
"ronald-hall1","6","1","2","28 January 2006"," Good But Not Up To The Book:
","Friday Night Lights was disappointing when compared to the book, despite a very good performance from its star, Billy ""Bob"" Thornton. The movie highlighted the games to provide action for the flick while the book was more interested in the community life and its affect on these high school boys. While certainly worth your time to watch, it did not capture the authors intense feelings for the pressure cooker the young athletes had to live in. The movie failed to magnify the huge amount of coddling and pampering the town and school gave to these young men. The novels author continually pointed out that this football team was the highlight of most the young men's entire life. The production was a little uneven and was probably hard to follow by anyone who had not read the book. Pick up the movie and preview it yourself and and watch intently for the little messages the film gives but fails to highlight.<br/><br/>Ron Hall Lake Butler, Florida"

","There has not been one sports movie that I can remember which hasn't been as moving and exciting at the same time as this movie was.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by H.G. Bissinger and directed by his cousin, Peter Berg, ""Friday Night Lights"" takes place in 1988 Odessa, Texas, where a high school football team called the Permian Panthers are pressured by the townspeople (and their own beliefs) to win the 1988 Texas State Championship.<br/><br/>The movie gives you the sense that sports (in this case, football), to some people, is a religion and that nothing else matters to them. It almost seems like an obsession to these people!<br/><br/>In any case, the performances were great, it had a fast pace, and it was very careful not to get corny and manipulative. Billy Bob Thornton is great as Coach Gary Gaines, Lucas Black (Thornton's ""Sling Blade"" co-star) is terrific as quarterback Mike Winchell, and country singer Tim McGraw is Charlie Billingsley, whose son is on the team. McGraw gives an impressive, terrific performance.<br/><br/>This film and the novel from which it is based are based on the true story."
"JoshtheGiant","5","1","2","17 November 2005"," Ruined By Camera
","Friday Night Lights looked like it was going to be a great football film, but it falls apart for several reasons which I'm about to explain. The story is genius, its a great true story and deserved a better script. The script is not altogether bad, it has good dialogue and some of the players are fairly well put together, as is one of the fathers, they are good characters but the screenplay fails to develop its lead played by Billy Bob Thornton at all, we really know nothing about this guy, and we never really do, plus we really want to. The acting is generally really good, Billy Bob Thornton gives a great performance but he still can't get over the lack of a character. The direction is what really ruins the movie, its simply mediocre, but its biggest problem is the choice to film it with a bouncy hand-held camera that flashes around so you can barely see anything. The visuals are fair, but not great. Because of the camera the film may not be worth watching."
"Traced66","10","1","2","12 November 2005"," Awesome Movie!
","This is a great movie! A movie not only about the ""sport"" football, but the pressure of living up to the expectations that are placed upon the player. I personally bought this movie because it engulfed the very essence of my small town and the extreme attitude towards football. This movie was from what I hear, well researched and a true story. Each player has a love for the game, but also has added pressures placed upon them by various people. The team is out of Texas, which is a serious football state anyway, and the town rallies around the team and lives for ""Friday Nights"". When the team loses, the town turns soar on the coach, who is played by Billy Bob Thorton, who is AWESOME! He plays this football coach who truly cares for his players, and without saying realizes the pressure these young high school kids are under. He is torn between the town's ""gotta win"" mentality, and his own view of ""let's just give it our all, and have fun playing football"". Of course he would never say the latter comment because his job is on the line. Thorton is the best actor to date. He is able to become the character, I mean truly transform into someone else. The QB is great in this film. I can not recall his full name at this time, but in the movie he is known as Michael Wintchum. He is a nervous kid, who is trying to get a football scholarship in order to help his sick/low income mother help. He looks at football as a job, needing to do well. Booby Miles was the star player and needed this as well, only..., well you will see for yourself. This movie is not just ""jockish"", there is so much symbolism involved. There are a lot of sad moments in the movie, such as when the coach is confronted in the Walmart parking lot, the QB at the kitchen table reviewing plays with his mom, the Booby Miles drama and the crying in the car scene, and the reunion between father and son after the final game, as well as the last play of the game. The music fits the dialogue well. Ten stars, watch it, I know I will be watching it again, after all, I have it right here."

","OK, not one to nit pick but I think corporate America slapping their names on anything that they can and is just getting out of hand. Did anyone notice in the beginning of the film during a football game that on the score bold in huge size was ""Bank of America"" and the logo.....<br/><br/>Just as a side note there was no Bank of America in 1988. It was Citizens and Southern (effectionally know as Crank and Screw). It became Nations Bank in early 1990's and only became Bank of America in the mid 1990's.<br/><br/>Just another sign of Corporate America trying to freaking make money and trying to post their name wherever they can."

","I liked this movie better the first time when it was called ""Varsity Blues""!<br/><br/>I don't kid you when I say that there were so many scenes copied directly from that it was absolutely appalling. The only difference was that ""Friday Night Lights"" was approximately 20 minutes longer and was a drama that contained comedy whereas ""VB"" was a comedy that contained drama. Any scene that wasn't from ""VB"" (which was scarce) was most likely from a different past football movie. Don't get me wrong, the acting was alright it was just that the plot was so unoriginal and it was unbearably slow-moving at times. The ending was the only thing that was somewhat unpredictable but even then it was more of a letdown than anything. If you score some complimentary tickets or are looking to burn a hole in your pocket than that's the only way I'd recommend seeing this as there was nothing special about it at all. Another thing I also hate is that every movie that supposedly had taken place in the '80s plays Run DMC's song ""Tricky"" even though no one really listened to it back then. The only time it was ever popular was after ""Road Trip"" came out a few years ago. People just don't stop to think about this at all. However one thing's for certain, Billy Bob has definitely been doing his fair share of bad movies!!!<br/><br/>Final Acquittal:<br/><br/>Movies: A waste of time.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: Only for someone that loves sports movies more than anything.<br/><br/>Rental: You could, but view with low expectations."

","As a student in Pennsylvania, I believe that high school football is big in Pennsylvania. But the way Peter Berg brought out the intensity of Texans in Friday Night Lights was unbelievable. The passion of the players, coaches, and fans seemed to come to life in Friday Night Lights. The acting was superb. Billy Bob Thorton was great in the role of Gary Gaines. I read the book, and was just as pleased with the movie. The hard-hitting action was brought right to you, and you felt each hit. The ups and downs were magnified in the small town, and the movie brought that out perfectly. Also I did not know Tim McGraw could even act. What a job he did. The passion of the players was a wonderful thing to watch, and for any sports fan, not just football, it is a must see. The ""be perfect"" message has to be recited by all coaches before every game."
"sf49rh8r","Null","1","2","9 October 2004"," Didn't quite do it......
","As a Texan and former athlete, it left me with the feeling that it had great potential but failed to hit the target. The story line from the book was definitely more in-depth and hard hitting. Whereas, the movie skimmed over the true fanaticism that took place in Texas during the 70's, 80's and probably still today. The movie did touch on the devotion and loyalty to the small town heroes but it failed in the area of paying attention to detail. The Panther's home field was turf but the turf in the movie was the newer FieldTurf-type that wasn't available in the 80's. Some of the athletic equipment wasn't available at that time either. Of course this may be me being picky but it definitely was a distraction. It would have be nice for the movie, since it wasn't gonna stay totally true to the book, to actually dig deeper than the book. There is so much more to the fervor of Texas High School football. Parents holding kids back in earlier years to assure there maturity in later years. I think 60 minutes did a profile of Belton High school many years ago. That type of story and others would have made nice additions from where the book left off. <br/><br/>I also didn't appreciate the depiction of the Dallas Carter team as gregarious, obnoxious, cocky and dirty villain. Was it coincidental that they were an all Black team? Football is football. And what goes on in the trenches is not for the weak of heart nor the soft. Odessa Permian's story definitely wasn't unique. You can find that story in most small towns anywhere in Texas on a Friday night. It just would have been nicer if Peter Berg would have paid more attention to detail and dug a deeper at the maniacal force that is the greatest high school in the country (bar none...Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and California)."
"d_bornemann","7","1","2","9 October 2004"," Varsity Blues without the humor
","This movie was well done on all the general aspects (e.g. filmography) but the story and plot were a little weak. The movie is so much like Varsity Blues it's almost scary. West Texas high school football, over stressed young boys, teen angst, overzealous fans in town, etc. But then it's trying to be too much like Remember the Titans, too. The super motivated, down to earth, yet outrageously insightful coach. There's the injuries, the blood on the field, and the motivating locker room speeches.<br/><br/>The problem is that it doesn't have the humor or the fun that VB brought to the table, and it is not nearly as dramatically moving as RTT. What you're left with is some run of the mill football scenes, a predictable story, and not much else. Seven stars for good acting, great filmography, but a tired story."
"JAKastner","4","1","2","9 October 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Friday Night Lights
","There are numerous genres and film concepts that Hollywood rarely touches, some of which have changed the minds and perspectives of the studio executives with their recent, and ultimately shocking, successes. The pirate genre, for example, was deemed the poison of the box office after such expensive flops as Cutthroat Island starring Gena Davis with the recent animated film Treasure Planet seeming to confirm that fact but once Pirates of the Caribbean crossed the coveted $300 million mark domestically, no one seems to know what to do now with the genre. And the firefighter genre, barely explored extensively since Backdraft, Ladder 49 has performed admirably at the box office thus far. Another genre that had taken a few hits was the sports-drama, more specifically in the area of football. Rarely had the genre been explored as extensively as it is now, and even fewer successes were created outside of a few comedies here and there (the Waterboy being the only true success of them all), but after the surprising long-run success of Remember the Titans in Fall 2000, the movie studios are scrambling to come up with ideas to produce a football film. Here's hoping it's just as entertaining as the game itself  people can dream, can't they?<br/><br/>The story is based on the now-ten year old novel by H.G. Bissinger entitled 'Friday Night Lights', which Sports Illustrated described as one of the greatest sports stories of all time. In 1988, the small bumpkin town of Odessa, Texas is practically for sale with little high-interest business in the area and plenty of drunks to make the liquor industry exuberant for years. With life as it is, no wonder the only joy they seem to find out of the few months out of the year derives from the town's high-school football team, the Permian High Panthers, whose aspirations are to go undefeated and win the state championship. Then again, that's what the football fanatics of the town say year in and year out, season after season. This year may be different with the star of the football team, nicknamed Booby, leading the charge through every position you can think of on the football field. All hopes are dashed when that star running-back injuries his knee and appears to be out for the season, if not the rest of his potential college career. When the Panthers lose to a district rival, their first hope of going undefeated is destroyed and as the season drags on through the fall they find it harder each time to maintain that aspiration to acquiring the state championship, let alone getting into the playoffs. Off the grid-iron, each player seems to have his own personal conflicts to deal with, some of which deal heavily into their playing ability on the field and how their season may end. If they have any chance what-so-ever to achieve the ultimate goal of becoming the state champions then they must put off their personal disputes and unite as a team to become perfect in their own minds, whether they win or lose. The story for Friday Night Lights, regardless of whether it was good on print or in real life, is an absolute abomination on screen, plain and simple. This film can't hold a candle to the majesty of Remember the Titans, one of the best, if not THE best, sports films of all time. The thing about that film was there was a whole different aspect to the actions on screen besides football, namely racial tension of the 1960s. The press release made it sound like there was a religious connotation, instead you get one stinkin' Our Father (no offense what-so-ever to Catholicism) relatively near the end of the movie and apparently that makes it a religiously affiliated sports film  once again, this is another area Remember the Titans trumps it in.<br/><br/>Though the film's primary focus is the community on the whole, there are few, if any true, stand out performances in this film that will stick with audiences members long after they have left the theater. Billy Bob-Thorton is the obvious standout amongst the cast of this film and even with as vivid a performance as he gives, he appears to be greatly underused. The problem does not lie with Thorton himself but rather the direction the filmmakers fail to take the movie toward. With films like Remember the Titans, you at least got some what of an in-depth approach toward the personal lives of the coaches off the battlefield. With Gary Gaines, you barely get a foot-hold into what the man's life was really like. This isn't to say they should have made a film primarily focused on his biography but they could have given the audience more material then they did. The most anyway, outside of the ones who have read the book, could have gotten from this film about him was that he was a high-school football coach, had a wife and a daughter  Deep! Jay Hernandez serves no point in this film, just as he did appearing all too briefly in another recent release, Ladder 49. This is a shame after the young actor gave two engaging performances in crazy/beautiful and another sports drama, The Rookie, so would think he would get better, if not broader, roles from studios but apparently that didn't happen. Derek Luke's Booby (why would anyone take a nickname like that, let alone a successful player) is a character you just love to hate. There are those who say you should never be envious or spiteful to those that have the ability or the talent to do the things they can do, such as Booby did on the playing field, but when one such as this individual do so with not just pride but extreme arrogance, they often get brought down to earth with a thud as they should. And Tim McGraw, the well-known country music sensation, branches further into the movie industry with a supporting-role in Friday Night Lights and gives an intense, if not partially disengaging, performance. The real problem wasn't with him specifically but with the way the relationship between the father and the son wrapped up too neatly and without much incident, which seemed awkward compared to what was previously seen on screen. Had more information been provided on how McGraw's character sunk to the position he was in then perhaps there would be a better understanding, though not to say this would excuse his behavior in the least.<br/><br/>Overall, Sports Illustrated once called the novel from which this film is based the greatest sports story of all time and you can't help but have further disrespect for the magazine then after witnessing for your own eyes the travesty that is Friday Night Lights. Peter Berg's stylized, and often awkwardly close-up, camera direction may have worked splendidly in The Rundown but it doesn't here. There's may be saying that if you look into a person's eyes you are staring into their souls but when Berg does it with the characters of this film, all you see bloodshot eyeballs and a lot of sweat. Another key concept a brilliant film needs to grasp is the idea of transition  a smooth, seamless transition from one scene to the next, even if one scene is critical and the next isn't. The problem with Berg is that he doesn't do that anywhere within this film. He'll have a critical scene (for example, the boy's drunken father catching his son practically having sex with this girl and duck-taping a football to his hands  you'll have to see the film to get it, so don't freak out), play it out and then just awkwardly end it in order to move on to the next scene. He didn't do this once, this happen frequent throughout the film and confuses the audience easily. Without giving away the film's ending, let's speak plainly and say it made the entire previous two hours of this movie definitively meaningless. It's hard to describe the feeling without giving anything away but once you see that dialogue on that screen right at the end of the film, you'll know it. Bottom-line, there's was just no connection between what was occurring on screen and the audience. Perhaps those who have played the game of football will feel a more powerful connection or have a much broader understanding of the players and supporting characters on screen then the average Joe, who spent better time hitting the books then the dirt, but (and if this is getting tiring then this shows how bad this film is) Remember the Titans was able to appeal to not only that specific group but a wide demographic as well without losing its message. Here, there may be a message but the mainstream audience doesn't get it, so it's like it never existed.<br/><br/>My Rating: ** out of 5 (Grade: D)"
"tfrizzell","Null","2","7","15 November 2004"," Remember the Panthers.
","H.G. Bissinger's highly controversial novel about the Odessa Permian Panthers hits the big screen in ""Friday Night Lights"", one of the finest films ever produced. 1988 Odessa, Texas is a place where most things are not as good as they could be. The one thing that the people of the city have to hang their hats on is the local high school football team and the high probability that the team could win the state 5A championship. Things don't always go as planned though as head coach Billy Bob Thornton gets thrown a curve-ball quickly as his all-world running back (Derek Luke of ""Antwone Fisher"" glory) suffers a season-ending injury. Now it is up to quarterback Lucas Black (who worked with Thornton way back in 1996 in the modern classic ""Sling Blade"") and teammates Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson and Lee Thompson Young to keep the team's lofty championship hopes alive. Also along for the ride is cinematic newcomer Tim McGraw (of country music fame) who nearly steals the show as Hedlund's alcoholic and disillusioned father who tries to relive his high school glory days through his emotionally tortured son. Director Peter Berg (best known for acting in the slightly popular television drama ""Chicago Hope"" and in the surprise hit ""The Last Seduction"") shows an amazing grasp for this subject matter. He is a deceptively strong director who has immense talent and first-rate vision. The bleakness and hopelessness of West Texas is shown with beautiful cinematography. The narrative tone is right on key as the production does not sell out like ""Varsity Blues"" or other lesser teen exploit flicks. Every character is complex and motivated by the opportunity that the team presents. Thornton is a revelation. He is easily one of the most talented and under-rated performers in Hollywood today. His credits are sometimes hit-and-miss, but Thornton is always consistent regardless of the project. The kids give landmark turns as well with Luke improving on the momentum he built in ""Antwone Fisher"" and Black continues to grow as a legitimate young actor. ""Friday Night Lights"" is the greatest homage to Texas since ""Giant"". Like ""Giant"", this movie is more of a religious experience than a simple cinematic viewing. It also strikes a chord when dealing with small-town life ala classics ""Hoosiers"" and ""The Last Picture Show"". Emotionally-charged, intelligently portrayed and wonderfully executed, ""Friday Night Lights"" is one of those movies whose brightness will likely never fade. Sometimes you truly do find heroes in the most unlikely places. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Honestly, I loved the movie, but I have to say that Texas is insane. This is a state that consistently ranks near the bottom of the country in the quality of its education. No wonder! All the money and attention are focused on a GAME.<br/><br/>If you're a boy, you play football. If you're a girl, you cheer for it. If you're a dad, you wear your high school ring for decades and relive the glory days. If you're a mom, you hire someone to kill your daughter's competition. (Different movie, but equally true story.) How pathetically sad. I'm awfully glad the highlight of my life wasn't HIGH SCHOOL, and as an adult I can teach my kids that there's a heck of a lot more in the world besides sports.<br/><br/>These people really need to get lives beyond Friday night lights."

","Thi is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. It had the honesty of ""Slapshot"" and the heart of ""Rocky"". It wasn't just a team-trying-to-win-the-big-game movie. The characters were interesting without being melodramatic (no sinister villains vs. sparkling good-guys). You'll learn a lot about how seriously they take high school football in Texas. Their stadium really seats 19,000! Apparently they left out the fact that this high school team took a chartered jet to two away games in 1988. It doesn't ridicule or judge, it just shows a variety of points of view, from the pure fun of the game to absurdity of hero-worship. You get a good balanced message of enjoying sports but not letting them rule your life.<br/><br/>Also, Billy Bob Thornton and Tim McGraw are great."

","I enjoyed this movie. I attended high school in Texas shortly after this time period and can relate to the intense football climate in TX. I had also lived in TX as a younger child and remember Friday nights with nostalgic feelings. I recall the dominance of Dallas Carter. The movie is poignant because it delves much deeper into the tremendous pressure these kids faced. Everyone's hopes are riding on their young backs. They have their own hopes of escaping this West Texas town and dwindling opportunities. Thornton is well cast in the part of the coach. Lucas Black, Derek Luke, and Garret Hedlund are quite good in their roles. Tim McGraw, who I believe is making his film debut, is surprisingly good in this film. Very good, realistic, and deeply felt film. 8/10"

","""Friday Night Lights"" follows a season of football in a dusty little Texas oil town where varsity football is not just the only game in town but the only way out of town and the only hope for the future for many of the players. The film examines the team's key players and their good guy coach (Thornton) as they wrestle with personal issues and work their way through the season one bone jarring touchdown at a time. Working more with montages than linear plot development, Director Berg brings life and verve to the screen culminating in the mania and frenzy of the statewide championship. An excellent football flick, ""Friday Night Lights"" is all about football and what it means to the town that lives through it vicariously. (B+)"
"mm-39","7","1","3","20 October 2004"," Filmed like a documentary
","Friday Night Light's is filmed like a documentary. I personally learned much about American high school football. In Canada, where Canadians only play 3 downs, high school football only has the parents, and some guy walking his dog by the park watching the game. In America, real football culture, with radio shows, ex players wearing their rings, and a crowd of 12000 a game. I believe one player's dad's problem was the dad had nothing else after high school football. The father peaked at 17! Billy Bob actually plays a good role. I was surprised the makers added realism, and seriousness of the game showing many hidden aspects like racial politics, violent on field intimidation, and fear of losing. I can not believe the Astro dome was filled for a high school game. Worth seeing on the big screen 7 out of 10."
"The-Silent-Photoplayer","6","1","3","17 October 2004"," Okay film. Worth catching once.
","Friday NIGHT LIGHTS promises action and drama, and does not fail to give the audience that. For a sports movie, LIGHTS does come above the average, giving some good detail while not overburdening the viewer with minutae they couldn't care less about. In this respect, LIGHTS is worth catching once (although you might want to catch the matinée price showing).<br/><br/>Its biggest faults are in its character development... for a semi-biographical film, one might expect that there could at least be SOME realistic development, but the little that there is in the film comes off as bland characters developing into a little less bland versions of their former selves (ie. no one ever raises themselves above the level until the final game, and then totally miss the point).<br/><br/>LIGHTS also tries to emulate another great football film, REMEMBER THE TITANS, in its approach to the characters and what they are going through, but ultimately leaves its former a stronger selection.<br/><br/>Thornton is good as the burnt-out coach of the team that almost makes it, and his character is certainly the most interesting of the rest of the cast to watch. Some honor should be made of the subplot containing Derek Luke as ""Boobie"" Miles, which does help pick up the story behind what is going on and does make for an interesting conflict. However, the writers feel that once it's realized that he won't ever be able to play again, they throw every clichéd symbol possible in the script, which really hurts what would have been a most positive part of the film.<br/><br/>The film is also well shot, giving it a feel of a late-80s film as well as the football scenes having a distinct NFL highlights sort of tone to them. The only thing I took issue with was the editing, that was obviously trying hard to pace the film, but ended up making me need to take a Dramamine.<br/><br/>So on a 1-10, I give this one a 6. It's above average, and is entertaining to watch for once, but there's nothing here that would merit me watching repeat viewings of the film. It is pretty much a sports programmer."

","When I saw Friday Night Lights, it was if I had to view it with two very different personalities. The part of me that is the regular movie goer was impressed with the action sequences, and the great acting. I became totally immersed in the movie. I felt as if I was at a football game and at times I wanted to cheer. I felt true ""Mojo Magic.""<br/><br/>My other personality involves my childhood in Odessa. I was born there and lived there until I was 18. While watching the movie, I was surprised that it was not more factual. Permian only made it to the Semi-Finals that year against Dallas Carter, and lost 14-9. Most of the season viewers will see in the film was fictional. Also, Odessa is not a small town; it's a city of 100,000. As an Odessan, I felt that many of the important things about the team were forgotten or skipped over. Most of all, I wish people could see Odessa, TX, and its' people for what they REALLY are.<br/><br/>When I step back from those feelings, I see an excellent film that could be considered one of the greats. Friday Night Lights will evoke a wide range of emotions, from laughter to tears, from intensity to relief, and from victory to defeat."
"sschwart","7","1","3","9 October 2004"," Any Given Friday Night - but is that so bad?
","One of the nicest surprises in the movie ""Collateral"" was an uncredited cameo (but pivotal) performance by actor Peter Berg. It was great because Peter Berg throws himself with unparalleled earnestness to any role he gets, even one as small as he had in Collateral. (If you're reading this and haven't seen ""The Last Seduction"" yet - get thee to a video rental store!) It also made me wonder if Michael Mann was a conscious or unconscious influence on Berg's direction of his cousin (H.G. ""Biss"" Bissinger)'s book, ""Friday Night Lights."" Well, no need to wonder. ""FNL"" is as all new directors' movies are, a hybrid blend of the movie masters he admires. This vertigo-friendly mix of Michael Mann + Oliver Stone + MTV + Cinema verity = a gripping, sports drama that grabs on like a linebacker on a face mask, and occasionally it hits as hard. Now as common with sports films, there is some definite ""character abbreviation"" here: we have the hard-drinking and take no prisoners father, the mentally-delicate mother that's a 21st century version of a Tennessee Williams character in a faded housedress, the gruff but lovable coach, the flashy knowitall star athlete who's just biding his time until his pro league checks start rolling in. Yes, we've seen these characters before. But triteness is not at fault here - Bissinger did not make these characters up, they are real-life people. Only a few plays and some events were changed to protect the innocent and the undramatic. So when we see shortcuts taken to show these characters, we understand that for our patience, the director rewards us technical creativity like more hand-held camera shots than a reality show, and more extreme close ups than an MRI. ""FNL"" owes a lot to the sports movies that precede it but it adds a modern sensibility, a directors deft hand at drama and almost-too-revealing cinema verity to the mix. The acting ranges from good to amazingly strong. One of the strongest performances is turned in by country singer-turned-acting newcomer Tim McGraw. McGraw is almost unrecognizable in the callous father who crawls out of a whiskey bottle long enough to chip away at his son's self esteem. It's clear McGraw's character is reduced to living vicariously through his son but then so is the entire town. From middle aged sheriff deputies wearing their old high school championship rings to menacing athletic supporters who accost the coach during a family shopping trip - it's clear that this town lives, breathes, and eats football. Billy Bob Thorton is totally on point as the Coach of the Permian Panthers and if he hadn't done ""Sling Blade"" or ""Monster's Ball"" then this would be considered his role of a lifetime. As it is it's damned good although Oscars are handed out quite stingily to actors who don athletic gear rather than executioners' gear or mental hospital uniforms. It's Oscar's loss, Thorton's turn as Coach Gaines will probably be one of the top male drama performances this year. Derek (Antwone Fisher) Luke seems to phone it in as the star player with as much ego as talent. Better is Lee (Jett Jackson) Thompson Young as the young hungry backup running back. One standout is Lucas Black who gives a heart wrenching turn as the overburdened young quarterback, Mike Winchell. Black plays Winchell with just the right touch of uncertainty, premature responsibility and stomach churning fear. Ironically Black's only major TV guest star appearance was an episode of ""Chicago Hope"" where he starred with ""FNL"" director Berg, and he's had no formal drama training. It's in this way that his aw-shucks persona adds depth and realism to this role. Would it be great if there were more Lucas Blacks in this film? Yes. It does still stand on it's own as a better than average portrayal of the life and death drama of Texas High Football. And if someone likes football, likes small town drama, and can well the tolerate the stylized *look* of ""Any Given Sunday"" - you can't make a better Friday Night Movie choice this season. 7/10 if you're open minded, 8/10 if you like fast moving, reality camera-work *and* love football. Give it a try!"

","**WARNING!!! Spoiler Ahead!!!**<br/><br/>I spent some time on the Football field in High School, even though it was as the yearbook photographer (That scene with the cameraman being tackled REALLY hit home). But anyway, I've had a front row seat to real live Texas HS Football action, from practices to game nights, and I'm glad to see this movie depict a great representation of the often chaotic world of Texas high school football.<br/><br/>The Permian Panthers (Go Mojo!!!) 1988 campaign is just one chapter of thousands of football programs across the state. Even though not all schools are state contenders, a large number of them have emotional highs and lows, not to mention the occasional luck (I believe three-way ties are still determined by coin flips). Permian's obstacles were expeted from my point of view, from losing their main offensive weapon, losing to their main rivals, barely making the playoffs, and eventually coming up one yard short of a title (Hello Kevin Dyson!). I mean this IS High School Football, where on any given Friday, on any given play, anything can, and usually does, happen.<br/><br/>Overall, a really good football movie that gives ""Remember The Titans"" a run for its money in the best Prep Football movie."
"heckbabe","6","1","3","10 October 2004"," Good but not fantastic
","First, I must say that I am a football fan. High school football in particular. I heard about this movie months ago and was excited to see it on opening day. Much of the hype said that it is the 'best sports movie ever made'. I disagree. It is a good story of a season in the life of one Texas high school team. If you are going into it to gain some sort of insight into football, or even to see some great football plays, you'll be disappointed. I was, however, surprised at how much it included about the players lives (outside of school or football). I was impressed by that- though there are too many characters and too little time to go into much depth. I became interested initially because it is a true story. Being Hollywood though I believe they embellished a bit - I suspect that the story itself was tweaked and the coach made less of a jerk to make it more movie- and audience-friendly. (Though it is far from sugar-coated.) That is why I decided to get the book and read it, to get the real story.<br/><br/>Bottom line- good story, a little different perspective than in other sports movies. See it if you like football, but not if you have sky-high expectations."

But all I saw in the movie was, another movie about high school football. I haven't read the book, so I'm sure that the book is probably way more controversial than the movie. Because I didn't see anything in the movie that the town should feel ""betrayed"" about.<br/><br/>Back to Varsity Blues reference, I love that movie, and it was a very funny comedy. The only difference between VB and FNL is that the latter is a true story of a serious nature. However can anyone see the similarities between the two? We're talking, Texas, not-so-smart athletes hopin for a dream, a hot slut who screws the QB, an asshole father, (which by the way, hat's off for Tim McGraw, I'm thinking possible supporting actor Oscar nod for that one) and a town who thinks football is everything. Please help me out here. Will it be worth reading the book?

"pbball","6","1","3","9 October 2004"," Racist Movie!
","I have just seen Friday Night Lights and I must say that it depicts blacks in a very unfair way. Where shall I start? 1) The most obvious, Dallas-Carter is portrayed as a butch of mean thugs in the movie. They took cheap shots and were very flamboyant when scoring TD's (one scene had the QB flick the ball in a defenders' face as he crossed the goal line), however, this behavior was NEVER portrayed in the book. SHAMEFUL!!! 2) Carter-Dallas jumped out to a commanding 18-0 lead in the movie, however, they beat Pernian 14-9. In fact, Pernian scored first. Why must the movie give the stereotype that blacks are bigger, faster, stronger athletes? Why must it be a ""white vs. black"" thing for ""all the marbles"" (ie: State Championship) when in fact this game really took place in the semi-finals. Were they trying to create a ""Great White Hope"" attitude among the audience? It wouldn't surprise me since the dirsector played ""The Great White Hype""...strange coincidence! 3) The movie never portrayed the racial tension in Odessa, however, when Boobie got got (in preseason) it is a fact that the town turned on him...one even said ""That n***** got what he deserved"". That NEVER took place in the movie. 4) The coach (Gaines) was portrayed as being racist in the book and seemed way to nice in the movie. He even had Boobie and his Uncle over for supper, which never took place in the book. Is this the movies way to convey that the whites are catering to the blacks? That they are civil ones in the movie? This scene NEVER took place, so why is it in the movie? 5)In the scene where the two sides meet to negotiate a place to play, the blacks seemed like the aggressor when getting ""the right colored referees"". While they were demanding on a black crew, the whites made a clever statement ""Zebras have the same amount of colored and white stripes"", almost like race is no issue to them and that they are the level heads at the table. Made the blacks look like they were pushing the race card too far.<br/><br/>The unfair stereotypes are overshadowing in this movie. Yes, race plays a role in the book, but it was unfairly shown ""one-sided"" in the movie and I am afraid that the blacks got the short-end of the stick. It was an entertaining movie and made the 2 hours go by very quickly, however, when you reflect upon the racial overtones in the movie...it is a movie that is poorly depicted. Don't mess with history, because when you do, you may mistakenly portray the story an entirely different way. I would love to watch a movie that has the ""TRUE"" story and not the story ""HOLLYWOOD"" wants you to see."

","Very good movie. Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, Friday NIGHT LIGHTS tells the story of the 1988 season of the Odessa Permian Panthers. It would be almost pointless to argue against the fact that Odessa Texas is one of the hottest hotbeds of High School football. This movie deals with the fact that the Panthers year after year carry the hopes and dreams of the Odessa townsfolk on their shoulders. And the meetings with Midland Lee High School is like a world war fought in the middle of the former oil laden west Texas. The movie strays from the novel, but it is still a thrilling movie following the MOJO Panthers to the state championship game. <br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton is outstanding as the legendary Odessa coach Gary Gaines. The spotlighted players are Boobie Miles(Derek Luke), Don Billingsley(Garrett Hedlund), Chris Comer(Lee Thompson Young), Brian Chavez(Jay Henderson) and Quarterback Mike Winchell played by Lucas Black, who also worked in Billy Bob's SLING BLADE(1996). Country singer Tim McGraw is very believable as a former Panther not pleased with his son's play on the current team. The lives of coaches, parents, boosters, players and 20,000 fans stuffed into Ratliff Stadium rise and fall with what takes place under the Friday night lights. <br/><br/>Filming took place in Odessa, Houston and Austin. Actual footage of the 2003 Permian Panthers season is interspersed into this movie that offers some very hard hitting, bone bruising, snot knocking action.

","No shock that when Bissinger's incredible book of the same name came out, residents of Odessa were none too pleased with what they read. It painted Odessa as a very backwards and overtly racist town. Countless examples and incidents revealed a Texas town still stuck in the Jim Crow days of years passed, inspired only by high school football victories. High school football was the main theme of the book, but the racism found in the community was right there with it. Enter Peter Berg, who wished to make a film about high school football, in particular, he wants to make this book into a movie. The community of Odessa made it clear, no way. Berg would not be allowed to use Permian images or Permian facilities. Berg pleads with the Odessa district to let him make the film, he pledges that he will remove all of the racist elements in the book that made Odessa look bad. In fact, Berg went one step further, he decided he would deal with the prejudice angle, by using African Americans as the example of the bigotry. The black coaches of the all-black Dallas Carter team that faces Permian in the championship game complain bitterly about the initial lack of black referees, implying they want to stack the deck for the black team. During the game, the black refs wink and smile at the black players as they taunt, cheap shot, showboat and play dirty. A black referee blatantly cheats on a call in favor of Dallas Carter. It is incredible! This is when you realize, this horrible excuse for a movie had nothing to do with the actual book it was based. It is very difficult for me to tell anyone that they should watch a movie, when the story being told, completely distorts the truth of what that film was supposedly based on."

","The thing that makes Friday Night Lights an impressive sports movie (which is saying a lot since sports movies have long since been a battered and abused dead horse) is that it is a true story. Well, it's based on a true story. Loosely. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that it was inspired by a true story. The phrase ""dramatized for effect"" is putting it very, very lightly. That being said, however, I certainly enjoyed the movie. It is a very well-made film, it has a great story, the performances are outstanding, and believe it or not, the movie doesn't get cloyingly, achingly cheesy until the closing scene.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the reason that I watched the movie was Billy Bob Thornton, and he delivered a great performance but I still can't tell how much of his performance was a genuine effort to accurately portray the coach that he was playing and how much of it was making fun of Texans. He does, after all, burst forth with such exclamations as ""Dad gum it"" and, my favorite, ""Great grandma's drawers!"" Then again, I've never been to Texas, I have no idea what high school football coaches talk like. Besides, it could have been the production team working with the MPAA ratings board to ensure that the movie got a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>My initial lack of interest in the movie was diluted by reminding myself that it is based on true events, on a real game, which surely must have been a hell of a game. I've been to tons of high school football games, when I was in high school my brother was the captain of the best team that our school had ever seen. The first seven games rarely was a touchdown ever scored by an opposing team, much less a game won. Then on game eight we had a night exactly like the last game in this movie, so it had an even more dramatic effect on me.<br/><br/>The thing that really bothered me about the movie stems from a feeling that I have about sports in general rather than about this movie or about sports movies in general. I spent a few weeks in Spain a year ago and the thing that really amazed me was the sense of community that was there. A woman sent her five-year-old son to show my father and I how to get to a local restaurant that we were looking for. Two complete strangers and she didn't think twice. At 1am the central park was crowded with neighborhood kids playing and laughing while their parents ate and drank coffee at nearby sidewalk cafes, I was stunned at how welcoming it was.<br/><br/>Then I came back to America and the first thing I saw on the way home from the Sacramento airport was a car with a bumper sticker that said ""Die Laker Scum.""<br/><br/>Not only is this Americans wishing death on other Americans over something as definitively arbitrary as basketball, but doing it in a time of war. It reminds me of the arbitrary meaninglessness of the roots of tension between the Hutu's and the Tutsi's in Hotel Rwanda. Luckily relatively little violence ever breaks out. And by the way, a great many people have told me that I'm being too harsh and that I need to lighten up about that, so don't e-mail me and think you're clever. Besides  DIE LAKER SCUM. Is it really ME that needs to lighten up?<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the opposing team in Friday Night Lights is one of the more dramatized parts of the movie, as they resemble movie monsters more than even the most aggressive high school football players. It's easy to throw in shots like one of them kicking a players helmet in his face as he lies on the field hurt, but it belittles the story that is being told, which doesn't need little bits of violence thrown into it. It is a strong enough story on its own, but evidently the writers and director didn't think so.<br/><br/>I really wish that they hadn't felt the need to end with a heavily manufactured, slow motion ending that had a sappy screenwriters boot-prints all over it, because it was even less necessary than the tidbits of random violence.<br/><br/>The movie is strongest when it does what it spends most of its time doing, which is presenting this tiny town in Texas that places all stock and hope into its high school football team because not only is it the most interesting thing happening in the town, but it is their one means of proving that their town has meaning. They are not some obscure little town in the Texas desert but the home of the 1988 Texas State Champions.<br/><br/>This does, of course, put enormous pressure on the players, who are forced to grow up far too quickly because not only their parents but their entire town is already looking to them for support and salvation. The options that many of the players have for the future outside of professional football also illustrates one of the more pressing dangers of high school football, one that has nothing to do with injuries.<br/><br/>By the way, the DVD for Friday Night Lights has a wonderful documentary about the true story of the 1988 team, in which several of the key players get together to talk about the days that have now been immortalized on film. While I certainly enjoyed it, I am shocked that no one thought to put the original game on the DVD. Maybe they were worried that everyone would see how different it was?"

","Released in 2004 and based on H.G. Bissinger's true-life book, ""Friday Night Lights"" details the 1988 football season of the Permian High School Panthers of Odessa, Texas. Billy Bob Thornton plays the resolute yet caring coach who has to deal with the pressure to win while Connie Britton plays his wife. Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson and Lee Thompson Young appear as the players, amongst others. Tim McGraw is also on hand. <br/><br/>While based on a true story, the film borrows heavily from 1999's ""Varsity Blues, which concerned a central Texas team, about 300 miles southeast of Odessa. But, then again, ""Varsity Blues"" no doubt borrowed from Bissinger's book and made a fictionalized version of the events. In any case, ""Varsity"" is a Hollywoodized version of a Texas champion football team whereas ""Friday Night Lights"" is a docudrama. Whether you prefer one or the other depends on what you want. In my opinion ""Varsity"" is the better film simply because it's more entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game in cinema. Yet ""Friday"" is a compelling realistic take on the same topic. With the exception of Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), ""Varsity"" has far more memorable football players; in ""Friday"" they're bland by comparison. <br/><br/>However, Thornton is noteworthy as the coach. Speaking of which, the character of the coach is the most significant difference between the two films. In ""Varsity"" the coach (Jon Voight) is power-mad and abusive whereas in ""Friday Night"" he's determined yet goodhearted. <br/><br/>The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in Texas (Odessa, Abilene, Elgin, Taylor, Austin & the Houston Astrodome) with the opening trailer shot filmed in Manhattan, Kansas.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

I guess my inability to write something about Friday night lights is the perfect proof of how this movie lacks any character or anything that would make it mildly memorable.

In the first game the star football player tore his ACL and was out for the season. The shot of boobie about to get hit by the linebacker can be seen as if you know that he is about to get hurt. The movie goes on and the team has to come back from big loses. The team goes through emotional and physical changes. The team gets back on track when the little voices became big voices on the team.

"jeffreymeadows6","10","0","1","16 November 2012"," Great sports movie, great directing!!
","Friday Night Lights is one of the best sports movies of all time, not only because of the great acting, but because of the great story line. Director Peter Berg does an excellent job displaying the small town of Odessa as a place where football is the last thing keeping the town alive. A place where being a football coach is one of the most stressful jobs, and where wins are heavily expected from the local community. If you are a sports movie fanatic like I am, then this film is a definite must-see. It is probably one of the best dramas I've seen in years, and it ends leaving you with a new feel of respect for high school football.<br/><br/>Although it may follow along the same plot type as many other sports movies where a team rallies together after facing some kind of adversity (in this case Boobie Miles injury) and goes forth to advance in their season, it holds a much deeper story. A story where football is only a small portion of what is really going on, the town seems to be at a loss for economic success and they need something to root for in order to bring them hope. Friday Night Lights does a good job showing how football is not only a game, but more of a lifestyle in Odessa Texas. While the acting was superb, I thought that director out-did himself here and brought a film to the table that displays the true meaning of football in some places. For instance, the scene where quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) is out eating with his teammates at a local fast food joint and a man comes up to him asking for him to take a picture with his son brilliantly portrays how much the team is looked up to. This also gives the viewers a chance to get a grasp for how much pressure these young kids were under while playing football in Odessa. Or even the scene where Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is out grocery shopping with his family and some locals pull up to him in the parking lot and ask him if they are going to win state this year. Followed by a snide remark declaring for him to ""get it done"" as a coach. Both of these small scenes implemented by Director Berg give off a sense of harsh reality that the Permian Panther football team must face, that they are the life of their small town, and without them, many people would have nothing to look forward to every Friday night.<br/><br/>Also the fact that this movie is based off of a true story makes it that much more special in my opinion, the director was able to portray Odessa Texas in a new light, one that gave me a new feel for how small towns functioned, and it was almost inspiring to see how much everyone came together to support a single team every Friday Night. And this can be a hard task when having to follow along the true story of what actually happened. After I had watched the movie, I even took the time to up some stuff about the Permian Panthers and what I found closely resembled how the movie displayed it. I watched some old game footage and read up on some of the players, and how they were portrayed online seemed identical to how I saw them in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a top-notch sports film, and one of the best out there. If you like small town football and want to know more about what goes on in the lives of many of those small town athletes, then this movie is definitely for you. I've gained a lot more respect for kids who have been able to get out of their small town slump and attend college based off of their football talent just by watching this movie. I now have a better understanding for what they've been through, and from what I can tell, it's not easy doing what a lot of those young kids do every Friday night."
"hall895","7","0","1","8 November 2012"," Football is life, the rest is just details
","They like high school football in West Texas. That previous sentence would have a good chance of winning a competition to determine the biggest understatement in the history of the world. The truth is that in West Texas high school football is an obsession. You watch Friday Night Lights and you see the passion. But passion can go too far. The pressure the adults put on a group of teenage boys is ridiculous. The self-worth of a town is determined by the results of high school football games. Adults live vicariously through the team, trying to relive past glories. Or bask in reflected glory since they never actually had any glory of their own. In the midst of all this stands a coach who has to mold his boys into men while also managing to satisfy the town's bloodlust for victory. And there are the boys themselves, they all have their own hopes and dreams, many of which have nothing to do with football. The players are constantly told that playing high school football will be the greatest thing they do in their lives. How sad it will be if that is true.<br/><br/>Coach Gary Gaines, played by Billy Bob Thornton, is the central character in the film. Gaines is a man put under tremendous pressure and he handles it about as well as you could possibly hope he would. He understands that the town's obsession with his team is unhealthy at best, dangerous at worst. But make no mistake, the coach wants to win. And he's got the team to do it. Until he loses his star player to injury in the first game. Can he rally his team in the face of adversity? The movie follows the team on its roller-coaster ride of a season, big ups and downs all along the way. There's some drama, some excitement, and maybe even a little room for growth for some characters who may come to realize there is in fact more to life than high school football.<br/><br/>Thornton gives a very strong performance in the starring role. And Tim McGraw is a revelation as the alcoholic, emotionally abusive father of one of the players. While Thornton and McGraw are excellent and create a couple of memorable characters the movie doesn't do as good a job as you would hope in establishing the personalities and stories of the players. The cocky, headstrong star running back has some pizazz to him but injury cuts him down. The film has some good emotional moments with him as he struggles to accept his fate. But when the story turns its attention to the other players things fall somewhat flat. The quarterback is quite bland. Most of the other players remain total mysteries, not established well enough at all for us to really care much about them or their fates. There is the one player, the son of the McGraw character, who has his moments but that story is much more about the dad than the son. It's odd but in this story of a high school football team it is the team itself, the players, who get short shrift. It all makes for an interesting movie but it doesn't pack the emotional wallop of some other movies of its type. There's some decent drama but nothing that really has you on the edge of your seat. This look at a team and its town has some good pieces but it never quite all comes together. In reaching for the goal line maybe this movie comes up just a yard or two short."
"rmlattimore","Null","0","1","3 August 2011"," Don't sleep on Julius Tennon
","Performances in this movie were top notch. Others have praised Billy Bob Thornton, Tim McGraw, Derek Luke and others; I'll draw your attention to Julius Tennon, who played the coach of Dallas-Carter. He's pretty much the villain here, and he is _perfect_ in his role. He gives a performance that should have been up for a Supporting Actor Academy Award, if the Academy actually honored supporting actors (like, for instance, Dame Judy Dench in Shakespeare in Love; probably the last time an actor with an incidental role will be so honored) instead of second leads. The sideline scenes in FNL are all so well done, and you can see the chess match taking place in the minds of the coaches, particularly when one coach has all the pieces. I can't think of a better football movie that I've seen. I prefer it to Remember the Titans and North Dallas Forty, among those that come to mind."
"howard.schumann","9","0","2","16 March 2011"," A film about values
","""Their sons grow suicidally beautiful, At the beginning of October, And gallop terribly against each others bodies"" – from the poem ""Autumn Begins In Martins Ferry, Ohio"" by James Wright <br/><br/>Directed by Peter Berg and co-written by David Aaron Cohen, Friday Night Lights is not only a sports movie about a high school football team but also a film about values and what is important in life. Set in 1988 in Odessa, Texas, a West Texas oil town of 90,000 people where everyone lives for Friday nights during football season so they can go out and cheer their team,the Permian High Panthers (also known as ""Mojo), the football team with the most wins in Texas history.<br/><br/>Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book ""Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream"" by H. G. ""Buzz"" Bissinger, people in Odessa eat, sleep, and breathe football. They talk about it incessantly on talk-radio shows, at the local drive-ins and bars, reflecting on the team's past glory and the championships yet to come. They ""dream of heroes because their own dreams have disappeared, andtheir sons must bear the pressure of these dreams."" Their obsession with winning is so strong that ""for sale"" signs are put on the coach's front lawn after a loss, and racial prejudice remains a potent factor.<br/><br/>The film captures the explosive force of the game and also explores the character of the boys, mostly 17-year-olds, who are under constant pressure from their families, coaches, and teammates to realize the hopes and dreams of the community, but who must deal with harsh realities. Led by intense head coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), the team has high expectations but, when star running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) tears an Achilles tendon in his knee, the mood of the team sinks. The young quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) now feels the pressure to produce even more, although he is lacking in self confidence and has to deal with a chronically ill mother.<br/><br/>There are also fireworks between tailback Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), a player prone to fumbles and his bitter, alcoholic father Charles (Tim McGraw), a former star for the Panthers, now living with only his fast-fading memories and his championship ring. Charles is not above humiliating his son in public, while telling him that football is everything. ""After football,"" he says, ""it's just babies and memories."" Upcoming star Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young) gives the team some hope but he is only a third-string running back with much to learn. Boobie wants to get back in, but his ego and immaturity get in the way. Insisting on playing in spite of the doctor's orders, he inevitably re-injures his knee and is out for the season.<br/><br/>Although some of the actors playing the 16 and 17-year-old football players look more like NFL linebackers in their late twenties, they act young and vulnerable and we root for them to come out on top. Like soldiers going off to war for a reason they do not understand, they play football as if their life depends on it. One boy says, ""I don't feel like 17,"" and you can see the sadness on his face. A very touching moment occurs after quarterback Winchell throws an errant pass in the end zone to a wide open receiver and cries openly in the locker room, repeatedly saying ""I'm sorry."" <br/><br/>Another extremely moving scene is when Boobie breaks down and cries as he tells his uncle L.V. (Grover Coulson) that he cannot do anything else in life besides play football. Though the Panthers struggle, they end up in a three-way tie for the right to play in the State Championship game against the rough and physical Dallas Carter team with a coin toss determining who plays and who goes home. That is where the fireworks really begin. Though some facts are embellished for dramatic effect, Friday Night Lights is an emotionally honest and compelling film, with characters that grow in depth and maturity, a rare achievement for a sports film.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton turns in one of his best performances as Coach Gaines who initially falls into line with the heavy-handed machismo approach, yelling at his team that they ""have to be perfect"" and repeating the win-at-all-cost mantra of the community. By the time the final game rolls around, however, he tells his huddled players that being perfect does not mean winning each game or never making mistakes.<br/><br/>It means that you can look your friends in the eye and tell them that you have given all that you could have given. As the team listens in hushed silence, he tells them to go back on the field with ""clear eyes, love in your heart, joy in your heart,"" an important reminder of the values in life that are the most nurturing and reflective of my feelings after the film had ended."
"perdue93","10","0","2","14 November 2010"," Much more than just a football movie!!!
","Friday Night Lights is the only sports movie ever to be made that can appeal to any person, even those who may not care for football. The movie is about teenage boys who have the weight of their hometown on their shoulders. The town of Permia expects these teenagers to win a state championship and nothing else. The movie shows the problems these boys have to deal with not just on the football field, but at home also. One of the main characters, Mike, is the senior quarterback of the team and he puts his sick mother before anything else. He never shows happiness only his love for his mother and the game of football. Another very appealing character, Don Billingsly, dealing with a drunk father who becomes violent over little mistakes by his son. The most heart wrenching character of the movie would have to be Boobie Miles because you feel his pain of not being able to follow his only dream after a career ending injury. The movie has you hooked to the very end and you feel for these teens who are counted on by everyone to ""get the job done."" Permia is a poor town suffering in depression and rely on the Permia High School football team to bring happiness to the town. I highly recommend this film to all people except for little ones as there is a couple of scenes that are too explict for younger ages.<br/><br/>Overall: 10 out of 10"
"stodruza","1","0","3","3 May 2008"," Inocuous, ineffective film. They know what the're doing.
","Apparently this is a very hard film to make well. It very well maybe an impossible film to make well. I haven't read the book, but by all serious accounts it by and large dismisses and does not articulate the main argument in the book. Impossible for two reasons: It would take an Oliver Stone in his Midnight Express devotional mood to make it, and apparently not Grazier and Berg. <br/><br/>Is being stuck in the realities of Football Texas as bad as a Turkish prison? No, but at least there you know you are in prison. In the realities of this film you do not realize significantly the quality of that which binds you, which is the failure of this film. In the end it can't have it both ways. To have all of the expectant beats of a traditional sports movie, and have the desired ironic effect. You get exited as you watch this film by all of the sounds and reactions, and those realities aren't shaped with irony by the screenwriter. Can they be? Very tricky to do I think. In the end we are suppose to come away with... is an insurance salesman, so and so is has twins, they lost the football game...and what? Everyone in this film lost, even the likable coach who was the inadvertent orchestrator of this institutionalized brutality that we have been conditioned to accept as normal so those unfortunate ""normal"" people who are everywhere can get there anger out by first investing their emotions in, then watching young men, so unlike themselves, time has proved, bludgeon themselves every week. <br/><br/>Oh, now they cash in on the fact and we are reminded that it's a true story. That surely has to give it some more credibility. Did you know...this actually happened...<br/><br/>Oh, oh, the critics lauded the film, and it made money, oh, oh, I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit/ Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit. <br/><br/>Chingy knows where it's at and he says it. These filmmakers hide and distort it pretty well. They might be ""Gettin' it"" in their personal lives, but on screen, well its a different matter altogether isn't it. <br/><br/>A really a muddled effort and message. <br/><br/>Impossible to make maybe also because of the economics of film. Who would pay to see one of the sacred cows of American culture (football) beaten and demolished on screen? I would, maybe you would too, but unfortunately not enough people to pay for the film and let the people at Universal keep their jobs, or so they timorously believe. What a great film that would have been! Hard to write well, impossible to make, but at least worth the work and effort. <br/><br/>You see you have to hate it and enjoy it at the same time both in traditional ways the filmmakers believe. <br/><br/>So you get the watered down bittersweet Koolaid to sip on. It won't kill you, but might make you wonder, hopefully at the duplicity of film's meretricious, ineffective creators. Hollywood's sharp understanding of the economics of the lowest, common, safe economic denominator time after time. The false thin facade of Grazier, Berg, and co. that if it has the veneer of truth that it's all good. They know what their doing.<br/><br/>The irony here is, though, that I think the people involved were considering and are considered being involved in a ""cutting edge"" non commercial venture film, because this film is not intrinsically commercial. Go figure. In which case they just didn't have the know how to do it right, or perhaps their ideological baggage kept them from seeing the correct path because I think they think they made a great or at least a good, maybe even a very good ""against the grain"" film. Probably an amalgamation of everything."

","Well, I'm not from Texas, or play football, or really particularly love football. Hell, I barely like it. When i went to see this movie, I didn't even know it was a movie about football. But, honestly, this allows me to be the most unbiased type of critic. I went in with a totally open mind.<br/><br/>Friday Night Lights was to me was lifting the magnifying glass, not only a small and backward town, that put winning above winners. Aggrandizing the image over the substance, but about ourselves. It took me under football's skin, to the blood, sweat, and tears, in a real way. I felt the pressure, I felt the hits, the uncertainty, the fragile youth, that comes and goes so fast. And I was moved.<br/><br/>I think at one point, we become anesthetized by Hollywood. And we start to keep predisposed outcomes -- but that's not reality. Reality is, the kids who tried, and failed, and yet, didn't fail at all. Because they learned a deeper truth. We see that when the QB smiles at the end, something he never does.<br/><br/>Because they grow, we are inspired. Enlightenment is contagious. I cried, I laughed - one scene the two other head coaches, who tend to stalk BBT around town, hounding him about winning State - threatens not so subtly, the coach before driving away. The daughter then says, ""Are we going to move again?"" Mom says, ""No, baby."" And immediately after, in a matter-of-fact manner Billy Bob says, ""It's possible..."" I laughed out loud at that. I never expected to see such a myriad of emotional layers opened up. The sociology, mentality, reality, of this film was beautifully depicted with gracious character development, that was all too realistic. Remember the comment on the Odessa radio station after the game when the guy suggested that they lost because they are in school learning too much. The fact of the matter is very few athletes go on to play in college and graduate and a fraction of them go on to play professionally, and a fraction of them make a good living out of it. Odessa put football on a higher pedestal than education and the town and all its residents suffer. Fact is perfect is different things to different people, and this is a perfect story.<br/><br/>I believe every scene was necessary in developing the main characters and the story being told."

","Hey, look everybody! It's the Hoosiers of football! Seriously, though, it's a decent movie so long as you remember it's just a football movie. It's in the same class as Any Given Sunday and Varsity Blues with less emphasis on teenage shenanigans and politics than those two. Friday Night Lights is more about the huge amount of pressure on the high schoolers to win the state championship. This is its main deviation from the ""Hoosiers template."" In Hoosiers, it felt like the characters had to win to overcome a personal challenge, to become a better person through the game. This movie takes a more realistic and depressing look at high school sports: the kids are playing either because they don't know how to do anything else, or because the entire population of their town is counting on their win for for what? Just what can this championship do for the town except encourage future generations to become football champs too? It's just a game, and a college recruiter reminds the quarterback at one point, ""it's supposed to be fun."" In any case, the players feel trapped in the game. It has consumed their whole lives and made them local celebrities that all the old ball players can now live through vicariously. Where other football movies try to paint a picture of life AS football, Friday Night Lights shows us several lives that have merely been interrupted by football. Many want out, a few are forced out, and life goes on."

","Not knowing any history or any part of the inspirational story of the Permian Panthers, from I believe 1988, I came into Friday Night Lights expected another inspirational story that had pointless inspirational lines from nowhere and an ending that you could predict from watching the first trailer. Thank heavens I was proved wrong. This movie was not the same at all; it lacked the Hollywood filming, it lacked the famous actors who aren't meant for these movies, and it actually had a good script (aka none of the inspirational crap that flows out of the mouth of the coach in most other sports movies. I have not been impressed with many sports movies, truly the best one I had seen before this was Glory Road, which was good at best. But enough of getting off topic, i'll give you my bottom line so.... BOTTOM LINE: With fantastic directing, acting and writing all combined, Friday Night Lights makes the perfect sports film without the stupid ideas that Hollywood provides to many sports movies. It is truly inspiring, which is half because it is based on a true story that the entire movie sticks to pretty well. I yelled at the ref with the bad call, I cheered with the sideline, and I felt sympathy for Coach Gaines after a loss or a problem with one of his players.

I downloaded it in 2007, saw it around 7 times, then had to watch the TV series first season about 4 times over to fully understand the movie. I have read multiple reviews, and I really don't get why people were so picky. So Boobie was FB, Chavo was TE or whatever, numbers were whacked and they lost to Dallas in State in the movie and not semis or whatever in real life I didn't care. I mean, as far as I see it, if Peter Berg had stuck to the real story completely boring. The way he made it was to entertain the viewer. The story makes you feel vulnerable. Boobie was probably destined to play NFL TB or FB; and whack... one stupid move and he's career's down the tubes. Mike Winchell was previously ""blessed"" with Boobie in the team, and now he's gone, everything in the teams going to change. All in all this is an excellent movie, the development of the characters, like Charles Billingsley (Don's father), Don himself, Boobie finally being less arrogant, and Mike, becoming an even better QB, but also his personality. It is ironic how Mike is portrayed as one who is internal and never smiles, yet at the end, he throws the ball to a bunch of young kids and he smiles. it's even more ironic that the kid who catches the ball wears ##45. Boobie's number."

","*Friday Night SPOILERS* <br/><br/>Odessa, Texas, 1988.<br/><br/>The local High School Football Team, the Permian Panthers, is the center of a (very scary) town-spread obsession; people do not seem to care about anything else - as is shown by two people that call the local radio, Mojo radio; one doesn't seem to care that quite the sum of money that could have benefited the school only went into remodernation for the school stadium, commenting 'it WAS spent for the school; isn't the stadium part of the school, too?' and another, quite disconcerting one, after the Permian lose a game, calls and proclaims angrily 'There's too much learning' going' on at that school!' (Learning? In a HIGH SCHOOL? Oh the horror!... Go hang yourself, will you?), and by the fact that, after a lost game, the coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) comes home to find 'On Sale' signs on his front lawn - and of course, other than Gaines, the young men on the team are the ones that are hit harder by the responsibility.<br/><br/>The main player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), who is an ace player, doesn't seem to care about that; actually he's way too self-conscious and arrogant, which leads to him hiding a companion's helmet to go back to the field for an unnecessary action and getting badly injured, to the point of actually having to leave agonistic football playing.<br/><br/>So, it's going to be up to the other players, like Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who is burdened with a very ill mother, Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), whose father Charlie (Country Music Star Tim McGraw, debuting as an actor), who won a tournament while in the Permian Panthers, is an alcoholic who reacts quite hardly at his son's apparent inability to hold the football in his hands, Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), who ends up leading the team through the State tournament, Ivory Christian (Lee Jackson), the quietest player on the team, and Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez), the only one who, with his good grades, is sure of leaving Odessa and its obsessions behind.<br/><br/>And it will be a tough time...<br/><br/>This movie, though not entirely real (the accident that happened to Boobie, as an example, happened during a pre-season scrimmage against Amarillo Palo Duro at Jones Stadium in Lubbock, where he injured his leg by getting his foot caught on the AstroTurf), is a very engaging, inspiring and also chilling experience, which seems to mirror some things I have seen people in my country do to players in a different game, soccer.<br/><br/>The acting was very good (especially newcomer McGraw), the music and pace intense, and the direction was spot-on.<br/><br/>Don't let this one slip through your fingers! <br/><br/>Friday Night Lights: 9/10."

","""Friday Night Lights"" is unique because, unlike many other sports films, it is not cliché. In other words, it isn't a feel good, inspiring movie where a team comes together to overcome the odds.

After seeing so many typical sports films, this film was a breath of fresh air for me.

"mgkitty11","8","0","2","27 February 2007"," Real Texan Football
","I myself am a Texan and in high school I was a cheerleader. ""Friday Night Lights"" is a wonderful example of how Texan football is. Just as in FNL, a ton of pressure is put on the teams, at school, everyone knows and idolizes them. Everyone goes to the football game on Friday, especially if it's a district game. In FNL, it actually goes into depth about emotions that Texans have when playing football. True, we are not all living in ""small, rural towns"" Odessa is actually a quite populus town. We are NOT all rednecks, looking for a way out. If you noticed, at the end of the movie, most of them were still in Odessa or Texas. I was present at every single football game all four years of high school standing on the sidelines. IT is absolutely brutal!!!!!! I could hear the sounds of impact as players pummeled one another to the ground. I was even hit once by a player on the sidelines, much like a cheerleader in the movie. The pain and effort shown in the movie is true. The exhaustion frustration and exhilaration is real. FNL shows what football for high school students is like."
"ceebeegee","9","0","2","19 February 2007"," Unsentimental Look At a Town, a Team and a Dream
","Very, very strong movie about a small town in Texas obsessed with its high school football team. With its hand-held camera shooting, it has a documentary ""feel"" that is appropriate for its unsentimental look at the price the players and coach pay for their town's unrelenting support/pressure--they are simply *expected* to win the state championship. Billy Bob Thornton gives a well-textured, understated performance as the coach who is paid more than the principal, but comes home to ""For sale"" signs on his lawn after a loss. Derek Luke breaks your heart as Boobie Miles, the player who is key to the championship season, but who suffers a serious knee injury in the first game, and is out for the season. The scene where he finally allows himself to confront his bleak future--he can only play football and has literally no other skills whatsoever, indeed he can hardly read--is devastating. In fact the entire ensemble is excellent; very strong actors even in small parts. My one criticism is that FNL has a fairly sexist outlook--the movie is about the whole town, not just the team, and it's very telling that the only two scenes with girls are ones where they're throwing themselves at the players without seeming to want anything more than sex with them. The book was much more rounded in that respect, and talked about how much pressure the cheerleaders felt to ""support"" their players, and make cookies, etc. for them, and I wish the movie had included that. That one criticism aside, it's an excellent movie--highly recommended."
"bgrams7","10","0","2","13 February 2007"," Great movie and perfectly describes high school football
","Friday Night Lights gives a great look at what high school football is truly like. The pressure of the school and the community, the thrills of a close win or heartbreak of a close loss, and the fact that for a few months out of the year, a bunch of teenagers truly mean something to a lot of people. A great movie for anyone whose ever played football, been a fan of football, or a fan of sports in general, and it does capture what people who play football in high school go through each fall. From the parties, girls, and family issues off the field to the big plays, big hits, and big disappointments on the field, Friday Night Lights is high school football."
"woodj-1","10","0","2","13 February 2007"," An Incredible Movie
","Fiday Night Lights is a marvellous piece of film making that I can watch over and over and am always sucked in to a story of heroism, tragedy, desperation and realism. The cast peforms to a very high standard, especially Lucas Black as Mike Winchell, a brilliant but troubled 17 year old kid with the responsibility for a team that has a whole town depending on them. He manages to portray Winchell so well that it is impossible not to feel empathy and admiration for the character. Billy Bob as Coach Gaines is understated and subtle yet perfect for the role. The most impressive thing about this film is that at no point do you forget that the characters are just boys and the director Peter Berg has done well to resist the temptation of putting the boys on a pedestal of heroics and success. The atmosphere he creates is also superb using the Texan band Explosions in the Sky to create an unforgettable score that enhances the shots of the town Odessa and surrounding West Texas. Although this is a sports movie, it is so removed from the stereotype that it does more to deserve a title of ""best sports movie"" it transcends themes that go so much further than the niche of a football movie. In this instance the football is in no way rooted to how good this film is but similarly it is irreplaceable, the story of the Permian Panthers of 1988 is as deserving as any."
"The_Mr_Awesome","9","0","2","24 January 2007"," Texas High School in a small town with nothing to offer but a game.
","Odessa Texas' fans, citizens and athletes are very connectible with in what, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. This movie really captures what Texas High school Football's soul is all about. The struggles the players go through are so parallel to what actually happens to other high school players like myself. There is enormous pressure placed on the shoulders of the athletes to succeed where the town does not economically, and the games are all the town has to look forward to. Living in a small town in Texas, playing football is all you have. It is your life, your dreams, what you eat for breakfast, and what you sleep with at night. Friday Night Lights really captures this emotion very well, and portrays everything with picture-perfectness. This movie makes me cry at the end, when the seniors are discussing what is left for them in their future, and what they will miss about the game, mostly because I know that I will be in those shoes in two years. The acting is great from every actor. Ithink this is one of Billy Bob's best, and really supports the character development. I really like the fact that I feel I can really relate and connect with FNL. Football fan or not, you will learn to love Odessa, the fans, coaches, athletes, trials and struggles of the team, and each individual on the team, of this emotionally driven movie."
"anchorman360","9","0","2","23 December 2006"," My Favorite Sports Movie!
","This movie was really good because it was exciting and dramatic. The movie is about a high school football team in 1988 Odessa, Texas. Everybody in town is expecting them to go to and win state. Billy Bob Thorton plays the head coach of the team. Derek Luke stars as the Boobie Miles the star running back. Garret Hedlund is the running/tailback with butter finger hands and an abusive dad played by Tim Mcgraw. In the first game of the season Miles gets hurt with the team at a 42-7 lead with 2 minutes left. That leads everyone to blame the coach for keeping him in the game. However backup running back Chris Comer and starting quarterback Mike Winchell played by Lucas Black rise up to the challenge and take the team to the playoffs. Other players include cornerback Brian Chavez played by Jay Hernandez who later starred in Hostel. They go to state and battle Dallas-Carter. Its a very exciting game with them losing just coming up inches short of the game winning touchdown. This movie is very good and I give it 9 stars out of 10."
"CWfan","10","0","2","8 December 2006"," Why Friday Night Lights is a MUST SEE
","This movie is without a doubt the foremost, best and perfectly written, acted and directed Football movie ever. If someone wants to know what it is like to play football, this movie is the closest to the real thing as possible. For those who have played football, even on a minor team as a kid, or senior high-school, you must see this. It is a refreshing thought, that in the age of horrible atrocious movies like ""Remeber the Titans"" and other Hollywood Disney clean white washed movies that a movie can really describe the battle and the raw,ugliness of the physical assault that is Football. Their is nothing pretty about football its real, and reality is something that is lacking in almost every sports movie. Not every team wins, not every idolized player is perfect. However, one thing is for sure, this movie was perfect.<br/><br/>Defiantly my vote for number one Sports movie of all time. And without a doubt the best football movie of all time. and if you disagree on that point and say ""Any given Sunday"" i will ""stab you in the Jaw""-Dane Cook please watch, buy, and re-watch this movie<br/><br/>ps Jamie Foxx would never strap on a helmet, stick to playing musicians and wanna be tough guys<br/><br/>-CWFan"

","Peter Berg's emotional yet solid film about a depressed town and their heroic football team. THis is one of the best Billy Bob THornton performances i have seen, i mean its up there with A Simple Plan, Sling Blade and Bad Santa. Although it sometimes is formulaic, i liked the atmosphere, it had a real classic feel to it. I liked this film even more than the likes of Coach Carter or Glory Road because in my opinion it was more realistic, where those films concentrated a lot on the coaches characters (Samuel L. Jackson and Josh Lucas respectively) but this film was more real and less character driven. It gave the audience a feel for the whole school and town's atmosphere because of the events, not just a character or two. I liked Bergs film and would watch it again soon. --- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my rating: 9/10"
"rghays47","8","0","2","17 September 2006"," MOJO Football
","As a 1965 graduate of Permian I would like to add a few comments that I think are pertinent to understanding the book and movie. As a new school (opened 1959) we were competing with the best from around the state from the start. I don't know of many schools in Texas that won their first of many state championships in their first 6 years. FNL does do a good job of relating the importance of high school football in Texas and what it meant to Odessa. By 1965 we had witnessed the assassination of President Kennedy, the growing military involvement in Vietnam and the beginning of integration in our schools. We were not referred to as Odessa Permian back then, just Permian or PHS or the Panthers. We did not use the term MOJO as it is known today but somehow in the back of my memory it seems I had heard it used before but maybe not. We were a conservative, patriotic and close-knit group of students. We prided ourselves on our accomplishments not only in sports but academia and music. PHS probably saved my life in Vietnam. Because of the education I received I qualified for the only guarantee the Marine Corps offered back then: Aviation Electronics Training. By the time-frame of FNL, many of my classmates had children attending Permian and the pride never went away but grew stronger with acceptance of minorities and the educational foundation upon which our school was built. And that is the key to understanding ""Odessa"" Permian;we were one as a school and student body and we did our best to excel in everything. You will never find any stronger tie, student to student, to school and faculty, than the Permian Panthers."

It really, really showed the emotion and passion of HS football, far more than Remember the Titans(another excellent movie).<br/><br/>4) I just watched it the other night. I couldn't finish it. It made me sick. It made me miss football far too much. I couldn't take it; I had to find something else to do.<br/><br/>Overall, it is one of my favorite movies of all time.

","Sports-Dramas always tend to be pathetic. This one's by no means an exception. It is based on affective emotion - as the fascination of sports itself is in real life. But FNL's strength is based on the portrait of the run-down, melancholic provincial town of Odessa, Texas and its football-mad inhabitants. The game is the binding link, the element to bridge the gap between generations (or to cause them, as the story of the player Billingsley and his local-hero-dad tells). The guys play for their town and every scene apart from the field conducts the pressure and the awareness of being vulnerable in a brilliant way. It is also more than a game, for many of the talented high-school-boys play to gain a place in one of the college teams, which may lead a way to wealth and fame - even for the poorest (here: Boobie Miles) Thornton's intense acting and the dynamically filmed play-scenes in combination with the effect-fully used music of ""Explosions in the sky"" create just enough depth to make this movie an enjoyable, serious sports-drama, that won't leave any emotional person on its seat towards the end. 7/10"

"james_norman1981","8","0","2","25 May 2006"," Visceral and moving, this is an exemplary sports movie
","There have been many movies made about American sports over the years, but few pack as powerful an emotional wallop as this one. Friday Night Lights is a real eye opener in many regards. Instead of the vainglorious pros or troubled geniuses, or any other single sporting clichés, what we have here is a far more real evaluation of life in a football mad world. That world is Odessa, Texas and the residents of Odessa take supporting your team to new levels.<br/><br/>The story concerns Odessa's 1988 football season, the last season for a group of young men playing football for Odessa before they graduate from high school and leave to go to college, find a job or whatever (I think - I don't know much about American football or education). But that future is the least of their concerns. Winning the championship is expected of them and that expectation weighs hard... as Lucas Black comments at one stage: 'I don't feel like I'm 17 at all...' Black is the quarterback of the side and a good, strong player but not someone who is ever likely to reach the pros. Still his life is dominated by football, that and his sick mother. <br/><br/>However, Derek Luke's wonderfully arrogant Boobie Miles does have a very good shot at the pros, as a wide receiver who can run, catch, dodge, sprint and even pass... Unlike his peers, and despite the fact that he can't read too good, the universities are queueing up to sign him, assuming he's as good as they've heard and stays fit. The other young actors in the piece represent other sporting stereotypes, though none of them ever appear hackneyed or insincere.<br/><br/>Garrett Hedlund is Don Billingsley, the son of an Odessa legend, a heritage he is ill equipped to deal with, particularly given his father's alcoholism and the unrelenting pressure Billingsley senior places on his son to succeed. Jay Hernandez is an intelligent football player and the only person, other than Boobie, likely to get far from Odessa, though thanks to his brains rather than his brawn. Lee Thompson Young is the wide receiver backup to the backup, someone on the periphery of the team and unlikely to ever get his chance to shine... Lee Jackson is the unrelenting Preacher and defencive star, a boy disguised as a man whose stare and attitude are as intimidating as his flying blocks. Finally there's Billy Bob Thornton, the coach, Gary Gaines, and, although he's not on screen all the time, his magnetic presence is what drives this movie to its dramatic heights.<br/><br/>This film is not really about football. It is much more about a small, poor community's relationship with their team, their pride and joy, and the pressure this relationship puts on the young players and older staff of that team. From the beginning Coach Gaines is being told how to do his job... play this person here, have you thought about that guy there and so forth. Paid more than the school's principal, and in charge of a stadium the cost of which could've paid for education rather than a single team's pursuit of one prize per year, Gaines has a great deal of responsibility and, when his star player takes a tumble in the first game of the season, with the match already long won, the difficulties begin in earnest...<br/><br/>Boobie, taken out after scoring or creating six touchdowns, is put on the subs' bench only to be called back in when his replacement isn't ready to go (he's lost his helmet). Seconds later Boobie is on a stretcher and, we later discover, has suffered that cruelest of fates: a career destroying injury. Without him the team go from the supposition of total victory to the very real possibility of absolute failure and, midway through the movie, the Odessa Panthers' progression to the knock out stages of the competition hinges on a coin toss... Well you can guess how that goes but the final conclusions of their season are less than certain.<br/><br/>But that's not with this film is about, as I've said before. Instead it's the pressure of a whole community's desires that is the driving force and the inner workings of these young men as they try to live up to those expectations. Far from disappearing after his injury Boobie subsequently develops into a much more interesting character: trying to get fit again, seeing doctors about his knee, playing again... By the time of the final, climactic match against a Dallas team, a far larger outfit than the Panthers, Boobie has gone from an arrogant jock to an emotional centre of a powerful movie... his tears when he finally bids goodbye to his locker, not to mention the emotions he shares when he returns for the final, not to play but just to be with his team, are gut wrenching indeed and will strike a chord with anyone who's ever seen their hopes and dreams destroyed.<br/><br/>All of the other young characters go through similar arcs and, to describe them all, would take too long and doubtless not do them justice. Instead let us finally focus on Coach Gaines... Thornton's portrayal of the man, with a job seemingly as tough as any in the pros, is spot on, from accepting the blame for Boobie's injury, despite not being responsible, to enduring a constant stream of abuse from the Odessa residents as the season starts to slip away from the Panthers. It is his weather worn, gentle face that anchors proceedings and, with the glorious, if not triumphant, conclusion of this movie it is his quiet changing of the guards at the end which best sums up Friday Night Lights... after a long a turbulent season he simply has to throw away the old name badges and pull out the new ones before leading next year's team, with a whole new load of emotions and stresses, to championship glory."

","...and one of the best sports movies I've seen. I enjoyed the book when I read it years ago and was looking forward to how it would be portrayed in the film. They definitely captured the spirit of the book. I knew Peter Berg from his acting performances, but who knew he would do such a good job directing? Billy Bob Thornton was very believable as the coach. I think he's from Texas so he has the accent and probably understands the intensity from the fans. Speaking of that, my favorite parts were probably the radio show clips where you had conversations like - Announcer: ""Some people say that the multi-million dollar stadium is too much and that money should have been spent on the school."" Caller: ""Well, isn't the stadium part of the school? I don't know what they are complaining about!"" That captures the fanaticism of the people for high school football.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw did a good job as the player's father. Reminds me of another country star who did some acting, Dwight Yoakam. The actors playing the players were great. The cinematography was great. I was actually yelling at the screen like I was watching an actual football game."
"DeeNine-2","8","0","2","5 April 2006"," High school football as a glorious religion
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>For an appreciation of this excellent film see the beautifully written review by D. Mikels. What I want to do here is present a counterpoint. I played high school football too and might have sat on the bench a little less except that I was a slow-footed T-quarterback at a school that ran the single wing. Yes, it was that long ago.<br/><br/>The football presented in this film by director Peter Berg is a little different. In fact it is a whole lot different. Here high school football is the most important thing in the world, not just for the players and coaches, but for the entire town. If you drive through a west Texas town or an Oklahoma or even an Indiana town on a Friday night in the fall, the town will be deserted (as in the movie) while the stadium at the high school will be lit up like a gigantic Christian revival meeting in which it might be fully expected that Christ will appear to perform the Second Coming.<br/><br/>It is no exaggeration to say that in the heartland of America the rites and rituals of football, joined into by almost the entire populous, take on all the trappings of a most zealous and evangelical religion. What Peter Berg has done here is capture that maniacal devotion and idolatry--that oh, so American way of life in a quasi-realistic way.<br/><br/>I say ""quasi"" because there is some license taken with reality by the film makers. First of all, and most importantly, the players are too old. Derek Luke, who plays star running back Boobie Miles (and does an outstanding job), was 29 when the movie was filmed. Jay Hernandez who played Chavez was 25. Anybody who really plays football or coaches it can tell you there is a world of difference between a young man of seventeen or eighteen and one of twenty-five or thirty.<br/><br/>And the scenes filmed especially for the movie with the flying tackles and the rolling flips and the bone-crunching open field tackles--forget it. Those are staged tackles, like kung fu fights in Chinese movies. Everything looks fantastic only it's about as realistic as a barroom fight in an old cowboy movie from the forties.<br/><br/>What is realistic? When sexy, saucy blonde Melissa goes looking for her trophy seduction of the MoJo quarterback--that's real. She knows that the highest status in town belongs to the star of the high school football team, and the highest status of any girl is to get that guy. Also realistic is the pressure put on coaches and administrators to win football games. Winning isn't a matter of life and death. As some coaches will tell you, it's more important than that. And they mean it. Die and you're only dead. But lose at football and you are disgraced for life. Typifying this mentality is Don Billingsley, father of running back Charles, who wants to beat the life out of his son for fumbling the football. Can't the kid see that you let down your teammates, your school, your town, your friends, your relatives and God Almighty if you fumble the f-ing football? Also real is Boobie Miles's answer to what subject he gets all A's in: ""There's only one subject. That's football."" Or this line from a disappointed fan calling in to the local radio jock show after the team loses a game: ""There's too much learning going on at that school."" He's not kidding. He means it. Too much time in the classroom. Too little on the field.<br/><br/>So is this film--as its devoted fans believe and know to be true--an ode to the glory and beauty of football? Think again, jockstrap. It's a glorification. It represents a mentality in which the greatest events of life occur when you're eighteen years old. After that it's all over. What you got left is beer, the wife, TV, and Bruce Springsteen's ""Glory Days."" Or to choose another lyric, what you've got are ""Veterans of the fight/Fast asleep at the traffic light."" (Jackson Browne) There are a number of goofs and anachronisms in the movie. IMDb lists a dozen or so including cars in the parking lots that weren't even made in 1988, the year of the film, and football gear used that didn't exist then. But that doesn't matter, and nobody who loves this film cares in the slightest about that because what really counts is the fantasy, the imagined and recalled glory of a time when everything was new and astonishingly vivid, when events made indelible marks on our hearts and souls. When we were all 17. This then is mythology in the making and in the living.<br/><br/>The question begs itself: is this good or is this bad? Is football as a religion something to be treasured or condemned? Personally I have mixed feelings. Young men have aggressive tendencies that need to be channeled and middle-aged men need to play war games. Football allows an acting out of these needs without undue harm to anyone. Certainly football is better than gang-banging.<br/><br/>When, some many years down the road, the history of cinema is brought up to date, this film will be remembered because it is a very good film, and Billy Bob Thornton's fine performance as Coach Gary Grimes will be appreciated. But instead of the film being seen as a realistic portrayal of what it's like to play and be involved in high school football, it will be seen as a commentary on the sociology of middle America in the late 20th century, a time when the nation was very rich and football was not only king but something close to a way of life, something indistinguishable from a national religion."

","Hey guys, I have to say this was an absolutely perfect film. There is no point reading about some loser who picks out every flaw in the movie, who cares? Buzz Bissinger came to Odessa in '88 to depict a bunch of kids at Permian who love football. It captured a transition of these young boys to fine men, but the book also showed hatred, race and economical depression. Here, in Odessa, most despise the book so I think that it's good that the movie didn't really follow the same direction as the book. Great football scenes, good acting (especially Winchell, God that kid was nervous), overall fantastic film that really encaptualated what it meant to play for Permian"

","I think my rating is truly genuine, and I can say that because I don't particularly like Billy Bob Thorton. I didn't know what to expect nor did I figure another sports movie could be done in an original and captivating fashion. I must say, I was impressed. Each character had his own valuable contribution, and you can't help but feel the highs and lows of the high school kids. I've heard how big high school football is in Texas, and having played high school football myself, I can really understand and feel what the Permian team was going through. I am typically a macho-macho man, but I can say that I cried when Permian lost to Dallas-Carter. I know that pain of losing a big game and in high school that is probably the most important game if not event of their lives to that point. A great movie, well done, it truly captured Texas high school football."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","2","23 February 2006"," Fantastic portrait of small town hell
","Small town life has always seemed rather miserable to me. The idealist would envisage it as a world of cookies and apple pie, of family values and kids playing softball. And this Shangri-La of hotdogs and cheeseburgers would be inhabited by golly-gee good-hearted folk, folk who look after their neighbours when they have cardiac arrest after their hearts swell with too much joy and love of life. And in each corner there would be a jock with a large chest and a cheerleader with a rack to match. But the reality has always seemed rather different. I can imagine a world full of losers and alcoholics, of broken dreams and smashed faces. Small town life isn't a piece of heaven. It's a piece of hell.<br/><br/>And so it is in Friday Night Lights. Here you have a town that defines itself entirely by football. Education and culture be damned.<br/><br/>The lack of interest in education is superbly illustrated in a series of calls on a radio show. They talk about the money that was spent on the football stadium. ""They say some of that money should have gone to the school."" ""Aint that stadium part of the school?"" And then during game day the entire town empties. Everywhere you go you see signs saying, ""Gone to game."" The entire town invests its dreams and hopes in this football team and in the kids that play in it. It's a pathetic state of affairs.<br/><br/>Of course this means that the kids that play are put under an extraordinary amount of pressure  pressure that they should never have to face so early on in their lives. Some react by internalising (Mike, the quarterback, rarely raises a smile) and some let it go to their heads (Boobie, the team's star player, is all mouth and swagger). But the frailty of this sort of existence is magnificently emphasised by the aforementioned Boobie. Right from the start you know his card is marked. He's cocky, he's talented and he says that his talent is god given. Therefore you know he's going to get injured. And his injury comes in the first game after he's forced into the match because a player loses his helmet. He should never have been on the field but suddenly his bright career is under threat. At the beginning it's kind of hard to find sympathy for the lad  there's a feeling of just desserts  but when the mask drops and he's reduced to a blubbering wreck because he'll never play football again, your heart goes out to him. Football was the one joy he had. It was the one thing he could excel in and it was his ticket out of this miserable town. But then out of nowhere it's taken away from him. And his future is bleakly summed up in one shot. He sits on the porch and he sees a bunch of garbage men. Not only is he now on the scrap heap but that's the sort of job he has to look forward to. He goes from having the world at his feet to being the rubbish that is scraped off the pavement.<br/><br/>Also under pressure is the coach. Everywhere he goes people give him advice. And then people slag him off on the radio and people even threaten him when the possibility of defeat is raised. If the team loses, the town loses. The absurdity of this is best depicted in a scene where the team is forced into a tie-breaker and their future is decided by the flip of a coin. The whole town watches this on TV! This is what gives their life purpose and meaning. And it's amusing (and sad at the same time) that the coach gets paid more than the school principal. The small town people here have no faith in bettering themselves through education and knowledge. In Odessa betterment is measured by how many balls you catch, how many yards you rush and how many heads you bash.<br/><br/>And the football here is superbly filmed. All the excitement is captured as well as all the crunching tackles (Boobie's injury is nasty, but I actually winced more when the quarterback gets his helmet kicked in his face). But I do have to say that I was disappointed when a bit of schmaltz found its way into the film in the final game. ""I love you all,"" the teary quarterback says before the final play. But thankfully it's only a small moment and thankfully the actual end of the game is a pleasant surprise, one that goes against the grain of most sports movies.<br/><br/>But then again, the film isn't really a sports movie as such. It's more a portrait of a town than a football team. And that's why the film works so well. It's about the desperation of having no way out. It's about the fleeting joy of actually doing something you love. And it's also about the despair that this might be as good as it gets. In the film there's an ex-football star who abuses his son. He chides him for not being good enough. But despite at first seeming like a one-dimensional alcoholic father (a character we've seen in millions of films) he reveals a misery that is all too real. He had one decent year in his life. One year that actually meant something. And from that point onwards it was downhill. He tells his son that he has one year to make some memories. It's a despairing sentiment, and one that might not apply to all the players, but for some, perhaps even most, it must ring true. Life isn't going to get any better than being a member of a high school football team. Holy crap, pass the gun."
"bce753","8","0","1","30 January 2006"," Good Movie But Fictionalized - Dallas Carter Was Stripped of the Title
","I was in my senior year at Plano Senior High School in '88 when Dallas Carter played Permian--in the semi-final game--and the movie reminded me of that time like it was yesterday. The big Texas arm patches and letterman jackets were all too familiar. PSHS was the 5A champion in '86 and '87, so as students we knew how big this was--especially our cross-town rivals at Plano East who were eliminated from contention in '88 by a Carter squad with grade problems and a tendency to entertain themselves by holding up convenience stores in their time off the field. However, the film makers changed the story, probably for two reasons: 1) to fully memorialize the Permian squad of '88 and 2) to avoid being labeled as being race biased in telling the truth about the Dallas Carter team that, at least for a few months, held the Texas 5A title.<br/><br/>The truth is that Dallas Carter defeated Permian in the semifinal game. At the time, they were already embroiled in a grade scandal and litigation launched by lawyers for Plano East Senior High, but they went on to beat Judson in the 5A Championship in Austin. Later, after months of litigation that initially sought to have some games replayed by eligible teams, Dallas Carter was stripped of the 5A title for having fielded at least one ineligible player--their quarterback--in several games. The postscript to this story is that several Dallas Carter players--almost all of whom had already won Division I NCAA scholarships to major schools--went to prison for a string of armed robberies of convenience stores and/or gas stations in the area and, of course, never played a Division I game. In sum, this Dallas Carter squad should have been banned from the playoffs at the outset. If this had happened, perhaps Permian would've gone all the way in '88."

Odessa Permian played Dallas Carter in the State Semi Finals Losing to them. Dallas Carter was under speculation of several school sports violations during that game but played anyway. Dallas Carter then Went on to play the JUDSON ROCKETS from Converse Texas. They beat Judson, but forfeited the Championship to Judson due to Conflicts and Rules violations and Ineligble Players.

It makes you sympathize with those guys, their families, their very personal story, which, most of the times we don't really seem. What this movie show us is the dream, the hope of a very small town and the players, who are making history and living, maybe, the best part of their lives, and this feeling about making the most of it, because you know it's your last chance to make it worth, it's their part to contribute with the town's history and they don't want to fail, so this makes them grow up faster, they're feeling how their futures can be sharped with the way they play.

","I really liked this movie as an entertaining football flick. Billy Bob Thornton did a great job. The kids played their parts well too. I did not like the fact that I sat through that whole movie just to see them loose the supposed ""5-A State Championship"". <br/><br/>I did some research just to see how long coach Gary Gaines lasted as a coach. Wasn't long. I did find the actual site as well for the Permian Panthers. In 1988 Permian lost in the State Semi-Finals, not State according to the site. It says Dallas Carter beat them 14-9 in the semi-finals. Is this correct? (www.mojoland.net/werock80.htm) That really ruined it for me. I wouldn't have cared but now the true story is the Panthers made it 3/4 of the way and lost. And they made a movie about that? They should have just made the movie about the 89' State Championship team instead.<br/><br/>Oh well. It's only for ""entertainment purpose"" anyways.<br/><br/>I'd still suggest it, just tell people to ignore the true story thing a bit.

","This movie was an entertaining account of what high school football can be in some parts of the country. Here, we have a west Texas high school team from a small town. Everyone goes to the games. The kids are constantly reminded by their elders how they won state and show off their championship rings. The coach is constantly asked around town about the team and winning state. Some of the big wigs imply win state or else you may be out of a job. Drama comes from the season ending injury of the star running back. There's also a fullback whose dad stays drunk a lot and is always on his tail about hanging onto the football and winning state like he did. He punches and verbally abuses his son all the time. There's the quarterback who just wants to get a college scholarship to get out of the small town and away from his needy mother.<br/><br/>So, the film follows the team from preseason till the end and they have a ""miracle"" type of season.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. It's an entertaining sports movie and fairly realistic because in Texas some people do take their football a little too seriously."

Varsity Blues was fun to watch but laughable when it to realism. However, growing up with these teams featured in this film, I must say that I was impressed with how accurate this film is. Now it is not perfect, there were definitely some creative license taken. However, I can tell that Peter Berg really put the time into this to make it as authentic as possible. This is not your typical sports film like others have said. That is because it is real. Peter Berg, unlike some other filmmakers, did not try to change aspects of the real events to make it more acceptable or cheerful. He stayed true to what happened and simply told it how it was. Being a film major myself, I have to say Peter Berg has finally gotten something right that others just couldn't seem to get.

","Take Varsity Blues, replace the humor with drama and you have Friday Night Lights. In this sports flick, Billy Bob Thornton stars as the embattled football coach at Permian High School in Odessa, Texas. The film focuses on the team's run at the Texas State Championship in 1988.<br/><br/>Apparently, a prerequisite for American actors is to appear on screen as a coach. If you don't believe that, just look at the list. It features: Al Pacino; Gene Hackman; Nick Nolte; Denzel Washington; Walter Matthau; Jon Voight; Tom Hanks; Tom Berenger; Kurt Russell; Samuel L. Jackson; James Caan; Kevin Bacon; Keanu Reeves; John Candy; Emilo Estevez; Dennis Hopper; Danny Glover; Rodney Dangerfield; Henry Winkler; Burt Reynolds; John Goodman; Rick Moranis; Ed Harris; and James Earl Jones. Now, Thornton can add his name, and his performance should put him somewhere near the top.<br/><br/>This isn't the perfect movie. Some of the characters aren't fully developed throughout the film and the state tournament montage towards the end seems trivial. Permian had gone through several tough losses, but suddenly they were unbeatable and the games weren't even in question. Maybe a more dramatic look at those contests would have helped, but overall it doesn't severely damage the story.<br/><br/>The young actors who comprise Thornton's footballers are a serviceable bunch, the most notable being Derek Luke. Luke turned in a quality performance alongside Denzel Washington in Antwone Fisher and comes through again in Friday Night Lights.<br/><br/>The movie is based on H.G. Bissinger's best-selling novel, and those who have already read it will not be shocked by the way things unfold. However, those experiencing this story for the first time will be surprised. This is not your typical, cookie-cutter sports movie. That alone should set it apart from its predecessors.<br/><br/>For Thornton, add Friday Night Lights to his growing list of respectable movie roles. Previously, he's turned in memorable performances in films like Tombstone, Monster's Ball and Bad Santa. His new career path, however, may be as a football coach. He'll play one again this year, when a remake of The Bad News Bears is released to theaters this spring."

","If I had to pick the best sports movie I've ever seen, ""Friday Night Lights"" would get the nod. Based on a true story, the film chronicles a year in the football life of the Permian Panthers of Odessa, Texas. Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Gary Gaines, the team's coach, at once a firebrand and surrogate father to his athletes. The film shows the immense pressure put on these kids by their peers, parents, and school officials; the folks of Odessa live and die by football (the creed ""Go Mojo"" is everywhere, and the town shuts down when the team plays), and the game offers the players hope of leaving the dead-end town for a better life. But this is not ""All The Right Moves"" - clichéd characters surprise us with their depth (Tim McGraw's performance as the abusive father is an eye-opener, as is the path the character takes), and the team's fortunes take some unexpected turns. And the film shows both the pain and joy of the game. It's a great, great movie."

But this movie missed a great opportunity to comment in a meaningful way (beyond Booby's tearful All-I-can-do-is-play-football lament) on our often troubling, national obsession with football. I'm watching this movie thinking that this is the movie to send to friends overseas who want to know what the US is all about. We're all about glory, pride, winning, and toughness. And not necessarily in a good way. Could have been a great movie, in the end just a good movie. Berg obviously thought about going the exploration route but opted for a pretty straightforward Rocky-like sports thing. Pity. Worth a watch though.

The majority of sports movies are produced with the same ending: The underdog team behind in the last minute, a breakaway for a touchdown, a slam dunk, or a grand slam to win the game.

For example in Varsity Blues, the team goes on the win every game, go to college to play, and their whole life is set. In FNL, they get a second chance to win the state championship and end up losing. It gets no more emotional than that for such a film.<br/><br/>It also shows the struggles of each player. Billingsly getting yelled at and abused by his father, played by Tim McGraw. (I didn't know he could act..) Boobie Miles getting hurt after being so cocky and an essential player to the team.<br/><br/>In the special features it has interviews with the actual players and show how they are like now.

It was a football coach.<br/><br/>And the movie ended on a strong note. The half-time speech Thorton gives during the final game is something that gives a former football player goose bumps. It really encapsulates what its truly like to be a part of a football TEAM...and how powerful that experience can be.<br/><br/>I have seen movies like ""All the Right Moves"", ""The Program"", ""Varsity Blues"" and the laughable ""Any Given Sunday"". NONE of them can hold a candle to this movie. Any football player or fan needs to watch this film...the best football movie I have ever watched."

","Friday Night Lights is a good movie - an excellent story of high school sports and the pressures placed on young kids to perform. What keeps FNL from being a great movie is the amount of time between the book and movie releases. In that interim period, the premise was used and over-used by MTV Productions, etc. to produce material that was wildly marketable to teenagers. This makes FNL seem worn-out and too similar to lesser movies that are still relatively fresh in the viewer's mind. Sadly, this also undermines the credibility of the film - Friday Nights Lights would have been a GREAT movie had it been released 10 years ago. Lucas Black deserves recognition; he's doing a nice job of building upon his accomplishments as a child actor (Sling Blade, etc.)."

It was well-paced and even myself and my best friend wiped a couple tears away!

","For those viewers who know football, and especially Texas HS Football, I can imagine they will find nits and picks throughout, but for a modest football fan like myself, this movie was both entertaining and educational.<br/><br/>Possible Spoiler: This movie takes us inside the much-storied Texas HS football, and some of the football players of a top West Texas football school during one season in 1988. The reliance of Odessa on football is both breathtaking and sad in its necessity to the local economy, to the point that the coach is operating under a hammer constantly.<br/><br/>Considering the focus on the game, the characters are well-drawn and played. There were a few gaps, but nothing that detracted from the story for me. Derek Luke is a standout, as is, to my delight and surprise, Tim McGraw. But the performances Berg gets from all the young men playing the players is pretty terrific. And Billy Bob Thornton does the coach just right, understated tension throughout, just as you would imagine for this character, and yet his love of the game and the boys still shines through. Never preachy or over the top.<br/><br/>Editing is a bit choppy in spots, and emphasis on some games over others can be confusing, but this was minor to me. Also check out the soundtrack, it matches the story so beautifully and so surprisingly, really setting a perfect mood. The primary artist used was a Texas band called ""Explosions in the Sky."" (In addition, some of the top rap artists of 1988 appear in the soundtrack.) Peter Berg has been a director to watch, IMO, and this movie shows me he's really on his way."

","If you like high school football, this is a good movie to see. High school football is big in Texas. It's a movie about a team (Odessa Permian)trying to reach the class 5A state championship game. I personally, did not like the ending because it was not Odessa who played against Dallas Carter in the 1988 class 5A state game. It was a team from Converse, the Judson Rockets. Dallas Carter did win the game but forfeited due to ineligible player giving Judson state title. Other than the ending, the movie was good. I have seen other movies on football games but this movie is better, only if you don't know the truth on who really played in the 1988 5A state game. By reading this, you know now.

","Having played football all four years of high school, I didn't find it hard to appreciate the spirit of Friday Night Lights. Although my team never competed on the level shown in the movie, the atmosphere and emotions of playing on Friday nights is a universal feeling for all those who suit up for their alma maters. High school is the purest level of athletic competition there is in the United States. Here, the players still play because they love the sport and the thrill of victory. Friday Nigh Lights does an admirable job of projecting that raw passion and determination and making it utterly believable. Whether you were an all-state superstar or have never even watched a down of football, everyone should appreciate the aura of the big game and the impact that football has on the lives of these young men. I recommend Friday Night Lights not only as a good sports movie, but a fascinating and heartfelt look at the American dream and what it takes to be the best."
"slinger1999","Null","0","1","20 February 2005"," Finally a movie about high school sports that isn't a clichÃ©
","The thought that I had the most when I was watching this movie is,""this is way better than Varsity Blues."" I actually identified with these characters, mainly, because they are actual people with real life problems. The characters from Varsity Blues are your stereotypical teen comedy characters. You have your fat guy. You have your somewhat sensitive hero guy that has one problem that keeps him from succeeding, which is he doesn't want to go the same school his daddy went to. I can't even remember anyone else from that movie because you could replace them with anybody from any teen movie ever made. And of course, the ending tied everything up to where everyone was happy.<br/><br/>Friday Night Lights is different. It deals with the pressure that these real kids went through to perform perfectly. They have pressure from their coach, their families, each other, and the whole town. This town of Odessa, Texas lives for this team. <br/><br/>In most of the characters in this film, I could see parts of someone I knew from my own high school. There are great guys on this team, and there are jerks. There are heroes and there are disappointments. Everything about this movie has a sense of reality to it that no other football movie has touched. <br/><br/>There is something in the book that was hinted at near the beginning of the film but never really explored, that I wish were in the film. When they are eating in the diner and they get their food for free, it is because they are football players. What the movie doesn't say is that many of these guys were given that same treatment with their grades so they could stay eligible to play. I don't know if that would have been too many issues for this film to deal with, but I think it would have put an interesting spin on it.<br/><br/>One of the other things I loved about this movie is the score. It was written and recorded by a band called Explosions in the Sky, and they are an amazing instrumental rock group. Instead of the pop that most teen movies are filled with, these songs seem to be telling the story with sound, as most good scores do, but in a totally fresh and dynamic fashion.<br/><br/>Overall I would have to give this movie an 8 out of 10. Although the ending isn't a traditional Hollywood happy ending, there were a few scenes at the end that I felt didn't fit in with the rest of the film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone."

Did I miss something here? What's the big deal? A lot of high school teams (and kids) play football with heart. Would I understand it better if I read the book? The performances were okay, and the film was well made and exciting at times but where I'm lost is when someone went into a producers office and said ""I have a great idea for a film about a small town high school football team that has an okay season and loses a good player and then they lose the championship by a few inches, but they've won the championship before and they'll go undefeated in the next season.""

","Based on true events, a Texas towns obsession with their high school football team is quite a little story. It's also a sad story. I'm all for getting behind your local high school athletics, but my god, get a life. Billy Bob Thornton plays the beloved football coach with daunting task to get the team to the promised land, the Texas State Championship. The problem is that he can't just get the team there. He has to win the thing along with trying to get an undefeated season out of his players.<br/><br/>The players are all your typical colorful characters. The star player is headed to the NFL if he can just shrink his head a little bit and the supporters are all stock roles. But the film works. It works well because the writing is so good and the grid iron action is top notch. Somewhere in white trash USA, these people exist. Stores are closed because the owners go to the game instead of running their business. This is probably true in many places across the country. But in this film, the obsession is rampant. This town deserves each other.<br/><br/>The movie does tell a compelling story and the football scenes are exceptional. It reminded me of films like ""Any Given Sunday"", ""Rudy"" and even ""The Program"", a movie which I liked, but many others didn't. Billy Bob Thornton is made to play Coach Gaines. A man who understands the situation he is in, but also realizes that it's still just a game and this town needs to realize that. That is best stated in a scene where he is more or less threatened if his team doesn't get the big win while driving into town.<br/><br/>This is a top notch sports film with terrific acting and tells a compelling story very well. I just wish these people would relax a bit. (***1/2)"

It captures completely the rise and fall of emotions that accompany the life of any athlete. The movie feels like a low budget production that is like watching an NFL films production of an old Super Bowl documentary. The movie does not have the color and Hollywood feel of Any Given Sunday or the master performance of Jamie Foxx or Al Pacino or Dennis Quaid.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown actors render an awesome gut-wrenching performance. The movie is based on a real story. Peter Berg has made sure that it feels like exactly that. No glitz and glamor - just pure raw emotions in very real situations.<br/><br/>You go through the movie with a feeling of discomfort because you are not used to a movie being so real.<br/><br/>Watch it a few times.

It all culminates into the final game that will leave you stunned. There is a great metaphor to life in this movie and they deliver it well.

They did a good job of showing the contrast between the obsessive attitude that winning is life and death, and the realistic attitude that even though it sucks that they lost, life still goes on and it does actually mean something to know that they tried their best. It's not like their lives were wasted or anything because they didn't win the championship. But I couldn't ever really get INTO the movie because they failed to develop a character that the viewer would care about. This movie needed at least one well-developed protagonist, rather than a slew of distanced characters who are, for most of the movie shown to be, well... not very good people.

"TxMike","Null","0","4","21 January 2005"," Superb film profiling football in West Texas.
","A fine ensemble cast brings West Texas high school football to life in this film. Billy Bob Thornton is one of my favorite actors and he is Coach Gary Gaines at Odessa Permian, where all the locals, many of them members of one of the 4 former state champion football teams, expect him to bring home another class 5A state championship in 1988. <br/><br/>The fine young actor Lucas Black is Mike Winchell, the quarterback. Derek Luke, who was so good as Antwone Fisher, is Boobie Miles, the gifted runner who is destined for a great college and pro football career, until he is injured. Tim McGraw is the demanding father, Charles Billingsley, who rides his son who has trouble holding onto the football.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow. The film follows the 1988 season, where the team ended up in a 3-team tie for the district championship, and one team was eliminated by a coin toss. As Permian was one that went forward, we See that they won each game that led to the state championship game in the Houston Astrodome. That may have been a fictitious location, as one of the extras on the DVD appears to show the final game being marred by rain. Anyway, Permian lost to a larger Dallas team, but won the state championship the next year.<br/><br/>The film shows how these young boys had to grow up young, to handle the demands placed upon them to win. It deals with the relationships they developed. A fine 22-minute DVD extra shows many of the real members of that 1988 team, and what they have done with their lives. One went on to Harvard and is a successful lawyer. The interview with Boobie Miles is touching, as his knee injury cut his career short, and he really wasn't prepared for anything but football. he makes a point that young boys really need to get an education, have a ""plan B' in case ""plan A"" doesn't quite work out."
"TracyLauren","7","0","2","20 January 2005"," Shockingly realistic!
","As someone who grew up in Odessa in the midst of this crazy Permian football era, I was surprised at the reality of this movie. I had read the book before they made the movie and, like the rest of Odessa, I was very apprehensive as to the content of the movie. The book was extremely unflattering and exaggerated in many aspects. Yes, this town is incredibly focused on football, but the town does have other things going on. Odessa is a town with 90,000 residents and at the time, the population was about 80,000. There is another 5-A high school in the town, Odessa High School, though they have never made much of an impression for itself in the name of football. However, at this time when the oil boom had gone bust and the town was struggling to find itself among the ruins of it's money-soaked past, this team was a winner and it made everyone else feel like a winner when they watched Permian high school play football. There are oil derricks everywhere, but not in the middle of town, and Permian practices at the high school, not at Ratliff stadium which is on the southern edge of town. It would have taken Boobie Miles about two hours to jog to practice at Ratliff and about an hour and a half to get to the high school. <br/><br/>What I need to realize is that this is a movie and is fictional in many aspects. The book, however, is very questionable in many of it major points. Another thing to remember, after the season of 1989, Permian has not won a championship and has repeatedly failed to qualify for playoffs for the last few years. I did have the opportunity to see the 1989 Permian High School State Championship game at Texas Stadium that year. Those winning years of Permian high school will live with everyone in Odessa for decades to come. We may not all root for Permian, but those were also years that brought attention to a smaller oil town with not much to be overly proud of. Now, with the movie, maybe we will have a place in cinematic history as well as football history. <br/><br/>Now, millions of people across the world will know what we mean and think of Permian high school and Odessa, Texas whenever they hear the chant, ""Mojo!"""

At the beginning of the movie the lip sync was just off enough to notice...as the movie progressed the audio sync got worse...until half way into the movie the audio was about 1 minute behind the film...By the time it got to the final game it was about two minutes behind the picture. Obviously this is not the way to watch an entire movie, but for the final game the very delayed audio playing under the picture gave the whole final game a ""dream like"" or ""deja vu"" effect for a lack of better terms. If you happen to have NLE capabilities in your computer I highly recommend that you unsync the audio and video in this movie during the last game...It makes for an interesting show. I plan to watch the last scenes again in this fashion...and later I hope to get a copy that really works:) I thought the music soundtrack really worked well.

It's the ""winner take all"" mentality that many people hate; they feel as though prep sports should not be about winning, but more about having fun. It's time to face reality. To many high school athletes, winning is everything. Losing isn't meaningless; it's a million times worse. The emotion and pressure of high school athletics is on full display in Friday Night Lights. There are no heroes in this movie. There is no magical Disney-esque ending. Only hard-nosed, red-blooded, mortal kids playing for themselves, for their school, and for an entire town.

For every parent who comes unglued at little league, and dons the school colors of their youth at the hometown Friday night game, take a close look. A microcosm of America, this is a movie that portrays the American spirit and desire to win. It shows that the concept of winning starts early and is supported without excuse by every aspect of our society. We love a winner, at any cost, and this movie is a winner!"

","""Friday Night Lights"" is somewhere between ""Any Given Sunday"" and Leni Riefenstahl's lyrical documentaries of Fascist gatherings. <br/><br/>While this view of high school football is not as over the top as Oliver Stone's treatment of the excesses of the professionals, the criticisms that glide by in sight and sound are drowned out by the competitive story of the sport and overwhelmed by the obsession that Texans have with their Glory Days that the movie not only captures visually, through talk radio and booster confrontations with the coach, but ends up being as seduced by as these fans. <br/><br/>I was personally horrified and disgusted at the money spent on huge stadia, teams and coaches - with none to spare on medical attention for the players-- but I didn't feel that came across to the guys filling the movie theater with their small sons (but then my sons were presidents of their debate teams). We don't even get to see how the academic side is doubtless being starved, which is only hinted at in the post script on how these players got on with their lives and in the fathers and fans that look to them to recall the peak of their youth, before alcoholism, stunted marriages, boring jobs, etc. <br/><br/>While evidently quite a few liberties were taken with the characters in the book for dramatic effect (particularly I would think the racial aspects, not having read the book yet), the personal stories of the players and their families are very involving. The young actors are very effective. It's nice to see Lucas Black all grown up from his child actor days in ""American Gothic,"" Southern accent intact. Newcomer Garrett Hedlund is particularly good in tandem with a very scary Tim McGraw, who is so strong that his character's post-game contrition doesn't balance out his abuse. <br/><br/>The females are pretty much only around for the pre-season and just disappear until they are cheering at the final game, which didn't seem completely realistic, particularly about high school. <br/><br/>While I know zilch about football and could not follow anything that happened at the games other than the score board, Peter Berg's in-your-face directing style grips you from the opening. The football games are shot ""Saving Private Ryan""-style, with excruciating grunts heard like bulls fighting for leadership of the herd (the sound editing should get an Oscar nomination), making the case that this is about testosterone given free rein. <br/><br/>The soundtrack songs are a good selection of hip hop as background for the kids and classic rock for the dads, though there's less country music than one would expect to recreate the Texas soundscape."

","There's a very good, if not great, film simmering just beneath the surface of this one. It's a story that tackles the reasons behind and the subculture of high school football, its fanaticism and why it's seemingly so essential to the survival of many communities.<br/><br/>Be it West Texas, upstate New York, western Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, high school football breeds an enthusiastic, at times rabid, fan base more zealous than anyone who dresses up for NFL games. Their passion spreads into the social fabric of their communities, which often quite willingly spend millions of tax dollars refurbishing or building new football stadiums, but are loathe to dole out money for classrooms, libraries or books.<br/><br/>That's what Peter Berg's film wants to capture. Unfortunately, Berg, who co-wrote the script with David Aaron Cohen, based on a nonfiction book by former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and Berg's cousin H.G. ""Buzz"" Bissinger begins well, but rapidly falls into the trap of almost every other high school football film and eventually gets mired in derivative clichés.<br/><br/>I've not read Bissinger's book chronicling the 1988 season of the Permian High School Panthers in Odessa, Texas, but I can't believe it would've received so many accolades were it filled with such conventional characters and scenes as this movie.<br/><br/>Berg and Cohen play loose with the facts - crucial moments in the film are made up - and wind up giving us something we've seen before in content, if perhaps not in style, in this genre. The writers obviously thought the changes made for better drama, but actually they wind up looking awfully conventional, if not downright hokey. Berg gives the movie a documentary feel - grainy, eye-level shots, hand-held camera for a sense of urgency. But, from what I've read about Bissinger's book, Berg might have been better served had he adhered more to the novel.<br/><br/>Clichés abound in Berg's film. There's the cocky star athlete who dreams of riches, alcoholic father living vicariously through his son, relative who ignores medical advice to further an athlete's dreams, improbable come-from-behind victory. None of this seems original no matter how slickly filmed it is.<br/><br/>Berg and Cohen don't spend enough time with the characters for us to truly care about them. We see plenty of Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), but his wife, Sarah (Connie Britton), is quite possibly the most underwritten role I've seen in a movie in years. It's essentially a nonspeaking role - she appears in several scenes, but doesn't get her first line of audible dialogue until about 80 minutes into the film, which is when we also find out the Gaineses have a young daughter. Britton's merely window dressing.<br/><br/>What's really interesting about this story are the underlying issues of racism among the citizens of the predominantly white town, their obsession over high school football and the pressures it puts on players and coaches.<br/><br/>Speaking of racism, I can see why some might be offended by the depiction of black people in this film. The Dallas-Carter football players, most of whom are black, are portrayed as brutes, their coaches as eager to play the race card. Also, the only questionable, and clearly bad, call made on the playing field in the important game is made by the black official.<br/><br/>The most interesting story element are the older men in Odessa, former high school football stars, who still cling on to their glory days, still wear their state championship rings, because those were the best days of their lives. Frankly, all this makes for much more gripping and intriguing fare than the gridiron and there'd be a lot going for ""Friday Nights Lights"" had Berg and Cohen cared to dig a little deeper. Instead, they opt to skirt juicy issues to concentrate on tired football-movie moments."

","I have been involved in sports my entire life, and one time wrote an eight minute persuasion speech for a speech tourney with regard to the overemphasis on winning in little league and interscholastic sports. The half-time speech by Thornton's character reminded me of how life is far more about losing than winning, no matter what the corporate control monsters say in trying to motivate you, and the speech reflected meaning to me. My almost 10 year old son, who hates to lose at anything, liked the movie, and liked what he saw as realistic--commenting without being parentally pumped and primed to say something. The sexual scenes were discreetly handled--at least I didn't tell the boys to cover their eyes--and the town football-junkies tooling about in their car also reminded of small-town football life and how it's approached with a zeal that goes beyond religious into irrational. I was glad to see that Coach Gaines won everything the following year, and it is my fervent hope that he took a baseball bat to the cars and mailboxes of the controlling football junkies thereafter. I have already recommended the movie to friends that I am confident will not only enjoy it, but relate to it, sports-wise and life-wise. T2T"

","It was refreshing to see a football coach that shows dynamics without 4 letter words. Billy Bob once again shows his skill and plays the coach well. The subtle work when he deals with problems and problem people are excellent. Director Berg's style is unique visually. I got the impression in some places at first that it was a student film with the odd angles and jerky camera movement - but it seems to put you 'in the film' with the action more than the more tame camera angles. Having attended Permian in late 60's and early 70's it was a real trip down memory lane too and seemed to capture the spirit of the game, the players, and the pressures. Great show of human effort and well done. The film was enjoyed by my wife too - and she is not a football watcher. Well worth experiencing."

","This movie was not what I thought it would be. Judging from the trailers (which obviously was wrong of me to do) I went in expecting something triumphant, along the lines of Remember the Titans. What I got was a film with a paper-thin plot, weak characters, and skull-crunching sound effects. The actors deliver uninspiring performances, the flattest coming from Billy Bob Thornton, whom I usually enjoy. The town portrayed in this movie is overdone, as a bunch home-on-the-range citizens whose lives pathetically revolve around the wins/losses of the local high school football team. There's really not much to give away, but don't expect to be given much explanation for what makes each character tick.<br/><br/>OK, this sounds like a bunch of negativity, but I was still entertained enough to sit through the entire movie. It takes a lot for me to walk out on a film. I enjoyed seeing Lucas Black (Sling Blade) and Lee Thompson Young(Disney channel's The Famous Jett Jackson), now all grown up, as the football players. Hopefully they're destined for bigger roles yet. Overall, this movie was mediocre at best. Good, (I use that term loosely) just not good enough."

I was worried the writers would depart from the book and put rose-colored holly-wood glasses on it and that the racism and athletics over academics would be glossed over. They didn't.

Those who get the allusion may be spoiled by the next line: The movie is plotted as a traditional Greek tragedy. And the central question: is the coach a hero or villain. A hero for allowing people to be put in situations where they could be physically injured. A villain for getting the team to the state championships.<br/><br/>And hats off to the cast and special effects that had great blood (the dislocated finger was great, too).

","There are many types of formula movies. A romantic comedy, a slasher, a thriller, the list just goes on. Sports movies tend to be formulaic too. Usually, it's the underdogs that rise to greatness through their coach. It also helps if the story is based on actual events. You see this played out in both directions. The bad is embodied in The Rookie, which sub came to the expectations of Disney. The other end of the spectrum is Friday Night Lights, which really is a formula but has the heart that The Rookies needed. Friday Night Lights will hopefully take its place next to films like Hoosiers as one of the greats about sports.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thorton is the football coach in Odessa, Texas. The town lives and breathes football and they want nothing more than for their team to take state. The players are average teenage boys. They want to win for the glory it will bring their school/town but also to get scholarships out of Odessa, which we see through the opening credits, is not a place anyone would want to settle in for life. Thorton usually plays roles where he appears magnified. He is usually the stand out because of the nature of his character. Here, he plays the opposite of that. He is the most human of all the people in the film. He is grounded and realizes that 'the only difference between winning and losing is how people treat you.' His performance is subtle and, although not as showy as, say, Bad Santa, is just as good.<br/><br/>For a fan of football, the movie does not disappoint. The plays are excellent and anyone who has ever watched their very capable team fumble time and time again will feel those same feelings when watching this. At the same time, it does not lack the glory of the kick-off return run for a touchdown or the fifty-yard run by the player that isn't even a running back. It is the perfect mix of reality and hope.<br/><br/>While Friday Night Lights specializes in football, it does try and add character development. It's nice but, at times, falters and you have to remember, this is not part of the formula that it subscribes to. In these scenes, the cinematography tries for the stylized chaos look but comes off more as chaos than something art made. I don't think that the level of film-making should decrease with the genre and so that makes the errors in Friday Night Lights inexcusable but still they have to be looked at as attempts to widen the boundaries of this type of storytelling and that is commendable. Most sports films like to have character growth and often accomplish about the same amount as 'Lights' but what is different here is how it is made a main priority to try and get across some motives at the same times show incredible, miraculous touchdowns.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending but will simply say that it is 'perfect'. It is perfect the way Billy Bob Thorton tells his players to be. He gives a perfect speech to his perfect players in a perfect film.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of *****"

","I am a huge sport fan and was looking forward to this movie. However, I was really disappointed in how shallow it is. Maybe it is just a sad commentary on modern America that winning in sports depends only on one's willingness to die for one's team and has nothing to do with how it is done. I assume that Coach Grimes actually taught his players something about the game and not just how to love one another. Why is that not included in this movie? At least in Hoosiers, we see Coach Dale as a teacher and not just a motivator. I came away with no sense of why Grimes is an excellent coach. He cares about his players and screams at them, but that is all. The well done part of this movie is the depiction of a community's willingness to spend too much money on sports while academics are ignored. This was done without any overt commentary or by beating us over the head with the views of the film makers. It was just obvious. We love our circus."
"bcherry089","7","0","1","23 October 2004"," Good film, but has its faults
","There's been a recent trend in Hollywood as far as sports movies go. The trend follows a basic formula, which is to get a B-list actor in the role of a coach, a bunch of college-age kids and a somewhat interesting story about a sports team to equal a good and successful movie. Recent examples of this have been 2000's Remember the Titans and Miracle (released earlier this year). Titans landed Denzel Washington as a coach of a football team, and Miracle featured Kurt Russell as the coach of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team. Friday Night Lights, based off the novel by H.G. Bissinger, has Billy Bob Thornton as the coach of a high school football team in Odessa, Texas.<br/><br/>Odessa is a small town where high school football is heavily emphasized. The players are acknowledged everywhere they go, and football is so important to these people that on every Friday night during the season, all of the stores are closed with signs that read something along the lines of, 'GONE TO THE GAME- CLOSED.' The film is about the Permian High Panthers' struggle to reach the State Championship. <br/><br/>What separates Lights from the aforementioned movies is that this movie focuses more on the players than on the coach. Instead of it being the story of a coach who brought his team together to do the impossible, Lights features Thornton's character as an average guy coaching a good team. The story is more about how playing football impacts the players' lives, whether it is a knee injury or an abusive father. This is one of the few areas where the movie failed. Although most, if not all, of the subplots were interesting, some were left unresolved, which is annoying after learning so much about these characters.<br/><br/>The only other area I can really criticize is the camera work. Most of the movie was compiled of quick shots, resulting in a frenzied feel to the movie. During the football games, this was great-the chaos of the game was accurately portrayed. This style of directing didn't work during the dramatic scenes, however, and often left the viewer in a state of confusion.<br/><br/>Overall, Friday Night Lights is a good way to spend two hours. The scenes during the football games were very well done and as a whole the movie was very interesting. I would give it a 7 out of 10."

You could see this in the way that he cared for each and every player on the team. The other factor that made this film enjoyable was its almost documentary style approach to the story. It almost looked as if you were looking at an NFL Films documentary profiling the team's season. However, the biggest plus for this film was the way it portrayed Texas' obsession with high school football. The old saying that describes that is that there are only two seasons in Texas, football and spring football. Also, the football scenes really keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.

The film stars Billy Bob Thornton, as the coach of the team, in a very subtle but effective performance, the focus is not on him, the film focuses on the players on the team, 3 in particular. The quarterback who is insecure about himself and is trying to be a leader, the star running back who seems to only think of himself until fate changes him, and the fullback that has a propensity for mistakes on the field, he has an abusive father that hates the way he plays. Without giving plot points which I hate to do, the film grew on me. It does have some of the typical sports movie stuff, the games the practices etc.. But most of it show how important the game of football is to them and to the town. Thew players trying to get out of Odessa thru football, playing their hearts out to get scholarships to college, but it is realistic in saying that most of the players wont make it out of the town.

"gregsrants","8","0","2","21 October 2004"," Simply put, the best football film ever
","Football movies. What would you consider to be the best football movie of all time? The Longest Yard? Rudy? Maybe Remember the Titans tops the list. Unlike baseball, football doesn't have the same rich history with Hollywood. Although there are superior films like Brian's Song and Any Given Sunday, it is movies like Field of Dreams and The Natural that always find themselves on top when discussions of the greatest sports films of all time comes 'round.<br/><br/>There could be countless reasons for this oversight, not least of which would be that baseball has a broader appeal due to its less physical confrontations. With football comes pain, the goal of infiltrating a core of linemen and tackling to the ground any individual with a ball in the most destructive way possible. It is a rough and tough sport that is played in any weather. No excuses. Baseball is more of a family sport. Take the kids. They will be board, but at least you don't have to explain why a stretcher has been driven onto the field to take a player to the dressing room.<br/><br/>Recent football movies have tried to focus away from the game to keep a diverse audience interested. Varsity Blues for example put a bunch of pretty kids in a high-school situation and spent as much time off the field as on the game. Unnecessary Roughness tried to become the Major League for football and The Replacements portrayed them as buffoons who bond together to win it all. A few minutes of the football match in M*A*S*H provided more drama than these duds.<br/><br/>But then H.G. Bissinger wrote Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team and a Dream about the Permian High School Panthers football team in the 1988 season. The story was focused on the game rather than the off field antics of young high schoolers. It was an instant classic and not only did Sports Illustrated and the talk show circuit begin to rumble about the story but also did his cousin, Peter Berg sign on to direct the motion picture simply titled Friday Night Lights.<br/><br/>Friday Night Lights follows the team for one season under new coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) who tries to restore the glory of the team's rich history. Gaines comes to the city at a high price, but his credentials leave the town encouraged and optimistic about the upcoming season. He is a coach unlike most we see in sports films. He doesn't try and reinvent the wheel, he doesn't give inspirational speeches that would bring a tear to Tony Robbins' eyes, and he doesn't get involved with the teenagers personal lives. When an overly abusive father (played with incredible poise and gusto by country music star Tim McGraw), storms onto the practice field to berate his sons ability to hold onto the ball, Gaines doesn't jump between them or try to help the young sufferer with advice or being a secondary adult influence. Instead, Gaines sticks to what he knows, and what he knows is how to coach a young football team.<br/><br/>Director Peter Berg does a wonderful job in keeping the movie on the field. As director of the misunderstood Very Bad Things and The Rundown, you can still classify Mr. Berg as fairly new to the other side of the camera (he has acted in over 25 projects), but you would think the camera was in the hands of a seasoned veteran as he captures the mood, the pulse and the crunch of high school football with the accuracy of the Elway bomb. Berg does have some side plots involving a dysfunctional family and a star runningback who injures his knee and fights with doctors and coaches to get another shot at fulfilling his passion, but for three quarters of the film, we are kept on the field  right there in the huddle and on the sidelines as the team fights its way through to the State Championships played at the AstroDome in Houston.<br/><br/>By keeping it simple, Berg has given us maybe the best football film ever. We feel the pressure of the young kids to grow above their years and compete against behemoths in a game that can leave you paralyzed or worse. We find out little about their backgrounds, but we are nonetheless interested in their progress and the outcome of the 'big game'. <br/><br/>So move over Field of Dreams and The Natural and try to hang on All The Right Moves, for there is a new football frenzied film that will find itself on lists in years to come and it is simply called Friday Night Lights.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"
"splat99","Null","0","1","20 October 2004"," Exciting and Revealing (Warning: Spoilers)
","It is often stated that high school football in Texas is unlike that anywhere else in the nation - that it approaches the status of a religion. This is amply demonstrated in ""Friday Night Lights,"" an exciting, yet in a way sobering, look at this phenomenon through the Permian Panthers of Odessa. <br/><br/>The obsessive importance of the team to the town is everywhere evident, from the small children following team star Booby Miles around (all clad in Permian jerseys with Miles' number), to the signs on every business in town on game night proclaiming ""Gone to the Game,"" to the unsolicited play-calling advice boosters and other citizens force upon Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton.) And the fact that literally everyone is constantly asking the big question: ""Are you going to win State?""<br/><br/>Also part of the atmosphere is the pressure put on the kids (after all, they are still kids, even the seniors) by coaches, classmates, neighbors and (above all) parents. They are expected to perform no matter what their personal problems might be. A seriously ill mother or an alcoholic and abusive father are no excuse for even a partial lack of focus on the gridiron. Most of these kids see the team as their only road to a college education, and thus a chance to get the hell out of Odessa. In a revealing moment, two players tell a third that he has it made even if they lose, because at least he has the grades - implying that the rest of them don't.<br/><br/>Or perhaps the rest have grades, but not meaningful ones. Another revealing moment comes when star running back Miles, being interviewed by so many reporters that you'd think he was in the NFL, is asked about his grades and answers, ""I get straight A's - I play football."" The downside of this all-too-common phenomenon is highlighted when Miles suffers a serious injury, and suddenly realizes that, without football, he has nothing to fall back on.<br/><br/>The town also looks the other way when students drink, and in fact encourage it, to the somewhat creepy point of thirty-year-olds inviting high school kids to keg parties.<br/><br/>The special treatment, however dubious, is secondary to the main story, a classic Cinderella story in which Thornton's small-town team makes a run towards the state playoffs and a possible shot at the title. I'm glad I did not know how things turned out in real life (the season in question was 1988) because the movie does an excellent job at keeping up the mystery - once the team has lost a game, the playoff shot is in doubt, and the suspense just keeps building as the season progresses. And you really want these kids to win - you become a fan of the team.<br/><br/>The football action itself is excellent - gritty, hard-hitting, exciting and realistic, if perhaps a tad too polished for a high school team (even a good one.) But it is among the best ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Thornton does a good job portraying the embattled coach, upon whom the town's hopes fall and who is subject to the kind of second-guessing usually reserved for the pros. Not to mention verbal abuse, in person and on radio, when the team loses (though I must admit that the plethora of ""for sale"" signs placed on his lawn after the first team loss is hilarious.) And Thornton's halftime speech in Permian's biggest game of the season is fantastic. Tim McGraw is effective and believable as the abusive father of one of the players, despite the seemingly limited range of facial expression he displays (or so it seemed to me. In any case, he has more facial range than Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris, at least.) But the real stars of the movie are the actors portraying the players themselves - all are quite good.<br/><br/>About the only thing that I found somewhat ""Hollywood"" was the instant reconciliation between McGraw and his son, once the latter (who has had a problem all season with fumbling) has a great final game. I love football - I miss playing it, though my knees don't - but the concept of one key ""big game"" performance canceling out a culture of abuse doesn't sit well with me, and seems far-fetched. (Relatives of the father/son in question have posted on the boards saying that the two have always had a good relationship, and that the abuse was grossly exaggerated if not invented outright. Which certainly supports my ""Hollywood"" view of this aspect.)<br/><br/>But overall, this is a marvelous film for anyone that enjoys football, and even, I'd wager, for those that don't. It's well-worth your money and time."

","Great story with minor flaws , none the less I can't wait for the DVD! As a native Texan, I'm very familiar with Odessa and the Permian Panthers, the MOJO as everyone calls them.....ask anyone in TX about MOJO and they know exactly who you're talking about, they've been making noise in the entire state for years. I was fascinated by the book and always wondered why nobody had made it into a movie....its a great story to be told and now we are able to watch the drama unfold on film. The movie is definitely an abbreviated version of the book and I wish they would have included a bit more back story...for instance, I would have liked to seen the game day ritual of some of the players involving a particular song from Bon Jovi....(those whom have read the book know what I'm talking about), and the story behind the Pepettes involvement with the players. I also wish they would have been more faithful to the game schedule, scores and game sites...some of those were just plain wrong! I do understand that Hollywood has their own set of rules when it comes to drama but true stories should be an exception and should be allowed to be displayed as they happened....an example was Boobie, when he got injured he left the team for good, he didn't travel with the team as the movie showed. Those were just a few things that I hoped would have been included and not changed...now the good things about the movie. I thought the MOJO fanaticism was captured well as evident by the towns people, and businesses closing shop and displaying signs ""gone to game"", the filming of the coin toss to break the 3 way tie, and that they captured the flat desert like landscape of Odessa(actual locations), the movie soundtrack was dead on, I can't get that little tune out of my head ...the movie was well casted, Billy Bob was believable as coach Gaines, Lucas Black which grew on me through the whole film was excellent as QB Mike Winchell...I had a lump in my throat on the last play against Dallas Carter when Winchell tells his teamates in the huddle ""this is for the state championship, I love you all man, I love you all"" that really was a defining moment and showed the camaraderie he felt for his teamates...the ending was sad but thats real life! Go see it, read the book....it will touch you hard. I've seen the movie twice and still can't get it out of my head."

","Friday Night Lights is a movie about a High School football team located in Permian, Texas. In Texas football is not just a sport, it is life. From the first day of pre-season everyone knows that anything short of bringing back the state championship will be viewed as a failure. The acting in this movie is good and brings a lot of emotion to the story. It is heartbreaking to see how the players lives are affected by the pressures put on them every day because they play for Permian. This could be on of the best sports stories ever told; I highly suggest checking it out. It will suit everyone's fancy. The soundtrack is great, with the music fitting every moment of the film. The football scenes are also fantastic. I gave the film eight stars."
"rosscinema","7","0","1","17 October 2004"," Berg's film shines with authenticity
","Just like ""Ladder 49"" this film is careful not to stray from it's roots and go overboard and instead remains focused on presenting itself in a completely realistic manner. Story is based on true events in 1988 where in Odessa, Texas the Permian Panthers are under pressure to win the state championship. In a small place like Odessa the areas events are centered around high school football and the ultimate glory is to win ""State"" and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is looked at very closely and if he cannot deliver a championship team his job will more than likely be in jeopardy. <br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>The young quarterback for the Panthers is Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) who lives with his unstable mother and he knows if he can show everyone how good he is it can lead to a scholarship to a good college and out of Odessa. Also on the team is Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) who has more natural talent than anyone but he loves to talk a lot and showoff and during the first game of the season he suffers a bad knee injury that puts his career in doubt. But the player that is really under pressure is Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) who is constantly being criticized by his father (Tim McGraw) to the point where he is actually slapped while on the field.<br/><br/>This is the third film that actor Peter Berg has directed and it's easily his most impressive and it looks as if he has a genuine career in directing. Berg has been getting better and better with every effort and not only does he stay true to the story without aiming for the extreme but this is a film that's visually interesting to look at. I've heard some call this the ""Black Hawk Down"" of football films and that's not a bad comparison because the look of this film is very reminiscent of something Ridley Scott could have made. The performances are also on the mark and Thornton gives us a coach that is one of the more intricate and human than we usually see in films. While Thornton really doesn't have one big showy scene in the whole film there is one moment that sticks with me and it's the scene where he knows he's being lied to by Boobie and his uncle when asked if he can play. They of course say yes but Thornton's eyes tell us that he knows whats going on but for the life of him he can't say so. Under Berg's direction this film doesn't try to be something other than a straight forward look at high school football and each of the characters are realistically portrayed to the point where we actually recognize some of them from our own lives. Some will say that this is ""The"" football film ever made and considering how carefully well made this is by Berg they might actually be right."

","I give this movie eight stars out of ten. Good story, solid writing, and a cast of good actors and actresses makes this a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>This movie is an adaptation of a book that actually chronicled a small town Texas high school football team that is consumed with winning the state championship. One of my friend who saw the movie with me was from a small town in Brazil. I did not know if she could relate to the story given that the subject is about American football but surprisingly she did because the theme is pretty universal. In her case, soccer was the fixation for her townspeople so she could relate to this movie.<br/><br/>Given this movie is based on a real event, the story is gritty and realistic. The football action scenes were just great. Even if you are not a fan of American football, like my friend stated, the theme presented in this movie is universal."

I mean, the only other, good, realistic football movie I've seen was Remember the Titans which I thought was worse. <br/><br/>This is also the only movie where I liked Billy Bob Thorton's acting. The Football genre is poisoned by movies like The Longest Yard, which they are making a remake of and will not help Adam Sandler get back on track with making ""good"" movies, and The Replacements filled with horrible cliques. I think it is about time that there is a good football movie made. If I had to rate this, I would definitely give it a 5/5."

","Some folks in Texas take their high school football seriously - very seriously - almost to the point where it becomes a religion. If you thought Indiana was a tough place to play basketball, ""sir, you ain't seen nothing' yet."" You better be ready to let it all hang out if you intend to play football in Texas. <br/><br/>This is a film about high school football, Texas-style. It's big, mean, and hits harder than a Mack truck spiked with nitrous, in a manner folks at ESPN would have been proud to have produced. It's seen from the viewpoint of what it was like, during one season in 1988, to play football the way it was not meant to be played. A game taken to new heights, and new lows, for a town absolutely in love with nothing' else but football. Vince Lombardi said, ""winning is an everyday thing"", but in this town, it's the only thing that matters. Come hell or high water, on Friday nights, either you win or you better start packin'. Kids here are expected to be men. Colleges from around the universe are all here to watch high school football and everyone knows it's the only way out of town. Kids' dreams are made and broken for a Division 1 football scholarship and then on to the NFL. The college scouts know it, the town knows it, the parents know it, and the kids dream it. But in life, just like football, they play the game and sometimes things work out and sometimes they take unexpected paths, and sometimes they don't work out. You never know, which is why they play the game. And they play it in Texas on Friday nights, under the lights."
"randy512tx","9","0","1","18 October 2004"," Very good movie, I think it left out some important information.
","In 1988 the American oil industry was in shambles, oil was less than $20 a barrel and it was cheaper to buy it from Kuwait than it was to drill for it.<br/><br/>Odessa was an oil exploration center in west Texas. The jobless rate was very high. So I think the pressure was even greater on this team because the whole self esteem of the town was in this team instead of the oil business and related industries that used to support them. Midland/Odessa was the smallest area to ever have a mercedes dealership because of the money being made in the late seventies and very early eighties. I think it accurately captured the amount of pressure put on those 16-17 year old boys.<br/><br/>Football in Texas is very important, and the more rural the town, the more important it becomes."
"sonic345","7","0","1","17 October 2004"," Desperation in Odessa, c. 1988
","Overall a good movie that will hold your interest. This movie was at its best painting a picture of the hold that High School Football has on smaller Texas towns. Presumably, what happens at Odessa is not dissimilar to what goes on in other Texas towns.<br/><br/>The overriding theme of the movie was desperation. Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton in a very good performance) expressed this best when he said that he felt no difference between winning and losing personally - the main difference was how people treated you afterward (which, really, could have defined the entire movie.) <br/><br/>The students' perspective were best represented predominantly by three players: Winchell (Lucas Black), Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) and most of all Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). Each of these three players came from a single-parent (or in Boobie's case, uncle/father figure) household where they were the only child; in each case, the parent was basically trapped in Odessa and silently (or not-so-silently) banking on their son's success as a last, best hope to help pull them out of their hell. <br/><br/>None of these kids were having fun. Between the expectations of their parents, and the town, it is thus not surprising that neither player was having fun, Boobie's boasting notwithstanding. Here, the relevant quote that sums everything up was Winchell and Billingsley's response to one of their ""candy-striper"" teammates, Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) who tells them to ""lighten up, you're only 17"" - to which they both reply, ""I don't feel 17.""<br/><br/>After the first scene, the movie all but ignored Winchell's relationship with his mother after the first scene. The other two parent-child relationships, however, were depicted vividly. Billingsley's relationship with his father (Tim McGraw in a solid performance), an alcholic former gridiron champion for Odessa was captured well - specifically the vacillating of drunks between abusiveness, remorse and compassion toward their loved ones. Most memorable was Boobie's relationship with LV. We see both men's total devotion to each other (at times, even to the other's detriment). Most of all we see this towards the end when Boobie realizes it's over, he is crying because he wanted to take care of his uncle, and because of his injury he won't be able to. For all of Boobie's bravado and braggadocio, we find he was just as vulnerable and desperate as everyone else, and maybe more so. (For that matter, there's also a telling scene where reading letters from college recruiters, he has trouble reading the letters, and specifically the world ""distinguished"".)<br/><br/>The football action, I think, was designed primarily to appeal to action-movie fans and not necessarily football fans. As someone who is a big football fan, who watches a lot of football, I can say that some of these plays, simply, don't happen. The ebb-and-flow of some of the games (especially the final game) was a bit odd - you're watching, and it goes from being a four-touchdown blowout to a tight, two-TD game and it is not really clear how it got that way. Not to mention that considerable liberties were taken with Odessa's season, as well as with some of the players (their progress in the state tournament, the circumstances behind Boobie's injury, etc.) Not that it wasn't entertaining, or that people won't enjoy it, but to me it just seemed embellished and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most memorable scene for me, was when the players were walking in the tunnel onto the field in the Astrodome for the championship game. They're walking in the plain, beige-painted cinder-block tunnel, and then, all of a sudden, they walk onto the field of the packed Astrodome - 55,000 strong - and you just say: ""Wow. So THIS is what it's like to play in a big stadium, for it all."" That to me is easily the single moment I'll remember most.<br/><br/>This movie also got a lot of the period details right - most of the music that was played was all relevant and popular in the period the movie was shot (fall 1988); they also got the fashion right, for the most part (i.e., Coach Gaines wore a Members Only jacket to the championship game, Boobie's Public Enemy jacket, etc.) The little touches are there in the Astrodome as well; there appears to be the word ""OILERS"" (or ""HOUSTON"") written in each end zone in the Oilers' old Columbia blue and font; there's even a quick shot of the Astros' 1980 NL West pennant. Finally, there is also the obligatory ""where are they now"" sequence at the end; much of what happened to these individuals I found quite surprising.<br/><br/>On the whole this is a good movie that I enjoyed. Go see it.<br/><br/>7*/10."

","I loved this film. I grew up in West Texas ( El Paso), played Texas high school 4-AAAA ( now 5-A) football and had the fortune( or misfortune..!) to see the MOJO machine in action. I am an aspiring coach here in GA, and Billy Bob Thornton does an excellent job of playing the immortal Permian Head Coach Gaines. The play-off scenes are a tad confusing and I would have liked a little more history of the Permian Panthers scrolled at the first of the movie such as the scrolling they do before ""Red Dawn"" and other movies based on an event relating to its history. The actors who played the Permian football team were outstanding. While somewhat controversial, West Texas football is the real deal. My kudos to author H.G. Bissinger, who wrote a fabulous story. It is my all time favorite book. The movie does a good job of ""demonstrating"" the ""reality"" of the players of the Odessa Permian 1988 football squad."
"drtturner","Null","0","1","17 October 2004"," Titians wanna be that fumbles and ultimately gets shut out
","I went into this film hyped as I had heard so much about it and as a movie buff I had actually resisted my urge to frequent the fluff of the past 2 months waiting for something special. On the edge of my seat with anticipation, it soon became evident that this film could not deliver the goods. Ironically the stars of this, one of my years worst films, have each starred in two of my favorite films of all time. The Antwone Fisher guy, plus the lead actor looks like the little ledwicky clan leader of the film ""War"" all grown up. The Antwone guy does an imitation of Tyrell Owens or any other cocky jock, but this is not any inspired performance as we saw that best when another guy said ""Show me the money."" The pace of the film was weird at best. The state of the art multiplex I saw it in had distorted sound for the first 5 minutes, however considering 30 minutes of shabby pacing I couldn't tell you if the initial sound disrortion was<br/><br/>a theater problem or just another short coming of a bad film. With regard to pacing, within the first few minutes we fast forward to where the guys are just being guys grabbing soda pops and trying to make out with their choice of girl. Before we know it, in the absence of any real plot or character development, the team takes the field and we are suppose to care who wins...why ? I found myself getting aggravated that the audience is suppose to cheer for the team simply because they have the screen time and are not exactly quite the bad guys. After curling up and trying to bare it and see if it would get any better, I noticed that the entire theater was only politely sitting by and watching, far from what is expected from a sports film. I ended up, finally, leaving and going to catch the end of another film as I could take no more by about the 50 minute mark. If you want a real homage to ""Remember the Titans"", ""Radio"" of course is one, however there is a little DVD gem called ""Unshackled"" with the common theme of integration although the sport in this case is basketball. If you get that film you are in store for a treat. ""Unshackled"" has an alumni of ""Titans"" playing the hero this time as opposed to the antagonist as he did in that film."

","Excellent movie, Billy Bob Thornton does a very convincing job portraying the coach and the young players are surprisingly good as well. I read the book twice and these are pretty much as I imagined the players being. <br/><br/>It's actually a movie about community and how football brings them together but also causes conflict between them. <br/><br/>This film could be seen as an indictment of sports in our society. I disagree, as I feel that having these kids and this community channel their energy towards football is probably better than some of the activities they could be channeling it towards. It's not like if these kids weren't playing football they would be studying to be Rhodes Scholars, that's not the place they live or who they are. Football will keep some of these high-testosterone kids in school long enough for them to find out how important an education is. <br/><br/>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, as well as possibly the best football movies I've ever seen. I think this film will get better them more times I watch it."
"dweezil44","9","0","1","15 October 2004"," One of the best football movies in a long time
","This movie is more than a story about a single football team or a single season. It realistically captures the spirit, pressures, expectations and emotional charge related to small-town athletics.<br/><br/>In Texas, high school football is a big deal. Really. Over one and a half million Texans are attending high school football games every Friday night in the fall. For some small towns, their greatest source of pride is, for better or worse, their football team.<br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" captures that spirit in an almost documentary form. The pressure parents place on the players. The pressure the town leaders put on the coach. The emotional roller coaster is palpably present as the team overcomes obstacles in pursuit of the state football championship.<br/><br/>A great movie.<br/><br/>One final note -- I found the original commentary by johnwstiles disappointing. The reviewer notes he is not even much of a football fan, and that perhaps this is why he didn't like this movie very much. Understandable, and I applaud his honesty. However, it seems unfair to make the lead review one by a person having that bias. This was a great movie, and Mr. Stiles review is unfairly critical."

","(Spoilers ahead) Ironically, the spoiler is that the outcome of the big game is not what you would expect, and one of the major credits of this film is the unexpected but totally believable ending. I am so sick of manufactured plot twists that an unexpected but justified ending is especially satisfying.<br/><br/>Notice that the reason the Mojo lost the game was a bad call which had nothing at all to do with their talents. The decisive point was a mistaken conclusion that the other team had accomplished something when in fact they had failed. Unrecognized failure in the other team was the reason for the loss--and everyone knew it.<br/><br/>Some of the plot elements are familiar, such as the dutiful son sacrificing his future to take care of an ailing parent (I Never Sang For My Father is one example); and a son failing to live up to the expectations of a domineering father (The Great Santini comes to mind), and an adult who is trapped in his adolescence (Lifeguard, for instance). All of the themes were familiar, and possibly were done better in other movies. But regardless of the familiar territory, I can't deny that this film was powerful, exciting, and touching.<br/><br/>I don't know the ""true"" story, and can't comment on the film's fidelity to it.

","This movie is evident that Peter Berg, the movie's writers and producers are A LOST CAUSE...UNFORTUNATELY, I'm sure there are those in Hollywood even worse. As a high-school football player during that era and being well familiar with both teams that year, I couldn't agree more with those who feel the movie was a Big Fat Lie. <br/><br/>I understand the need to edit causes some false accounts to exist in a fact-based movie. This movie, however, went too far. I particularly can't believe the portrayal of Dallas Carter's Coach Freddie James. Anyone with any knowledge of high school(or football for that matter) in Texas knew he was well-respected and well-admired. Considering the fact that theie are those who are still mourning the man's sudden death a few years ago, to see his greatness portrayed so ugly was absolutely pathetic on the part of the filmmakers. I couldn't help but watch in disbelief. It's equivalent to making a movie about Duke University's Basketball Team and Duke not winning a game in the school's history; far from the truth. Legal action by Coach James' family would definitely make sense."
"classicsoncall","9","0","2","12 October 2004"," ""You have to look your teammate in the eyes.""
","There's an uneasy ""is that all there is?"" subtext running throughout ""Friday Night Lights"" - it's there in the pre and post game revelry; it's there in the storefront ""Gone to the Game"" signs; it's there in the radio talk show snippets that alternately proclaim and shred the embattled coach, and it's there in the memories of those who either once lived or who want to live the dream of winning a championship. When I view a film like ""Friday Night Lights"" I'm more interested in the characters and their motivation than in the outcome of the big game, and on this score the movie delivered in a big way.<br/><br/>For Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), winning the state championship is not an option, it's a matter of where he and his family will live next year. The followers of the Odessa-Permian Panthers take their football seriously, as do all the fans of all the football teams in all the towns of East and West Texas. In that regard, the movie realistically depicts the rabid and obsessive fervor that grips the town on game day after game day.<br/><br/>For the players, it seems that there is no time to relax, and life outside of football is virtually non-existent. Team quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) is in the game because he has the talent, but it's never quite clear that he even likes to play. Running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) has an ingratiating charm, you'd like to smack him for his cockiness, but he puts points on the board. Receiver Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) faces a tougher opponent at home than he ever sees on the football field, his father (Tim McGraw) is a one time football champion himself, who can't crawl out of bottle or the memories of his championship season. When Don drops a pass in practice, the father's reaction is one of rage and humiliation, so much for positive reinforcement. <br/><br/>The movie follows the Permian Panthers on the way to the final state championship game with all the highs and lows, wins and losses in between. It's a harrowing ride, particularly after superstar Boobie blows out a knee, and refuses to face the reality of life without football. After all, this was to be his ticket to the big time, pro ball and all the trappings that go with being a football hero. <br/><br/>The locker scene between halves of the championship game is a defining moment. Coach Gaines can get into his players like no one else can, and he finds just the right words to inspire his players to do the undoable. You just know how this game will end. Or do you?<br/><br/>For me, the movie succeeds in challenging the viewer to re-evaluate one's concept of winning and losing, knowing that when the game's over you have to be able to look your fellow players in the eye and know that you did everything you could for the team. And once the game is over, the game is over, there's no going back and no do-overs. In that respect, it's a lot like life."

","Friday Night Lights is a terrific film about the 'professional football' atmosphere that surrounds high school football in western Texas. Billy Bob Thornton is outstanding in his portrayal of Coach Gaines, leading the Odessa-Permian High School team.<br/><br/>The players are believable, as is most of the action. The background story lines are executed perfectly, and Tim McGraw, playing the father of current player who was once a state champion football player at the same school but now is just a bitter drunk, steals the film.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film happens near the end. Trying not to give the ending away, there is a critical play in which the team needs 7 yards for a first down, and is 8 yards away from the winning score. They have no time outs left, and indeed they gain the first down. However, a holding penalty is called against them, negating the first down. The next thing we see is the clock winding down to zero, and the team scrambling to get one last play off.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: anyone that has either played football, or watched football, will tell you that on a holding penalty like that, the clock is stopped until the next play begins. So time shouldn't have been ticking away. I don't know who the technical adviser for the film was, but if it was someone with football credentials, the only thing I can figure is they were overruled by Hollywood types wanting a Hollywood ending. This, in my mind, is what ruins most sports films. Rather than trying to manufacture a Hollywood Ending, most sports related stories that are worthy of making a film don't need the classic Hollywood ending to be manufactured.<br/><br/>Because of this, Friday Night Lights becomes nestled into the third position on my ranking of all-time great films about football, with the original Brian's Song first, and Rudy second.<br/><br/>Still, if you are a high school football player, want to become one, were one, or know/knew one, this is an entertaining film. NFL fans, watch for Detroit WR Roy Williams as an assistant coach with Midland Lee, and watch for New England CB Ty Law as a wide receiver with Dallas Carter in the championship game."

I thought billy bob thornton did a great job as the coach and i loved his speech towards the end of the movie. Also, i was shocked to see tim mcgraw in the movie but he played billingsley's abusive father very well. I know the ending isn't what it's expected to be but the movie wraps up well without it. I encourage people to view this movie and form their own opinions."

","They could have gone a dozen different directions with making a movie on the book, but I think they chose the best. They cut out the racism. The n word was only used once in the movie. There were a couple of other enhancements, but I don't want to go into much detail without ruining the story for anyone. If you have seen the movie and don't have time to read the book, then I encourage you to go to SportsGuy.net to see where they analyze what's in the book vs. what's in the movie. There's good stuff there. I love the portrayel of Coach Gaines, QB Mike Winchell, and Boobie Miles. There's really not anything I do not like about the movie. Even the party scene with the booze and women was just enough for you to get what was going on with those kids and it was not so bad that I didn't mind letting my 13 year old see it. Oh... and they nailed dead-on the intimidation factor of Dallas Carter and their fans."

","Obviously Mr. Oshram-3 was not born or raised in Texas. You just don't see and understand what a sissy la la movie Varsity Blues was. This Hollywood style sham of a Texas setting is not even in the same caliber as ""Friday Night Lights""! You refer to the fact that we have no central character to follow, well let me tell you as a former Texas high school football player, this movie and this book is all about the TEAM concept. And this film echoes that sentiment perfectly. It's an ""us against them"" type personality. Unless you grew up in Texas or found that kind of commraderie from playing sports you won't ever understand. James VanderGEEK is not even believable as a real quarterback. His arm motion and mechanics is completely off. As far as the character Boobie Miles being a jerk- well congratulations you WERE paying attention. He was big headed and egotistical. This is what usually happens to a 17 year old who has been courted around by colleges like he's the prized turkey at Thanksgiving. We put our athletes on a pedestal whether they're 17 or 37 (Deon) and they believe what they hear. Friday Night Lights is terrific and displaying this. Although it could have shown more about some of the racism that we read about in the book, it's perfect in staying true to it's book form. (I admit some artistic licensing was taken in showing the Panthers play against Dallas Carter in the finale. It was actually the state semis) But what are you thinking O-scram! You think all stories have a perfect Dawson's Creek ending. That's what playing high school football in football crazy Texas is all about. When I read the book in 94 as a youth playing back up wide receiver for our horrible south Texas football team I became inspired. I would plead for the day this story could be seen on the silver screen. But first, gay ass Hollywood had to come in and put those homo's VanderGEEK and Paul Walker in that bomb ""blues"" You don't know what your talking about O-SCRAM 3. ""Friday Night Lights"" is a definite must see."

"george.schmidt","Null","0","6","11 October 2004"," Glory Days
","Friday NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) *** Billy Bob Thornton, Derek Luke, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Tim McGraw, Connie Britton. (Dir: Peter Berg) GLORY DAYS I may be in the minority but I just don't follow football (or sports in general for that matter) basically since I never had any athletic ability in high school (or before or after my duration thereof) but I do know it's even more popular now then it was back then. Frankly speaking I hated pretty much all sports and never got the jock mindset. What makes things difficult for me now is actually paying for a ticket to see any film with a sports theme to it and I rather grudgingly went to see this expecting to not like it. Well I am glad to admit I was wrong. For the most part.<br/><br/>Based on the true life account of the 1988 The Permian High Panthers squad's struggle to become state champs in Odessa, Texas and on H.G. Bissinger's book the film focuses on the fair yet tough coach Gary Gaines (a transfixing low-keyed turn by Thornton) who must face tough scrutiny by the locals, the school and his own team who all live, breathe and abide in the sport as a true way of life in the Nowheresville persona of the town.<br/><br/>Among the players that are portrayed are star Boobie Miles (Luke who made one of the most auspicious debuts in recent film history in ANTWOINE FISHER), a big mouth who does more talking than working out since he is under the assumption he's God's gift to football (his arrogance soon gets the best of him when in the first game he is severely injured); Mike Winchell (Black who co-starred with Thornton in SLING BLADE), a quiet yet determined star quarterback, who wants desperately for a scholarship as his ticket out of his Podunk town; and running back Don Billingsley (Hedlund) who must deal with his humiliating, bullying alcoholic father (country singing superstar McGraw pulling a Dwight Yoakam in his big-screen debut) Charles, whose nasty tirades are fueled by his living past glories as a football hero vicariously thru his rough around the edges progeny with some truly repugnant behavior (he makes Robert Duvall's character , THE GREAT SANTINI, look like Mr. Rogers). The trio all learn some life lessons as the season progresses in an uphill battle to achieve their dreams to become state champs and bask in their historied glories.<br/><br/>For the most part actor turned director Berg (THE RUNDOWN) has a good eye for keeping his camera fluid, non-stop in its breathless, bone-crunching action and pell-mell editing techniques work to full-tilt, visceral effect conveying the fierce violence and threat imposed to each and every play on the field.<br/><br/>He also smartly lets his characters develop nicely never going for a cheap emotion or hamstring the deft script he co-wrote with David Aaron Cohen.<br/><br/>The only thing that prevents me for giving this a slightly higher grade may in fact be my personal feelings specifically of just how over-the-top the nation is in its regards to football as the be-all-end-all of what it means to be a man or more precisely how to be macho. I just hate that mentality and of course Berg deserves props for depicting just how insane one small town has a fevered love for the game by any means necessary; it's just my opinion what is so wrong about the good IL' USA  you're nobody unless you're somebody."

I cried throughout the movie and especially at the end....when the the teamates said goodbye!!!<br/><br/>It's been over 40 years since I taped my ankles and put on the pads but each and every football season the fire shines bright in my heart. Football is a special game and one that changes boys into men, men that they will become as they travel down the road of life. I owe all my success to loving and playing football, the values and discipline have remained with me to this moment. I usually never write replies like this....however after the movie and I finally wiped away the tears I had a catch with my youngest son, I still could lead a wide receiver perfectly.....he caught ever one of my throws in full stride, when I attended my 40th reunion, our first and only one last year the guys all wondered why I never made the NFL....another story but maybe in 2005 I will make history as the oldest (60) year old guy to play in the pros's. I plan to tryout and make an ARENA football team....how's that for a movie script Mr Berg.!!! The movie is hopefully going to get a nomination for best picture, and Billy Bob should get the nod in the best actor category, but the supporting cast and the screenplay are also spectacular.

","I read the book and was amazed at the craziness that went on around this program. I wanted to see the movie and ""see"" the craziness. I was not impressed. It was a ""good"" movie - just not what the book deserved.<br/><br/>Boobie was not as lovable as the movie makes him out to be. Chavez was a deeper story, I think. Winchell probably didn't deserve that much of a story. Billingsley was only that major of a character in the book due to the way his school day went but on the movie his dad was a major player in the story (I wonder why? Did they pay Tim McGraw big money or something??)<br/><br/>I was disappointed because the parts that stood out in the book (a high school spending $70K for plane flights, an English teacher with 25 years experience making $12K less than a guy that coaches football, students getting answer keys with their tests, sophomore girls wanting to sleep with all of the stars...at once...and take Polaroids, etc.) weren't even touched upon on the big screen.<br/><br/>It could've been made SO MUCH better - but it's worth the $2 rental at Blockbuster."

","OK...here are the FACTS!<br/><br/>Odessa Permian was great. The stuff about the regular season and the coin-flip were DEAD ON!<br/><br/>But...they DID NOT PLAY Dallas Carter in the State Final. They met in the State SEMI-FINAL. And the game wasn't in Houston, it was in Austin. Dallas Carter won that game 14-9.<br/><br/>See the following from Dallasnews.com<br/><br/>Permian magic no match for Cowboys, 14-9 08:20 PM CDT on Thursday, October 7, 2004 <br/><br/>By JIM SOUHAN / The Dallas Morning News<br/><br/>Editor's note: This story originally appeared in the Dec. 11, 1988 editions of The Dallas Morning News <br/><br/>AUSTIN - Finally free from a month-long court battle over the eligibility of one of their players, the Carter Cowboys joined their attorneys and administrators Saturday and showed why their community has fought so hard in their defense. <br/><br/>Carter waded through metaphorically stormy weather - the game was played in torrential rain - and survived a last-minute comeback attempt by Odessa Permian, a team famed for dramatic endings and state championships, to earn its first state final berth. <br/><br/>Carter's 14-9 victory before 10,000 at Austin Memorial Stadium means the Cowboys (13-0-1), who had lost state semifinals in 1971, '75 and '82, will play Converse Judson (14-1) in the Class 5A title game next Saturday at noon at Texas Stadium. Judson ousted Houston Stratford, 16-0, in Saturday's other semifinal. Permian (12-3) suffered three losses in a season for the first time since 1968. <br/><br/>""We deserve a week without controversy,"" Carter All-America linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ""We're a bunch of 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds. This was not a good experience. We might look tough, but this was wearing on us.""<br/><br/>But Carter's passing defense and passing offense were just tough enough. This week, Carter didn't even need any of Armstead's late offensive heroics - like the touchdown pass he caught with three seconds remaining to beat Marshall in the quarter-finals. <br/><br/>""We said when we were sophomores that we were going to state,' said All-America safety Derric Evans. ""Now we're on top of the world.""<br/><br/>Permian took a 6-0 lead on a 31-yard, tackle-breaking run by tailback Chris Comer, but Carter made it 7-6 a minute later, with 2:18 remaining in the first half, on a 58-yard touchdown drive in which all 58 yards came on three Robert Hall to Marcus Grant passes. On the touchdown play, Grant cut over the middle, beat perhaps the only single coverage he saw all day, and hauled in Hall's pass, scoring untouched from 18 yards. <br/><br/>Permian took a 9-7 lead with 8:48 remaining in the third period on a 30-yard Alan Wyles field goal set up by Steve Womack's blocked punt. But Carter came back at the beginning of the fourth on a 27-yard touchdown pass from Hall to fullback David Jones, providing the winning margin. <br/><br/>On that play, the cornerback assigned to cover Jones blitzed, and when Hall spun out of that defender's tackle, Jones found himself wide open on the left sideline. He caught the short pass and sprinted between two defenders for the touchdown. It was the first time Jones had touched the ball.<br/><br/>Having scored 14 points, Carter's offense left the team's fate up to its defense, which wasn't a bad idea. Permian barely moved the ball on its next two possessions. Then, on the Panthers' last possession, they began on their 48 and reached the Carter 11. <br/><br/>But on the play Permian advanced that far, a Permian lineman was called for holding Armstead, pushing the Panthers back to the 36. Two plays later, on fourth-and-six from the 24 with 13 seconds remaining, Permian quarterback Mike Winchell, who was held to 4-of-25 passing, tried a short pass. Armstead knocked it away and Carter's celebration, which left a few tears on the watery turf, began. <br/><br/>""I believe our quarterback was better than their quarterback,"" Carter coach Freddie James said. ""I think that was the difference."" Carter's defense also had some a hand -- actually, a few strong hands -- in the outcome.<br/><br/>""There's been a black cloud hanging over our heads,"" Armstead said. ""But I couldn't see us going out because of this controversy, and I couldn't see losing my last high school game."" <br/><br/>Instead, Armstead and Co. have given themselves a chance to win Carter's first state championship. <br/><br/>I am VERY disappointed in this film. It is NO WHERE near the truth (and I understand that ""based"" on a true story does not mean ""true story"")."

SO is MOJO some kind of acronym?<br/><br/>OK, since I need to write at least 10 ten lines I'll talk about the movie a little bit. I thought that it was very good, but far from the best sports movie of all time. I think it is hard to call a movie the best when it is so sad. Yes, I know, the movie was based on reality and reality can be sad, but when you leave the theater with a frown on your face instead of a smile, do you really want to call it the best? I wish we could have learned more about the players, especially Boobie. I almost wish that this was a drama with football in it instead of the other way around. I definitely have to see it again tho before I make any further judgements."
"movieguy1021","9","0","2","9 October 2004"," Friday Night Lights: 9/10
","In February, I saw a sports movie called Miracle. I didn't like it one bit. It was basically a clichÃ©d, rah-rah-rah-go-America sports movie, with no purpose in it. With obvious reasons, Friday Night Lights will be compared to it. But there's a huge difference here. One's good, one isn't. Plain and simple like that. Every fault that was in Miracle is not evident in Friday Night Lights. Miracle focused in on the coach, yet tried to focus in on a few players, too. The result was a muddled mess, while here in Friday Night Lights, there is no central character, allowing the story to go in so many more directions.<br/><br/>In the small, poverty-stricken town of Odessa, Texas, all the residents have is their local high-school football team. The oft-state championship-winning team, headed by Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), is going for another state title, thanks to their big star Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). But the team goes through injuries, hardships, and others, as the whole city is counting on them to win the states again.<br/><br/>What makes Friday Night Lights so great is director Peter Berg. Most importantly, he takes a team that requires no sympathy whatsoever-they're state champions-and yet makes us root for them. How he does this, I'm not sure, but it's an amazing feat to accomplish. Also, a hand-held camera is used with great effect. It reminded me of Man on Fire used its camera. It kept on moving around and around, not being able to be still for a second, but here, it actually worked. It wasn't obtrusive, and it looked like it belonged. It wasn't nauseating at all. The camera also had a few ""novelty"" shots, as I'll call them, which are overhead shots, crane shots, etc., which worked will in the story and the movie.<br/><br/>What may be even better than the directing is the writing by David Aaron Cohen (based off of Buzz Bissinger's book). It may seem like a simple script at first, but then you can't place your finger on why you liked the movie so much. It's because the movie works amazingly well as basically a series of vignettes. Most scenes are short, or overlap each other, and at first seem to be pretty random, but they all fit together and make a coherent storyline. And then you realize that this is no ordinary football film. There's a bit of the slow-motion action shots, sure, and some inspirational music swelling up. But there's no central character, therefore, we can't say that the script deviated from the main character, which means that development would be lacking. We didn't find out as much as we could about these characters, but we found out enough. It's amazing how well a movie like this could work with stock characters, too. There's the kid living with a single mother, a kid with an abusive dad, and all of the above. Friday Night Lights focuses in on a few characters, lets us get to know them, and really works. We find out that we care about all of these characters, they're not larger than life or anything.<br/><br/>Thornton was pretty good, but he's not the world's best actor, so we can't expect that much. The best, though is Derek Luke as Boobie. His performance is credible, and after coming off the mess that was Antwone Fisher, he redeems himself here. Friday Night Lights is hard to talk about in words, but it's a purely cinematic experience, one that you must see even if you hate sports movies.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for thematic issues, sexual content, language, some teen drinking and rough sports action."

","Just came back from watching the movie and I think it will do well and in general it is a good movie... BUT after waiting for the movie for so long, after reading the book, I was left hoping for more. What did I miss? I missed several of the characters which were brushed over or left out. But mainly I missed the pageantry and in particular the band's music. You could hear ""Hawaii Five-O"" in the background once, but some of the psyche up songs(like Back in Black!), the PHS band, the cheerleaders, the pre-game school pep rally all should have been part of the movie. Where was the 'MOJO/RE-BEL' duels, where were the 'NO MO MOJO' chants... there were enough ""slow moments"" that I think a bit more of the passion of the school and all the football related activities should have had a part in the movie. Those who lamented that the PHS band had not been used in the movie, will not feel bad as the band plays basically NO part in the film.<br/><br/>I would say there was a bit too much 'Boobie' Miles at the expense of other characters. On the other hand the coach's character was expanded even beyond what I remember from the book, and the acting from Thornton was excellent. The game action sequences were excellent. And even though the music left me wanting for more, the music as the teams took the field in the Astrodome was EXCELLENT! I thought they treated the famous bounce pass scene very well. The social edge from the book ALMOST came out here, and in the pre-game meeting between the Carter and Permian coaches. The final sequences of the players falling short, but realizing they had given their all, were for me the highlight of the movie. I would have added a bit more importance to the end, when they talk about Permian winning State in '89. After all they were ESPN HS National Champions in '89, and you could have given an additional 'feel good' finish. At the theater where I saw the movie the lights were on and everyone was walking out when this finally came on the screen! Overall I recommend this movie highly, but I also recommend you get the book and read it. The book will have a harder edge, but it will also give life to many of the characters that the movie only skims over..."

This is the movie based on the 1991 Buzz Bissinger book about the 1988 Odessa Permian football season. (For the record, I am the play-by-play announcer for the Ennis (TX) Lions, and grew up in San Angelo, about 90 miles east of Odessa)<br/><br/>The movie portrays the small west Texas city as verrrrrry small, not the metropolis of 100,000 that it is. A lot of the movie was filmed at Odessa's Ratliff Stadium, a 20,000 seat facility with Safe Play surface, and a two-tiered press box. Filming was also done in the Houston Astrodome, and in Austin.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton does an incredible job portraying head coach Gary Gaines (now the head coach at Abilene Christian University). Tim McGraw has a breakout performance as Charles Billingsly, the drunken father (and former star athlete) of running back Don Billingsly (portrayed by Garrett Hedlund).<br/><br/>My favorite actor in the film was Grover Coulson, as L.V. Miles, the uncle of injured running back Booby Miles (who has a cameo in the movie as an assistant coach).<br/><br/>The football action is incredible, the play-by-play that is interspersed in the film is the most realistic pbp that I've ever seen in a movie, not the typical dumb commentary.<br/><br/>Fans will see what football is about in Texas, from the pressures of the citizens of the communities, to the large crowds that one will find Friday night at just about any stadium in Texas. <br/><br/>""Friday Night Lights"" is a must-see for any football fan."

As a former coach I thought Coach Gaines was an exceptional coach and portrayed coaching as it should be portrayed. I have worked in Odessa in the Oil Fields in the 1960's and the community was portrayed very accurately as their priorty on football seems to be a little jaded. The pressure of a high school coach in Texas to win is out of sight,they make in the upper $80,000-$100,000 range and the community expects wonders are they are fired.

"knicoboker","8","0","1","6 October 2004"," Good but not the best.
","I recently viewed the movie at a screening on the University of Michigan's campus as the Screenwriter was a Michigan Alum. Friday Night Lights was a good representation of what High School football is like, especially in a community where football is what keeps it together. I enjoyed the movie but it was too much about football, and not about the other important issues like race, and class, and gender. It didn't portray racism and the role it played in Odessa, Texas in the 1980s. There was maybe one scene in the beginning that touched upon it then maybe one or two more near the end. Not nearly enough for the amount of racism that was experienced in the late 80s in Odessa, Texas. The football sequences were heart-pumping to say the least. On the field there was non stop action, it was as if you were on the field with the players and coaches. However, the movie didn't fill the shoes that the critics left for it being arguably the ""best sports movie of all time."" Nonetheless it was a good movie to experience High School football first hand. Although the basis was like your everyday documentary, this contained some action, comedy, and even some drama. It was a very good sports movie, but not the BEST of all time."

","As a former football player and a huge fan of the book ""Friday Night Lights"", I was more than thrilled to see that the novel was being adapted as a film. I first read the book over 10 years ago and have read it a few times since then as well. The movie more than does justice to Buzz Bissingers novel, and I believe it will appeal to athletes and regular movie-goers alike. The shaky camera perfectly captures the essence of being in the middle of the action on the football field and while it does get a little annoying at times, it detracts almost nothing from the movie itself. The performances of Billy Bob Thornton as Gary Gaines, and Derek Luke as Boobie Miles are outstanding. You feel sympathetic for both characters and really get an understanding as to what they must be going through at particular stages of the season. Tim McGraw also gives an amazing performance for a first timer as former Permian star Charlie Billingsly, a man that exemplifies what is wrong with some parents living their dreams vicariously thorough their young sons. The action on the field is great and the individual stories being told for all the characters is played out very nicely. The only real criticism I have is that two of the main characters from the book have been given seemingly second rate parts in the film. Linebacker Ivory Christian and TE Brian Chavez are both amazing stories and I thought they deserved at least a little better treatment in the film. Overall though, there is not much to complain about when it comes to ""FNL"". I have grown up around sports being the son of a HS coach so I really love movies based on football. Some are good. Any Given Sunday, The Longest Yard, and North Dallas Forty come to mind. And some are bad. Little Giants anyone? All in all, I really believe that FNL will satisfy a wide variety of people and it is a movie that should not be missed. If nothing, you WILL be entertained for 2 hours."

","Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) leads his high school football team to the 1988 state championship game. The movie depicts the daily struggles endured by a coach of a high school team, especially, the Permian High Panthers of Odessa, Texas, the most successful football program in Texas, with four state titles. Every Friday night in the fall, the small town of Odessa comes alive beneath the stadium lights when the team runs onto the field. The 20,000 seats at Ratliff Stadium are filled with their devoted and loyal football fans. This is more than a game; it is a way of life for the town. This season may be the last time some of the players will ever put on a football uniform. For some, this will be the greatest moment of their lives. The players have dreams of stardom, and their parents dream of college football scholarships for their sons. This is a good football movie with a lot of real action. At times, it looked like the players were hitting like pros, not a high school team. The filming of the championship game will put you into the action. The halftime pep talk that Coach Gaines gives to the team on the subject of being perfect is inspiring. Everyone who played football in school will like this movie. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:57, Rated PG-13) (8/10)"

","A lot of the movie was full of foreshadowing. It was fun to watch and it was all based upon a real story. The entire town the team is from is one of those small town football towns. The local businesses close down for games, and travel many miles to got to the championships. It seems like half of the town has their own championship rings. When the star player is injured it's the responsibility of everyone to step up, and grow through their pains on and off the field. A really wild role for Tim McGraw, he was playing a drunken out of control dad who wanted his son to win. Pushing him farther and farther away from him. The whole movie was about dealing with ones abilities and disabilities and finding a role for ourselves.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is the typical sports related movie. A lot of pure stupid lines and Illegal tackles, penalties, nothing that could really happen without any kind of repercussions from the officials. Almost every event are able to be pretty much be seen from a mile away. The one player they flash on the screen the entire first 10-15 minutes, the one that no one can be without, and injury happens. The over zealous family member trying to push their son / daughter into the winners circle."

","For those of us who endure the suffocating zeal of Ohio State football fans or hear about the football obsession of small-town Massillon, Ohio, 'Friday Night Lights' is more of the same. Odessa, Texas, has little else but high school football given the poor economic times of 1988 and the barren world of remote Texas. But it's a true story filled with a game that defines the future of its players and the town, for whom there is little else.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton plays Gary Gaines, coach of the Permian Panthers, in an adaptation of a best-selling book by H.G. Bissinger about high school football ('The Devil's Own'). The Panthers have moved into the semifinals of the state championship but without their best player Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). Thornton underplays Gaines, with a few moments excepted where he berates his team. (The town, however, takes on the role of the rabid coach.)<br/><br/>The stereotypically abusive dad, a former state champion who won't accept anything short of perfection from his son, is complemented by the single mom who studies plays with her son but gives unconditional love.<br/><br/>At one moment, however, Gaines delivers the usual pep talk in a most unusual tone-one of conciliation and harmony, ascribing perfection to doing all you can for your team so that you can look each one in the eye with love. It's not about winning, he says, and I believe him for the sentiment and the powerful delivery of the Oscar-winning Thornton.<br/><br/>The cinematography is too jumpy and close for me for most of the film although those who know this vicious contact sport swear it gives an authentic sense of the up close and personal linemen and battered running backs. The music is harsh at times, maybe even too dominating.<br/><br/>Whether or not this is how the final game of the championship was played is less important than the insights the film reinforces. No one who loses can shake the feeling of personal inadequacy, no one whose livelihood depends on winning can have respite from fickle fans, and athletes who don't study will find themselves returning to towns like Odessa to retell their football story like the Ancient Mariner.<br/><br/>In 'Miracle' (2004) USA veteran hockey coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) knows it's not just a game, as his enduring wife (Patricia Clarkson) reminds him in the hours when he is most absorbed in game films and firings and neglecting his family. In fact, 'Miracle' is about this remarkable coach's vision that only the most grueling practice will prepare them for the best team in the world. He purposely at one point verbally beats them up.<br/><br/>The two films show different coaching styles but the same love of a tough game where its winners take abuse and admiration in equal measure. It's the true believers in the game who best define the drama: 'I think that I would still rather score a touchdown than make love to the prettiest girl in the United States.' (Paul Hornung)"

","Saw this movie as a sneak preview in cinema class yesterday and I was pretty blown away by the the action scenes as well as the story. Berg did a great job filming, lots of it is filmed with an unsteady hand cam type style which really draws you into the action. It is a touching story but not to the point of sappyness like Remember the Titans. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure how it compares but it is one hell of a movie. The acting is great as well, Billy Bob came into our class to talk about the movie and said that he didn't meet the real coach before filming because he wanted to have his own style, and he does. He does a great job playing a coach, very believable and he has so much talent. The kids are great as well, they do a very convincing job and will have a bright acting future ahead. Bottom line: if you like football or any kind of sports movie for that movie, you should love this one. Don't worry, it's not at all like Varsity Blues. Beautifully filmed and acted, I haven't seen as great or touching a sports movie in a long long time, it was like the emotion of Rudy but the action scenes of Any Given Sunday (but much better), I thought it made for a great combination. Go see it, it'll be a sports movie for the ages. As a side not, in the locker room scene when Billy Bob is giving the emotional talk to/about Boobie Miles, pay attention because the real Boobie Miles is standing right next to him, it makes it extra heart wrenching. Enjoy!"

","I am in a cinema class that shows movies before they come out, and I was fortunate enough to see this wonderful movie. Great acting by the young players, decent performance by Tim McGraw, and a great job by Billy Bob Thornton who plays the coach of a high school football team that the whole town leans on. Remarkable, and although far less grittier than the book, still a great performance and a must see for any football or sports fan. No spoilers, but look for the man standing next to Boobie in the last locker room sequence. It's not just other guy, but the actual Boobie that used to play for the team. Great acting, great movie, two thumbs up."
