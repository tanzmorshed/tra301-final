","«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' ""Sunset Boulevard"", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.<br/><br/>The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: ""The Artist"", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.<br/><br/>I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.<br/><br/>Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and ""The Artist"" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.<br/><br/>Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in ""Singin' in the Rain"") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's ""Silent Movie"", which was clearly a tribute. ""The Artist"" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.<br/><br/>If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so ""old"" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.<br/><br/>Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced ""The Artist"" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?<br/><br/>""The Artist"" plays like a missing link between ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'."

","As I waited for two hours in a long queue to watch this movie at the Mumbai Film Festival, I wondered why I was doing so much for a silent movie, of all things. Post screening, I'm ready to brave hail, rain or the super hot Indian summer sun and stand in a serpentine queue, just to watch this movie all over again. <br/><br/>'The Artist' is sure to go down in history as a must-watch. For those who want to study films, for those who pursue cinema relentlessly, and also for those who just watch movies because they just like to. If you're wondering why a silent film, the movie not only answers it, but makes you fall in love with the medium. it's clearly a product of a thinking director, where every thing in the scene has a story to tell. Whether it's the ironical film posters, street signs, or just a little dog barking quietly in the corner. <br/><br/>I don't need to comment on the talents. The Best Actor award at Cannes 2011 has done that already. I will however mention the four-legged supporting actor in the movie. Best performance I've ever seen so far! <br/><br/>Enjoy this movie. Add it to your collection. This is one movie worth upgrading to from DVD to Blue Ray to ..."
"RolyRoly","10","306","430","11 September 2011"," Marvellous; one of the best movie experiences you'll ever have
","The Artist arrived at the Toronto International Film Festival preceded by the accolades it received at Cannes, so expectations were high, but those expectations have been more than amply fulfilled. This film is an absolute marvel - charming, witty, surprising, moving, clever and beautiful. Filmmaking is about decisions, thousands and thousands of them, and everyone involved in The Artist makes every decision to perfection. The cinematography is ravishing in luminous black and white. The musical score, on which the film, being silent, is so dependant, is subtle when it needs to be subtle, dramatic when the occasion calls for it, and never overbearing or overwrought. The screenplay (yes, silent films do have screenplays) toys with the conventions of the silent era, paying homage to some of the greatest films of the first two or three decades of cinema history. The acting is flawless, extracting emotion and humour from a simple but classic storyline. The direction displays such self-assurance, and treats the audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue with the director.<br/><br/>The Artist is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I have ever had. It deserves a wide audience and all sorts of awards. I can hardly wait to see it again.<br/><br/>And oh yes, if there is ever an Oscar for best animal performance, the dog in The Artist should receive a lifetime achievement award for this role alone."

","This is a treat. Charismatic leads with chemistry and talent, in a love story that plays as a pitch perfect homage to vintage Hollywood features, whilst never tipping over into parody, and that's no mean feat. The period detail is outstanding: film stocks, tints, (heck even the frame weave), captions and montage are all on the money. <br/><br/>There's an evocative score, an imaginative use of silence, wonderful locations and costume. All rounded off by a top notch cast which includes a brilliant dog. Dujardin is every inch the charming 20's star and Bejo is sassy, surefooted and gorgeous. Go see this people. They do make 'em like they used to!"

","What a treat. I left the theater sort of floating. Delighted. A European film looking back at Hollywood better than Hollywood has been able to do for years. ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Singing In The Rain"" mixed in a glorious black and white cocktail. Silent, yes silent! But with a fabulous score and so much panache. Jean Dujardin is the revelation of the year. What a performance! Running the gamut of emotions, leaving us breathless, and if this wasn't enough, a rousing tap dance routine in the style of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell, partnering with the wonderful Berenice Bejo. I know that it's not just me. The audience applauded and cheered as the end credits rolled."

","I managed to catch a screening of this at Cannes, and if you're thinking about skipping this film because it's silent and black and white, you're going to be missing out on a very special experience.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is exceptional. The acting is top-notch, the story is intriguing, and despite being black and white, the film is visually appealing. The filmmakers really make great use of the medium, and even though there are no voices or color, my interest was never lost.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin gives a great performance. You like him instantly and, without giving too much away, you want him to succeed. This movie is really chock full of great actors and actresses. You'll see some familiar faces, but they all blend in well with the world of the film.<br/><br/>I really don't know a whole lot about the director Michel Hazanavicius, but after seeing this film I'm definitely interested in seeing what he does next.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!"

","I go to a lot of screenings and it is rare that once the credits roll I feel satisfied. One or more of the elements of most films just don't work together to create a feeling that you have been thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that this film DELIVERS! The acting is superb, the chemistry between all of the actors is sizzling, the comedy is absolutely hilarious, the storyline grips you and never lets go, the music is superb, and you feel emotionally connected with the characters and story.<br/><br/>If you check my previous reviews, you will see that I am most often moved to write a review when a film was really bad, but this film caught me completely off guard and I just had to express my overwhelming satisfaction with this filmmaking experience.<br/><br/>I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to try and finance a period film with two stars who were not well known outside of their own country. I am just overjoyed that it all came together. This is how film should make you feel when you leave the theater - entertained! To the entire production team - BRAVO!!"
"renzl","9","165","240","27 May 2011"," stunning
","Jean Dujardin deserved his Palme D'or for his captivating and wonderful performance. Where to start...this film is so clever, so beautifully crafted, so mesmerising. The lost art of the silent film is once again brought to life and that era is impressively recreated, whether it be the acting style, the sets, the locations (shot in Hollywood), the shimmering black and white photography. It is obvious to see that the people behind L'artiste respected that era of film making and wanted to recreate the magic with some modern touches ( I won't spoil them) and totally succeeded. I saw this in Cannes at an 8.30 am press screening and was totally entranced. I cannot wait to see it again!"
"SusanShop","Null","111","162","20 August 2011"," Brilliant movie making
","I have read that in 1895 the art of movie making began, allbeit in black and white and silent. It would be another 25-30 years until the second half of the 1920's before the innovations of Technicolour and sound would change how movies were made! Many of the actors in Hollywood were new immigrants, and dialogue coaches had not been invented yet, so when silents became talkies, many previously successful film careers were over. The European accents didn't translate so well. The Artist asks the question - how does one make that transition from silent to talkie? And then proceeds to answer using the silent/black and white techniques of those first pictures...absolutely brilliantly !! This afternoon I drove 2 1/2 hours (each way) to see The Artist at the Montreal World Film Festival. Being a fan of the silent film genre, I was watching for nods to those first stars of the silver screen. Some were obvious and some were more subtle.I want to talk about the picture so much, but don't want to give anything away. LOVED THE FILM - I may have to make it to the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September to see The Artist again !!It's worth the trip !!!"
"estebangonzalez10","9","20","28","10 February 2012"," As colorful as any black and white film could ever be!
","¨Look at what you've become. You've become proud! You've become stupid! ¨<br/><br/>The Artist is a beautiful film that pays homage to movies from the late 20's and early 30's, the silent film era. In order to do so, French director Michel Hazanavicius decided to make this film almost entirely without sound and in black and white. Many producers would've probably thought he was crazy for trying to make a film like this in these days where viewers are used to seeing spectacular and colorful movies with great sound and even in 3D. However, The Artist works perfectly and is one of the brightest films of the year despite being in black and white. The cinematography is spectacular (perhaps only rivaled this year by The Tree of Life and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), the costume design and editing are among the best of the year, and the score is also amazing. This is truly a beautiful film that many film historians will enjoy for the nice tribute it renders to the age of silent films. Many famous actors during this era weren't able to make the transition to the talkies, and that is exactly what The Artist is about, and it does it in a very simplistic but stylized fashion. The film has been nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Performance by a Lead Actor (Jean Dujardin) and a Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo). It will probably walk away with the Best Picture title considering how appealing the subject matter is to the Academy, and how well the film was crafted. Please don't be scared off because the movie is silent or in black and white because the story is really entertaining and despite being colorless it is brighter than any other film released this year. It is really worth a watch; you won't regret it.<br/><br/>The year is 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the height of his artistic career. He is a very successful Hollywood actor and producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) is very pleased with his work. After having succeeded together yet again in a recent film, they are already collaborating for their next project. During rehearsals for their next movie, George runs into an extra named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). They hit it off instantly sharing a dance number and George insists that Peppy should get the part. Pepper falls in love immediately with George, but he is married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) so their relationship is entirely professional. George gives Peppy the best advice she would ever receive: In order to make it in the industry she needs to be different and he paints a spot near her lip. This will be her trademark later on as she slowly begins rising to the spotlight during the arrival of the talkies. Valentin however, isn't lucky and realizes his days as a successful actor are coming to an end with the advent of these talking pictures. People want to see new faces and hear their voices. Al Zimmer realizes this and breaks relations with George, so Valentin decides to produce, direct, and star in his own silent film. The movie is a failure as people want to see these new talkies, and as Valentin's fame becomes to decline, Peppy Miller begins to grow into a superstar. Valentin is left with nothing except his faithful driver, Clifton (James Cromwell) and his Jack Russell Terrier named Jack. The times have changed for the great artists and fortunes are reversed.<br/><br/>The Artist is among my top ten favorite films of the year and it works really well, not only as homage to these silent films, but as a love story as well. Along with Midnight in Paris, these are perhaps the two best romantic movies of the year and would make for an excellent date. I've already mentioned some of the technical aspects, but now I would like to praise the performances from Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, and the dog (which was played in most part by Uggie). I can't leave out the dog, because he plays an important role in this film, and in a way is Valentin's faithful companion and savior. Jean Dujardin does deserve the Oscar nomination for his performance, he was terrific, and I think I enjoyed it over George Clooney's. If he wins, it will be well deserved. My favorite performance of the film however, comes from Berenice Bejo, who was also nominated as a supporting actress. She is just terrific and shines every time she's on screen. Her performance gives this black and white movie a lot of color. Both Bejo and Dujardin have worked together with director Hazanavicius in the past in the French spy spoof film OSS 117. I've never seen the movie, nor its sequel, but after seeing The Artist I'm very much interested in doing so. Overall this is a terrific film and one you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"dbborroughs","4","98","162","7 December 2011"," good but wildly over praised
","Sue me I'm not in love with the film.<br/><br/>Yes it's funny. yes it has some charming moments, but I can not for the life of me understand how this is the front runner for this years Oscars.<br/><br/>The plot of the film has a silent movie star meeting an extra at a premiere. Meeting again the next day on a set they are both smitten, but he's married. As her star rises, his begins to fall since he won't move from silents to sound films. However their lives remain intertwined....<br/><br/>I laughed, a had a tear or two but I wasn't blown away. For me the film isn't all the critics have said. It's not so much a loving homage to American silent films, its more a homage to some one's idea of silent films if they really haven't seen them. The pastiche's mostly fall flat feeling more like recreations of recreations (The only silent film that feels like a real silent film is the material they stole from Fairbank's version of Zorro). There are other problems with the historical things in the film, but they are not important since this is after all just a comedy.<br/><br/>To be honest the real problem is the film's short changes too much. Characters, such as our hero's wife are more cardboard than real. There is also the casting of people like Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell in roles that give them billing, but in reality are glorified walk ons (was stuff cut?) The plot also leaps through time not building to anything simply moving from moment to moment hoping that we in the audience will fill in all that isn't said.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I don't hate the film, I just don't think it's the nearly the best of anything of the year.<br/><br/>Worth a look but don't feel the need to fight the crowds."
"TheExpatriate700","6","52","82","3 January 2012"," Doesn't Quite Live Up to the Hype
","The Artist is a well-made if not particularly involving homage to the silent films of the 1920s. The film itself looks beautiful, and makes interesting use of its lack of sound. However, the story lacks interest, and is as clichéd as the silent films it pays tribute to.<br/><br/>The artist of the title is George Valentin, a silent film star caught in a loveless marriage to a petulant starlet. He gives a jump start to the career of actress Peppy Miller after kissing her at a premiere. However, he soon finds his stardom dwarfed by hers after the debut of talkies and losing his fortune in the stock market collapse.<br/><br/>The film is at its best when it plays with the whole concept of silent movies. The most impressive example is a dream sequence conveying the transition from silent to sound movies. Valentin dreams that his word, previously filled with a silent movie soundtrack, now consumed by overly loud background sounds. This may be the first time in cinematic history in which a dog's bark has conveyed the shift of an entire world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of silent films in general. Because of the lack of dialogue, The Artist ultimately has a simplistic story with largely one dimensional characters. To a large extent, the plot mimics that of A Star Is Born, focusing on a famous performer ultimately surpassed by his protégé. As a result, the film is boring and predictable.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film emulates the least interesting of the silent movies. Rather than focusing on the more experimental films that characterized the early years of silent movies, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and D. W. Griffith's work, it looks at the making of genre films. Given that The Artist, by its very nature, is aimed at film buffs with an extensive set of references, one would think they would give attention to more interesting films.<br/><br/>Still, the film's cast does a lot, particularly given the lack of dialogue. Penelope Ann Miller gives Valentin's harpy wife as much dimension as one can to such a one note character. John Goodman is also good as a dictatorial producer."
"curtis-8","5","65","106","30 January 2012"," I Don't Understand the Universal Praise
","I really don't get it. My wife and I went to see The Artist this past Saturday and I was left with an overwhelming feeling of ""meh."" Which is really surprising, given the almost universal, glowing praise this film has been getting--what with Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations, etc (not to mention all the 10-star reviews here on IMDb).<br/><br/>I just didn't see anything special here. I mean, they filmmakers did a fairly good job of recreating a silent film, but they didn't take it any further than that. The plot, acting, etc, was no better or worse than a real silent film. I've seen many much, much better silent films on TCM's Silent Sundays each weekend. Those who are gushing over this movie have apparently not seen very many real silent films from the 20s. If they had, I think they'd have found this film kind of a ""been there, seen that"" kind of experience as I did. Or maybe this Artist-Praise-Hysteria is mostly the result of folks desperately wanting to jump onto the bandwagon of the newest ""cool"" thing.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me most (besides the stretches of tedium) was that the cinematography was distractingly flat and gray--there were no real blacks and no real whites. I understand from articles I've read that this low-contrast, glowy B&W was intentional. But I didn't like it. Just looked like it was poorly shot with a bad video camera with the contrast turned all the way down. (this wasn't helped by the fact that the theatre I saw it in now presents all their ""films"" via digital projection--a process that, in my opinion, has NOT been perfected yet and is still too ""low res"" for cinema).<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Artist"" should be nothing more than a minor, vaguely interesting experiment that would have had a better home on video. How it has become an indie sensation with Oscar nominations is a totally mysterious to me. Wonder how much money it took to convince us all that is was a masterpiece?"
"anches-725-976306","1","97","166","5 February 2012"," Silent pictures? They deserve better than this.
","I won't mince words here: for me this was a desperately disappointing film. I am a passionate fan of the movies, especially the silents, of which I have seen more than a hundred, ranging from the excellent to the almost unwatchable and I must say that ""The Artist"" does not come up to my expectations. I shall be very surprised if it wins any major awards. It is not a silent film, it is not even a silent film with recorded musical score and occasional sound effects like, say ""Sunset"" or ""The Trail of '98"", it is more like a talkie with the dialogue track muted. The musical score is completely wrong as it sounds to me a couple of decades later than the period of the film. There is too much lip movement and there are too few titles: silent movie lovers will know that by the end of the silent era, titles were used sparingly and the unheard dialogue was short and to the point. Add to this the fact that the lead characters were not particularly likable and the film was too long. I was expecting a tribute to the art form I love and ended up watching a spoof! I much prefer ""Singin' in the Rain""-at least it is an honest spoof."
"Art Snob","6","152","270","21 December 2011"," Beware of the overhype!
","If you can get your Weinstein-manipulated expectations WAY down from ""Oscar"" to ""cute gimmick,"" then this cinematic truffle could very well satisfy – especially if you've ever seen and enjoyed a theatrical screening of a silent movie. There's a faithfulness to the spirit and techniques of the silent era that's undeniably impressive and will delight those few audience members (myself being one) who have enough familiarity with silent cinema to appreciate it.<br/><br/>But is it a movie that you should be running out to see because omnipresent web advertising says that it's an Oscar lock? Negative. If you DON'T have the required familiarity with the silent era, the charms and nostalgia evoked by the film will be completely lost on you, and you'll be far more dependent on the thin and unoriginal storyline for entertainment. (Note: the story borrows shamelessly from both SINGING IN THE RAIN and A STAR IS BORN and is fully consistent with the era's cornball aesthetic.) And even if you ARE familiar with silent cinema, ""Oscar worthy"" is going to seem like a stretch. Either way, if you really want to enjoy this movie, lowering your expectations from their current hype-elevated levels is imperative. (Anybody notice how remarkably similar Weinstein's overhype campaign for this film is to the one he successfully ran for Roberto Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL years ago? Anybody watched that movie since?) <br/><br/>I first saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with a full house at the spacious Elgin Theater, and it received a favorable albeit muted response from the audience. (By comparison, I saw AMELIE at the same theater ten years prior, and it received a ten-minute standing ovation at the end.) If I'd known at the time that I'd just seen the year's BEST movie, I would have been depressed over what this portended for the year-end releases.<br/><br/>You simply can't help being aware of the limitations of silent movies -- and thankful for the quantum improvement that the introduction of sound made -- no matter how deft the filmmakers are in recreating the look and feel of a bygone era. It's a movie-making era that you're glad IS bygone -- as evidenced by the inability of any of the gushing critics to cite a single color talkie favorite that they wish had been a b&w silent instead.<br/><br/>I say ""A"" for cinematic conceit and ""C"" for entertainment value (""B+"" for silent film buffs)."

","This is one of the most pretentious films I have ever seen. It is imbued with pointless clichés (the loyal servant, the love at a distance, the failed artist who burns his works, the dog coming to the rescue...not to talk about the tiring and old storyline of pride leading to downfall before final resolution). The two levels, narrative and meta-narrative, are utterly and inexplicably overlapped, mingled without making a point. The choice of making a silent film which speaks of ...silent films and of an actor who would not switch to the new techniques of sound is a very cheap option for a film which aims at winning an Oscar. What is the conveyed message? That silent films are still enjoyable? Or what...? I simply do not see any greatness in this film, only much pretentiousness."

","It may have been a cold January night in Leicester Square when I left the cinema but inside I was glowing, my faith somewhat restored in film having just seen this heartwarming classic.<br/><br/>There's little point going through the deeply romantic/dramatic plot set in stark contrast against the shallow world of 1920's Hollywood as it may only spoil it for those yet to see, but in summary this film is a real gem, a true joy to behold with a clever little unpredictable twist at the end. Fabulous acting, superb score, great cinematography and look out for a star turn from a little performing dog which is quite amazing at times.<br/><br/>With lots of classic touches woven throughout this movie, expect to laugh out loud, cry real tears and go through a roller-coaster of emotions as you will no doubt watch in fascination, the vivid recreation of an exceptional time in the history of cinema (the advent of talkies)and the history of the America (Wall St Crash/Great Depression).<br/><br/>Though it is a silent film, sound is used in a very clever way. Similarly the director meshes subtle modern cinema techniques with some classic framing and detail. This is a glorious mixture of the old and the new and has great balance between light comedy/entertainment, intense romance and at times dark drama. The result being interesting characters that engage on many levels.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning the nods to some of cinema's all time classic films like Singing in the Rain, Sunset Boulevard and Citizen Kane(and several Chaplin classics) but it's not plagiarism, parody or irreverence - it's a beautiful pastiche of the cinema's finest. Watching The Artist, feels like someone was clearing out an old Hollywood Studio and stumbled upon one of the greatest silents (if not films) of them all and suddenly the lost masterpiece is revealed to the world.<br/><br/>Emerging from the Cinema and into the crisp night air of Leicester Square, my thoughts were on one thing...how many Oscars will this instant classic win come February? The Academy certainly didn't disappoint as it picked up 5 Oscars including Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Director. <br/><br/>A big thank you to all who were involved in this magnificent production, a truly wonderful film, delivering a great cinematic experience."

","I don't get why people are agog over this movie. I wanted to like the movie but it was achingly boring through the first hour that I didn't think I could take the last 40 minutes. It picks up a little in the second half as it gets darker but it's still limp. Not as good as any ordinary silent movie I've ever seen. Overly campy, predictable, and frankly boring. I thought the movie would provide modern movie story-telling to an old art form to transform the medium. It clearly didn't do that and also failed as an ode to the glorious silent films of the past. Simply making a silent film today that is weak, insipid and vacuous does not qualify as homage. Even the independent film house where I saw this movie, which has adoring audiences that tend to applaud at the end of every movie, failed to generate the obligatory applause when this tome ended. I was very disappointed."
"augurar","5","32","51","16 February 2012"," Very Okay
","Well, this movie was... okay. Not great, not terrible. It's an interesting idea to try making a silent film (in fact, I thought the places where the film did use sound effects were rather silly), but I think they should have tried to make a more substantial movie instead of relying on the style as a gimmick. The plot was rather thin for the most part and parts of it seemed a bit overwrought. I had no particular problems with the acting, at least not with the lead parts, but there wasn't a whole lot of interest to the characters because their roles were so one-dimensional. I'd be interested to see what could be done with silent films if the filmmakers weren't trapped in the idea of making some kind of ""tribute"" instead of adding something of their own to the work."

","This is an example of ""The Emperors New Clothes"". Everyone is secretly thinking ""Why does everyone else like this?"", but is afraid to say it aloud. Yes, it is a an OK film. But it is not the movie that everyone proclaims it to be, certainly not worthy of the Oscar nominations it has garnered. This is the same pretentiousness that catapulted Roberto Benigni and his ridiculous ""Life Is Beautiful"" into unwarranted success. ""The Artist"" is a movie that screams ""Look at me. I am so quirky"" while all the while obfuscating the fact that the film is devoid of substance. David Lynch was a master at this. Don't waste your time on a film that was reformatted to black & white because it was irrelevant in color. It is still irrelevant!"

","It all started last Christmas when I, like many others started hearing a lot of hoo-ha about this new film coming out called The Artist which was silent, black and white, and up for all sorts of prestigious awards. I decided to give it a chance even though I couldn't really imagine how it could possibly be as good as all that, of course unless they brought something new and exciting to the silent picture, for why else would we have moved onto talkie films? To my utmost dismay, The Artist not only turned out to be ultimately disappointing, bringing nothing new to the table but also a member of that most dreaded genre- the tribute film. In other words, the type of film that says 'we've run out of ideas so let's just rehash old ideas and call it homage'. The tribute film is even worse than the remake and just one step up from clip shows in terms of unoriginality; and we all know how much we hate clip shows! I can just about understand tribute bands, they make sense. For instance, you want the Beatles live for your party, so you book a Beatles tribute band- not as good as the real thing but better than a CD.

"a-ozornin","10","16","25","15 January 2012"," Absolutely unmissable, charming film of the year!
","Hollywood, 1927: Silent movie star George Valentin is famous and wanted by his fans. He meets Peppy Miller, a young dancer, and propels her to the top of the movie industry. But as the sound enters the Hollywood, will George Valentin stand up to the challenge or surrender? I will definitely remember the year 2011 as the year of extreme nostalgia about the old movies. It seems to me that suddenly that feeling overwhelmed all the major producers, and as the result we saw so many films heralding how good the times were. The suit was started with Drive, the movie that initiates a time travel into 1980s movie production with all the main attributes in place: pounding soundtrack, violence and L.A. Then there was Hugo, in which Martin Scorsese took us back to the very beginning of the film production and has shown the fate of one of the pioneers of the industry, Georges Méliès. This time, the nostalgic authors take us to 1927, the era of silent black-and-white movies and booming movie industry.<br/><br/>The Artist is very different from the other two films mentioned. If the Drive hails the style of 80s and Hugo is the ode to the brave pioneers of the movie industry, the Artist talks mainly about the people involved. It asserts strongly that the actors during the 1920s were shining, glossy, glamorous in their own, down-to-earth style, and builds the entire storyline around it, not trying to capture the viewers' attention by anything else.<br/><br/>This was a very risky experiment. The movie is black-and-white and silent in the era of 3D, Avatar and Transformers. But the authors' bet on the charismatic characters paid off – the movie is very lively and charismatic. The simple story about George Valentin who tries to find his place in the rapidly changing world is very touching; the simple jokes easily make you smile. The fact that the movie concentrates on the new technology allowed some amazing plot turns – I promise that the George's nightmare will catch you by surprise. The movie is charming and light in a way that only old movies can be, without being too worried about special effects or the drama in the plot. The authors concentrated on one thing only: that is, to make people empathise with the main characters again, and they succeed – the main characters are charismatic and lovable.<br/><br/>Of course, this would not have happened without the right cast, and it is difficult to underestimate the work of Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo. It feels as if they came straight from late 20s, they look so natural and confident. It is difficult not to smile when seeing Ms. Bejo's smile or watching Mr. Dujardin's dances. They performed to their best, and it is this brilliant performance that guaranteed the charisma and irresistible charm of the movie. Absolutely gorgeous actors literally filling the room with optimistic and upbeat mood, despite all the hardship – they make this film what it is.<br/><br/>VERDICT: The risky experiment in the era of 3D and IMAX, but the most charming film of the year. TO WATCH: if you don't want to miss the most festive movie of the year.<br/><br/>http://m-picturegoer.blogspot.com/"

It plays off one running gag which seems clever at first but the redundancy amounts to Chinese water torture. As much as I tried to take the Hollywood love-fest with a grain of salt, it became horribly aggravating midway through the movie.<br/><br/>Perfect citation of a style does NOT amount to innovation.

","I had been looking forward to watching the Artist, I'm not sure why except for the quirky nostalgic angle that in today's world someone was willing to make a silent movie... the last tip of the hat to the silent era I remember from my youth being the Mel Brookes comedy. I dusted off the projector so I could watch on the big screen as my own little tribute to this movie as I watch most films now lazily on my 13"" laptop. I sadly found the film very disappointing and struggled to watch it through to the end. (I actually fell asleep halfway through). It felt like the story was one that had been told before way back in the day that it was reflecting and I questioned the need to reproduce what was already done so well back when the silver screen really was silver. Worse than my reaction to the film though was then to remember that it had won so many awards and been so highly praised by near all critics. How on earth did this film win Oscars and Golden Globes galore? A black and white movie that all had seen with a rose coloured tint? After seeing that the film had an 8.1 rating on IMDb and 98% on Rotten Tomatoes I felt compelled to have my say in an attempt to balance out, in my opinion, this highly unjustified acclaim. Indeed after seeing it had been so loudly applauded my own rating was nudged from poor to poop!"

","The quality of everything but the movie is good, it is a perfect 1940-1950 looking film about the 20's. However making it a completely silent movie was IMO a disaster. After 5 minutes we returned the movie to Blockbuster and got another. Sorry if I wanna watch a silent movie it will be one with Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin/WC Fields. I could not eject this movie from my DVD player fast enough! How this movie ever got made is beyond me it was that bad. I am bewildered as to how this film won so many Oscars let alone the Grand Prize! It seemed to me to be a remake of Singing in the Rain but black and white as well as silent.

"CirAndreasSiCorneliusAh","1","45","84","1 March 2012"," A sad insult on the era of Silent Films
","It should be titled ""The Emperor's New Film"". Contrary to what some of you may believe, the actors that lived in the time of the silent films actually did speak, could hear sounds, and the world was actually in color. For a movie to accurately portray their lives and how they were affected by the advent of speaking films it would have to represent their real lives, not the result of what their lives would have been without color or sound. To appreciate the films of the silent era, you watch those films. To create a farce such as this to feed the arrogant intellectuals that have so much power in the movie industry and the presentation of paid for awards is insulting to the people that truly appreciated the art of the silent era. What is next? Will we go to a theater to see a blank screen and a sound only version of a film representing the real lives of old time radio show personalities? This was just an insulting attempt to show that today we can make a better silent film than they did originally."
"KenToo","3","44","82","24 January 2012"," Gimmicky, boring, self-indulgent, and shallow
","It is generally understood that a movie maker should not employ a gimmick unless it is important to the plot. In this film, the movie maker(s) employ the gimmick of having the entire movie done like a silent movie (with very rare exception) simply because it tells the tale of a silent movie star. This gimmick violates the foregoing rule because it is NOT intrinsic to the plot.<br/><br/>In the last five seconds (or so it seems) you get one sound bite of sound to let you know the lead actor has a severe accent, which FINALLY explains why he was so resistant to doing ""talkies"" throughout the film. This would have been useful information to understanding his character and the actions taking place in the movie had it been disclosed earlier. As it was, it was a throw-away piece of information, with almost no attention drawn to it, too late to do any good. Instead, you are pretty much left with the realization you have been misled the entire movie -- by its silence -- into thinking this silent movie actor had some philosophical or artistic objection to talkies (even the name, the ""artist,"" misleadingly suggests this is the case).<br/><br/>To maintain this secret, the movie maker(s) also had to contrive the dialogue, because in all the conversations the lead actor (the ""artist"") has with people about not doing talkies, in reality his accent would be the main talking point. ""Hey, don't worry about your accent."" or ""You can get a speech coach to work on that accent."" No, the conversations are conveniently contrived to keep the movie-goer in the dark on this one.<br/><br/>Phony, contrived dialogue is not the end of the problems. As the movie itself confesses in dialogue, silent movie actors employ the prop of overly exaggerated facial expressions and ""mugging"" for the camera to get their point across. Well, this movie employs THAT too, in addition to being silent. So you get the actors mugging throughout the entire thing. It's quite annoying after 10 minutes. I go to see good actors act well, not intentionally overact and ""mug"" for the same of some stupid contrivance that some idiot thought would be ""oh so clever."" However, none of the above are actually the biggest problems with this movie. The biggest problem of all is the lack of depth or realism in the script. The movie maker(s) were so caught up trying to make a modern ""silent"" movie that they ignored the critical element of having characters with any depth.<br/><br/>We get the lead actor who is the definition of two-dimensional. He carries around his dog-sidekick wherever he goes and does the same tricks with the dog that he does in his films ALL THE TIME. We know his marriage is in trouble, but we don't see a single meaningful conversation between him and his wife. His interactions with his other love interest are completely phony, unrealistic and shallow.<br/><br/>I was ready to walk out of this movie after 30 minutes, but for the hope it would transform, grow, deepen or somehow make some meaningful point. It NEVER DOES. It goes on at the same speed, the same shallowness, the same one-dimensional tone THE WHOLE TIME.<br/><br/>I have a theory on people who rate this movie as so amazing. (1) They are old silent movie fans and this film brings back that nostalgia for them in a way they find pleasing. So, basically, the gimmick does it for them. (2) They see way too many movies, so they are bored and get overly excited about anything unique so, again, the gimmick satisfies them and they do not look for anything deeper. (3) They are the kind of artsy phoneys who do not really understand the art of storytelling, and so wait to see which way the critical winds blow and leap on that train so they can seem like they actually know what they are talking about.<br/><br/>To draw a comparison, which I think is apt, this movie is very much like Dogville, wherein the actors struggled to act without the benefit of props or sets. You had to IMAGINE all this stuff, as did the actors. And it got rave reviews. However, apart from this plot gimmick, it was a very bad movie. First, if you take the rose-tinted glasses off, you will readily see all the actors struggled with the lack of props and this really impaired their performances. Second, you will see this lack of props had no plot-related purpose and so was, again, a bad idea and in violation of a fundamental rule of good movie-making. Third, the story itself was weak inasmuch as the characters were not realistic, but instead were as shallow as comic book villains, which is fine if you want an immature horror-type plot, but not if you want to learn something deep about the human experience. It was a bad movie that should have been soundly condemned by any critic who actually knew what he/she was talking about, but instead people got fixated on the gimmick and gave it rave reviews.<br/><br/>How about a film where all the actors sit in wheelchairs? You can just use an old Karate Kid script, because no one will care because it has a new gimmick so it'll get rave reviews."

","*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER .... PLEASE READ AT YOUR DISCRETION ***<br/><br/>I had seen a ton of cinema....beginning from the 1890s to present day to American, Italian, Japanese, French, German, British, Spanish, Latin American....etc, etc, etc...including lots and lots of silent pictures, therefore my film education is very well versed. <br/><br/>Harvey Weinstein's executive money management campaign always works.....a little bit of proper marketing money does the trick. Personally, I think this film is an insult to the silent cinema, not a tribute. Anyone that had film education and saw at least the films of Charlie Chaplin will have a tendency to agree with me.<br/><br/>The storyline, while it exists, carries very little substance. <br/><br/>As far as acting goes: Dujardin does deserve a Best Actor Oscar...the film holds entirely on his acting. Directing was decent, although I do believe in order to make a film more interesting, the cinematography (or the way it is shot), could have been a lot more innovative, but since the filmmaker resorted to attempting to ""copy"" silent films, the entire cache of the picture got lost.<br/><br/>**** WARNING - SPOILER BELOW ****<br/><br/>But the story.....well here it goes: The film basically shows our protagonist who is on top of his acting game and is a ""superstar"", who then ""bumps into"", or rather she ""bumps into him""....an ""extra"" or an onlooker on set, whom he is charmed by....of course our film's leading lady, and our film director's wife in real life. Next thing we know, the silent era is over...the talking era begins and she becomes famous and he becomes nothing by becoming an alcoholic and a wimp.....literally a wimp. As soon as they start making ""talking"" pictures in our film, our protagonist can no longer work all of the sudden......but why? So a successful superstar turns into a wimp overnight.....that does not hold true for Hollywood.....please DO NOT underestimate the effect of star power.....please take a look at Mel Gibson's case and how long it took him to destroy himself, despite all of the ""charades"" he threw out publicly....and if you wanted to compare this film to the times of Charlie Chaplin would still be absurd....Chaplin never lost his ability to make films, even when ""The Great Dictator"" came out in 1940. That was not a silent film...it was a talking picture, which is one of Chaplin's most infamous pictures to date....check it out via Criterion Collection, yet Chaplin was a silent actor/filmmaker, but somehow still managed to make good, quality films that were talking pictures.<br/><br/>Continuing... Then our leading lady comes and rescues our leading man, yet until the very end of the movie, it is really unclear (when you think about it) why he is the guy she should be rescuing. He does not ""give her a start"" in the movie industry...just because he adds a ""birthmark"" above her lip in the beginning (clever Cindy Crawford copycat citation there by the way....) does not mean she should be rescuing him.<br/><br/>In the end...everyone's happy....the wimp is rescued by a ""strong"" lady who was always obsessed with him, she didn't actually love him, she loved ""the image"" of this successful man....in today's real life example for instance, it would be the same as a regular girl obsessed with George Clooney or Brad Pitt, but the story in this film wants to make us believe that she loves him, when she actually does not, but only in a movie can they attempt to get away with something like this. <br/><br/>The bottom line? Best Picture? I don't think so....nice try though.<br/><br/>Of course, for people that go to movies in a movie theater ""on a date"", when they are all ""into each other"" and are concentrating more on each other's lips and are boiling with emotions because they can't wait to finish the movie and go home and shag....add a little popcorn and soda and smiling characters on screen with somewhat existent story line in today's day and age will pass for today's average viewer, but for someone that understands what makes a real film work, I would say....pass....or see it only for Dujardin's acting.<br/><br/>To close....I was not disappointed to be honest after I completed watching this because after getting used to so much garbage that comes out on screen during the course of the last 10- 15 years, finding a truly unique picture with a profound storyline these days is a surprise, therefore I did not expect much...but was curious why George Clooney lost the Oscar to Dujardin. <br/><br/>3/10 ... Sorry Mr. Michel Hazanavicius, I meant no disrespect to you or to the film, but it is the job of the viewer to give each film a sober and honest review, otherwise what good are our opinions?"

","""The Artist"" is a great example of a very good film that was over-hyped by critics. Again and again, I heard how the film was a prime Oscar-contender. So, as a result, I had EXTREMELY high hopes--too high, actually. If I'd heard nothing about the film, I would have left the theater VERY satisfied.<br/><br/>Oddly, this film is the second homage to silent films that's been released in the last few months. ""HUGO"" was simply brilliant (and my hope is that it gets the Best Picture nod) and ""The Artist"" is fortunately very good but quite different in style. It is, aside from one song with lyrics and the end of the film, silent with only some incidental music and occasional sound effects. It's a reworking of the myth about TONS of silent stars losing their careers because of their inability to adapt to talking pictures (popularized by the film ""Singing in the Rain""). I say 'myth' because actually very few major actors really lost their careers due to the coming of talking pictures. Two frequent examples often cited, Clara Bow and John Gilbert, really weren't lost in talkies completely because of their voices. Sure, Bow had a thick New York accent--but her odd-screen antics (she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day) and fragile mental health really did a lot more to push her out of films. But Gilbert did some amazingly good talkies and his losing his career had a lot more to do with Louis B. Mayer hating him--as well as Gilbert's heavy drinking--and nothing to do with his fine voice. But,...back to the story.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin plays a huge silent film star--one very similar to Douglas Fairbanks. Along the way, he helps an aspiring actress (Bérénice Bejo) and soon she, too, becomes a star. However, when talking pictures come, she becomes a mega-star and Dujardin becomes a has-been. The plot is quite a bit like a reworking of ""A Star is Born""--and is clever enough and new enough not to be repetitive. However, to me, the star of the film was actually Uggie--the wonderful dog (actually three different ones according to IMDb) who co-starred in Dujardin's silent films.<br/><br/>So why am I only giving the film a very respectable 8 when critics are going crazy talking about it? Well, the story is originally but it's also VERY simple. It is also, unfortunately, a tad predictable...though quite satisfying as well. Not a bad film--in fact, a very good one--with nice cinematography and music as well. But probably not among the very best films of the year.<br/><br/>FYI--Dujardin and Bejo have played together before--such as in the very funny James Bond-type comedy ""OSS 117""--which is also very well worth seeing."

First of all, it's the oldest story in the books, in fact it's a rip-off of Singing in the Rain. Hello. Is anyone awake? Ugh. I could not believe it. I truly thought I had Hollywood's number, that they wouldn't pull the wool over my eyes again, but with The Artist, they did and I just cannot believe it.

","Going into this film , I did have high expectations. What I learned coming out of it is that, I do believe, I have grown a bit as a critic. This being of the highest praised films of the year, I had no doubts that I would come out of it liking it somewhat at least. This being said, I was mostly let down here. Another thing this film taught me is that trailers for films can be deceiving and that literally most of the great parts of a film are within it's trailers. This is mostly the case here. I found the most enjoyable moments were parts of snip-its from pieces in the trailer. If you have not yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend against watching it. The story here, overall, is actually quite bland and nothing to really get excited for. This is a pretty easy film to swallow, and there is really only one scene in the film that really gives it anything worthy of a PG-13 rating. You could say this is almost a family film for the easy minded, and for some, it could be something anyone could enjoy if you are into the more independent films of course.<br/><br/>However, despite all this, the performances is what really saves the film here, and they are spot on, and in every way worthy of an Oscar nom. from at least the 2 leads or just the female lead overall. Also, the cinematography is quite gorgeous to look at for the most part. I can't really say that what IS here is really flawed at all, it just really didn't grab me and have all the magic most are claiming it to have. There is something here, but it is missing a lot of charm it could have had. What we get here is splices of charm with a downtrodden face."

","I had high hopes for THE ARTIST, a modern-day black and white silent movie that promised to be a charming celebration of movie-making in the silent era and a film which swept the board at the Oscars. Unfortunately it's a movie that's not as good as it thinks it is, one which happily copies that which has come before rather than providing much in the way of originality.<br/><br/>The story involves a famous silent film actor who finds his career in the doldrums after the arrival of 'talkies', sound films which effectively bankrupt him and end his career. Gee, wasn't this done already - and with a lot more charm and vigour - in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN? Elsewhere, there are plot links to the likes of SUNSET BOULEVARD, but THE ARTIST feels overall like a pastiche rather than genuinely profound piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a handful of funny moments here and there - my favourite scene is the 'sound' nightmare - and the dog is instantly lovable. But I felt that Jean Dujardin was smug rather than likable, and his romance with a co-star is pretty sappy and doesn't really go anywhere. The ending also feels false, apparently tap dancing makes all the problems go away. Like Scorsese's HUGO, this is a film that had everybody raving about it, yet I fear it's one of those ""Emperor's new clothes"" situations after all."
"Ramascreen","10","20","36","23 November 2011"," A masterpiece! A film for the ages!
","THE ARTIST is beautiful, definitely one of my favorite films this year.  I can watch it again and again. Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has  crafted a timeless masterpiece, a film that deserves best picture  nomination along with acting nods for Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo.  It's a silent black-and-white film with masterful music accompaniment,  a charming, irresistible story and an excellent production that gives  you the feel of elegance and authenticity..  In the midst of remakes and sequels out there, THE ARTIST stands out as  something unique, original and well-made. Not only is the film silent  black and white but it's also presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so it  immediately takes you to Hollywoodland era right from the start.  Hazanavicius must've seen hundreds of silent films to get this thing  right because that's what I would do. I haven't watched many in my  lifetime but what always amuses me about silent films is that you'd see  the characters engage in a fairly long dialogue but then the caption  shows up and it only consists of a few words. THE ARTIST goes above and  beyond to stay true to how silent films were done in the early years of  cinema.  The story essentially is about a silent film star named George  Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin, who's rich and famous and is proud  of his accomplishments, he has a big house and a wife he no longer  finds happiness with. He loves the attention, he loves fame, and he's a  natural born charmer. Actor Jean Dujardin as Valentin looks like a  cross between Gene Kelly, Clark Gable, and Douglas Fairbanks. Valentin  meets a girl named Peppy Miller, played by Bérénice Bejo. He helps her  enter the business and she eventually rises her way to stardom. And  then something radical happens, the talkies, films suddenly aren't  silent anymore and audience want to hear their stars talk and Valentine  becomes obsolete. The great depression only worsens the situation,  Valentin loses his fame and fortune, the only thing he still carries  are his four-legged friend and his pride. Peppy closely observes from a  distance, still admires the man who helped her be part of this showbiz.  Jean Dujardin gives a towering performance, it's acting at its purest  form. Even when Valentin is sad, he could always show a bit of smile  here and there. Because it's a silent film, the body language speaks  more volume and Dujardin's physical and facial expressions speak a  thousand words. When he's jolly and comical, he channels a Chaplin-like  personality and when he's sad and frustrated, his Oscar worthy dramatic  side breaks through, what a magnificent performance! Bérénice Bejo is  vibrant, glamorous and a perfect walking replica of 1920s-1930s  starlets Every actor, including John Goodman, involved in this film is  fantastic. Even the dog deserves an applause. There's a couple of  scenes in the film when you're allowed to hear sounds and people  talking, the first scene introduces them as nightmare, the second scene  happens when Valentin fully embraces them. Because you can't hear  dialogue, composer Ludovic Bource's consistent music plays an even  bigger, more imperative and more integral role in the storytelling, the  music is one of the many things that make THE ARTIST a film for the  ages."
"ClaytonDavis","10","20","36","6 November 2011"," Should be Oscar's Best Picture of 2011
","When witnessing the evolution of film, it's hard to grasp how it went from a seemingly simple concept of silent imagery into a loud, uproarious third dimension experience. Michel Hazanavicius' silent film The Artist plays homage to the origins of our cinema in a general manner while attaining a massive respect that can't be denied. The film tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film actor megastar who withers away into obscurity when the introduction of ""talkies"" meets monumental popularity. Movie extra Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a star on the rise who's admiration for George's work runs much deeper than the film's they share. Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius explores the deepest parts of his soul which he calls ""a love letter."" What a beautiful letter it was. He makes conscious choices to illustrate the medium in the most toxic and potent fashion. A Q & A with Hazanavicius' at the end of the picture placed much into perspective. His funny, mild-tempered personality will carry him extremely far in this year's Oscar race. He could easily be the new director that everyone roots for. His stamp on the film is evident and his adoration and tribute to the genre is clear and ostentatious.<br/><br/>Dujardin and Bejo showing Oscar all they got... The obvious question is how does the silence work and is it done well? Tying in with the prominent theme of silence, the presentation is an absolute marvel. Hazanavicius' respect for film bleeds out the screen into the audience and with so little words, we are transported into a world of unspoken expressions and explosive representation. The narrative is so uniquely relevant and intricately precise, that every scene is as equally important as the one before it. There's no fluff just brilliance. Production design by Laurence Bennett alters the viewer's perception of reality and engages a time travel experience to Hollywood 1927. The sets are so imaginative and exquisite, the film runs like a hybrid of classic films like Rebecca (1940) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman shoots the film with a modern camera but attacks each scene with finesse and diligence like an old pro. He captures some of the best shots seen this year on film. Hazanavicius not only writes and directs this triumphant piece of cinema, he dips his hand into the editing process with Anne-Sophie Bion. The duo know their pace and they know when to give more and pull back. At 100 minutes of pure cinematic magic, it's one of the rare instances in film where it begins and ends perfectly. Bringing to light the gorgeous production design, the gray whirlwind images shoots the costume design by Mark Bridges to the forefront. Bridges captures sharply the essence of time especially with Peppy's wardrobe. An awards magnet indeed. The star of the technical show is Ludovic Bource, a composer that just catapulted himself into the big leagues as composers John Williams and Alexandre Desplat. In a silent film, the music is important and needs to be on queue every second. Bource knows when to play it rough and especially when to retreat and let the film speak for itself. It's not overkill in the slightest. The supporting players, which American audiences will know more than our two polarizing leads, are effective in their respective roles. John Goodman proves to be the strongest of the players, ripping through scenes of comedic brilliance and showing that he still has everything in his armor. Penelope Ann Miller, an underused and undervalued actress during her prime returns to form as the beautiful Doris, a brokenhearted housewife looking for some attention. James Cromwell plays Clifton, the ""Alfred-type"" driver to Dujardin's ""Bruce Wayne,"" a tantalizing and endearing performer that shakes the hearts of the viewers. Malcolm McDowell shows brief but subtle showmanship. The Artist is the year's finest and most wonderful film. The Academy Awards can stop looking, this is their winner for Best Picture 2011. A fine piece of cinema that will hopefully be clutched by moviegoers for years to come."

There's a reason films have a soundtrack. It makes them interesting. I identified with the hapless audience watching Valentin's last silent film after the talkies were introduced. Mugging for the camera is not a skill I wish to pay money for and other than tap dancing that's all you get. I am amazed at the way in which people followed the critics like sheep.

","Where do I begin, well for starters I can say that I am a huge fan of Jean Dujardin. However, as I lack any artistic bones in my DNA the black & white silent style of this movie just did not appeal to me. <br/><br/>The silent era as well as that of B&W, is a bygone era and for a good reason, it has been surpassed by better technology. I can certainly appreciate B&W photographs, for the most part, I prefer to shoot them that way. That, however, does not mean I want to watch a movie in this format.<br/><br/>Even as a kid I found Mel Brooks' Silent Movie to be somewhat annoying, but in the end, it was entertaining and funny - that said I only watched it once. The Artist was neither - perhaps it is my fault though as I fast forwarded through the majority of the film."

","What with so many films up for awards being a big let down i was hoping The Artist was a film that at least , lived up to it's hype. Thankfully it did.<br/><br/>George Valentin is a famous silent movies start who is loved by himself nearly as much as his fans. He meets , by chance , up and coming actress Peppy Miller and he falls in love. The problem is that Peppy is making it big in Talkies and George finds that silent movies are dying along with his career.<br/><br/>I never thought i would like a silent movie as much as i liked this one. This is a very cleverly made film that keeps the audience spellbound by some fantastic backing music and three brilliant performances from Jean Dujardin , Berenice Bejo and a delightful little Jack Russel.<br/><br/>I love the first 15 miniues of this film. Jean Dujardin is in his element both in the film and with his acting. The smile and swagger of George is superb and you cant but help like the man. Berenice Bejo is just the same. A lovely smile and wonderful attitude and you can see why any man would fall for her.<br/><br/>The film does dip a little in the middle and maybe could do with ten minutes being shaved off it but apart from that The Artist is everything that people are saying."
"ferguson-6","8","9","14","26 December 2011"," With Pleasure
","Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the last silent film that received this much adoration, acclaim and publicity? Of course you don't. It was 1927 and Clara Bow starred in ""Wings"", the most recent silent film to be nominated for Best Picture (it won). My guess is, that streak is about to end thanks to French writer/director Michel Hazanavicius.<br/><br/>No doubt many will avoid this one since it is a Black & White silent film. What a mistake that would be. It offers a wonderfully entertaining and captivating story, and two outstanding and expressive lead performances. Jean Dujardin is remarkable as George Valentin, one of the biggest movie stars in 1927 (when this story begins). It's around this time when the ""talkies"" begin taking over. Valentin is a very likable character, but foolishly believes talking movies are a fad and his fans will remain loyal to him and his traditional silent films. Not only do talkies take off, but the Great Depression also hits. Valentin finds himself out of work and broke.<br/><br/>The most fun in the film occurs when Valentin and Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) are together. Their characters have a chance meeting and there is an instant spark. Valentin gets her the first break of her career and before long, she is on the rise as fast as he free falls. Only Valentin's dog and driver (James Cromwell) remain loyal to him during the tough times, but Peppy refuses to let the bond die.<br/><br/>It's impossible to watch this film and not notice the influence of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Sunset Blvd"". Also, Dujardin's Valentin looks to be a cross between Douglas Fairbanks and Gene Kelly, replete with the electric matinée idol smile. Both Dujrardin and Ms. Bejo (who is the director's real life girlfriend) have the elastic face and bright eyes necessary for silent film stardom. They really allow us as viewers to forget the silence and enjoy the characters.<br/><br/>This is a fully realized story with excellent character development. You might wonder how this is possible with no dialogue, but that's why this is a must see film garnering an abundance of critical acclaim. It's very easy to access and is purely entertaining ... with both moments of happiness and sadness. It has everything a really good movie should have ... just with fewer lines of dialogue!"
"paulmartinstillman","10","13","22","30 January 2012"," The Best Film and Soundtrack I've seen in a long time.
","I just saw this film and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I was surprised that a black-and-white movie could captivate and affect me so much. Ironically, the fact that it wasn't a color talkie with modern special effects actually helped me to pay attention to the wonderful film; the score/soundtrack (best soundtrack, in my opinion, since I saw ""Fantasia"" back in the seventies), the facial expressions and bodily movements, and the absence of speaking ""spoke"" to my emotions rather than to my intellect. Sometimes modern technology, including color, and language distract me; they also seem to enable bad acting and imbecilic plots. The acting in ""The Artist"" was superb (I especially enjoined the leading man's and leading lady's performances), the costumes were authentic (I loved the fact that men actually dressed up and wore ties to the movies), the vehicles were works of art (rather than the plastic bubbles we drive today); I felt nostalgic for a time when class and compassion reigned supreme."
"Ryan_MYeah","10","11","18","3 February 2012"," Thoroughly enjoyable, and mightily ambitious, it's worthy of the applause.
","When The Artist premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it opened to an enthusiastic reception that continued to spread over to the U.S. Now hat I see it, it isn't hard for me to see why it's been bringing audiences to their feet, and claiming Best Picture awards left and right.<br/><br/>The Artist was a passion project for director Michel Hazanavicius. He'd long wanted to make a film inspired by the black & white silent movies of the 1920's and early 30's. There's barely any audible dialogue or sound effects in the whole film besides music. The movie's first ambient sound effects aren't heard until half an hour through the film, and they aren't followed by any more until a full hour later. This is where Hazanavicius specifically lets his writing and direction take center stage.<br/><br/>Some may call it incredibly flashy, but I actually find the direction to be quite subtle. Co-working as both a director and film editor, Hazanavicius paces the movie at the exact rate it always needs. He pieces together his excellent cast's performances with style, and knows when to make a quick cut, whether it be to another person or an inter-title. But he also knows when to slow things down, to let the audience absorb the detail of the film, such as the pleasant cinematography and lovely costumes, and to let a shot go uninterrupted and let Ludovic Bource's elegant, if not always so subtle, musical score do the storytelling. This is a thematically and technically excellent score, as Bource relishes in the lightly romanticized and melodramatic orchestrations inspired by those from the golden age of Hollywood.<br/><br/>What Hazanavicius ultimately excels at best is his terrific cast. There's a whole slew of outstanding performances in this picture that perform perfectly, and manage to tell us almost a whole story without saying a single word: including great supporting roles by John Goodman, James Cromwell, and Penelope Ann Miller. Standout notices go to Jean Dujardin, whose natural charisma, sincerity, and incredible array of emotion in the role of George Valentin is enough to carry the whole film on its own. Berenice Bejo, on top of being so utterly beautiful, gives a masterstroke portrayal as the enthusiastic Peppy Miller, never uttering a single line, but charming us and placing us under an irresistible spell. As if that weren't enough, Uggie the dog, who plays Valentin's faithful pet, is the most adorable thing I've seen all year. Applause is most richly deserved.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","I'm getting tired of reviewing other peoples' work, when I want to be shooting my own stuff, but this film really was a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>Who says they don't make black and white silent films anymore? Before the days of talkies, musicals (much less sci-fi blockbusters and CGI fests) there were the likes of Rudolph Valentino, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplain and a host of others who are now immortalized in American (and now global) cinematic culture.<br/><br/>Old fashioned film making with modern film making techniques, and a few rifts on an old formula with a contemporary twist. Me, I really didn't get the whole romance thing, but that's just me. It seemed a bit over the top. But, the film is what it is.<br/><br/>Give it a shot.

If you're going to ape your betters (which in this case would include Pabst, von Stroheim, Murnau, Lubitsch, and Chaplin), then you should have the decency to study what they do and try to imitate their style. <br/><br/>This is crap. I'd like to believe the acclaim for it is a joke, but I fear it's not. I guess people don't watch things like ""City Lights"" any more and don't recognize this for the pandering garbage it is. And it *is* pandering; never for one frame do you get the feeling that these people don't think they're archly ""slumming"" and being ""edgy"" by shooting without sound despite the fact that their vision is utterly pedestrian and probably wouldn't have made it off the second bill in 1928.<br/><br/>Oh, and they use ""Pennies from Heaven"" with no awareness whatsoever of its resonance.

","""The Artist"" is a true cinematic achievement. In this day and age of CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen, here is a film done for all practical purposes, like a film made in 1928. This is so well-made it hard to know where to begin. The music score has the sound of an actual Vitaphone score from the period. In particular, some of the score reminded me of ""The Jazz Singer"". The narrow-screen aspect and evocative black-and-white photography added to the vintage atmosphere the makers were trying to convey. The players are all excellent, and wow! Can the two leads dance? Watch them! It took me about a month to see this because it did not play at all in Chicago for the first month of it's limited release. At the end of the screening, the audience actually applauded. Something I haven't seen in a long time. The appreciation by the audience made me think that if a contemporary audience can enjoy this, they may not avoid some of the other classic silent films that are still available to be enjoyed. So ""The Artist"", great film that it is on it's own could serve as a trailer for those uninitiated to the joys of the silent classics."

For those who aren't regular viewers of this lost art, it will be an enjoyable novelty. It is a good story, but too slow, and stretched out too far. I'm not comparing it to movies from the teens, but am to movies from the twenties, when the silents became a refined art.

"JohnRayPeterson","9","11","19","14 February 2012"," Since all the adjectives to praise it have been written, I'll just say YES.
","I know of only one real try at making a silent movie since the genre died of natural death in the thirties; that was the Mel Brooks 1976 parody 'Silent Movie'. I did not go to see that film and don't plan to. While technically not a real silent movie, 'The Artist' is as close as you'll ever come to it; it has an actual soundtrack which is almost exclusively music with very few sound effects and, like Brooks' film, only one word is spoken, hence, it can't be called a silent movie.<br/><br/>The Oscars are just around the corner and 'The Artist' has been gathering momentum. With all that fuss and the outstanding ratings, I just had to see for myself if it lived up to the hype. If it had not fared so well at all my usual sources and all the unusual ones as well, I doubt I would have bothered; hey it's a silent movie. While I've seen most all the 2011 movies that are nominated for best picture for the upcoming Oscars, and written reviews of them, only 'The Artist"" I can say truly is a bold and daring artistic production. I've read countless reviews of this movie and though other nominees are worthy of the prize, such madness deserves to win. It not only was mad to attempt it, it overlapped into genius because it was done successfully. There are no flaws in this production; it pays homage to silent movies by being just that, flawless. It has a beautiful story, the actors are compelling and it calls to sentiments any modern movie could boast of conveying.<br/><br/>For history buffs: The silent movies, in the early thirties, were the sole source of happy escape from the hard times (the great depression) of that period. Anyone going through hard times now deserves to see this movie; thankfully, you need not be French or American to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have at length outlined the storyline, well summarized in IMDb, so you don't need to read it again from me; it was brilliant to make that particular story in silent form. I could go on about the wonderful musical score, without which it could not have worked so well; the directing by Michel Hazanavicius, who wrote the script and poured all he had to give toward making it a well done movie, deserves all the rewards he is now receiving, including public admiration from his gorgeous wife, the co-star of the movie (and you don't see that sort of display everyday). I liked the whole cast, no exceptions.<br/><br/>If, on February 26th, this movie wins best picture, you'll see an audience, the whole industry is there, stand up and cheer like you've never seen before; that much I can predict. Did I like the movie? I loved it."
"tomgillespie2002","9","11","19","18 January 2012"," Note-perfect love letter to the silent era
","George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the biggest stars in Hollywoodland. His latest picture looks set to be a commercial success after he charms the audience after a screening with his on and off- screen sidekick dog Jack. Afterwards, as the press surge around him, a screaming fan, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) drops her purse and finds herself alongside George, who grabs her and smiles for the camera. She causes a sensation in the press and lands a small dancing role in George's next film. But with the emergence of the talkies looming, George finds his role as Hollywoodland's favourite star threatened, and Peppy slowly rises and becomes a star in her own right. Unable to find work as a talking film star, George slides into infamy, but finds his path repeatedly crossing with Peppy's.<br/><br/>The emergence of the 'talkies' is one the biggest events in cinema history. Cinema giants found themselves pushed out of the business if they didn't have the right voice, and had to make way for a new set of stars. Very few actors survived the transformation, with the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo managing to scrape through. This has been depicted on screen before, most notably in two very different masterpieces - Billy Wilder's homage-filled noir Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Stanley Donen's iconic musical Singin' in the Rain (1952). While the latter depicted an ageing former silent star verging on madness, and the latter a production company making the difficult transition from silent movies to musicals, what The Artist has going for it is that it's shot and acted exactly like a silent movie, and does so with such dedication and love that it transports you back to the time where you feel as if you're witnessing this change first hand.<br/><br/>It would be easy to make a mockery of silent movies. As many greats as the era produced, they mainly consist of over-the-top acting, unrealistic sets and overly romantic attitudes (I said mainly, I'm not referring to the works of Murnau, Lang and Dreyer, but mainly the work that came out of Hollywood). But they were simple, passionate and often theatrical, and the works of Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton are still some of the greatest comedies ever made. Director Michel Hazanavicius is clearly in love with them, and even shot the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which allows the actors to dominate the screen. It is also littered with sly winks to the era and to the likes of Mary Pickford, who was possibly the biggest actress of the era, and Douglas Fairbanks (a scene from his The Mark of Zorro (1920) is shown as a Valentin movie, with Valentin incorporated into the close-up shots). <br/><br/>The casting is a stroke of genius. Dujardin has such a perfect cinematic face that it is as if he was made for silent cinema. He simply doesn't need to speak, he has the ability to generate an emotion with an eyebrow movement, and has possibly the greatest screen moustache for many a year. If the Academy fails to recognise his performance here, I'll eat my own face, and I hope he goes on to bigger and better things. Bejo is not nearly as impressive, but charms her way through the film and is perfectly believable in her role. She has real chemistry with Dujardin, and the scene in which she has a small role dancing with Valentin, who keeps fluffing his actions because he is enamoured by Peppy, is truly beautiful. It is one of the most genuine and achingly romantic scenes I've seen in the cinema.<br/><br/>It is too early to call it a masterpiece, but it is truly a stunning film and the hype is well justified. But I did leave wondering if I had just witnessed the death of cinema. Are we so devoid of ideas that we have reverted back to where we started? Well, no, but it did make me think. Cinema has come full circle, and I am now concerned that there is nothing else left to explore. With the emergence of 3-D, old classics such as Star Wars (1977) and Jurassic Park (1993) are being re-released into cinemas. Do we now have to look back for inspiration, rather than forward into the unknown? Perhaps people have wondered this in the past, only to then witness cinematic landmarks that have pushed the medium forward. I'm most likely, and hopefully, wrong, but for now I'll enjoy The Artist for what it is - a love letter to a time in cinema often neglected by the masses - and a brilliant one at that.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Films sometimes have multiple script-writers and you just know that things have been tweaked and changed to please preview audiences of teenagers. The Artist takes us back to a time when cinema was about entertainment, when new technology was used to improve things rather than swamp the product with an 'aren't we clever with computers?' attitude.<br/><br/>It has moments of great humour and great poignancy, many of these moments enhanced by a mere facial expression from the fantastic Jean Dujardin (Best Actor Oscar with any luck), ably supported by Berenice Bejo and ....Uggy the Jack Russell in a scene-stealing performance.

The best part of the movies was the ending so i could get out of there AND COMPLAIN TO MY FRIEND HOW I WOULD NEVER TRUST HER TO PICK OUT A MOVIE AGAIN. SO YEAH i hated it dumbs down and i have nothing else to say but the stupid review makes me write 10 lines just wanted to put my little input in it. sorry"

","I was blown away. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed this much watching a movie with so much entertainment, originality, freshness and skill. One can safely say now that this little experiment has paid off, but to push forward such an idea and to execute it to the way it had turned out requires a lot of conviction. <br/><br/>George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar who is on top of the Hollywood tree with his huge fan following and never ending box-office success. His world comes tumbling down with the dawn of the talkies which he doesn't take too seriously. His find Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a new star overnight and the stock market crash doesn't help his cause either. While his life descends into depression and loss, his pride blinds the love shown by Peppy Miller who is now the hottest property in Hollywood. Can he come out of his shell? Can Peppy Miller express her love? Can they have a future together? Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are two extremely charismatic and talented actors who can switch gears so effortlessly from little subtle expressions to over-the-top requirements of the era. The attention to detail starting from sets to the type of film used to get the right look is done with precision. The same story has been told in many different backdrops before, but the format presented here is quite fresh. Another challenging aspect that is overcome with excellence is the screenplay, as the writers mare not used to tell a story in this format. Best moments to look out for: <br/><br/>1. Introduction of Peppy Miller and when she romances George Valentin's suit. <br/><br/>2. George Valentin's realization of Sound as the future in his dream. <br/><br/>3. The way Peppy Miller blackmails the producer. <br/><br/>4. Expression of Peppy Miller when she races to George Valentin's house before climax. <br/><br/>4. Climax duet dance. <br/><br/>This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era, but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved. This movie, is one that should not be missed."

","First of all, from 2008, the movies which won best picture shifted directions: instead of going towards the masterpiece original movie they are going towards the commercial type. I hope this is the climax of these 4 years, although I have serious doubts.<br/><br/>The critiques say The Artist is just a mix of clichés, a compilation of scenes from other films. How does that affect me, why would I care(asks the casual viewer) ? Well, the answer's simple : this film lacks depth. Badly. I mean it's fun to watch, it's well made...but it just doesn't have like other layers of meaning hidden below the surface, imagine an egg which is empty inside. I don't think in those times films were like that!<br/><br/>The story is fine for entertainment, but doesn't even come close to, say, The Aviator. I did like the moment when the music stops and we can hear some sounds which are briefly related to the story, it makes you more intuitive. The acting is indeed good- and the movie is good, but overall it just doesn't bring anything new. It just stinks of Hollywood, and not the old one !<br/><br/>I could tell you 100 films like this one, but could hardly name 3 like, for example, The Tree of Life."

"asda-man","10","12","22","14 January 2012"," Will leave you speechless
","I'm quite confident to say that ""The Artist"" will be the best film of 2012 and the year hasn't really even started yet. It's quite a shame to see how ""The Artist"" was only playing on my local cinema (well not local, local that one doesn't have anything worth seeing on it! It's just got one screen and it's usually kiddie films, but it's cheap and they have the odd thing on which can be useful) for just one week, on one of its smaller screens (still bigger than my local, local one!) I can only presume that its been taken off early for ""The Darkest Hour 3D"" because they thought that a silent black and white film will not do well. Who's going to want to see a black and white film? Never mind it being silent! Obviously a lot more people are going to want to see the upcoming masterpiece ""The Darkest Hour 3D"" that's clogging up two screens because it's in 3D. Well they're wrong! (If I'm assuming correctly) because ""The Artist"" sticks one gracious middle finger up at 3D blockbusters and has you asking, ""Who the heck needs sound?""! Because it is an absolute masterpiece!<br/><br/>The only other film I've ever felt slightly the same about was last year's ""Black Swan"" (although I don't think I'd put it up there yet...) But that just shows how ""The Artist"" really is for everyone, because it is absolutely nothing like ""Black Swan"" apart from the fact that it ended on the stage. ""Black Swan"" is an extremely intense character piece that literally blew my mind (don't worry I'm not schizophrenic) whereas ""The Artist"" is a character piece but presented in such a different way that it blew my mind as well! I knew that when I went to see it that it was going to be good, I just didn't have no idea it would be THAT good! I probably would've gone to see the very next screening but it cost £8.65 or something outrageous like that. Thankfully, ""The Artist"" is worth every single penny. If you have to pawn your watch to see this film then DO IT!<br/><br/>Why am I getting excited about this film? Well, I've never seen anything like it, quite literally because I've never seen a silent film, just parts of ""Nosferatu"" and so I wasn't quite sure what to get. Actually ""The Artist"" has pretty much everything, fabulous acting, beautiful directing and cinematography, engaging story, amazing music that just carries the whole film! The soundtrack is gorgeous and basically does play throughout the whole film, only when their is no music, it's done in perfect timing and is just breathtaking!<br/><br/>""The Artist"" also carries so much emotion, it's happy, it's sad, it's angry, it's funny, pretty much every emotion is shed on that screen and it's just an absolute delight to see. I wasn't expecting ""The Artist"" to be quite so deep either, because I didn't really know much about it, I just knew it was a love story, when actually it is so much more! It's a character piece really on our hero George who places too much faith in silent films, when talkies suddenly appear around the corner. It's also an extremely clever idea to present a film about the silent era as a silent film, because you can actually sympathise with George as it makes you thing ""Talkies are crap!"" When a film can look this beautiful and be silent and black and white.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" is also so amazingly clever! It's like great literature being projected onto a screen. Like ""Black Swan"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" it carries so much symbolism and visual metaphors that are just so clever it had me astounded. The film is also so beautifully shot! There are some shots that I thought looked absolutely perfect, like when George sees his shadow on the white screen, and when he sees his reflection wearing a suit, these are absolutely perfect shots that are also executed magnificently. There just seem to be so many great moments throughout the film that are sure to make this film a classic for years to come, it's the definition of ""modern masterpiece"".<br/><br/>I have to talk about the actors as well, Jean Dujardin is perfectly cast, from the moment we see him he is instantly likable. He has this perfect silent era charm about him and is such a great comic actor and emotionally charged actor. You can feel his pain and happiness where ever is appropriate. Bérénice Bejo also has a great charm about her, she's weirdly beautiful and also a great actress. The dog is also an absolute joy to watch. When he's on screen (I know it's a ""he""!) he brings guaranteed laughs, and also tugs on your ""aww"" strings. The dog is actually an amazing actor and probably should win ""Best Supporting Actor"" at the Oscars.<br/><br/>In fact ""The Artist"" should win everything at the Oscars, it should win ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Actor"", ""Best Actress"", ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Music"", ""Best Sound"" (no really their is some great use of sound in their!) But then again I said the same thing about ""Black Swan"" and that only won the one. ""The Artist"" is a film for everyone, it's oozing to the brim with sophistication, and if it was a woman it would charm me right into bed! It'll make you laugh and it just maybe might make you cry on a couple of occasions, but one things for sure it will make you full of absolute joy. ""The Artist"" is perfect, basically perfect, from start to finish."
"demented_peruvian","8","12","22","3 January 2012"," Interesting, mild fun but overrated
","""The Artist"" unfortunately cannot be reviewed at this moment in time without being aware of the hype manufactured by the Weinstein brothers - the producers of good-but-not-great movies that muscle their way into all of the award races. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with the Weinstein movies, it falls short of expectations.<br/><br/>On its own, ""The Artist"" is a fun experiment: let's shoot a silent black and white film, using many of the mechanisms of that film era, from cinematography to screenplay. In particular it imitates that romantic films of the time, as opposed to the more influential satires and fantasy/horror films. It goes as far as incorporating a variation on ""Lassie"". The actors are charming and there are some interesting metaphorical shots. It is clever at times, amusing and funny at turns, cheesy at others, mildly suspenseful towards the end, but consistent in its style, and it delivers on the romance. The few moments of sound provide such a contrast to the world of silent film (are we in a self-aware movie?) that they become the most memorable and admirable parts of the film.<br/><br/>However, it is so light that it would make Clara Bowen's ""It"" seem as heavy as ""Intolerance"". It is intentionally clichéd, but does not do anything with its references; we are expected to accept them as if we were a 1928 audience. We must accept the on screen relationships as such, and the characters do not escape beyond the 2-dimensional. There is little advantage taken of modern technology to develop more elaborate scenes.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" succeeds as a moderately fun recreation of 1920s and early 1930s cinema. However, the experiment perhaps would have been more interesting had the silent treatment been given to a modern story or to a deeper screenplay."
"MartynGryphon","10","10","18","24 January 2012"," A throwback to a bygone age.....and they nailed it to perfection!
","As a lover of both silent movies and early talkies, (as many of my other IMDb reviews prove), I was looking forward to seeing The Artist. However, this was not without a degree of trepidation. I've seen other movies try to parody the silent age using all the available clichés in the book. Flickery images, tinkling piano soundtrack etcetera. I was not expecting any different here.<br/><br/>The Artist is the perfect homage to the age and the most realistic reenactment of what the silent movie experience was really like, with a great orchestral score. Silent movies were often accompanied with 100 piece orchestras in the theatre playing emotive music composed specifically for the feature as displayed here in the opening scene.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give too much away on plot here but it centre's around a huge silent Hollywood movie star and a career ruined by the advent of sound. Sadly this was a scenario all too real for some actors, most notably John Gilbert, who tried his luck in talkies and failed and Douglas Fairbanks who retired from the screen immediately without even attempting a 'talkie', to whom lead actor Jean Dujardin, bears more than a resemblance.<br/><br/>The scenes with Dujardin & the dog reminded me so much of the interplay between William Powell & Asta of the thin man movies of the 30's and 40's.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is ripe with symbolism. The movie is silent because our hero feels he has no voice in the modern world which is brought home in a wonderful scene where everyone and everything has sound apart from him. This scene raised a smile and must have had the Foley boys working overtime to get right.<br/><br/>Bérénice Bejo is excellent as the young struggling actress Dujardin befriends, who's star ironically rises as his starts to fall. A nice little inter-title card declares mid-film, 'I want to be alone' a nice nod of the head there to Greta Garbo one of the greatest actresses of the silent age who in early talkies made that phrase her trademark.<br/><br/>My nod of the head goes to the film makers that made everything as authentic as possible from the fashions, the music, the cars and the interiors. Look out for some natty dancing from our two leads as well.<br/><br/>I've always loved silent movies and although this has been made over 80 years after the art form officially ceased to exist, this is one of the best. Will it revive the genre? Probably not. Will it encourage people to look outside the box and explore silent movies further? That's even less likely. Should it win every award it's nominated for? Certainly.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!!"
"redeyedtreefrog","10","9","16","13 February 2012"," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","Last night I went with a friend to see The Artist. We made a night of it with popcorn and coke and dinner after. I had read that it was about a silent film actor who felt threatened by the talkies. It was not until I went to see another movie and asked the lady at the counter if she had seen The Artist that I found out it was actually a silent film. My curiosity was immediately piqued. The next question was... who do I invite to go with me? Having settled that, it was off to the movies. I have two categories of movie 1. must see on big screen and 2. just as good on little screen. The Artist is best captured on big screen with the surrounding musical accompaniment. It was like stepping into a time machine. The visual and music quality were good enough to keep the interest of most ages but shot authentically enough to whisk you away to 1927. The acting left no doubt as to the story, the emotions. The script and timing could not have been more effective. I really got the feel of what it must have been like and I was intrigued to understand more about what it must have been like for my grandparents and great-grandparents. I had never really thought about the skill of the actors/actresses to be able to convey the story or how important music was. I had also never thought about how difficult it must have been to make the transition from 'exaggerated actions' to 'speaking ability relevance'. I can honestly recommend it for anyone living in 2012 - young people used to the special-effects of Avatar or old ones who actually lived in the silent film era. All the awards and the nominations are most deserved! Well done!!!"

","We sit watching the adverts and the trailers for the latest awful Hollywood rubbish - the ghastly War Horse and the UK's over-hyped Iron Lady (great impressionist is Ms Streep but that's it). Then, the curtains pull in - that's unusual - we go to 4x3. We go from Glorious colour (on the very day Kodak go into liquidation - I really cannot believe this). And, we small group of film lovers in a club for film lovers - The wonderful Harbour Lights in Southampton - become silent. And, for the next hour and forty minutes we do not watch so much as live in a world of no- colour and no dialogue. Left therefor to concentrate on the visuals and occasional subtitles. We enjoyed the endless subtleties and not so subtleties, the actors expressions and movements. We titter and some sob. And, some of us wondered why we needed colour (let alone 3D) or the constant noise and distraction of dialogue. So, why almost a masterpiece? Well, it was a little self-indulgent and there were some over-laboured scenes (presumably to help of US cousins to understand it). The conversation in the bar afterwards was so so positive - a rare thing. Tonight, I watched Ken Russel's Elgar - also B/W though some BBC fool had stretched it to 16x9 - though it was well graded. It was 43 years old and it was beautiful if clumsily operated. It too reminded me of Kodak and the end of an era."
"bcbell79","10","12","23","22 November 2011"," One of the years best, most charming films, a total gem
","The Academy of Motion Pictures ran a film series (here in L.A.) earlier this year, of some of histories best silent films. If the film I saw tonight, The Artist, had been released (yet) this film surely would have made the list. This is one of the most charming, funny, sweet, clever movies I have seen in years. Everything about this movie works and is executed to perfection. Due to the fact that I actually watched several silent films on the big screen earlier this year, I can say this film looks straight out of the 1920's and is one of the best reminder's of why America fell in love with the movies.<br/><br/>The Artist opens in 1927, to a packed movie theater enjoying another silent Hollywood film premiere. As the credits end, its star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin in a sure- fire Oscar nomination for Best Actor),who is strikingly similar to Douglas Fairbanks, walks onto the theaters' stage. Considering the man never udders a word throughout the whole film, it sounds funny to say I think he will get an Oscar nomination in the Best Actor category, but I do! And yup, I think The Artist's stunning leading lady Berenice Bejo will probably get nominated for her portrayal of Hollywood's favorite ""talkie"" star Peppy Miller. Peppy Miller (Bejo), an aspiring Hollywood actress, bumps into star George Valentin (Dujardin) leaving the opening film premiere, and there relationship continues over the nest several years. As his career fades with the silent film era, her career grows with the ""talkies"". There is delightful cast of characters peppered throughout the movie, played by actors such as James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell. <br/><br/>Do not let the fact that this film is in black and white and silent deter you. The music is so perfectly matched to every scene, and still authentic to the era. In fact, you guessed it, the music is so good I am sure that it will be nominated for Music (original score). And while i am predicting this films chances at the 2012 Oscars, adding to what I have already mentioned, I expect it to also get nominations for Art Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Directing, Film Editing, Makeup and Writing (original screenplay). This is a film that can't be given justice with description, it must be scene on the big screen. Go see The Artist and get transported back to a different era, and enjoy old Hollywood as you probably never have, or will again..."
"tpeterson1955","2","8","14","2 August 2012"," One of the worst films ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.
","THE ARTIST is definitely one of the worst films ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. I don't understand why the Academy went so ga-ga over it. <br/><br/>The Oscars lately have definitely gone to the wrong films, and it will be embarrassing in ten or fifteen years from now when people look back and see some of the dreadful choices that were made.<br/><br/>Some examples that come to mind: CRASH; THE HURT LOCKER (better than AVATAR? In a pig's ear); and THE KING'S SPEECH (a good film...but not that good).<br/><br/>And going back a bit further: SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART 2; THE STING; THE FRENCH CONNECTION; BRAVEHEART; Technically the film looks pretty good: the production design, costumes, film editing and music score are excellent, but it didn't do a thing for me and I was very disappointed in it.<br/><br/>And I'm surprised this won the Golden Globe award for Best Film: Comedy or Musical. As a comedy it wasn't remotely funny from start to finish, and the snappy tap dance routine at the end of the film was good but nothing when compared with SINGIN' IN THE RAIN which it copies so slavishly from.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin's performance was not Oscar worthy despite a few good moments here and there and his co-star, Bérénice Bejo was extremely irritating as Peppy Miller. Ugh! But Dujardin looks like an early 1930's star like Ronald Colman or Douglas Fairbanks. At least ther dog was funny! He gave the only Oscar-worthy performance in the film.<br/><br/>But why was the film silent? Surely if we had a comparison with George's films being campy and silent and Peppy's being a quantum leap in entertainment replete with sound, we would have seen how deluded George was.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1929. Why? By that time, most films would have been all talking. Remember Al Jolson's THE JAZZ SINGER, made in 1927, was a silent film that had a few talking sequences thrown in to make it the first ""talkie"". By the end of 1928 all the studios had converted to sound, and by 1929...well...there wouldn't have been any silent films at all.<br/><br/>When George goes to see one of Peppy's talking films, why can't we hear her speak? I don't get it. I know that George Valetin does not embrace this new talking picture fad as just that: a fad that sound will not last. His ""nightmare"" is truly that: he can hear sounds but cannot make any of his own. When he laughs at his co-star acting out a scene from Shakespeare it would have been a perfect comedy moment: her voice could have been terrible like Jean Hagen's character Lina Lamont in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, and we could have laughed at her with him.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks' 1976 film SILENT MOVIE was at least genuinely funny, colorful and witty. As Mel Brooks said in an interview about the film: ""We didn't need sound for that one because ""the visual jokes were laid thick and fast with no let up.""<br/><br/>THE ARTIST was a brave step for any director to make but I was still really annoyed by it all."

He meets a young dancer, Pepe Miller, who is set to go places in in the movie industry.<br/><br/>The film is largely silent with a wonderful musical score which soars. The black and white background lend itself the the nostalgic feeling and evokes the right emotion.<br/><br/>I must mention the little dog which stole the show. He is Valentin's faithful companion throughout all his trials. The dog is so good, he almost deserves his own award.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer."

Maybe it's just me but Jean Dujardin reminded me a little of Gene Kelly. Uggie (the dog) is marvelous - I don't know why he hasn't been nominated. I would call it a 'movie lovers movie', it has nods (or maybe winks) to 'Sunset Boulevard', 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Mark of Zorro'. Although this is a silent movie, there are moments of sound playfully executed. The story is relatively simple - how does an established star cope when trends and technology change faster then he wishes they would? There are a couple of nits I could pick, but why?

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","8","8","14","19 January 2012"," Such magnificence!
","Such magnificence! As advertised, The Artist is an enthralling love letter that captures the silent film era of cinema with such aplomb; a captivating recreation of a time long passed. I can't even say that I'm an enthusiast of silent cinema, but the throwback here by writer/director Michel Hazanavicius and everyone else involved makes me want to be. He fills it to the top with such charm and loveliness, it's one of those films where you can feel the adoration of it's creator pouring over every frame. The film is getting a lot of attention and appreciation for this unique style, but it also excels in the very basic ideas of what makes a film work.<br/><br/>The Artist is built around the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star whose light begins to fade as talking pictures arrival in Hollywood and what begins as this charming love letter to silent cinema becomes a fascinating and emotional journey with a complex character. Valentin is charming and handsome, but his success has led him to become quite smug and arrogant, mugging for the cameras and ignoring everyone who helped him get where he is. When the spotlight moves away from him, and towards new stars like Berenice Bejo's plucky Peppy Miller, he's forced to take a look at himself and what he doesn't like what he sees.<br/><br/>French star Jean Dujardin takes this character on a roller coaster emotional journey and the road he's taken down has some very strong emotional highs and lows. Critics of the film have often cited that it's ""too light"", but I couldn't disagree with this more. I was surprised by the depths of despair the film took me down with a Depression time period giving it an interesting social relevance and some heartbreaking moments of devastation for Valentin. In spite of all of his arrogance, the man still seems to have a heart of gold and Dujardin plays him with a charm that won me over pretty quickly and got me very invested in him.<br/><br/>The film is certainly the child of Hazanavicius, whom you can feel in every moment, but Dujardin is a revelation in the leading role. The character of Valentin goes through a wealth of development during the film and he plays each scene expertly, fully embodying this person. When we meet him he is all about mugging for the camera and basking in his spotlight, all charm and no depth, but as he sinks further into depression and isolation we begin to explore what the man is made of deep down and it's a fascinating journey into his mind. Stripping away an actor's use of speech, you would have expected it to be a very internal performance, but I was blown away by how outwardly emotive Dujardin was able to be here.<br/><br/>This is one of those roles that you feel someone was born to play, as he uses his body language and that unbelievably expressive face to portray a wealth of emotions, along with some intimately internal work along the way. With his unique, charming and winning chemistry with all of the actors, from the glowing Bejo to James Cromwell as the resilient driver to Uggie the dog, he commands every moment of this film. Hazanivicius is responsible for all of it, but Dujardin completely owns it.<br/><br/>The Artist is memorable in just about every way, especially in it's astounding recreation of an era long gone. Film has evolved so much over the decades, but somehow everyone involved here was able to transport themselves and the audience back to the silent era. It's truly remarkable, even just on a technical level. From the way it's shot and edited to something as basic as the way the actors act, going for broad strokes as opposed to the more ""natural"" acting we experience today.<br/><br/>With this, we were given a gift of a film that one hundred percent feels like it comes to us from another time period. With a bounty of instantly classic scenes, from the dancing legs to the climatic ""Look what you've become..."", this is a true winner that is an absolute crowd-pleaser but also surprised me with it's dark themes and emotional depths. I have to admit that this didn't seem like the kind of film I would have taken to, but it absolutely won me over in every way."
"DICK STEEL","10","8","14","24 December 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Artist
","Who would have thought that the trio of writer-director Michel Hazanavicius, his wife actress Berenice Bejo and actor Jean Dujardin, all probably better known for their comical spoof of the spy genre with the OSS 117 movies, could have pull out all the stops and made such an affecting romantic film that epitomizes all things great about an era of cinema long gone, providing that pitch perfect nostalgic feel and homage to the black and white greats of the old days where films meant dressing up, the acting almost always exaggerated, the reading of inter-titles, with a live orchestra at the front of the hall playing the soundtrack and providing the emotional cues of the film. The Artist has been picking up accolades and gaining traction in the cinemas toward the various award seasons, and it certainly deserves all the hype and kudos that are coming its way.<br/><br/>Hazanavicius' story deals with the classic tale of rags to riches, and riches to rags, set against the backdrop of the old Hollywood and star system, where recognized stars can command just about the world's attention, and a junior artists can aspire to be at the top of the fame game one day if opportunities, chance and fate all smile their way. It's two stories joint at the hip, one focused on the story of famous mega film star George Valentin (Dujardin), ubiquitous hero of the silent film era, now faced with the possibility of extinction given his studio's growing interest toward the talkies, and his adamant belief that talking pictures is nothing but a passing fad, snug at his position at the top of his career. But this pride and arrogance bear no prisoners when audience attitude and technology change, and George soon fades into oblivion more quickly than his rise and stay to fleeting fame.<br/><br/>The other, parallel story of course deals with actress Peppy Miller (Bejo), who literally bumps into Valentin during the premiere of his latest movie, and progressed from obscurity to a big break given by Valentin himself, who had also offered her a beauty tip that changed her career fortunes for the better, or rather assisted in her stratospheric boost in film fortune. She moves from cameos to support roles and finally marquee large productions, with a flamboyant personality to boot that helped her heaps, becoming the darling of Tinseltown and enjoying an equivalent status and perks associated that George himself had once enjoyed.<br/><br/>Not everyone survived the transition from silent films to talkies, and The Artist doesn't sugar coat it all. With the transition, new stars get born while older ones faded away, especially when their real voices failed to match up to what audiences had imagined during their heydays, and rejection at the big screen was easy given a new lineup of stars all primed to take advantage of the new medium. While watching The Artist it brought back to mind some memories of the good old days where I took on a course module just so to watch Pulp Fiction, but got enthralled by the fascinating silent, black and white classic films such as King Vidor's The Crowd, and The Son of the Sheik starring Rudolph Valentino, amongst other greats.<br/><br/>Technically Hazanavicius' film can't get any better than this, and his meticulous research during pre-production shows in the delicate touches put in the film, from costumes and dressing, to set and art direction, right down to the technical details of framing, camera, and transitional scene techniques used to tell the silent film story right. His story here is one that is filled with strong irony throughout, crafting an incredibly moving and humbling tale of being grateful to those responsible in any way for one's success in any form. For a modern filmmaker, Hazanavicius did everything right in recreating the spirit of silent films, complete with powerful, all-encompassing music by Ludovic Bource to set the tone, emotions and mood right from beginning until the final scene.<br/><br/>Even the acting by the leads were all spot on for the era, who gotten it all right in both their larger gestures and subtleties. Jean Dujardin made his George Valentin believable as the famous movie star, and will have you feel for his character as he bet big on his own abilities and lost to the winds of change, and had to endure further whammies to his life in the form of the Great Depression. He possesses that flair and airs of the star from yesteryear, and is an absolute delight to watch on screen, more than justifying his Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actor. Berenice Bejo too owned her role, sharing fantastic chemistry opposite Dujardin as the woman is forever indebted to her idol for everything good coming her way, and is trying her earnest best to reciprocate as best as she can during times of dire straits. The support cast of James Cromwell, John Goodman and Penelope Ann Miller were great, but none stood out other than Uggie the Jack Russell Terrier who single handedly stole the limelight each time it's on screen!<br/><br/>Ask anyone these days to watch a black and white, silent film and you'll probably be scoffed at, but to anyone who has not watched The Artist, it is truly their loss. I only hope that this will spur many of us who have been bedazzled by large scale special effects in almost every modern film, to take a look back into the rich and early days of film to identify the few gems yet to be experienced, and take that bold step to appreciate them once more. The ending couldn't be more perfect as it heralded yet another era of films, that hammers it all home again that The Artist had hit all its intended marks set forth, especially putting that belief in cinema back again. Highly recommended and a definite entry into any year end lists this year. Do NOT miss this masterpiece!"

","To be fair there is little of substance happening in 'The Artist'. It tells a fairly conventional and frankly kind of cliché story about rags to riches to rags. 'The Artist' isn't really about anything other than pure emotion. It's a sentimental film designed to really invoke a response in it's audience and it does it beautifully. Is the film sappy? Yes, no doubt but it's delicious sap. Watching 'The Artist' is like watching the best of Capra corn, it invokes a feeling of joy that you can only get from watching a movie whose sole goal is to make someone smile. 'The Artist' achieves this effect far more effectively than any recent 'Forrest Gump' caliber knock off. <br/><br/>Jean Dujardin is absolutely brilliant in the title role. Silent film acting is more than just pantomime. There has to be give and take with your surroundings and your fellow cast members. Dujardin gives a performance that feels as if it could have come out of the 20's. He embodies Chaplin, Fairbanks, Keaton, and in the darker moments of the film I was pleased to see a little Lon Chaney as well. Dujardin while playing a humorous role gives his character a lot of dignity. That is why the silent clowns still endure. What makes this an exceptional performance though is that Dujardin really embraces the tragedy of this insecure character. I love the fact that this Fairbanks persona hides a deeply insecure man. The film is built around hearing his voice and there is a progression to it in the character which is very satisfying. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is in love with the silent era but I somewhat question whether it truly captured it's essence. The film for better or worse paints a very romanticized and verily predictable picture of silent era Hollywood. I don't really know if this is enough to sustain a film. We know the general story as it has been explained in countless Hollywood lure films like 'Singin in the Rain'. I kind of wanted to find out more about Valentin and where he came from. The film begins with him being on top of the world but I think it would have been interesting to see his beginnings. I'd like to see maybe Valentin doing a vaudeville act and him being discovered. I think it would have made the character rounder and would have allowed the audience a broader picture of the entertainment at the time. If this film had been made in sound with the same script it probably would have been forgotten despite it's sweetness. I think that is really what is to be said about the film.<br/><br/>Is 'The Artist' a gimmick? Probably but you know what it is a lovely gimmick that is done pitch perfectly. DuJardin is a joy to watch and the film looks beautiful. It may not be an ambitious or deep film but it is honest and sincere and fun."

","The words in the title of this review are just some of the ones that you might find yourself using after watching this film.<br/><br/>I cannot even begin to describe how oddly simple and oddly amazing this film is. I was excited to go and see it 1. because it was nominated for so many Oscars and 2. that it was playing in 2 theaters in the City of Toronto right now. I can't believe how lucky I was to be able to see this at the Cineplex Varsity Cinema. I won't go into too much detail about the theatre but let's just say that the auditoriums themselves are very..intimate. There's maybe 100 seats in the theatre! Very tiny auditoriums. This is all relevant to the review though because, even though I was excited to go and see The Artist, walking into the auditorium was a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>This feeling was short lived though. As soon as the lights went down and the movie began I instantly realized that this type of auditorium was probably the best way to watch this film in. Just everything about it. The movie really gives off that old school silent film vibe (obviously) and being in a very intimate setting made me forget about 2012 and made me pretend to be in the early 1900's.<br/><br/>And that is another thing. This film forces you to insert-your-emotion-here many times. It knows exactly what it wants from the audience. This is obviously due to the fact that it is a silent film but the point I am trying to make is that it sucks you into it's story and everything with immense grace. I and many around me when I looked the odd time had a smile on our faces for nearly the entire film. You don't quite get this pleasure as much anymore in this modern day so I was pleasantly surprised and knew from the start that I would likely be smiling like a fool for the whole film!<br/><br/>I walked into the theatre with high hopes and expectations on this cold Tuesday in Toronto and I left delighted. <br/><br/>Simply blown-away by this masterpiece. <br/><br/>If you have a chance to go and see this film before the Oscars I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING SO. But be warned: you are going to leave feeling invigorated with amazement!<br/><br/>10/10, 5/5, however you want to rate it: this film is near perfection.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

","I think Hollywood has lost it's collective mind by giving a best picture Oscar to a black and white mostly silent movie in the 1.33 to 1 format. There is a reason movies started to move away from that format in the 1930s - IT IS BORING and is like looking at TV dramas from the 50s. What has happened here is that the Hollywood elite and the critics and not real movie goers have gotten all caught up in the artistry of making an old time movie today. Aside from the technical issues, the story itself is just barely interesting and can't keep your attention thru the whole movie. Do yourself a favor and save your money. If you must see this picture wait until it is on TCM at 4 in the morning in 5 or so years where they play all the old silent movies almost no one watches."

"SnorrSm1989","9","7","12","12 March 2012"," A lost world reemerges
","The cessation of silent films, Leslie Wood acknowledged in her book ""Romance of the Movies,"" is a tragedy which ""will probably not last."" Thus sounded her prediction in 1935; by that time, five years had passed since silent films were declared prehistoric, but Wood was still bold enough to estimate its possibilities of a comeback as probable. Sadly, in this case being bold was being far too bold. Although there has emerged certain film-makers since that time confident (and powerful) enough to make films visibly influenced by the silents, such as Jacques Tati, 'silent films' has remained a term to define a bygone era. I suppose Michel Hazanavicius' THE ARTIST came as a slight surprise to most of us, then; even more unexpected was its commercial success. But the one thing that truly astounded me was how the film managed to give me that same explicit, unexplainable ""feeling"" which my favorite authentic silents do; witty in some places and dark in others, THE ARTIST reminded me of just why I love silent films so much.<br/><br/>The story is quite easy to summarize. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of motion- pictures' hottest attractions, handsome and irresistibly charming in high-budget adventure films of the day (obvious Douglas Fairbanks-association here). However, his success seems doomed after the arrival of ""talkies"" towards the end of the 1920's, combined with the outburst of the Great Depression. As his own popularity fades, a young actress whom he once helped rises to superstardom; Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is declared the new ""sweetheart"" of the movies, as she fondly embraces the new aspect of the medium (her charm brings Clara Bow to mind). However, she has not forgotten how Valentin once helped her; and there, in essence, is your story. The relationship between John Gilbert and Greta Garbo is an inevitable association; Gilbert had enjoyed a phenomenal career as a leading actor during the late silent era, but vanished from the screen after it turned out that his voice did not match his image (or so, at least, the official story goes). Garbo made him do a comeback, albeit with limited results.<br/><br/>Some reviewers of THE ARTIST have objected to the apparent simplicity of its plot, claiming that the sole reason for its success has to do with its status as a novelty. This claim, I think, misses the whole point; yes, the story of a fading celebrity is very basic, and hardly new (Chaplin's film LIMELIGHT comes to mind, as well as Hjalmar Bergman's 1930's novel ""Jac the Clown""). But THE ARTIST would never have achieved such success as it has only due to an aspect of freshness; a less clever director could easily have ended up doing a parody on the medium, and thus provided more nutrition to the myth that silent films merely consist of funny-lookin' jabbernowls running at an impossibly high speed-rate. Despite some meta-references to the medium of silent films throughout (a title card saying ""BANG!"" being one example), director Hazanavicius has not made a parody, but a beautiful film which made me laugh in some parts, and so teary-eyed in others I almost felt pathetic. By using a relatively simple story as its foundation, Hazanavicius demonstrates that 'silent films,' contrary to common belief, is an art form that deserves to be evaluated on its own terms, rather than being viewed as a primitive fore-runner to talking pictures. For if the depth is not so dominant within the story, it is certainly present in the visual narrative; every shot, angle and gesture is significant, and both the witty comedies of King Vidor (THE PATSY and SHOW PEOPLE, both 1928) and the expressionistic work of F.W. Murnau frequently come to mind. The performers are of equal importance, of course, and both Dujardin and Bejo are phenomenal, sensitive and extremely charismatic at the same time. A special mention should also go to Valentin's dog; both Rin-Tin-Tin and Roscoe Arbuckle's Luke the Dog would have bowed in respect.<br/><br/>One final question worth asking, perhaps, is whether Leslie Wood's prediction, that silent films are likely to reappear on a regular basis again, will come true after the success of THE ARTIST? Probably not. But at the very least, I do hope the film will encourage more people to seek out the very best silent films. If you cared for THE ARTIST, I see no reason why you would not appreciate films such as THE BIG PARADE (1925), SUNRISE: A LOVE STORY (1927) or THE CROWD (1928). By the mid-1920's, the best of film actors and directors had, once and for all, begun to trust the intelligence of viewers; understatement had become the trend in pantomime, whereas directors less relied on title- cards, instead more often conveying depth and subtle nuances through purely visual expression. Much of this was sadly lost again when talkies arrived, as all too many film- makers then adopted a use of dialogue reminiscent of the exaggerated frequency of title- cards in the early silent days. Of course, thanks to CITIZEN KANE and a handful of other films, visual experimentation was eventually re-discovered, but THE ARTIST still reminds us that while talkies may have lots of advantages, the decline of silent films was indeed a very sorry thing."

","Finally the Oscar goes to a good movie. Kind of Ironic it is French and silent. But it is very touching. First of all, it has something that the recent movies of Hollywood lack: a good story that is well told. Not only did they have a good plot, excellent cast, a ""four legged actor"", but they also manage to tell the story in a comprehensive way with the right amount of details to depict the life ( from glory to downfall and then back to an emerging career again ) of the main character. It has also brought fun back to the big screen, a romantic story without being too dramatic and yet able to capture the atmosphere of that changing time. It is a truly remarkable production, something we did not see for a long time in the big screen. I just can thank all of those who got involved in this project and truly believe that the seventh art is beyond mere special effects ( which are important, of course, but should not be considered as the sole reason of making a movie, as it has been lately ) – Thank God it is NOT in 3D !! - I know the movie industry is going through changes nowadays. Perhaps the answer is in the past, as it concerns which direction it should take.. Anyways, it's a great movie and the art is back to the Theaters !!!"
"jburtroald95","9","10","19","17 February 2012"," An earnest piece of innovative cinema
","I will admit that at times I approach a classic silent film with a slight bit of reluctance. Some might find the little quirks of the grainy, blotchy film reels from which it has been garnered part of their charm and the historical experience, but realistically, I find it quite distracting when trying to genuinely lose myself in the film. The same goes to the richly textured black and white aesthetic and the absence of synchronised sound; sometimes I just feel trapped in a prison of deafness and colour blindness, and I feel that I will go mad if I don't see colour or hear an environmental sound very soon. I also get tired of watching hyperactive characters that look and sound like circus clowns bumbling around scary cardboard cut-outs as instruments of a very cheesy plot.<br/><br/>Although, given the period, these aspects that would now be considered deficiencies can be forgiven and enable us to appreciate the film for what it is. However, the idea of such a film being made in contemporary times seems very silly and self-indulgent, an expectation that was fulfilled entirely in all its second-rate glory with Dr Plonk (2007). As this year's The Muppets and Hugo have shown us, what works with a revival of an old genre of franchise is to embrace the past while still acknowledging the future.<br/><br/>Yes, The Artist is certainly a silent film, but it doesn't try to fool us into thinking that it was in the '20s. Many traditional conventions are used, but French writer/director Michel Hazanavicius doesn't restrict himself to them. The film is a reflection of the era, and focuses mainly on its dying days. The death of silent films was, of course, the talkies, which came gawkily at the beginning of the 30s, violently uprooting old luminaries such as our main character and taking at least a couple of years to find its own footing.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is the cocky and charismatic megastar George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who is as French as his name would suggest, but since voice was then irrelevant in a screen actor's bank of skills, his foreign accent is in no way an inhibition for him in Hollywood as it was tragically for Bela Lugosi just a decade afterwards. He frequently milks his applause at film premier's pushing aside his disgruntled co-star Constance (Missi Pyle) and casually disregarding the feelings of his long-suffering wife (Penelope Ann Miller) by flirting and giggling with his female fans: but it's all good comical fun at least for the audience. As one can imagine, he is coasting along well until the industry suddenly veers off into territory that he is unable to walk on.<br/><br/>Acclaimed film critic David Stratton described the plot as ""part Singin' in the Rain and part A Star is Born"" which is quite true, but only on the most superficial level. After the beginning of the sound movement, the cheery laughter goes out with a bang as Valentin views on of Constance's sound tests and takes it to be a joke, but as soon as the austere studio executive Al Zimmer (John Goodman) declares ""This isn't a joke! This is the future!"" the gags are reduced to a scant serving of ironic chuckles and we see a downsized Valentin plummet into a bottomless pit of despair and disillusionment. He doesn't just struggle to make the transition; the change has thrown him into a miserable exile. Meanwhile, the lively Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) a hapless and helplessly devoted old fan is taking a piece of Valentin's guidance to make herself the flourishing It girl of the new age, making cavalier comments to the press on the previous era that are similar to my complaints made in the opening paragraph. The timeless question of whether to judge people on their actions or the intentions behind them is then added to the melancholy world of the redundant cultural has-been that makes this a truly meaningful piece.<br/><br/>David also said ""it's a real feel-good movie"", which is partly true, but again only if one looks at the light-hearted, carefree beginning, the uplifting ending, and the loyal little dog that does the cute tricks that everyone is always talking about. I could go on quoting from that episode of At the Movies, but perhaps I should stop here. They said many things that I don't agree with, for even though the three of us would give the film the same rating, we all apparently liked it for quite different reasons. I admired the creativity of the silent film that is about silent movies, and the clever and rather bold use of synchronised sound in some parts to show the changing times and attitudes.<br/><br/>Our enthusiastic cast features an eye-catching display of familiar faces and proved talent trying something new. However, John Goodman, James Cromwell and Malcolm McDowell aren't here to dominate the picture as a cowardly insurance policy. Arguably, the only safe route taken by this picture is the upbeat ending and the adorable dog, the rest is quite bold and ambitious. The film ultimately belongs to its splendid French leads, who exude a natural nostalgic charm as though they've always been silent film stars, and thrive on the freedom that the absence of spoken dialogue gives them. It is a shock to hear Dujardin's strikingly European accent at the very end, for at that point we had for some time stopped seeing him as a French man, and simply thought of him as a man. Hopefully, that will ensure that he nabs this year's Oscar for best actor."

What makes this movie special was that it was made in today's age of in-your-face big special effects and CGI bells and whistles, but in the end, it doesn't stand out as one of the great silent movies ever made.

"Turfseer","4","12","24","5 February 2012"," The Count of Monte Cristo meets The Little Rascals meets A Star is Born meets Sunset Boulevard meets Citizen Kane
","The Weinstein Brothers strike again by bringing French director Michael Hazanavicius' silent film tribute, 'The Artist', to the United States, now in the running for possible Oscar Gold. To my recollection, silent films wore out their welcome way back in 1927, and only something strikingly original, should be considered for the Academy's highest honor. While Hazanavicius does his best at technically putting together the kind of film they made in the silent era (and he certainly doesn't get 'everything' right), story wise, his narrative is completely derivative. There's nary a single original idea in the entire picture.<br/><br/>Hazanavicius' protagonist is George Valentin, obviously named after silent screen legend himself, Rudolph Valentino. Valentin's character, a heartthrob before the advent of the talkies, is modeled historically more on silent screen star, John Gilbert, than Valentino. After the introduction of the talkies, Gilbert's career fell apart, not because the sound of his voice didn't sit well with audiences now accustomed to 'talking pictures', but because he was saddled with inferior scripts and the one or two good pictures he was in, did not find wide favor with the public. Like Valentin in 'The Artist', Gilbert also proceeded to self-destruct by embracing the bottle.<br/><br/>The Artist's narrative is based both on films from the silent era as well some classic sound pictures. 'The Count of Monte Cristo', one of Gilbert's well-known silent era films as well as Douglas Fairbanks' 'The Three Musketeers"" are alluded to when Valentin is seen in one of the 'pictures within a picture', playing an action hero swordsman. Silent era melodrama is also referenced when Valentin's dog, Jack, alerts a policeman on the beat, who runs into the fading screen star's home, and saves him from a raging fire. I can't help being reminded of the early sound serial, 'The Little Rascals', where dogs are used to a more comic effect. Early in 'The Artist', Jack is featured in an amusing bit, running to and fro, on stage.<br/><br/>While there are many allusions to actual silent films and very early talkies in 'The Artist', the basic plot is derived from two later classic 'sound' films. In 'The Artist', Valentin, a once successful actor, now in sad decline after a successful career, finds himself supplanted by a love interest, who has gone on to a successful career of her own as a celebrity actor, but offers to rescue him out of both feelings of love and guilt. This in essence is the story of 'A Star Is Born', made in the 30s and later revived in the 50s, as a Judy Garland vehicle. One also cannot ignore the parallels to 'Sunset Boulevard', which features a story that in part revolves around the movie studio system. 'The Artist' even has its own chauffeur, Clifton, played by James Cromwell, that echos the chauffeur role in 'Sunset Boulevard', famously played by Erich Von Stroheim. Should I also mention how Mr. Hazanavicius can't help himself throw in a bit from 'Citizen Kane'? When Valentin uncovers all his auctioned effects which Peppy had purchased for him, it's a scene completely reminiscent from 'Citizen Kane', where all of Kane's property sits in storage, covered by similar white cloths. And what of Hazanavicius' lazy use of music composed by Bernard Hermann, associated with both Orson Welles and Hitchcock? It seems that Ludovic Bource simply ran out of ideas and perhaps was unable to complete the score. A more likely scenario is that Hazanavicius simply wanted to save money by licensing Hermann's Hitchcock soundtrack. <br/><br/>There is little point in rehashing the details of Hazanvicius' derivative and pointless plot. Suffice it to say, it's Valentin who ironically discovers kindly Peppy Martin, after she accidentally crashes through a roped off area of Valentin groupies, and is photographed by paparazzi. After sad sack Valentin feels sorry for himself after falling from grace as a silent screen star and Peppy becomes famous in the talkies, he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself. Leave it to Jack to save him along with Peppy, who recalls that Valentin is actually a talented dancer, and suggests to the Kinograph studio honcho, that they could make a great pair, as the next Rogers and Astaire-like dance team. <br/><br/>If 'The Artist' has any value, is in its fairly faithful recreation of a bygone era. It's fun watching how director Hazanavicius utilizes the costumes, makeup and set design, as well as the many techniques of silent film era cinematography to create the final product, which best can be described as a 'loving tribute'. Nonetheless, Hazanavicius has chosen merely to emulate the traditional conventions of the silent film era than create an original, final product. One is reminded more of a 'B' melodrama from that era than one of the classics, such as the kind proffered up by a Chaplin or Keaton.<br/><br/>It's a sad state of affairs when a less than mediocre story, created in a now defunct style of filmmaking (which was put to rest over seventy years ago), garners some of the top awards from the chief pundits in today's film industry. It only goes to show how hard up the film industry is, in its ability to discover and promote quality scripts, instead resorting to the dubious tactic of reaching back to yesteryear, for ill-advised inspiration."

It made me hesitate for months before I got to watching it. That was a mistake!<br/><br/>The Artist is certainly different, and it takes a few minutes to get used to, but with 'losing' sound it hasn't lost any of its potential to grab the audience and pull it into a true cinematic story from the old days. Rather, while the story is quite simple the lack of dialogue forces you to actively 'see' what's going on, which engages the audience (us!) much more, and much more intimately. You don't need to be a die- hard 1920s fan to be entertained by this film!<br/><br/>The film itself is a simple love-story between a proud actor (obviously modeled after Douglas Fairbanks, I thought) who falls hard when Hollywood switches from silent to 'talkies', and the upcoming actress he discovered who shines in the new, talking, cinema.<br/><br/>So if you hesitate because it's a silent B&W (or because you, rightfully, think 5 Oscars out of 10 nominations was a bit of an overreaction): don't, you won't regret seeing it!"
"Galina_movie_fan","10","6","10","1 February 2012"," The Charm of Silence
","I don't know if ""The Artist"" is the best movie of 2011 but it is certainly the most charming, original and unexpected. To make in 2011, in the age of the breathtaking and jaw-dropping video possibilities, sound techniques and rapidly becoming the common place 3D, the authentically looking and feeling black and white SILENT movie just like they made them back in 1927, takes guts, talent, and deep and tender love and admiration for above mentioned movies. It takes the director/writer who not only had a dream of bringing the long gone era of cinema's adolescence on big screen but made his dream come true. It takes two basically unknown to the American audiences French actors who were splendid as the stars of the silent pictures in the silent picture (Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo). They were helped by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, and Malcolm McDowell). Let's not forget one special four-legged artist (or there were three of them?) - the cutest, smartest, and most loyal dog that ever graced the screen. <br/><br/>I wanted to see the film since I first read about and I expected to like it but I did not expect it to be not only technically perfect and very funny but also melodramatic in the best, sadly almost lost now, meaning of the word. I expected more lighthearted comedy but it is more tragic comedy. It is easy to overdo the melodrama but it never happened with The Artist. It is beautiful, romantic, funny, and spectacular. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are the best silent era couple on screen since well.. the end of the silent movies era.<br/><br/>As I am writing, ""The Artist"" is one of the major contenders for the Best Picture of the year Oscar having received already the awards from many prestigious organizations and made the countless critics lists. Ironically, in the case of ""The Artist"" to be noticed and heard meant to go completely silent. Is it not miraculous? Another observation - language of cinema is truly international: one of the sweetest love letters to the Hollywood's early years is created by a European director, French Michel Hazanavicius. His film speaks the native film language that involves the images, gestures, eyes, faces, and most importantly - the soul to perfection. It speaks clearly and loudly to movie lovers everywhere.

"EUyeshima","8","6","10","5 December 2011"," Dujardin is Extraordinary in a Silent Screen Tribute Made from the Heart
","To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinée idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then."" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a ""meet-cute"" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another ""meet-cute"" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard ""A Star Is Born"" storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise"" and King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.<br/><br/>Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. Bérénice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.<br/><br/>The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as ""Singin' in the Rain"". By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from ""The Thin Man"" series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's ""Vertigo"" score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not a film for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat."
"pontifikator","6","9","17","12 February 2012"," It didn't speak to me
","It's a silent movie in black and white. I'm perfectly willing to accept it on its own terms as silent; it didn't come across as a gimmick to me. And I take it as a black and white -- not gimmick there, either.<br/><br/>Still, ""The Artist"" didn't speak to me. I'm accustomed to watching silent movies, and I'm used to longer scenes, superbly composed camera shots of empty sets or of actors sitting silently as they muse. ""The Artist"" seemed to me to be completely contemporary in its compositions and pacing. Where others see a paean to the lost art of silent film-making, I saw a contemporary movie that happened to be in black and white and silent. <br/><br/>It quickly became apparent that ""The Artist"" was a take off on ""A Star Is Born"" with a tip of the fedora to ""Singin' in the Rain"" -- which tipped me off it would have a happy ending. Sure enough, our hero, a star of the silent screen, laughs off the advent of talkies and becomes a has-been while the girl he meets and introduces to motion pictures becomes a talking sensation. I judge the movie to be about a half-hour too long, dragging us along as our hero sinks into oblivion, alcohol, and poverty, while the heroine becomes the talk of the country in talkies.<br/><br/>There was one scene which I found riveting. In a sequence after he dismisses talkies, our hero is in his dressing room and rattles a glass. It's the first sound we hear from the movie. He's startled, and he makes noises among the objects on his dressing table as if the world in which he lived had been silent before but now there's sound. But he himself could not speak. We see him silently scream at his image in the mirror. Then he wakes up sweating from a dream. It was a fascinating thing to do -- to have sound effects without dialogue in a silent movie. I thought it dramatized his fears very well while commenting on the nature of silent movies by stepping outside the bounds of the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot was obvious, the actors did not do anything I thought amazing with their silent roles, and the cinematography was too modern for my tastes. It was an interesting experiment, and I won't say it failed, but it did not bring me into their world as other movies have done.<br/><br/>I recommend contrasting this movie with Fritz Lang's talkie ""M,"" where Lang uses sound but has long stretches of utter silence as we watch the characters interact with each other and their world. ""M"" has the best use of sound I can recall. Lang's ""Metropolis"" is a silent film that I recommend for his brilliant compositions and lingering portraits of his actors. ""Metropolis"" was released in 1927, the year ""The Artist"" is set in at the beginning."

"mistarkus","6","13","27","28 December 2011"," Contemporary Silent Film a Classic?
","The artist is a smartly crafted tribute to movies from the silent era. Everything from the sets, to hair and outfits to the overly exaggerated expressions, to even the late 20s mentality brought us back to movies from that time period. The actors expertly emphasized the over the top emotions which are needed since verbal expression is not possible. The as minimal as possible shots of written words to convey a statement, as was done in silent films from the past, was a fun aspect that showed how minor a role words actually play in order to convey a story by film.<br/><br/>It was a nice tribute and it excellently mocked those old silent movies however The Artist is not a classic as those old silent films are. I think when a silent film is revisited it is not so much for its entertainment value but rather for its value as a classic as a art form in its infancy, perhaps to get a sense of the time period or perhaps to touch on film history by witnessing legendary actors or filmmakers. It was impossible for The Artist to achieve this level or any level of nostalgic classic nor will it since it is a contemporary parody.<br/><br/>As a silent film and as a mimic of those old silent films it had a cumbersome pacing at times. It was rather light hearted and didn't have as much as that interesting psychological dark edge as other similar stories that explored a Hollywood star that is once on top, loses it all and is no longer relevant has; think Sunset Boulevard. There were also much more entertaining movies made about the advent of talkies and the impact it had on actors from the time period, think Singing in the Rain.<br/><br/>The Artist is mildly entertaining, with a premise that felt revisited. It was a comfortable tribute that expertly recreated films from the 1920s."
"mayurdeepz","9","5","8","8 February 2012"," An analogue admirer's analysis
","After waiting for about 2 months since I first watched the trailer and more than 5 since I first heard about it, I finally managed to watch ""The Artist"". Between then and the night before last, I've grown accustomed to hearing only the superlatives and most glorious adjectives in reference to the movie. Although none from my close friends, I am referring to my favourite pastimes like Facebook, Twitter, American Cinematography Magazine, Total Film, Time Magazine to just name a few. Apart from setting unimaginable expectations in the sub conscious, it did generate a sense of delirious excitement in me, while I sat down for the experience. Here's what I think, how it fared.<br/><br/>The Artist is an accomplished piece of work that should / would appeal to a wide spectrum of cine goers across the world. But ""a lump in the throat"" is reserved for the absolute fanatic of the craft. In my books, I consider myself a member of such a make belief club. Before I indulge in the sparkles and the fireworks, the movie managed to create while watching it and right after, let me get into some of the facts.This is as much as some may hate to accept, is a French production shot on location in Los Angeles and includes various craftsmen from both French cinema and Hollywood. But in true heart and soul this is an American story of the industry that sells dreams and most successfully so.There have been many stories about it in the past and so will be in future; that may have or will manage to tell it successfully and some not so much. The Artist, I perceive will have a special place amongst them all, a first among equals if You'd like. At a time, where the advent and renaissance of ""Social Media"" has brought fans of cinema and the ones who don the grease paints to unbelievable and sometimes unacceptable proximities, the process has inadvertently led to considerable degeneration of the mist that surrounds them and their lives outside the spot light, between ""cut"" and ""action"". And at such times, ""The Artist"" is a breath of fresh air and works as a reminiscent of what movies right after its conception, stood for. A celebration of one such art form, from one such factory that has outlived itself in many ways in the past millennium. he story itself is about an indispensable act of nature, ""change"" and how it affects the one's who take success and in this case fame and admiration for permanency or as some would call it, granted. In life as much as in the world of glamour, nothing is constant. The protagonist's fights with his inner demons about accepting change is projected in the simplest of manners which is why it works. Research of how it worked in the 1920′s and technical excellence in achieving the feel of those times more than the costume, make up and body language which we have come to expect of movies these days, makes it a product par excellence. The fact that the makers shot it at 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps, helped them achieve what they did and is a serious case in point. Although its USP, ""a silent film"" will manage to draw the crowds and more so with all the nominations it has been getting, what would make them savour the experience is, how good it is, at it. Michel Hazanavicius who held this dream / passion project close to his heart for long before it came true chose his confidants for the lead roles, Jean Dujardin & Berenice Bejo (who also happens to be his better half). They have achieved major success in the OSS 117 series in France before this. Along with that some very familiar faces that constitutes the important players list includes the likes of John Goodman & James Cromwell who by the way pull off excellent character roles pivotal to the story line. Special mention to Uggy the Dog, who by the way has his own IMDb page now. But by and large Jean Dujardin with his impeccable sense of timing besides an affable charm, the original score produced by Lodovic Bource and performed by Brussels Philharmonic and most of all, Michel Hazanavicius who did not have to depend only on intertiles to tell a silent story, should be held high, very high in respect to what they have given us, the fans. Come February 26th, people who watch movies and follow them for what it is worth, will wait to see if ""The Artist"" stakes claims at the 10 Oscar categories it has been nominated for (including BEST Picture). My only concern is, people should not give it a miss if it does not get some of them ""Gold Statuettes"" in the bag because for once, let's not make The Academy the yardstick of its excellence and achievements. Martin Scorsese for all I care should have earned it long before for far better works than ""The Departed"", for which he did. Lets for once, stand up and applaud ""The Artist"" wherever You are, until it deafens the ears that have grown accustomed to appreciation of the mediocre, because this one is not it. It is quiet truly and literally if I may, in a league of its own.<br/><br/>Check out more review http://mayurdeep.com"
"nebulousbox-imdb","2","16","35","29 January 2012"," See Hugo for a better homage to silent films - walked out of this scam
","Initially this movie is an interesting experience in sensation and perception, playing with what is silent and what is not. <br/><br/>But once you are accustomed to the gimmick, it is nothing more than boring movie with minimal plot stretched out extremely long. The plot idea (one star sinks while another rises) has been done before, and this one had nothing new to add. Additionally, the story was shallow because there was almost no interesting dialog enriching the plot -- any time there was a conversation that might be of interest, most of the time dialog cards were NOT shown, so we could only guess what they said, the result being a very simple cartoonish-level plot. There can be a lot of potential in this rising/falling star plot, but the story didn't mine any of that territory.<br/><br/>The only time the plot sparkled was when the director did something interesting with sound and sight about 30 minutes in (don't want to give it away for the victims of this scam who might watch it) - at that point I thought the story and perceptual experience was finally going to be interesting, but the director abandoned that promising approach.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago I saw Hugo, and the silent film excerpts and shooting scenes in that movie were interesting and enthralling, and the ones in this one were not. And the overall plot and camera work were much better than in this one.<br/><br/>I walked out of this after an hour. The only reason I am not giving it one star is that I can imagine even worse productions."

","I started to watch this piece of dog-roll while on a flight into Singapore and got past only 10 minutes into it and gave up in disgust. I just knew it would be a travesty on silent film and wasn't disappointed. In Vietnam I bought a pirated copy for 50c so that my wife and I could see it together at home. How could such an abortion of a film manage to fool the masses into believing it great? Maybe it was the dog? and the two points I gave it was for the dog.<br/><br/>Why was there no speaking parts even when in the ""reality"" of off-stage? Why was the hero so obsessed with noise, sound, etc. Could it be he was as deaf as the aged Beethoven? Could it be that the stars' French accents would have given the game away? No sound, hardly any music make for a dull, irrating waste of one hour, forty minutes....except for the antics of the dog.<br/><br/>If this is supposed to be a homage to a largely forgotten era, then it was the duty of the producers and director and stars to know something about the Silent Era (which was anything but silent). By 1929, the writing was on the wall for silents. The last of the great studios, MGM, went sound that year. The hero had to be more than deaf, to be dumb enough to try making a silent in 1930.<br/><br/>Peppy's critique of silents, when interviewed in a restaurant, is wrong from start to finish, especially the comment about ""mugging"". If there were space enough, I could list a hundred silent films with superb acting. Have a look at Lillian Gish in the ""Wind"" or the whole cast in the German film ""Asphalt"".<br/><br/>The vulgar command ""Listen up"" is contemporary but is used in the film. I'll stop here and merely say that if this film encourages more to view and appreciate films, shorts, cartoons of the Silent Era then it was worth my sacrifice of fifty cents.<br/><br/>Kudos to the dog."

","""The Artist"" is one of those films that you go into not expecting very much out of it, and, in the end, you're left truly moved, and inspired. This film is certainly unconventional, but that adds to what makes it so GREAT! <br/><br/>The year is 1927, the place, Hollywood. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the most successful and beloved silent movie stars, and along with his canine companion and sidekick, Uggie, charms his ways through Hollywood. While making his newest movie, George meets an up and coming dancer and actress, Peppy Miller, who dreams of making it big, and the two start an unusual friendship/partnership, which makes George's already jealous wife (Penelope Anne Miller) even MORE jealous, because she believes that there is something more between the two coworkers One day, the director of George's newest film, and a frequent collaborator and close friend (John Goodman) shows George something new, something that he calls ""the future""- movies with sound, or Talkies. For some reason, George is not willing to speak in the movies, and is convinced, as is everyone else, that he will soon become a thing of the past.<br/><br/>Over the next few years, Peppy becomes one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, while George sinks deeper and deeper into obscurity. When his next movie, ""Tears of Love"" opens alongside Peppy's newest Talkie, and proceeds to bomb, he slumps into a deep depression that leads him to fire his butler and closest friend, Clifton (James Cromwell), and on two occasions, attempts to commit suicide, until Peppy comes to his rescue, and saves not only his life, but also his career.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Artist"" so terrific is the director and cinematographer's decision to shoot the film in black and white, and make it silent, to add to the authenticity of the time period and the subject. The added bonus of VERY FEW duologue cards allows the audience the opportunity to create duologue between the characters. Combine that with Ludovic Borec's score, which ALSO fits the time period, and you have one hell of a authentic film set in the 1920s. The chemistry between Jean Dujardin and Bernece Bejo is ELECTRIC, and their performances speak magnitudes even though the film is silent. This is ONE HELL of an amazing movie, and it leaves you speechless after the film ends."
"LloydBayer","10","8","15","21 February 2012"," A modern masterpiece about a bygone era.
","Call me a new age critic, but I must have seen only a dozen black and white movies, half of which was re-mastered during the Technicolor era. Having said that, this movie has shot up to the top of my list – Perfect and flawless, yet deep and heart wrenching. What a fantastic and moving experience! This is not just a throwback to the early days of cinema; this movie embodies the heart and soul of cinema as we know it. For a B&W movie, ironically, it is very vivid in its message that no matter who or what we have become, we should never forget our roots.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, this is the motion picture event of 2011 and for a variety of reasons. Hazanavicius' story is simple yet profound with several underlying messages. Set during the late '20s era of black and white films, it tells of the diminishing favor of silent movies as the film industry gives into the increasingly popular 'talkies'. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin plays a famous but ageing silent movie star when he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). Although they form an instant bond, Peppy is overly charismatic and grabs the attention of studio executives with ease. Simultaneously, and with the advent of sound in films, Peppy is all the rage, while George maintains that talkies are just a fad. The inevitable happens when producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) heralds in the new era of cinema, where Peppy becomes a major Hollywood star, sending George into a tragic downward spiral.<br/><br/>If a picture can speak a thousand words, ladies and gents, this movie is that picture. For a silent black and white film, there is so much conveyed, all through astounding facial expressions made possible by brilliant performances. French actors Dujardin and Bejo are simply flawless without uttering a single word. More than just reincarnating screen legends like Charlie Chaplin, Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly or Gloria Swanson, together, Dujardin and Bejo has resurrected a period in history that faded in oblivion almost a century ago. Also worth mentioning are great supporting roles from James Cromwell as George's loyal chauffeur, Goodman as the studio boss and Penelope Ann Miller as George's uncompromising wife, with special mention to Uggie the dog – playing a vital and heart wrenching role.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, standing up and clapping is the least anyone can do in appreciating Hazazavicius' brilliantly crafted work. Without having to mention the staggering number of times this film has been acknowledged at various film festivals and award institutions, I can say that the performances, the story and the music are THE defining factors of this movie. Speaking of which, the original score by Ludovic Bource clearly sets the tone and hugely amplifies the already overwhelming emotions, throughout.<br/><br/>With the Academy Awards just round the corner, I personally feel that ""The Artist"", ""Hugo"", and ""The Help"" are each worthy of being nominated for the ""best Picture"". A common thread between the first two is the obvious homage to the early days of cinema and an uncanny 'French connection' that binds them together. Even so, Hazazavicius may have turned the tables on Scorsese with this simple yet beautiful movie within a movie. Pun unintended. In narrowing that down to just one choice, my heart goes out to ""The Artist"". Sure, the likes of Brad Pitt, George Clooney and even Spielberg and Scorsese are often considered Hollywood's favorite sons, but having said that, Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin have more than reiterated the quintessential soul of cinema – its integrity, its origins, its essence and why it remains society's most powerful form of art.<br/><br/>Watch it only because this is a masterpiece."

","This film was over much too quickly and created a world I didn't want to leave. It is a demonstration of the film- makers art to be able to explain everything visually. After seeing The Artist I wondered if we ever needed sound in films. George Valentin's smile is infectious. Without speech, facial expressions are everything. The sequence when sound is added is visually witty and funny. Above all the music is great. Rather than reproduce music from the time, the elements of the 1920s style have been reworked into an original and thoroughly enjoyable film score. Elements of the film could stand alone. It could be enjoyed in complete silence. The photography is stunning. The clothes and sets are stylish. The music is great. Together they sparkle."

All the scenes are well worked and superbly directed and filmed, some scenes are just exquisite. All the actors create subtle but powerful roles with no ego inflected cameos.

","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>"" Dreams can come true again, When ev'ry thing old is new again. "" <br/><br/><ul><li>Lyrics by Peter Allen </li></ul><br/><br/>Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a fine homage to the heydays of early cinema. It is 1927 and the arrival of ""talkies"" is about to change the silent film industry and those who are unable to transition to this new process. One of those soon-to-be victims is Hollywood movie star George Valentin ( Jean Dujardin ). A top matinée idol ( ala the real John Gilbert ) accustomed to fame and the fortune or misfortune it brings, Valentin meets cute an adoring fan named Peppy ( Bérénice Bejo ). Soon Peppy becomes a rising ingénue on the road to stardom while his life begins to descend into alcohol and poverty. <br/><br/>Yes, the plot is mighty familiar, but bear with it. With the film being basically silent, the overall visual look of the film must greatly compensate for the lack of words and dialog. And that is just what happens in this marvelous film, as it captivates and transports the moviegoer back to a more innocent time.<br/><br/>The Artist is a rather conventional mash-up of Singin' in the Rain with A Star is Born. Yet it completely won me over with its masterful direction and period details. ( I realized this about 20 minutes into the film during one terrific dream sequence where sound effects abruptly broke the ""silence"" barrier. ) Shooting the film in 1.33:1 ratio and in glorious black & white, just as those silent films were initially seen, is more than a mere gimmick in Hazanavicius' vision. He takes his appreciation of his film subject seriously and adds his modern spin to this film while staying entrenched in that revered cinematic style.<br/><br/>The film is done mostly without dialog, albeit title cards playing a significant role as does a continuous musical soundtrack that highlights the action on the screen. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, tends to borrow too heavily from some musical choices (as with Hermann's Vertigo score ) and some film masterworks ( like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, The Mark of Zorro with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, loyal chauffeur and all. Some may say these touches are only inspired from other sources, others might question the film's lack of originality. )<br/><br/>But the film has certified moments of pure genius intermixed with scenes of high melodrama. There are scenes of such wit and charm ( a musical dance number remindful of that of Astaire and Rogers ; a slightly surreal moment with a young starlet embracing a coat-rack that seems to come to life; a dinner table scene that owes much to passage of time tableaux from the aforementioned Kane, etc. ) that dazzles the movie audience. ( At the film's end, there was spontaneous applause heard throughout the theater. )<br/><br/>Another plus to the film's winning demeanor is the central casting of the two main actors. Dujardin plays Valentin as a proud and vain peacock of a man. He can emote like the silent film stars of yesteryear, brandishing his handsomeness and profile to extremes and the next moment bringing a Chaplinesque quality to the more vulnerable side of this man's personality. Bérénice Bejo radiates that sunny and ""peppy"" quality needed for her character to become fully realized. Her loving and caring nature provides the essence for romance within the story. ( Special mention goes to Uggie the Dog for proving once again that we humans can be so easily upstaged by our four-legged friends.)<br/><br/>The Artist is an affectionate love letter to the silent film era and Hollywood itself. As the old adage says, ""Silence is golden."" And so is this delightful film. GRADE: B+<br/><br/>NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com"

"jp-aventurier","10","3","4","2 January 2012"," Go see ""The Artist""!
","Having dabbled in the 1920s with ""Midnight In Paris"", this movie will immerse you in this classic decade. The cars, the clothes, the hair... Director Michel Hazanavicius doesn't miss a single beat. Even the extras - every pedestrian and stagehand - has the classic familiarity of your grandparents' yearbook. Even the top name character actors filling in the cast as featured extras (Malcolm McDowell, Beth Grant, Ed Lauter). Stars Jean Dujardin (looking more, at times, like Gene Kelly) and Bérénice Bejo fit perfectly into this era. All in all, it's like a lost reel straight from 1927.<br/><br/>I grew up going to the local Silent Film Festival every spring, so my hopes were high for ""The Artist""; I can tell you, I was not disappointed. It wasn't a stylized homage (like, say, ""Down With Love"") or a technical exercise (Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho""), this was a 20s period film all around. Like the indulgent ""reality"" of ""Mad Men"", ""The Artist"" is clouded with cigarette smoke, charmed with male chauvinism, and shamefully lacking real roles for minorities; and at the same time, full of G-rated romance and compelling melodrama.<br/><br/>Michel Hazanavicius takes full advantage to his film's lack of sound and dialog, using title cards only when absolutely necessary. In fact, one slightly jarring moment comes when we hear Rose Murphy singing ""Pennies from Heaven"" over a montage. Slapstick and truly expressive acting are illuminated instead. This, frankly, has been sadly absent in movies lately. The most expressive performances coming from animated characters like Wall-E and Caesar (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"").<br/><br/>One of the compelling (and melancholy) aspects of the plot is the shift during the Great Depression from silent films to talkies. Though it is the undertow of the lead's story, it simultaneously self-conscious, reminding us what a rare treat this movie really is.<br/><br/>Like I said, Go see ""The Artist""! Take someone who truly loves cinema with you. Take your grandparents. This movie will transport you and remind you why we love movies so much."

","I have just seen ""The Artist"" and I liked it very much. It has some creative inventions like the genial part where, during a couple of minutes, suddenly there's sound, though not ""speaking"". The speaking mouths, a bit later, add to the dilemma. Wonderful. Superb acting as well.
Superb technics to convert to a really Silent Age movie. Original the thought.<br/><br/>Then I went through ""User Reviews"" and I noticed all good reviews got 0 out of X were helpful.<br/><br/>Now if someone dislikes a movie and has serious reasons to formulate higher objections against it in a comment that makes sense, I respect that, but just going through all positive reviews and clicking ""Was this review helpful?"", ""No"", that's vandalism. So I went through them and I clicked ""yes"", to give some counter weight, but this is the way live is in 2019, I fear. Don't bind value to TripAdvisor reviews, or stars for that and that place, or anything else ""validated by customers"", it's all anonymously paid for or just plain resentment."

","From the beginning, this film was destined to fail. <br/><br/>I've never seen a silent film. I've got a couple on the ""to-see"" list, but I've never seen one. That's why I went into The Artist with excitement, but apprehension. Would I like it? People don't talk, what about the story? Will I get bored? All those questions disappeared in the first 10 minutes of the film. <br/><br/>Truly a delightful and utterly unique film, The Artist is pitch perfect (mind the irony)! I loved the characters, the rush backwards in time to the late 1920's, and ESPECIALLY the absolutely charming and 100% original film score to accompany the Artist.<br/><br/>The film itself is heavy with thought provoking material: Why does modern film lack the ""movie magic""?, How can simplicity find a voice when big special effects or conformity are the true ticket seller? Who cares about character and story anymore? It's a unique film in this sense. <br/><br/>Continuing, you will love the characters. They don't utter a word, but you will grow extremely attached to them, from the start. Jean Dujardin is incredible as the lead as well! the acting is all around incredible!<br/><br/>From the beginning, the film was destined to fail. No big name stars, no eye popping trailer, it's not directed by Lucas or Spielberg or other big dogs, and...hold on...it's a silent film? In 2012? Are you kidding? <br/><br/>But your thinking is backwards. It's been tainted for years by big names, big budgets and big industry. The Artist is the most refreshing, delightful, fun and entertaining film I've seen in 2011. Give the Artist your full attention. This director, musical composer and wonderful cast has found their voice in the simplest of forms. And as Goodman puts it in the end, it's ""PERFECT!"""
"hall895","8","4","6","21 April 2013"," The sweet sound of silence
","Kudos to director Michel Hazanavicius. He had the audacious idea to make a black-and-white silent film more than eighty years after movies had begun to talk. And then he executed that idea brilliantly. The film had the potential to be a cheap, if interesting gimmick. It proved to be so much more than that. It proved to be a great film. The fact it was so unique only added to its allure. Helped by a terrific cast Hazanavicius produced true movie magic.<br/><br/>There are so many ingenious things about The Artist but the smartest thing the film has going for it is its subject matter. It's a silent film about silent films. And that opens up so many delicious possibilities. The film's star, Jean Dujardin in a truly mesmerizing performance, is playing silent film star George Valentin. Valentin is on top of his game and on top of the world. The biggest star of his era, adored by legions of fans. One of his biggest fans is a young woman, Peppy Miller, who audaciously sneaks in a kiss with him outside the premiere of Valentin's latest smash hit. Little do either of them know then that they are two ships passing in the night. The silent movie era is about to end. George Valentin is on the way to ruin. Peppy Miller is on the way to stardom.<br/><br/>Peppy starts out as an anonymous extra on one of Valentin's films. From there her star slowly rises. Meanwhile his star burns out completely. The world forgets George Valentin. But Peppy does not. She remembers that man she once so admired. They had but a brief connection but it meant the world to a young woman just getting her start in the business. If anyone can save George Valentin it is Peppy. With a little help from George's wonderfully cute four-legged friend Jack the dog.<br/><br/>All of this is told so wonderfully and, to modern eyes and ears, so uniquely. Producing this particular story as a silent film was simply ingenious. It's both a love letter to old-time Hollywood and a thoroughly modern film. The film has so many nods to that long-gone era but still works so well for a modern audience. When characters in this film dismiss silent stars as just mugging for the camera it reinforces the point that this film's stars are not doing that. Yes, it's a silent film but unlike any we have ever seen before. And yet with enough of those old silent movie touches to make it a worthy homage. A very delicate balance was required and Hazanavicius created that balance perfectly. Of course it never could have worked without the right cast. What a challenge these performers had, doing something quite unlike anything they had done before. And they all nailed it. Dujardin was simply amazing. Bérénice Bejo, playing Peppy, matched him stride for stride. What a delightful pair they prove to be. James Cromwell gives such a heartfelt performance as Valentin's loyal chauffeur. And as head of Valentin's film studio John Goodman manages to be a loud presence even in complete silence, he's simply perfect for his role. Helped along all the way by a wonderful old-time sounding silent movie score the film gives you comedy, drama, romance. And often does it in ways only a silent movie can, Hazanavicius taking full advantage of his medium. Intertitles are used sparingly but to great effect, most notably in the film's most dramatic moment which so cleverly becomes the film's funniest moment. That great silent movie moment serves as a reminder of what films can be with a little imagination. Hazanavicius had the imagination. And he had the talent to bring his vision to life. It all adds up to a wonderfully unique, incredibly entertaining and supremely charming film."

","The Artist is A movie of romance,one mans tragedy and A intertwined relationship between the two main characters.

The Artist is A movie of pure art and it is something that has not been done in a long time.

","This is one of the best movies of the year 2011. i haven't seen much black-white and silent films but this is a gem. It brings back all the innocence and simplicity but with a rare execution. The Artist works on every level depicting the rise and fall of a superstar of silent films whose career face a breakage after the popularity of films with voice. He lost all his fans and masses but not the new female superstar who he has inspired so much. Jean Dujardin is just excellent and most charming star,his smile is so good,he totally deserved to win the Academy and other accolades for portraying his character with perfection. Bérénice Bejo plays more of a supporting role she looks most charming,naughty and raunchy. Her dance with Jean in climax is amazing,totally marvelous. The scene where Jean attempts to shoot himself,the scene is heart throbbing. All the supporting cast and screenplay is splendid Direction by Michel Hazanavicius is over the top. It deserves all the respect,awards and appreciation. Must watch this movie get lost in a retro world."
"sddavis63","9","4","6","14 November 2012"," A Brilliant And Imaginative Film
","It is absolutely impossible to watch this film without being astonished by how well made it was by director Michel Hazanavicius. When you think about it, this was a risky project. In the second decade of the 21st century how many movie goers would actually be impressed by a silent movie? And I must admit that for the first few minutes I was tentative as I watched this, wanting to be impressed but holding back on my admiration, almost as if I wanted not to like it for some reason - but then succumbing, and having to admit that it really is a brilliant piece of movie making. And Hazanavicius deserves great credit for that. He took this very old and worn style of movie making and made a very new and fresh style of movie out of it. Once you're hooked - which you are very quickly, if not right away - you're hooked.<br/><br/>This is a great story. If you know anything about movie history, you know how true to life it is as well. How many silent actors just couldn't cope with the advent of the talkie? How many careers went down in flames almost literally overnight as the talkies took centre stage? In ""The Artist"" it's the fictional George Valentin who's facing this sudden upheaval. Valentin is a huge silent star for Kinograph Pictures, when all of a sudden the studio simply tells him that it's over. Everything they have - all their resources - are now being put into talkies, and George - as big a silent star as he was - just doesn't fit. As arrogant as he is in many ways, you still feel so sorry for him. His life crumbles; his marriage crumbles; he loses everything (except the love of his dog, who stays loyally by his side through everything.) He struggles to keep going. When Kinograph cuts him loose he tries directing and producing his own silent movie. I think the saddest scene in the entire film is the premiere of this effort, as we see an almost empty theatre watching. He WAS a big star - but no one cares about him anymore. The movies have passed him by. It would be the equivalent of people suddenly losing interest - all interest almost overnight - in George Clooney or Brad Pitt. There's a rawness to that simple shot of the almost empty theatre; it truly cuts at the viewer. And you wonder how many silent actors had this (or something similar) happen to them as the 20's suddenly became the 30's - and no one cared about them anymore. French actor Jean Dujardin was wonderful in this role. He silently captured Valentin's pain and bewilderment and sadness as the life he knew totally collapsed around him.<br/><br/>And, of course, there was the other side of the coin - represented by Peppy Martin (played by Berenice Bejo, who reminded me very much of a young Joan Collins.) Peppy was a fan of Valentin who managed to give the mega star a peck on the cheek, which photographers captured. That earned her some work as an extra and finally a scene with Valentin in one of his movies. Then - the talkies that destroyed Valentin were perfectly suited to Martin. She rocketed to superstardom even as Valentin collapsed into obscurity. From time to time their paths would cross, each time the different trajectories their lives and careers had taken becoming more noticeable. Bejo was also perfect in the role. She pulls off the hint of arrogance so natural for someone who's just become the hottest ticket in Hollywood, pointing out to reporters (as Valentin - unbeknownst to her listens) that people are tired of silent movie actors and all their ""mugging."" But she doesn't forget Valentin. She falls in love with him and rescues him, finally using her currency as Kinograph's new mega-star to insist on making a movie with him - or else. It can't be a talkie because Valentin doesn't do talkies. But it all leads up to an absolutely breath-taking dance routine between the two near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Brilliant. Just brilliant. The supporting cast were equally strong - from James Cromwell as Valentin's (and later Miller's) chauffeur to John Goodman as the head of Kinograph Pictures to even Uggie as Valentin's loyal little pooch. A great movie. I found it just a little hard to get into at first, but I think that was my fault more than the movie's as I struggled slightly with the whole largely unfamiliar silent medium.

","With 3-D movies becoming so ubiquitous, the magic of cinema is wearing off as more and more humdrum flicks are poured at us from every box office orifice. Previously, CGI perfection and action sequence bombasts became formulaic and jaw-achingly dull for the average cinema goer. Thankfully a wonderful piece of film making has emerged in the form of The Artist. This is modern cinematography stripped bare of all whistles and bells: no 3-D, no CGI, no colour, barely any spoken dialogue, not even filmed in wide-screen. This, far from holding back any enjoyment of the theatregoer's experience, rekindles their long lost passion for cinema in its pure form. Indeed, the film is set in Hollywood(land) of the 1920s and 1930s, straddling the last major technological milestone in cinema since the digital revolution: the advent of talking pictures.<br/><br/>Every player in The Artist is, necessarily in a film with almost no talking, visually arresting. Jean Dujardin cuts a suave dash as George Valentin, a huge silent star unwanted in a new era of vocal acting. With landscaped chin, lacquered hair and moustache clipped to an eyebrow pencil line, Dujardin's face and physicality fascinates throughout the film's 100 minutes. His acting is comic without being farcical; tragic without being hysterical. His co-star, budding blossom Peppy Miller, played by an engaging Bérénice Bejo, remains charming, demure and level-headed even when achieving the heights of talkie fame. She never forgets the role of Valentin in her success and watches, while trying to attenuate, his private demise as he witnesses her very public ascension to super-stardom. Bejo does this with an unbent sensitivity, her engaging mouth filling the screen with her smile or quivering with unfettered sadness at the man left behind.<br/><br/>The supporting actors, although less physical, all have faces full of depth and character. Even a flash appearance from Malcolm McDowell as a jobbing extra delivers a comic vignette full of facial subtlety and wrinkled brilliance.<br/><br/>The director, Michel Hazanavicius, cannons a well aimed, pared down shot straight to the emotional core, uncluttered with dialogue. The depth of the monochrome montage screams sophistication and the soundtrack swells and dips with the action on screen. Hazanavicius brilliantly portrays an enormous sense of fun and excitement from the start with clever editing and use of movement to compensate for the lack of Foley sound or speech, which is never a disadvantage in this film. This makes almost every moment edge-of-seat tense which does lose fervour in the middle, possibly in order for the audience to catch breath before being shot at again during the dramatic ending. The director himself has been quoted as saying that he has used the silent format not as an homage to bygone days but a storytelling tool. He does just that, making an amazingly refreshing new film and helping audiences of all ages to rediscover the raw and beautiful art of cinema at its purest."

","You know you've seen a masterpiece when you walk out of a film and shed tears of joy or felt something stir within your soul. This is just the show which will make you glad that someone has the passion to make a black & white silent film and share it with the world.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly blown away by the leads and practically everyone else in the film who has managed to convey their feelings, humor, anguish, anger etc just with their facial expressions. In modern times where movies are heading towards high definition IMAX, CGI and what not, a black and white seems like a step back, much less a silent one. But this film is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of classics. Easy to comprehend and very enjoyable to watch. It's no wonder this film is so highly lauded and expected to achieve more at the golden globes and Oscars.<br/><br/>I just wonder if more films like this that seem to have moments of magic will continue to be produced."
"puffball97","10","4","6","30 December 2011"," This Season's Best Movie
","If you like something that's different in more ways than one for the holidays, where the movie has real plot and character development, and not standard cartoonish violence as in many of this season's holiday movies, then run, don't walk, to see ""The Artist."" The movie is headed by two international stars who should become well-known to American audiences - French actor Jean Dujardin as the hero George Valentin, and Argentinian actress Berenice Bejo as the ingenue Peppy Miller, along with the familiar faces of John Goodman as his usual cheerful self in the role of the egomaniacal studio head Al Zimmer, Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's troubled wife, Doris, and James Cromwell as Valentin's faithful butler.<br/><br/>The message of ""The Artist"" is all about changes in our culture. Also, this movie, while maintaining its originality, pays homage to two of the greatest Hollywood movies ever made, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" where Debbie Reynold's regular voice fit best for talkies as Jean Hagen's itty-bitty voice didn't, and fell for her co-star, Gene Kelly, and the storyline of ""A Star is Born,"" where the heroine's celebrity rises and the hero's celebrity falls. For those who really think that ""they don't make movies like the used to,"" then you see everything in ""The Artist."" It is much more than an all black and white silent movie. It is a tribute that makes the viewer think, feel, and yet enjoy its magical movie-making. It is funny, sometimes disturbing, intellectual, and the viewer leaves with good feeling and emotion. And that's what a great movie is all about.<br/><br/>The storyline goes that George Valentin is a hot 1920s silent movie hero who meets dancer Peppy Miller. He puts the beauty mark on her and then she is a star ingenue. However, Al Zimmer realistically announces to George that the movies are forever changing to sound, which is true in our culture, and George feels disheartened over his silent film celebrity status. Even more disheartening when Peppy's sound movie is a fit, George's last silent movie is a flop, and George's actress wife, Doris, deserts him. George moves into a small apartment with Clifton, and his Jack Russell Terrier, and still more desolation ensues. George drinks uncontrollably, attempts suicide twice, and the only people to save him are his smart and loyal dog who knows more danger signals than humans, and Peppy, who loves George unconditionally. The predictable but exhilarating ending is a real gem that not only makes the viewer feeling good, but thinking what will come next for years to come. And finally, George is back in form in the next status, which Peppy adapted to right away.<br/><br/>The last silent movie tribute was, well, Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie"" back in 1976. Sorry, but audiences these days seem to be more interested in a thoughtful tribute than a mindless but still always hilarious and timeless parody by our spoofmeister Brooks. Thirty-five years later, we get the real treat for what the silents are all about. Call it artsy and all black and white, but ""The Artist"" is a thought-provoker that I would like to see nominated for Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor Dujardin, and Best Actress Bejo. I'm not the best at handicapping Oscars, but it looks so far that this movie may win for all its artistic merits."
"meeza","10","4","6","29 December 2011"," The premier piece of art of 2011!
","No one can silence me on expressing my jubilant emotion on the silent masterpiece modern movie ""The Artist"". It is pure artistry. So therefore, I have to voice that to me it is the best movie of 2011; and I am not the only who has been vociferous with that sentiment. ""The Artist"" stars a brilliant Jean Dujardin as silent movie star George Valentin. During the silent movie era of Hollywood, everyday was Valentine's Day for Valentin as he was admired & loved as that era's supreme movie star. Valentin was confident, charismatic, determined, and pretty much a pure silent showman. However, it was all the future talk that ended up ruining Valentin's career. When the silent movie days of Hollywood dwindled, and the talkies became the talk of Tinseltown, Valentin became a movie face of the past. After Valentin gets booted by the movie studio he was under contract with for many years, he decides to keep the silence alive by developing a silent film which he produces, directs, and stars in. When that experiment bombed, all kept spiraling downwards for poor Silent George; he loses his house, his wife, his fame, and even to a certain extent his legacy. At the same time- Peppy Miller, an aspiring actress which George had given her first break by briefly appearing in one of his last silent movies, becomes a megastar in the new Hollywood talkies. I guess one can say that her Peppy Talk was the talk of Hollywood. George and Peppy's careers go through opposite pathways, even though Peppy continues to admire George even throughout all his trials & tribulations. The epitome of man's best friend has to be George's cerebral dog who is not only George's pooch confidant but eventually his savior. Director Michel Hazanivicius' orchestration of ""The Artist' is one for the ages and for all ages. He is able to formulate a wondrous silent movie in modern times and to make it as magnetic and enticing as it is was simply movie magic. It is the best direction of the year and it will be very hazardous if Hazanivicius does not garner a Best Director Oscar. Moreover, the vicious Hazanivicius also pulls of another cinematic impossible- scribing a spectacular and lively screenplay to a modern silent film; translation= Another Oscar. There is a lot to love about Dujardin's expressive starring performance as Valentin. Dujardin is definitely due a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Berenice Bejo was very nice with her stellar work as Peppy Miller, there is no doubt that Bejo won't be to lejo of the Kodak Theatre come Oscar time; she is a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. ""The Artist"" also got more support from the great ""silent but medley"" performances of John Goodman as the studio mogul, James Cromwell as George's chauffeur, and Penelope Ann Miller as Mrs. Valentin. Another guiding force in ""The Artist"" was the grand musical score of the flick orchestrated by Ludovic Bource. The Bource Musical Identity was of Bource Supremacy and the sound of this music should rejoice in the Oscar mountaintops with an Academy Award for Best Movie Score. Many have called ""The Artist"" a love letter to ""old school"" Hollywood. And yes I do concur with that analysis, but the new school of Hollywood should reward ""The Artist"" as the movie valedictorian of the year 2011. So go ahead and. enjoy the silence! ***** Excellent"
"StevePulaski","10","4","6","26 December 2011"," Vibrant even though colorless
","What could've derailed into a drab and dry spectacle, perfectly executes everything it tries to accomplish in a serious and fun way. The Artist is an amazing homage to the classic silent films from the twenties and thirties, respectively. They are some of the simplest films, but pack so much in their context it's easy to miss a few beats.<br/><br/>The idea of silent cinema is sketchy in 2011, but thankfully, The Artist never tries to present itself as a tongue in cheek parody or a goofy tribute. It is serious in its presentation and wants nothing more than to show that captivating cinema still exists and can work work wonders if done properly. Maybe it's because I have shot two silent films in the last year and am sympathetic to all the effort it takes to actually create one.<br/><br/>The silent films I shot were for a Television class I took last year. They are nothing special and are pretty cheaply made. I loosely based it off a situation that really happened to my friend and I, and added a nice KISS song and threw in a few plot twists. It wasn't in black and white, and the editing wasn't this tight. I am open to the idea of more now that I have been schooled watching The Artist.<br/><br/>Being that Jean Dujardin is a gifted physical actor and his appearance mirrors a real-life actor from the silent era only adds to the many reasons why The Artist succeeds on so many levels. He plays George Valentin, a silent film actor who has starred in many films over the course of the twenties with his scene stealing Jack Russell Terrier. Sadly, it's now 1927 and the silent film studios are suffering because a new fad of films that include sound, called Talkies, are the big thing.<br/><br/>One day when George is being swarmed by the paparazzi, a woman gets pushed into him by accident. Instead of acting infuriated, which I can see many celebrities being now, he embraces the abrupt entry of the woman and poses for several pictures with her. The woman is then discovered to be Peppy Miller, played by the engaging and utterly beautiful Bérénice Bejo. George is so wooed by Miller's attitude and beauty that he auditions her for a role in his new film. After that, Peppy becomes more and more famous through roles of all different sizes in Talkies.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, all this action, excitement, and suspense is captured through black and white film, many musical numbers, and a lens not in the typical widescreen format. Though the film is so engaging, I did not forget its silent nature but I do believe it is possible to forget the film lacks in dialog. Some very impressed moviegoers will be lost in the film's story and might be in for a rude awakening before the credits roll.<br/><br/>The Artist is an enriching and delightful movie experience. Some will grow tired of the aspect but I can see many embracing it and craving more. The film has enough well-delivered action to not be called ""one note,"" and enough clever plot points to prevent the word ""monotony"" from coming in. It's subtle in its presence but massively entertaining in its delivery.<br/><br/>Starring: Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, and John Goodman. Directed by: Michel Hazanavicius."

","The film's blocking a B&W cinematography were very good but that was about it... it's amazing how a spin can be put on something and everybody just follows along. I really think that the Weinstein Company put the joke on us... making a mediocre silent movie in 2011 had to be cheap... so Harvey is laughing all the way to the bank. There are hundreds of better silent movies made years ago... what's the buzz here? Giving the film won so many Oscars is really an insult to the other nominated films. Just because the Weinsteins have power in Hollywood isn't enough for me to blindly follow the opinion that this is a ""brilliant"" film... very far from it."

","Yikes! I was expecting something more to the plot from such an Oscar winning movie. Sure, they nailed the look of old B&W movies of that era but that novelty soon wears thin with the simplistic story line I had to endure with four others in my small town local theater. I mean the ""Munsters"" TV series nailed '30's era B&W with better plots told in 30 minutes.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" only ran one short week in my small town Texas theater ONLY AFTER it won the Oscar for Best Picture before it was quickly replaced by newer releases. <br/><br/>The long wait and heavy media buzz may have unrealistically raised my expectations but I don't think so even if it is considered an homage to the history of cinema which is sort of ironic since silent movie's had to rely heavily on a well written story with intricate and compelling relationships and plot lines to keep audience's attention for over an hour. <br/><br/>Just read some IMDb story lines to a number of Lon Chaney flicks they could've borrowed from like ""The Unknown"", ""Unholy Three"", and ""The Penalty"". They're more involved and complex than what's shown at most Sundance Festivals. <br/><br/>""The Unknown"" left me dropped jawed throughout most of the movie because I couldn't believe the level of intelligence written into and acted out in the story line. There were some really smart folks writing and producing silent movies back in the '20's and '30's. ""The Artist"" makes them out to be innocent dolts.<br/><br/>You want to award an Oscar to a movie that pays homage to cinema? Give it to Scorcese's ""Hugo"" which was a much better and more entertaining movie in my opinion."

","This film is wonderful. This film is perfect. This film is a delight. Everyone should see it. It's a feel-good movie, a love story, a comedy and an interesting historical film about a crucial period in the movie business. <br/><br/>As an homage to the silent movies of the twenties, it's extremely well done. In every small detail, it's as if you're watching one of those wonderful silent movies. But it's more than just a pastiche. In many ways, this is a movie of the 21st century. Some extremely witty gags can only have been made up in modern times (pun intended). And there are quite a few of those witty gags. <br/><br/>One is right in the beginning of the movie and it made the audience chuckle for the first time. The Artist begins with a movie being shown in a theatre. It's a silent movie, so we only hear music. When the movie stops and the audience starts applauding, you sort of subconsciously expect to hear clapping. When there is no sound and you realize that not only the film-in-the-film is silent, but the film itself as well, you can't help but laugh. <br/><br/>The film is full of such visual and auditive jokes, as well as subtle references to the main theme: speaking versus silence. You can spend an entire evening telling each other which funny parts you liked best. <br/><br/>When The Artist came out, I thought of it as an art-house release for an extremely limited audience. French. Black and white. No speaking parts. A funny sort of film for movie buffs. Being a movie buff, I wanted to see it. But it left the cinemas before I had the chance to. Because of the Oscar buzz, it's re-released now on a small basis. I saw it in a packed theatre. The Artist's evolution from extremely art-house-orientated film to a multiple award winning crowd pleaser is one of the most extraordinary events of recent years in film business. <br/><br/>It's entirely deserved and we all should be pleased that this kind of film can be appreciated by a large audience. I can only hope that The Artist will lead to a renewed interest in the wonderful silent movies of the twenties. Go see it. And after that, watch City Lights. It's on YouTube!"

","I was a little bit timid going in to The Artist, fearing that a PG rated hundred minute silent movie might be soapy and sentimental. I was very impressed to find that this is not the case. The Artist is a film about simple relationships, and that's its strength, simplicity. We begin in the year 1927. George Valentin; a charismatic silent movie star is very fond of the new member of his latest cast, Peppy Miller. She is very fond of him too, but they go separate ways with the arrival of talking pictures. George refuses to take part in such pictures, while Peppy embraces it and goes on to become a super star, leaving George in the shadows. But does this mean she has forgotten him?<br/><br/>I think what keeps the movie from being cartoony is that The Artist could have easily been played as a romance, but it chooses not to. George and Peppy are presented as friends not lovers. The movies that are featured within the movie have all the soap and sentiment, but this one is played serious. It does have it's effective moments of comedy though. The best the Artist, even as a silent movie, never feels overdone.<br/><br/>Most of the time, The Artist is actually a rather sad movie. A good portion of it is focused on George's low point in life, spent brooding, low on cash, and unable to make a successful film. The two leads carry the film, beautifully. Director Michael Hazanavicious trusts his actors completely. He chooses to let the camera linger on their faces rather than break up the scenes with to many caption cards. In fact there is more dialogue spoken and inaudible in the Artist than there is captioned dialogue. The plot is presented accessible to a fairly general audience while still being a maturity of subject matter; also quite impressive. <br/><br/>The Artist is shot and assembled very well, and looks like something that was made eighty years ago. One item worth noting is of course how early movies have far more static frames than moving ones, as stedicams and shoulder camera-work would not be in vogue il the mid- late twentieth century. Even for a mostly static picture, there are some great shots and angles. I particularly enjoyed a dutch angle (diagonal) shot of George at a table which is so polished that you can't telling with is the man and which is the reflection until he spills his drink.<br/><br/>The ending came a little bit more abruptly than I thought. for a film with such a long middle section I would've liked to an extra five to ten minutes. the hundred minutes that made up the Artist are a delightful throwback, with room for laughs and tears. It's a film with heart and soul, and even if imperfect is one of the most disticive films of the year."

","This is the first silent film I've ever watched. The last of the non- talkies were in existence way back in the 1930s and for ""The Artist"" to revitalize this so-called 'dead' genre is simply a marvellous achievement. I wouldn't be overstating it when I say it is possibly the best work in film-making in the 21st century.<br/><br/>For starters, the brisk pace and sheer entertainment factor of this movie catches you off guard as it is something not usually expected of a silent film. The acting by both Jean Dujardin (what a well-deserved Oscar win his was) and Berenice Bejo (would have loved to see her win too; on reflection though, the competition this year made that virtually impossible in either category) is tremendous. The complex task of expressing emotions without the aid of verbal activity is a feat accomplished with nonchalant ease by the duo. The original score (don't bother with the baseless controversies regarding an alleged rip-off from the score of ""Vertigo"") by Ludovic Bource is as good as it gets, and landed him and the film another well-deserved Oscar nod. And finally, the screen writing and direction by Michel Hazanavicius is first-class; overall a stupendous work of art befitting the title of the film.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the superficial 'lack of punch' generally associated with silent films. Watch this and your respect for the classic silver screen cinema might just increase manifold."

","This must be a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Someone thought this was great movie making, so everyone falls in line? This was nothing more than novelty. First, the story cute but nothing that would ""WOW"" me. ""Avatar"" was blasted for stealing its story from previous screenplays, but not this movie. I saw ""Singin' In The Rain"" (which was much more entertaining) and ""A Star Is Born"" blatantly in this story. Nothing original here. The acting was adequate but Academy Award worthy? My favorite performance was Uggie. Finally, big disappointment in basic movie technology. Video standard screen size? I go to the movie theater to see widescreen. Audio only coming from the front; what happened to surround sound? (If you state that the intent of the movie was to see it as a silent movie then why was it filmed digitally.) I should have waited for the DVD. I guess with all the hype my expectations were much too high, but I have seen far superior silent movies on TCM. If I as missing something, please enlighten me!"

The only thing I thought walking out of this movie was, ""man, I'm sure glad we don't have silent movies anymore."" Personally, I found it boring (and judging by the audible snoring I heard within the theater, I wasn't the only one), thought it was slow to develop and generally lacked any type of plot.

","I love this film. It's just as simple as that. But I'll explain why I found it to be so enchanting and perfect. I loved how they handled the subject of the rise of the talkies, despite the fact this film is a silent film....If I told you how that would be a spoiler for you. Jean Dujardin (George Valentin) and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller)had an amazing chemistry on screen. They really stole the show. But what has to be credited and ofter overlooked is that the fact they only are allowed to capture the audiences attention for about an hour and forty minutes with expression and movements only, no dialogue. That is impressive and not once did I find myself falling asleep, because the enthusiasm of Jean and the sweetness and jolly manner of Berenice was so enjoyable to watch and you know what the say, actions speak louder than words. Of course the dog, Uggie, was beyond brilliant. The music of course was also the star of the film, the music alongside the actions of the actors is vital in terms of trying to convey certain emotions across to the audience. It was so beautiful and perfect for what was taking place within the film. Don't let the fact it is a silent film put you off, because it is so much fun and it is so lively that you can't stop smiling throughout the whole film. The film meets up to the critical acclaim this masterpiece has received, it does not disappoint."
"achyutaghosh","10","6","11","25 February 2012"," Pure Class. A masterpiece. Triumphant!
","If you don't understand my silence, you'll never understand my words..<br/><br/>I remember with great fondness the good old Charlie Chaplin movies when they used to play on Sundays on Doordashan- silent, yet laced with so much slapstick humor and emotional wallop, that even to this day, they remain my most memorable cinematic experiences. While the introduction of sound was a significant development in the history of cinema changing the level of audience involvement and creating new stars, but it also led to the supposed demise of the silent movie stars. Or did it not? This myth is brought to life in Michel Hazanavicius's The Artist where a silent movie actor -George Valentin finds himself fading from the limelight once silent cinema goes out of vogue. It's strength is in its inspired performances and its seamless updating of the kind of visual storytelling used in the silent era, and its weakness lies in a story that's as predictable as every other modern romantic comedy.<br/><br/>It is 1927 and George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) is the reigning king of Hollywood, at the apex of his popularity. His movies are in black and white and silent. He is a cross between Gene Kelly with the dazzling smile and Clark Gable with his intense eyes. George is self assured, loves audience attention and in general is soaking in the good times. A fateful day brings young, starry eyed and looking for an opportunity Peppy Miller (played by Bernice Bejo) together with George- that moment in the spotlight sets Peppy on the road to stardom. George does his little bit to create her unique identity, and they begin to lovingly fall in love with each other. He is enraptured on the set as he watches her legs rehearsing a dance behind a backdrop screen, and she puts her arm in an empty jacket sleeve caressing herself in a imaginary embrace. Their connection is instantaneous, and their affection is infectious. They make each other happy, and by the end of the movie, there would be no two thoughts about the fact that they were made for each other. Though their story may look clichéd, the scenes will make you tingle no matter how often you see it.<br/><br/>But since George is a mega star, it means he is not prepared for the advent of sound in pictures, and the fact that it will change his life. In a metaphorical scene, when George walks out of his studio and walks down a staircase with a plan to make his magnum opus silent movie, he meets Peppy who is walking her way up. Peppy's film career explodes, and George's career implodes, both spectacularly so. By not accepting the future, George willfully sabotages his own life- he loses his wife, his wealth, his respect, and find solace in the bottle and his adorable Jack Russell terrier. Will Peppy come to the rescue and arrest George's decline into madness, and more importantly, will George allow her to help him? Watch the movie for the answers, but this I have to say that you will come out smiling :) <br/><br/>The film has a carefully constructed tone that lingers between comedy and drama, playing alternately with melancholic and playful tones, bordering on light satire. It's both a creative success and a crowd pleasing movie, with the two stars delivering perfect Hollywood characterizations. Dujardin is already a big star in the film industry and here he plays George with terrific magnetism, and in the latter half, excellent poignancy. He has great screen presence, and an irresistible smile, ably complemented by Bernice Bejo who is beautiful, passionate, sassy and exuberant, endowed with positivity and willpower. Last but not the least is the fabulous music score that aptly captures every mood, and George's Jack Russell who often steals the show from his talented master. <br/><br/>In this era of slam bang actioners, cacophonous explosions, VFX laden spectacles, remakes and sequels and of course the ubiquitous 3D, it takes extreme gumption to make a silent film that celebrates the old magic of movies. Director Michael Hazanivicius deserves more than a pat on his back for crafting a movie which is deeply reverential of the world of movie making, in addition to stimulating the sense of joy in all of us, making it irresistibly charming and appealing to the modern audience. <br/><br/>The film already has 10 Oscar nominations, and already has swept other global awards. The Artist is a triumphant celebration of the artistry in movies, and in that it scores a 10/10. Its a must watch for the viewer with taste. My pick for best director, and best actor for tomorrow's Oscars."
"callumthebeast","9","6","11","23 February 2012"," The artist review
","Hello, Silent films are obviously by far a thing of the past and with the dawn of new 21st century technologies, like 3-d and imax, you would think the format would never creep back onto the silver screen again. Until now. The artist has shovelled past the half hearted 3-d action and animation flicks that have flooded the autumn/winter box office and is now the 'talk of the town'. 'For how could a black and white silent film be any better than a film in colour and shot in SPECTACULAR 3-D!!!' Easily! And here's why... Film making today isn't what is used to be, today, production teams are littered with high tech equipment (like 3-D camera's!) That for some reason, (needed or not) they think is a necessity in the film. But what's to say we can't go back to old roots like the artist has done? Simply because companies don't want to lose money, that's why the artist is such a big risk. But the risk has defiantly paid off as new films made with new technology are being overlooked as this new film with old technology is stealing the limelight and its such a nice sight to see. As of course the artist is one of the best films I've seen for a while. Its such a breath of fresh air to see such a film which along with a heart warming story line delivers great acting performances around the board especially from Jean Dujardin (and of course Uggie the dog!) But the aspect I really loved about this film was the screen play and the overall style in which this film was shot. I especially loved the opening sequence in which ( however corny it may sound) I really felt as if I was actually in a theatre of the time with the band playing live in front of me. By seeing this scene at the start where 'George Valentin' is happy and charismatic, it means that we can really relate to the character throughout the film going with him though his highs and lows . Overall I think this film was beautiful, a real unlikely masterpiece for a film of the 21st century. One that will always stand the test of time and one that should defiantly win the awards for best film and of course to Michel Hazanavicius for best director. They most certainly do not make them like they used to!<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>Calum.R"

","This movie is tremendously entertaining. Goosebumps from start to finish. As soon as the movie ended, I could watch it again.<br/><br/>However, I would like to comment on one particular aspect not mentioned in most reviews. This is a monumental and ground breaking achievement in the art of film-making and cinematography. I bet that from now on, this movie will be included in the lists of top-50 or top-100 movies of all time, and that all future filmmakers will study how this movie was made.<br/><br/>For example, in this mostly silent movie, I could actually hear the dialog by reading the lips, as the actors spoke and brilliantly expressed their parts when the movie was filmed. Judging by light and shade complexity, this black and white movie was filmed in color using high ISO and high resolution equipment, and colors were converted to gray-scale B&W separately and differently, allowing the viewer to guess colors on the B&W screen.<br/><br/>Next week we will find out whether it will win the Oscars. I predict it will sweep the Oscars winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay. Even though we may never know the actual Academy Awards voting tally, chances are, ""The Artist"" will win by the widest voting margin since ""The English Patient""."

","A lovely sparkling film. What goes around comes around - that a French ""black & white"" ""silent"" film should be made and feted in 2011 is odd enough, but also that it is so good in all departments too, and with very little recourse to digital cartoonery.<br/><br/>If you know your silent film mythology and well remember films such as A Star Is Born, Singin' In The Rain, Show People, Flesh And The Devil, Citizen Kane amongst many other referenced the story is rigidly straightforward - a big male star struggles to cope with the onslaught of sound films. He starts the slide to the bottle and suicidal thoughts while the acting career of the younger woman who loves him is in the ascendant. But the acting, production and direction are all perfectly in time: the pose struck and the camera movements as starry-eyed Peppy got off the tram; the very close ups of George's expansive smile (based on Gene Kelly's); Astor's – sorry, Uggi's race with a cop down the pavement to save George. In the Golden Age movies like this were churned out by Hollywood studios at dozens per week, it has to be so much more involved and convoluted nowadays. Now nearly everything strives to be Art first then Entertainment but nearly everything fails. My daughter and I watched it expecting to find a few holes somewhere, I couldn't really fault it and the only thing that jarred with her was she thought Berenice Bejo looked too 21st century. Poor old Uggi though – apparently shot dead accidentally near the end by George! Well, did you see him again after the gun went off?<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, as a triumph of discipline – a reminder of how good films (silent or sound) can be whether when they're made without the routine bestiality that's always required nowadays. Based on my extremely limited knowledge of modern movies I would say it deserves to win every award everywhere in 2012 and hope it does for years to come, but whether it deserves all the hype is another matter."
"hwesuhunu","3","14","33","7 January 2012"," Awful, awful, awful!!!
","This was an absolute waste of time, I found the central character repugnant and the lead actress to be wooden and two dimensional, the style was kitsch, story was predictable so I hated every minute of 'The Artist'. I enjoyed James Cromwell (as ever) and others in the supporting cast where there were one or two moments where I had a brief chuckle (hence the 3/10 otherwise 0/10) at some small joke but there was very little in this to endear me to it. I write this as an avid silent movie fan (Chaplin, Lloyd etc. etc.) but this movie from the first moment had me wanting to punch the smug central character full in the face! I see there are one or two people who have written low score reviews on IMDb going against the groundswell of favourable opinion, but in my view this had little or nothing to recommend it as an experience and I almost want to see it again to check whether it is actually as bad as I experienced it today! I suspect this movie is a little like Marmite, you either love it or loathe it there really isn't much in between. I watched about five minutes of 'The Artist' before I started to think about leaving the cinema and going home (something I've done only once or twice over 35 years of going to the cinema!). To sum up this was a cinema experience I can barely believe and I'm looking forward to seeing anything at the movies just to erase the memory of this as the last film I've seen!"
"CubsandCulture","10","5","9","21 February 2019"," A Wonderful comedy, A romantic love letter, a cinematic treat...
","While this film isn't particularly deep, it isn't mere empty style . Re-watching the film the other day I was struck by how George being replaced in his industry due to technology is actually a fairly universal experience. Sure the film is self-consciously modeled on Hollywood history but it is applicable to many other things. Anyway, the story of the aging silent film actor falling in love with up and coming talkie actress feels like a classic Hollywood myth and the story is wonderfully engaging. That the film is very funny, what with the cute doggo and board humor.<br/><br/>Now it is true that the film has a ton of style. It makes many allusions to classic films-Grand Hotel, Citizen Kane, Vertigo to name a few-and it is artificially silent film making (for the most part), not widescreen and in black/white. People who love classic Hollywood will find a lot great in jokes here. It is also a fun game to try to guess what films the director is thinking of. Films about films can be a little twee put here this feature just makes the film utterly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film really does feel like an unearthed silent film from the (late) 20's. It's amazing on all technical aspects in this regard. Hazanavicius really knows how direct action to give information visually. (Having seen a few of his other films, he really is chameleon-like in his ability to invoke period) There is just so many places were the film is effortlessly cinematic; where the story is all about behavior, actions and movement.<br/><br/>Wonderful Best Picture."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","9","13 January 2015"," The Artist is silent, but deadly. It's a good watch, but it's not a perfect film.
","If I can say a few words about this film. It's didn't deserve the praise, it got. I know, its sound harsh, since I do kinda like the film, but besides it paying homage to the style of a black and white nostalgia silent film. There is barely anything original. It felt very old. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, but compare to the others movies nominated that year for Best Picture. I was deeply surprising that it won Best Picture in 2011. Directed & written by Michel Hazanavicius, the movie takes place in the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1920s, focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) and a rising young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) during the growth of the 'talkies' films. Like, I said, before, the movie concept isn't anything new. It's been tackle years ago, by 1952's Singing in the Rain, 1954's A Star is Born, and 1950's Sunset BLVD, but unlike them, the Artist received way too much highly positive reviews from critics and won many awards, including Best Picture at the Oscars. It just seems like such a common, classic storyline, almost timeless and yet in ""The Artist"", this plot feels extremely stale to me. While, it's not as good as those films that I listed above. While, this might be a controversy decision. I have to say, it's a lot better than a lot of older films during the silent era in entertainment value. It's really funny, and you find yourself, laughing yourself head off. Honestly, besides Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton's films, there are rarely any funny silent era films. Most of them, were very slapstick and didn't have much of any other types of humor. I have to say this film was a lot clever in how to show emotional without speaking than the silent era. The movie does well to establish the limit of the medium, but throughout the film, they do break it at times. I love how clever the film it was to show adult themes like George's leading lady almost giving the finger. Though if you pay attention to her lips, you can see she's also a silent Cluster F-Bomb. The film have a lot of things, you quite don't see in any old silent-movie. The film has way better acting than a lot of those way over the top acting from silent films. Did Jean Dujardin deserve the Best Actor award that year? In my opinion, not really. While, his acting was alright in the medium, he was in. It's cool that he tap dance, have comedy chops and show emotion, but it was indeed limiting. You really don't see, how great; he can become, because he playing this silly likable character than. Still, he's by far the best thing in the film. I didn't like Berenice Bejo or the role, she had. She felt a bit 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl'. Also, Berenice Bejo doesn't really stand out, much. Half of the time, I mistake her for actress, Rachel McAdams. The dog, Uggie remind me a lot of Skippy aka Asta who appeared in dozens of movies during the 1930s like the Thin Man series. While, the film mostly expresses its love for movies by channeling well-known silent-era tropes; the movie has a lot of references to early talkies films, more than silent films. Don't get me wrong, you see some silent film references to Rudolph Valentino's films like 1920's Mask of Zorro, 1921's The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse & 1927's Metropolis, but I wish the movie capture more from that era than it did. I have watch a lot of silent films over the years, and the film is missing telling the story in purely epic visual terms. While, the movie isn't low budget. It feels and look low budget at times. Why have only a few dancers? 1920s films like 1929's Broadway Melody had tons of them. Why have a small set for the Mask of Zorro rip-off scene? Get a huge set for it, like 1916's Intolerance. I was really hoping for a lot of 4:3 shots made to look wide screen with large sets and tons of extras. Films in the 1920s were big and high in production value, back then. I was hoping for something like that. I like how catchy the main tune is, by Ludovic Bource. It was indeed fun to hear, but I surprise to hear a synchronized music recorded for a silent film. Most of the time in silent film terms, the theater would provide the music for the film or sheet music would be sent down with the film. While, it's not a big deal, if the movie really wanted to be, realistic. It wouldn't have any sound effects or background music like older silent films. There has been some controversy about the film music. Actress Kim Novak stated that the film ""rape"" portions of Bernard Herrmann's score from Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo for this film. I have to disagree with Novak, here. They did use music from another movie, but they did pay for it. The movie pacing is a hit and miss. At 100 minutes, the movie pacing should be fast pace, considering the simplistic, and silent, narrative, but it tendency drags on. Still, most of the scenes that they linger on, were worth it. Though for those who interpret and analysis the film, believe The Artist serves a metaphor for those who reject new technologies such as this generation, when digital media is becoming more and more the norm. You have to learn how to convert and change with the times. Overall: This movie was alright. I didn't think it was all Oscar worthy like they made it out to be, but definitely worth a look."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","5","9","27 November 2013"," Heartfelt History with an Eternally Pertinent Theme
","An excellent, caring, deeply nostalgic look at the changing of the guard in 1930s Hollywood. Though the primary narrative focuses on the shift from silent film to full-blown ""talkies,"" The Artist serves as metaphor for so much more. Truly, every generation endures this brand of major tidal shift, with the forward-thinkers rewarded for their daring while those set in their ways are swiftly discarded and forgotten. Presented as a silent film itself, the production delights in toying with its audience, no sooner establishing its own rules before testing and bending them. While the cue cards and light accompanying score are, initially, something of a distraction, as the film moves along it becomes remarkable just how restrained and appropriate they both become. Perhaps my greatest surprise wasn't that nothing was said, but that nothing needed to be. Costars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, both duly recognized by the academy for their roles, spill chapters with their bodies, expertly overcoming the potential handicap of the format and running full-bore with the premise. They sparkle, both together and apart, in two very different roles, and are essential players in nudging the finished product from ""good idea"" to ""borderline classic."""

","This was a very good movie. I think a lot of the success this movie had was due to the fact that it was done as a silent film which got it a lot of hype, most films aren't black and white any more obviously and nobody does silent much so when it did these things it got a lot of attention, obviously especially in Hollywood because they go nuts for any movie that's about Hollywood and movie making in general. It's amusing to me that the movie was all about Hollywood and set in Hollywood but made by the French. Also this movie is not a silent film! A movie is either silent or has sound and this movie was not silent for the entire film, the last scene has sound and dialogue. I know that is picky but a film can't have any sound at all in my mind if it is a silent film. I also wish there were more scenes with John Goodman and that he got more attention for his supporting role. The actor deserved the Oscar win, the lead actress was great too, and the film deserved winning for best picture, but it was also a weaker year. This movie was very good but not the status of great."

"seaview1","9","5","9","24 February 2012"," The ARTIST and the Golden Age of Tinseltown
","The Artist is a little gem of a silent film that was shot in black and white. This clever throwback to old Hollywood was the work of a French production team with American support and headed by director Michel Hazanavicius. Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale. Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no less. The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern audiences.<br/><br/>In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinée idol whose films are popular with the masses. At one Hollywood premier, he shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in movies. George's home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife (Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile, Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman). During a dance club scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while Peppy is a fast rising star. When the stock market crashes, Valentin is ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.<br/><br/>This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos. If that sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don't make anymore, it's because they haven't for over eighty years! People who respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic silent films like Chaplin's City Lights and The General by Buster Keaton. The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other masterworks.<br/><br/>The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right out of A Star Is Born. When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at the dinner table in Citizen Kane. The scenes where the studio is switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in Singin in the Rain. The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone? <br/><br/>Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly in the playful main theme,it uses several minutes of a love theme from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo for a climactic sequence. It works just fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann's haunting score may find it a tad annoying. There are also a couple brief instances when actual sound is employed to great effect.<br/><br/>There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline. There is a sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on display. And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the bird in a silent film! <br/><br/>Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clichés, but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless film wears off. And consider this-an engaging silent film with no nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the way to the Oscars."
"guyincognito1","9","5","9","13 February 2012"," A Triumph
","I have fallen in love with this film. It is touching, sad, yet witty and enigmatic. It is quirky. In short, it is one of the best films I have seen. The last time I said such a thing, it was about Inception, which is in itself a truly wonderful film, but if I tell you that this film beats it into the ground, then you are halfway there to understanding how brilliant a piece of cinema this is.<br/><br/>From seemingly nowhere come a triumphant lead, Jean Dujardin, and a truly astonishing talent in Berenice Bejo. They play their characters with such belief, such conviction, and such sensitivity that it is simply a pleasure to watch. In fact, the whole cast produce something very special and I doubt if they will ever make such a film again.<br/><br/>The camera-work was exceptional, and deserving of the BAFTA it won last night. Indeed, all the BAFTAs the cast and crew won yesterday were truly deserved, and they probably should have got more besides. Even the dog should have been rewarded for some truly heroic work! In what is essentially homage to something no-one really remembers, Hazanavicius creates a world which we can see, enjoy, even take part in, and there is no cheesy symbolism or anything like that, it is all very subtle. Not so subtle that only a select few will get them, but in a way that makes you impressed that you noticed. <br/><br/>The black and white was illuminating, and at times was so bright it almost felt like colour. All of the awards and praise it has received has deserved. The film is also clever, and the dialogue, which you would rightly expect to be minimal, is only transcribed when absolutely necessary, which is surprisingly not often. The beauty of the film is that we know what everybody is saying, we know what they are feeling, which is also the true beauty of the silent film.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that there was only one thing that I did not like about the film, and I will not spoil it by telling what it might be, but I will say that stylistically, it is perfect for the moment, and merely a technique that I personally do not like. That said, overall, this film exceeded all expectation. This is a film which is both beautiful and funny. And I applaud it."
"leecjaster","Null","5","9","24 January 2012"," The moment the credits roll, you'll want it to start all over again.
","The Artist is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of the year. An original masterwork filled with true moments of joy, drama, pain, and classic romance that hasn't been seen on-screen this side of Singing in the Rain or Gone With the Wind. <br/><br/>For the modern audience, most of whom have never actually seen a silent film, the task of sitting through an entire production based around the concept of a silent actor portrayed in a silent movie will prove to be a cinematic curve that will deter certain audience members (see: anyone who liked Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides).<br/><br/>For those who are willing to listen, The Artist will provide the most satisfying taste of cinema's ability to truly entertain.<br/><br/>George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a prominent silent film star in the late 1920s. On the top of the world, Valentin spends his days working at a job he loves, coming home to his loyal (and adorable) dog, Uggie . He also comes home to his wife, Doris (Penelope Anne Miller), but a brief hello is the extent of their vapid interaction.<br/><br/>Valentine has a chance meeting with a fan while schmoozing for the crowd, and this serendipitous event turns out to have vast repercussions on George's future. The girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), soon musters up her own career, eventually finding a place for herself in Hollywood. The attraction is immediate and visceral, but the two cannot consummate their feelings.<br/><br/>When ""talkies"" become the future of the movie industry, George finds himself out of work, a has-been, and decides to prove the world wrong by making his own silent feature. All the while, Peppy finds herself as the new face of the talking Hollywood era. From here The Artist weaves a wonderfully spirited portrayal of a man who has it all, loses what he loves, and must come to terms with what his life can be.<br/><br/>Will he find love? Will he get back on top? Will he make it out alive?<br/><br/>Valentin is one of cinema's most empathetic characters to come along in years. He's a throwback to the stern of mind, light of feet, and ""quick with a joke or a light of your smoke"" movie stars from a by-gone era. Jean Dujardin, who has rightfully earned many awards and nominations for his performance is simply—enigmatic. He shows more emotion in his left eyelash than most actors over an entire career.<br/><br/>Physical comedy, which hasn't been enjoyable on-screen since Jim Carrey and Chris Farley were able to capture the magic again in the early '90s, is finally back. When George and Peppy engage in a Deliverance moment of back and forth dance steps, the audience cannot help but smile. The Artist is a gift, it brings the past to the present, full of all the original charm and charisma that made cinema a worthy art form in its genesis.<br/><br/>In order to engage a modern audience effectively, The Artist boasts a captivating score by Ludovic Bource. Helping to keep the audience up to speed with the tone and feeling of each scene, the score's heightened importance creates a different kind of cinematic experience that hasn't been around since the silent film era. There is no other score as integral as The Artist's is to its success. <br/><br/>The Artist is also masterfully directed by Michel Hazanavicius, choosing to visually move the audience with shots framed with a classic elegance and movement. (It was actually shot in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio from the silent film era.) The scene that showcases this best features George drinking whiskey on a reflective table. The camera turns upside down, framing his reflection, only to have the whiskey poured on top and distill his appearance. The scene gives the audience everything they need know about the character, and it's simply brilliant to watch. <br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>A captivating and cultured cinematic love letter to the era of Hollywoodland, The Artist not only hearkens back to the best of the era, but pushes modern cinema forward with a look back to where it came from. It's amazing with all of the hack Hollywood scripts floating around, the idea of turning them into silent movies shouldn't be altogether cast aside. (It's a shame The Artist wasn't around before George Lucas started working on his prequels, audiences may have never been subjected to that horrid excuse for dialog. C'est la vie.)<br/><br/>On the Side<br/><br/>Uggie is one one of the best on-screen dogs in years. In fact, this year boasted a rather large collection of memorable pets, including Arthur in Beginners, Dolce in Young Adult, Skeletor in 50/50, and (stretching a bit here) Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Any dog lover must see The Artist, simply to shed a few tears about the love between a man and his best friend."
"tadzio148","Null","5","9","5 January 2012"," Dr. Johnson's Dog
","I liked this movie, but it reminded me a bit of Dr. Johnson's dog walking on its two hind legs: it was noteworthy only because it could be done at all. (The real dog in The Artist is one of the best things in the film.) Otherwise, I was principally struck by the camera work. The film seems largely true in its sets, costumes, music and, most especially, in the over-sized, operatic acting that is necessary for a silent. But the camera work is oddly, relentlessly modern. The filmmaker avoids antique devises (there was one iris-in; no wipes or dissolves). The editing is quick. There was a lot more tracking and dollying than I think would be the case in your average silent where the actors spend more time moving about in a static establishing shot.<br/><br/>So we are left with an odd conclusion: the filmmaker (or the producers) evidently decided that we would pay money to see a silent film only if it was not VISUALLY true to the silent era. And, after all is said and done, we get exactly what the movie is: a modern film pretending to be a silent."
"rjc722","10","5","9","11 December 2011"," The Artist is Pure Art!
","I doubt as a reviewer I can say anything about this movie that hasn't already been saidbut as a filmmaker who has written and produced a film on the silent film era (Madcap Mabel) I can say plenty, starting with the sub-title to The Artist should be ""Is Great"". For starters, what the film does best is not overplay its concept. It is a silent film but it doesn't hit us over the head by playing to the public's general perception of what those films entailed. For instance, title cards and music are used sparingly and not as cliché devices catering to what people not familiar with the genre (in other wordsthe majority of the movie going audience) would expect to see. This not only gives one an appreciation for not being catered or dumbed down to, but allows the actors to truly earn their keep by ""acting"".<br/><br/>The story is simple but classicafter helping young starlet ""Peppy Miller"" (the name fits the character), movie idol ""George Valentin"" (the last name perhaps an homage to silent great Rudolph) falls on hard times and when the now famous actress he's helped tries to return the favor, his pride becomes his biggest demon. OK, we've seen this when James Mason's alcoholic binges destroyed him after making Judy Garland the title character in the classic A Star is Born. However, setting this theme in the silent movie era, using the advent of sound as the impetus which led to the title character's downfall (fueled of course by a drug more dangerous to an actor than alcohol""ego"") was both ingenious and historically accurate as many a silent film star's career disappeared when sound first emerged from their mouths (as another classic, Singin' in The Rain, could attest).<br/><br/>The film's structure moves everything at a great pace. We see actor Valentin's subtle downfall from fame equally balanced with starlet Miller's rise and again without the usual clichés. The cinematography is as sharp as any classic black & white film and the few lines we do read from title cards are witty and clever. Finally, the ending which I will not give away, brings everything full circle.<br/><br/>Director Michel Hazanavicius should be applauded for not only attempting the risk of making a silent film about silent films in this day and age, but for writing a screenplay which not only brings together such classic themes, but doing it in ways that cleverly highlight the film's genre by using its silent limitations. I not only smell Oscar nomination herebut maybe Oscar itself.<br/><br/>Speaking of Oscarlead Actor Jean Dujardin should also be getting an early phone call on nomination day for his portrayal of the egotistical yet always classy fading star. As for lead Actress Berenice Bejoshe does the impossible by letting her natural beauty come second to her natural acting. Her performance combines comedy, tragedy and genuine emotion and one can't help wonder how great she would have been as an actual actress from that era. Her large expressive eyes which make one melt with every blink speak volumeswhich although an oxy-moron when discussing silent film is certainly true in this case. Her scene with a coat rack is hysterically-romantic and if the Academy gave an award for ""Cute Dancing"", her ""Charleston"" would be win handsor should I say ""feet"" down. In good supporting roles are Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's long suffering wife ""Doris"", James Cromwell as his chauffeur /assistant ""Clifton"" and John Goodman as the blustery studio head ""Al Zimmer"" (another good name). And for all you pet loversyes, Valentin has a very talented dog that fills those ""awwwww"" moments.<br/><br/>The films only fault maybe it could put acting schools and teachers out of business for all aspiring thespians need do to learn the true craft of their vocation is to watch the heartfelt, well written and well directed performances in The Artist. As a silent movie buff I Iook at this film as a love letter to that bygone era and hope and expect it will renew and create interest in classic silent movies and silent movie stars. As a writer, producer, actor and general movie lover myself I give it as many stars as the talkies destroyed. In fact, I've already put in my pre-order on Amazon for the DVD, the insert of which I'm sure will feature the words ""Academy Award Winner""."

I was expecting much more since the critics are so amazing and the rewards are so many to glorify this film. I asked myself a question after finishing viewing the movie: What makes this movie so boring? I think the answer is that I have seen most if not all the classics of non speaking movies, the Jazz Singer, all the Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson, the Cecile B DeMille collection, Fritz Lang, the Cabinet of doctor Caligari, etc, etc....

","""..with an open mind i headed into this year's 'almost cert' Oscar movie 'The Artist'. I personally had only heard bad things although i had been told that it was receiving rave reviews. I wonder why. I love old black and white movies, but ones with a good story. The Artist simply took from many, many b & w movies before it and simply re-made it. As i watched the movie unfold before me i did ask what many had seemed to ask already...What is the point. If this does win numerous awards at the Oscars this year then yet another remake or imitation does it again. Yes, it is well made BUT..with the technology that the studios have today, this would be an easy feat. Was I entertained..no not one bit. In fact i was so desperate for some sound...which says a lot for the movie. As i write this piece i am still wondering what on earth was the point to all of this. Was it a way of ribbing the current film industry. Was it a just trying to be clever. Was it trying to be different (and do we need that). What was it trying to achieve. Those who give it high praise must be seeing something i am certainly not seeing. Those sad geeks out there that spot the 'references'...good luck to you. All i spotted was a nice imitation of what has already been and gone...and done much better than this attempt. 2/10 (for effort) TV is proving a far more powerful medium than the movies these days-Great Expectations, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, Treme, The Hour etc etc p.s.

"gizmomogwai","4","6","12","27 April 2014"," An obnoxious stunt film
","In a modern age of cinema, directors sometimes opt to go with black and white for artistic reasons, and it often works for those films. I rewatched Schindler's List after seeing The Artist for the first time yesterday, and the 1993 Best Picture winner was totally worthy of the honour. A silent film for the sake of ""artistic"" reasons, on the other hand, you pretty much never see, until this. There's a reason we stopped making silent films, after all, as it's generally a lower form of art. A film, at least for me, is usually defined by its dialogue, and an actor by his/her delivery. And it's the way drama is supposed to be. If you went to a Shakespeare play at the Globe Theatre, would you be able to hear the actors, or would you just see them mouth their lines, occasionally with cards held up indicating some of what they said?<br/><br/>The Artist explores a cliché concept, a silent actor struggling to adjust to sound, that we've seen done before, and better, with Sunset Blvd. (1950) and Singin' in the Rain (1952). This one is simply distinguished by an obnoxious stunt, being silent (or mostly silent), with the usual problems that come with it. Most of the dialogue is not only inaudible, it's not written on the cards, leaving you to guess what it is, unless you're HAL 9000. And to tell a story not worth retelling. What was the point of this film, aside from anything we hadn't seen before from Sunset Blvd. or Singin' in the Rain? Just to see the cute little doggie? A low point among Best Picture Oscar-winners, to claim this is better than The Descendants or A Separation baffles me."

And how can this movie, with a commonplace script (so simple, predictable, and slow it makes you nervous), with a story so old fashioned and a staging so plain I was taking glimpses of my watch within 40 minutes into the movie, knowing already how the story would evolve, and what would be the ending, how can a film like this be nominated and win so many prizes???? My only answer is, ironically, the cinema era is finished, and we have produced nothing more valuable that this. I say ironically, because the The Artist dwells precisely in the same spot, the crisis cinema went through when it went from silent to sound. Now, I think we are living the end of the big cinema industry, and the emigration of every talent to TV. The aesthetics of The ARtist can be spared, though. Specially the protagonist dresses, really marvelous, the faces and smiles of both protagonists, really gorgeous, the black and white silent (with music) elements, and the 4:3 screen, to celebrate old times. But at the same time, it is an insult to those marvelous silent movies, to Chaplin, and Keaton for example, with stories so exciting and original they are still modern today, and of course, to Sunset Boulevard, the wonderful B.

","It's 1927. Arguably Hollywood's most admired movie screen idol, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), is enjoying the success of his latest picture, The Russian Affair. He enjoys his work and the adulation he receives by being a movie star, as witnessed by how he hogs the spotlight during The Russian Affair's post-premiere bows. Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is an aspiring young actress, who literally and figuratively runs into Valentin at the premiere, which ends up being the launching pad to her Hollywood acting career through bit parts. The advent of talking pictures brings a reversal to their fortunes as Kinograph, the movie studio where Valentin is under contract, is looking for fresh faces such as Peppy Miller to star in their talking pictures, while Valentin resists the entire notion of talking pictures. Peppy, who appreciates everything that Valentin did for her career, tries to help him as much as she can, but Valentin may have to decide on his own where and if he fits into the Hollywood machine, one where he doesn't think people want to hear him speak.<br/><br/>A celebration of the silent era and I can surely see why it won the Oscar. This represents everything that Hollywood loves and has nostalgia for. Jean Dujardin brought his character's joy, pain, pride and the love for another woman who wasn't his wife to perfection on screen. Surprisingly, Berenice Bejo's Peppy was a heart stealer and is one of the best performances of the year by any actress. All the supporting actors like John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller (though her character was painfully one-dimensional) and others are fantastic. The music, the costumes, the sets, the execution were all great. I especially loved the metaphor when George taps his bottle onto the table and he hears sound and he can feel his career vanishing away from him. That was simply marvellous to behold and I was so in awe of that scene. The whole movie is well put together, but my only gripe is that it isn't daring. The movie doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done before and the ending is far too sweet and saccharine and very wishful for the tale its telling and that it has no worthwhile commentary to offer for what happened to many of the stars from the silent era who didn't have such a happy ending to their own tales. But, the movie is unoffensive and I do think The Artist deserved the honours bestowed upon it since its so infectious and charming.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Most people do not watch silent films. In fact, most people do not watch black and white films. Judging by the box office lately it seems people are even giving up on theatrical 2D. So I know I have my work cut out for me when I say you must go see The Artist as soon as possible. It is silent, black and white, 2D and not even in widescreen. And it is going to be crowned the Best Picture of the year by the Academy Awards; if it doesn't I will have serious reservations about defending the Oscars' integrity.<br/><br/>It is the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star who is pushed aside at the start of the sound era; the classic rouge hero is quickly forgotten as new star Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) takes centre stage working for Al Zimmer (John Goodman) and the Kinograph Studios.<br/><br/>All of the performances, with Dujardin and Bejo at the centre, make this an extremely relatable film. Even modern audiences expecting to be frustrated by the lack of dialogue will be surprised by the expressive storytelling power that this film delivers. An equal partner to the actors is the film's score by Ludovic Bource, and director Michel Hazanavicius uses the music or removes the music with elegant ease.<br/><br/>Many will claim it is for filmmakers and cinephiles only, but that is not true. Filmmakers and cinephiles are just at the head of the pack because they already watch silent films and understand that they should not be treated differently. A moment of silence will bring a hush to the audience, as it should, but that is no different than any other modern film. When a joke is funny, you can laugh. When a shock surprises you, you can gasp. A great film is a great film, and this uses every trick developed in a century of filmmaking to tell the most beautifully realized love letter to cinema I have ever seen. Only Hugo and Cinema Paradiso have come this close to recreating the exhilaration I remember from seeing my first movies.<br/><br/>This silent, black and white, full-frame movie is a delight. I will be going back to see it again. I will buy it on blu-ray. I will make everyone I know watch it because, believe me, it is breathtaking.<br/><br/>http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2012/01/the-artist.html"

Well, after all that a breath of fresh air is a blessing to anyone with a sincere love for cinema. ""The Artist"" goes against the flow and restores some of the art without appearing artificial. Time for some pure back to the roots entertainment of the grand scale and with its simple yet poignant story the film doesn't strive to be anything but. While back in the days black and white was dictated by the medium's limitations, it also signified a filter, a style, which now again - brought back via a postmodern lens - helps to see things differently than we are used to in real life. Music, not words, floats through the air and the picture prefers to conclude with a tap dance rather than a twist for a twist's sake. In all that ""The Artist"" serves as a reminder, a reminder of what we gain by taking a step back, by opening our eyes and ears to experience the beauty and the magic that reverberates in the sound of a perfect silent."

","Now this is a masterpiece. Surprising to say since its a modern black and white movie without sound. Most modern movie audiences would be put off by movies like this but what makes this work is the simplicity in its story and how it pays homage to the nearly forgotten film style of silent filmmaking. This is more or less love letter to hardcore fans of cinema and serves as a reminder to why we watch movies in the first place.<br/><br/>The story is the simple but classic story of out with the old and in with the new. Its the late 1920s and the era of silent films comes to a close with the advent new style of film called the ""Talkie"" and a silent movie star faces the end of his career when he cant adapt to the new form of art.<br/><br/>French actor Jean Dujardin gives a fantastic performance without speaking a single word. Most acting nowadays doesn't involve emoting but Jean proves that acting can still be powerful without talking. His co star Berenice Bejo does just as great, not to mention shes beautiful as Peppy Miller who becomes a talkie movie star.<br/><br/>The camera-work is fantastic old school and really looks like that it was filmed in the 1920s. The set design, costumes and cars all feel authentic to the time period making this a period piece. The music is just great and very emotional at times just matching the feel of every scene.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves cinema. Just go into this with an open mind and don't be discouraged because its silent and black and white. Id say that this film is worthy of owning but thats me. 10 out of 10 stars"

","Korean girlfriend insisted on seeing this, so I caved. Thought I was in for a yawner, Cannes film festival, put your feet to sleep, ""let me out of here!""...etc.<br/><br/>Now, in all honesty, the first 15 minutes may have you looking for the exits as this experience is...well...unique, and initially boring (for anyone will all their teeth). Anyway, as the picture progresses you'll find yourself more attentive and involved, probably more than you've ever been before, because this movie demands your ""active"" as opposed to ""passive"" attention. No great special effects or digital wizardry to mindlessly delight the senses, just great facial expressions, body language and stage presence to convey emotion and meaning (with the odd dialogue box thrown in when necessary). <br/><br/>In my case, by the time we got to movie's end the only word that came to mind was riveting. The Korean audience were literally awe struck by the picture, judging by the looks on their faces as they stayed in their seats and actually sat through the credits (usually it's a mad dash for the exits as soon as the lights come up). I felt the same way. I have seen some black and white comedy (Charlie Chaplin) on the nostalgia channel, along with some snippets from other silent films, but I've never sat through an entire production like this and really gotten into the story.<br/><br/>For you guys with gals, this is a great way to score brownie points with your girl (going to an apparent ""chic flick""). Thus justify dragging her to an action movie in the future. Best part is you'll really enjoy it, too (just don't tell her...stupid):)"

","... WOW, don't know where to start. I kept getting mixed reviews of this movie from friends and family so I wasn't sure whether to watch it or not. But once I finally did watch it, I was outraged by the fact that anyone could find this movie bad. Everyone has their opinion obviously and I feel that in some cases the movie is discriminated for the fact of it being black and white and silent. As long as the person explains why the movie is bad rather than saying that its black and white and silent, I'm happy. I just think that this movie was perfect. From the very beginning it was captivating due to the charisma of the protagonists. Dujardin... What a breathtaking performance along side Bejo, they were both spectacular and how beautiful did she look?<br/><br/>This movie was just a directing master piece. Every scene was perfect and they all kept me at the tip of my chair because I was so desperate to know what was going to happen, not to mention the incredible flux of emotions. The movie kept such a light-hearted vibe and then the breakdown of George comes along and we can but wish that a happy ending will come. I recommend this movie for every movie lover... It is unmissable."
"zaciogeribello","10","4","7","26 February 2012"," What Is It That Movies Are All About?
","The Artist searches the ultimate fountains of movies. If you take everything else out, what is the essential? Could we take out the sound? The dialogs? The images? No, not the images. But is that what movies are all about? The reason to be? Not quite, at least I don't think so and I don't feel this way. We could not take the images, for sure, but that's because it's the media, the supporting language of movies. But maybe it's not yet the essential.<br/><br/>I studied language a lot at the university, it would be very boring and inappropriate to discuss it here, but it would be very useful to comment something about it. It's the ""old"" discussion, the ""rivalry"": which says more, or means more to us? Words or images? Words and images or silence? Images or music? If we put that way, though, it would seem that all these languages, all these ways to express feelings, thoughts and actions would be in an endless battle against each other, competing against each other, but it is not true. One media, one language, helps the other, works with the other. This is art and culture, this is language.<br/><br/>So, when we see a silent movie, it doesn't mean it has no words or dialogs. If we could see it, there would be an intense interchange of words, between silent movies and audiences. Words are all over it, in the big screen and in the atmosphere of the theater. We are all the time trying to put words in it, to understand. There's no way one could understand images, even sounds, without looking for words.<br/><br/>Sometimes they just aren't in the first plan of things, but they are there. There is just a difference in the focus, in the emphasis of what is being told and the way it's being told. Sometimes best communication comes with silence. But there are words deep inside the silence and all around it. So the essence of movies could not be just the images or just the silence. Also, it's not essential that you spell all the words, sonorous ones.<br/><br/>By watching The Artist in 2012 we spontaneously start thinking about those things. The answers or maybe the new questions should come from the story, from the movie. I actually made a list: audience, entertainment, art, magic, dream, visual effects, comedy, drama, adventure, mystery, there are a lot of very important roots composing the essence of movies. They are the elements of movies that combine in very different proportions in each project, like a DNA.<br/><br/>There seems to be, however, one element among all the others, that made movies what they are, that made movie industry and its alternatives what they are. Of course we know it, it's romance. Not always in the first plan, sometimes not visible in any plan, but it's there, like the words, it's the essence, what makes us understand movies. Even when it's denied, fought against or destroyed; it's the energy that works underneath. Or when there's a silence about love and romance in a movie, we miss it. But when it comes to the surface, we finally meet what we were looking for, what gives meaning to a not ordinary but very special life.<br/><br/>This is what movies are all about. None of us really want an ordinary life, we want it to be special and happy. We are not all the time thinking about love and romance, but that's the road where everything else we care about is. And that is what made The Artist a great movie. It is a wonderful story, a meaningful one, working with all these elements, roots and, of course, the essence of movies."
"Marcelo_Dos_Santos","9","4","7","10 February 2012"," Cinema in its most chemically pure state
","Hitchcock used to say that the silent movies were the most perfect state of the cinematographic art. And, of course, this is an undeniable truth. <br/><br/>In 2011, a French director, obviously a movie buff, sketches out this profound, touching, brilliant recreation of a time, a set of techniques and a filmmaking community long ago gone. <br/><br/>The Artist is an exercise of style; despite the fact that some of the shooting techniques from the silent era cannot be reproduced now (for technical or commercial reasons), director Michel Hazanavicius shows to our unaccustomed eyes the life and the work of the men and women who made movies even before the modern film language was invented (by Hitchcock himself). <br/><br/>The traumatic and difficult transition between the silent and the talkies is portrayed here from the point of view of a great silent actor, who is dubious about his ability to talk on camera and keep being believable. This membrane shakes the entire industry, and even the companies have to decide whether to keep making silents or retrain their entire productive process into the sound. There is a beautiful love store embedded in, and a superb directorial work, mixing ancient and modern techniques to configure a shining piece of visual narrative, a real time travel to the past and a heart touching tribute to those pioneers. The only obvious anachronism is the modern make up (I'd rather like the kind they used to wear back then, so full of contrast and flamboyant to the naked eye, but not for those lowly sensitive film emulsions), but, letting this aside, the entire movie becomes a highly developed piece of art, fluid and flawless. <br/><br/>Great acting of the entire cast (that Argentinian beauty Bérénice Bejo will left you breathless many times), with all the craftsmanship of John Goodman and James Cromwell... But watch out particularly for Uggy the Jack Russell Terrier, because the little guy is perfectly capable of stealing your heart. As a matter of fact, the dog is just another main character in this film. He cannot talk, but the humans don't, either. <br/><br/>Also, watch out for the last ten minutes of the music score: the trained ears of classic moviegoers will found a revered master there (two of them, in fact). And lots and lots of cinephile winks and tiny tributes for the eyes capable of spotting them. <br/><br/>All in all, a movie about the movies, the filmmakers and the actors, and a great artistic work almost perfect in itself. <br/><br/>Worth watching? Of course yes... twice."

","I have just seen The Artist and was totally blown away by it. It is such a joy to see a film which doesn't rely on big bangs & special effects but purely on the acting, soundtrack & cinematography.<br/><br/>I went to see this out of curiosity & wasn't sure if I would enjoy it or not. I can honestly say that I could have watched it again & still have been gripped. Yes the story might not be particularly deep but it is told with such feeling that you can't help but be drawn in. This film is a true display of 'proper' acting. No reliance on dialogue, just the acting in it's purest form where every little feature or movement has to tell the story.<br/><br/>From a light, fluffy start the film turns to some quite dark scenes to convey the turmoil of George Valentin as his star descends & boy did he convey it well. It felt as if you were being dragged into his psyche and the pain he endured was brilliantly portrayed. <br/><br/>As for the dog, well what can I say! When George is at his lowest & thinking of suicide you actually feel the dogs desperation to stop him.<br/><br/>I can understand why there are those who don't enjoy or 'get' this film. As others have said, I suppose it's a bit like Marmite, but I think that not everyone understands what this film is about. It' a love letter to the cinema but it's also about the problem that many silent actors must have faced. You might be a good ham but it doesn't mean you have the voice or talent to cross over to talkies.<br/><br/>I enjoyed everything about this film. The superb acting, the soundtrack, the clever use of sound, the beautiful way in which it was filmed. EVERYTHING. If you want to see something wonderful that is truly different, uplifting & full of heart then go to see this film. It certainly got under my skin & I don't even like silent films!"

","I started in a different mindset than most watchers, I think, because there are some silent films that I LOVE, namely Birth of a Nation, Nosferatu, and especially Metropolis. It was odd to consider going to a new silent, but I'm SO glad I did! This movie may not be what you expect (though in many ways it's quite familiar), but it is utterly affecting. The leads are likable beyond reason, and the supporting cast is great and sometimes familiar as well. Please, people, don't write this off because it's black-and-white and/or silent. (SPOILER - it's not ALL silent, and when the director chooses to use sound, it's a shocker because one so quickly gets used to silent mode!) Some of the music will be familiar to Hitchcock fans - name that tune! I'll bet this takes some awards, and justly so. Just see it."
"DonFishies","8","4","7","29 November 2011"," A wildly enjoyable dose of cinematic magic
","Looking back at the ride that was this year's TIFF, I continue to find multiple errors in judgment in regards to what I could have seen versus what I did see. While I saw some extraordinary works, I find that I missed out on some truly incredible films. One such loss was The Artist, a decision I regretted immediately afterwards. I have heard nothing but praise since the film's debut at Cannes, and missing out when I had a remote chance was a terrible mistake. Luckily, I only had to wait a short while before getting another chance to see the film. And let me say right from the start, if you have the chance to see this film, do not think twice about missing out.<br/><br/>George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the pinnacle of his career as a silent film star in late 1920s Hollywood. He is a megastar, beloved by his fans and loathed by his studio. On chance, he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) and helps get her film career started over night. But as talkies start to take over and Miller's star rises, Valentin's starts to fall. <br/><br/>It does not sound like a lot, but the simplicity of The Artist is where the film finds its charm and its wonder. Michel Hazanavicius, a relative unknown on this side of the Atlantic, has composed something truly extraordinary and ridiculously unique by 2011 standards. Who would have thought that creating a silent film would provide one of the most enjoyable experiences you will likely have at the movies all year?<br/><br/>Of course, the most widely discussed item regarding the film is its use of silent film tropes and language. This is a silent film about a silent film star. Hazanavicius takes his cues from the pioneers of cinema, and wisely and effortlessly fuses together a film that would not look entirely out of place should it have been shown in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Where filmmakers have been using a widescreen canvas since the 1950s, Hazanavicius stubbornly sticks to the method of the time and displays everything he needs to in the 1.37:1 ratio. I imagine the film would look great in colour, but again, he stays true to the time and gives the film a glorious black and white image that shines brighter than any colour image ever could have. It gives a certain aura of authenticity to the picture that borders on being a gimmick not unlike 3D, but instead allows the film to become all that more special and unique.<br/><br/>I must confess that I have watched very few silent films, a hurdle I envision many audience members may face when they see The Artist. But right from the opening frame, Hazanavicius makes it incredibly easy to put those fears to rest. Through the lovingly created and often nostalgia-inducing visuals, I found myself swept up and deeply engrossed in what was happening. While I could read the lips of some actors, I found that you never really needed to in order to get a full grasp of what was being conveyed. It may sound a bit pedantic of me to even consider discussing the semantics of my literal viewing experience, but it is something that demands to be noted. This film is not an easy sell, and its silent nature was initially a little startling of an idea for me. I do not know if Hazanavicius envisioned this problem from the offset, but I cannot imagine the film would be anywhere near as enjoyable had it had sound.<br/><br/>While Hazanavicius does deserve a lot of praise for the sheer fact that he made this film, I find an equal if not greater amount of praise should be bestowed on Dujardin. Without letting us hear him say a word, he is simply marvelous from beginning to end. He is a true artist, brilliantly using his emotions at every turn. He hams it up when he needs to, and then goes deeply serious even quicker. He works twice as hard as any actor working today to really make his plight from silent film icon to a distraught and lost has-been truly believable. His actions, whether wholesome fun or downright depressing, are one-of-a- kind, and make us truly appreciate what icons like Charlie Chaplin, Lou Chaney and Harold Lloyd had to go through when they made their films. The expressions on Dujardin's face are simply astounding, and are more than enough reason to see the film, if there were not already more than enough.<br/><br/>While Bejo's chemistry with Dujardin is the stuff of magic, I found that she was nowhere near as strong without him. She does some great work, but she never really comes out as a character that I truly believed in. I found that I was watching an actor act her way through a silent film, as opposed to Dujardin whose work simply transcends the medium. It makes for a slight disappointment, but thankfully she shares the screen with him enough times that it makes up for her fumbles on her own. Supporting turns from James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and especially John Goodman are all above and beyond great, but again, simply pale in comparison to the artistry on display by Dujardin.<br/><br/>It may be overly clear already, but rather simply put, The Artist is every bit as good as you have heard and probably even better. There are a few minor elements that simply do not add up, and a bit too much of a lull in the middle act, but this is a really wonderful film unlike any other this year. It is wildly enjoyable from beginning to end, and packs one of the best performances of the year that will leave you astounded. This is the kind of movie magic we see all too rarely. Do not let it pass you by.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"Chris_Pandolfi","10","4","7","25 November 2011"," Silence is Golden
","""The Artist"" is cinematic perfection  a joyous celebration of  everything that makes the movies so wonderful. Set during the end of  Hollywood's silent era, it surely must have been a labor of love for  writer/director Michel Hazanavicius, because in this day and age, a  filmmaker does not lightly make the decision to tell an image-driven  story in the language of melodrama. He pays careful attention to the  technical aspects. It's a (mostly) silent film, photographed in black  in white, shot in the Academy ratio of 1.33:1. It utilizes action-heavy  music that's intended to dictate how the audience is supposed to feel.  The actors rely almost entirely on body language and facial  expressions. Wherever necessary, intertitles will appear on screen  displaying vital bits of dialogue.  But ""The Artist"" is not merely a stylistic homage. If it were, it would  merely be a remake of Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie,"" which had a lot of  humor but little in the way of substance. It actually tells us a story,  a loose revision of ""Singin' in the Rain"" with just a hint of ""Sunset  Boulevard"" thrown in. It has interesting characters we can care about,  and because all of them are essentially decent, we don't feel as if  we've been manipulated into it. In its theatricality, it does not  patronize or dumb down; it wants to make a connection, and so it does  by appealing to emotions that I believe most audiences possess. There's  drama, comedy, romance, and dancing  all immensely entertaining, all  done with tremendous heart.  Taking place in Los Angeles between 1927 and 1932, it tells the story  of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star known for his  roles as action heroes and romantic leads. Just when it seemed his life  could not be any better, a producer named Al Zimmer (John Goodman)  shows him some test footage of an actress talking into a microphone.  It's a new innovation: Talkies, in which prerecorded sound is  synchronized with the picture. George initially laughs off the idea.  Who wants to hear actors talk? It won't have a future. But not long  after, major studios cease production on all new silent films. New  young actors, who are perfectly willing to have their voices heard in a  movie theater, quickly upstage their older silent counterparts. This  would include the fresh-faced Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who George  ran into completely by accident. In his dressing room, after saving her  from being fired onset, he tenderly supplies her with a trademark look:  A penciled-in beauty mark on her upper lip.  Although Peppy's star is rising, George's star is rapidly fading. By  1929, he has fallen out of love with his wife (Penelope Ann Miller),  preferring instead the company of his dog, his constant companion and  costar. He clings to the belief that he's better seen and not heard,  which is why he writes, produces, directs, and stars in his own film. I  don't need to tell you how the premiere goes. I will say that it  happens immediately after the stock market crash, leaving George with  virtually nothing. His wife kicks him out of the house. He begins  drinking. Out of kindness, he fires his loyal chauffeur and manservant,  Clifton (James Cromwell). He's forced to pawn his beloved tuxedo and  auction off his personal possessions, including a life-sized portrait  of himself. Can this washed up movie star ever find his way back into  the hearts of the people? Or will he completely fade into obscurity?  Watching Dujardin, with his strikingly handsome face and irresistibly  dashing smile, one cannot help but see echoes of Gene Kelly, especially  during the final scene. Bejo, slight but brimming with high  spiritedness, doesn't need to speak to let you know what she's feeling;  her expressive eyes do the talking for her. When a tear rolls down her  cheek, you're tempted to cry right along with her. Some would call this  mugging, except it isn't mugging  it's the language with much movies  like this communicate. If you take this away, you no longer have a  silent movie. Instead, you have a film in which the actors don't talk.  You know the difference. In the best possible sense, emotion oozes from  every character and every situation. This would include a climactic  fire sequence, in which the most unlikely of heroes will rise.  It's amazing how beautiful ""The Artist"" looks. Guillaume Schiffman's  Oscar-worthy cinematography transforms the sets into picturesque  dreamscapes and the actors into the very embodiment of glamour. Just  looking at the film floods the senses; you can smell the cigarette  smoke and pancake foundation, feel the burning studio lights, taste the  booze and the lip stain. It immerses you, not in another time so much  as in another world, where reality is filtered through nostalgia.  Speaking of Oscar nominations, I hope someone puts in a good word for  composer Ludovic Bource, whose powerful score runs almost the entire  length of the film. As long as I'm going this route, I might as well go  all out and hope for a Best Picture nomination. I'm fairly certain this  movie has the right qualifications."

","If you really fancy silent movies from long long ago en do not mind the lack of sounds in general en lack of voices from people talking to each other and you like the thin story's from 80 years back you must see this film. If not you will probably find this movie terribly slow and non dramatic. Drama is normally (among others) built around or grounded in sounds and voices. That's why the introduction of movies with voices was such a huge step forward! The Artist is really an almost complete silent movie with storyboards (!) tot tell the story. For reasons unexplained, the spectator is brought back in history, between 1927-1935. Not by the story which is situated about 80 years ago, but by the philmographic techniques. No zoom, no sound (except some music, which is OK), black and white, storyboard, etc. Thus it is very difficult, if not impossible to connect with the characters. Characters are also cardboard and the story is very simple and flat, as in more movies about 80 years old. With a running time of 100 minutes the movie is too long or at least feels far too long. I found the movie very boring. It is certainly not the best movie from this year"

"kgprophet","5","6","13","2 March 2012"," This is the best film of 2012? Really?
","Audiences of late are being educated about life in the early part of last century with the very layered ""Boardwalk Empire"". Moreso, the scripting and characters are intricate and have a complexity that modern audiences expect in intelligent filmmaking these days. Here comes ""The Artist"", a very simplistic and unadventurous throwback film. But really, even back then filmmaking was capable of complexity, like ""It Happened One Night"". Frankly, the story was so cliché and clunky, it felt like a film student's first screenplay. And the production was no more impressive than a stylised episode of ""Moonlighting"".<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin's James Bond spoofs. And I expect great things ahead for both of them. I am certainly convinced that they will make better films than this, one that really might deserve an Oscar. This is not a bad film, but ""Citizen Kane"" it is not. It really does not break any new ground, has slow character development, and the script at points felt repetitious. Although the photography adhered to 20's techniques, still some creativity could have been welcomed. Black and white photography can be stunningly beautiful. This film shows little flair despite being a bold period piece.<br/><br/>So what is left is the music, and there is nothing either disappointing or epic about the soundtrack. Again, for such a film to draw attention to a different place and time, only to model itself as the cookie cutter film establishment circa 1920's, loses it's chance to add nuance and complexity. ""Boardwalk Empire"" injects timely cultural nuance, along with the limitations and different mindsets of a less sophisticated time. Perhaps some reference to the silent comedy stars that suffered a similar fate (Charlie Chaplin was a silent film legend, but his comedy could not translate into talkies). In general, this film had a lot live up to when I walked into the theatre after winning so many accolades. There was nothing unique to this compared to other throwback films. It is not innovative in any way. They could have injected more subtle humour and less dog tricks (Disney has the silly dog film market covered). A bad Coen brothers film is better than this. I was surprised how little meat there was on the bone after sitting through it. Certainly a film like ""The Tree of Life"" is a more memorable film from 2012. Heck, ""Moneyball"" has a more intricacies to it and it's a baseball film. I am truly sorry I could not get into this film, and I will probably be considered someone who can't appreciate small art-house films. It depends, a small film with a great script will standout. This small film without a great script does not."

","One day in 1927, a star actor George meets a new face actress named Peppy. He advises her to make a noticeable feature to be a big actress and pencils a false spot on her face. Two years later, because of a change of the screen from silent to talkie, the popularity of George falls but Peppy becomes a top actress<br/><br/>What it is important that though this movie was made in 2011, it catches the atmosphere of the movies in 1920s. The pictures in this movie is in black and white and the makeup of characters are the very same as the 20s. The discovery of story is a little simple, but the performance of actors and stage direction are great. Motions and expressions of Peppy are very attractive and appearances of George after lose his position are so pathetic. But, more than them, the best player of this movie is the Dog of George!"

","Not knowing much besides the good rating on IMDb, I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did. This film is so different from the crap that rolls through Hollywood these days. Even without words, I connected with George Valentin throughout his fall from grace and his redemption. Refreshing film overall. The Artist is funny and dark, and everyone included, even his dog, played such pivotal roles. Who needs movies with a dozen stars with zero plot when there's gems like this.<br/><br/>George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the king of silent movies in Hollywood in 1927 and he knows it. Audiences just adore everything George is a part of. Along comes Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) who you just know is going to be a huge star some day. George and Peppy work together on one film as George not only takes her under his wing, but an undeniable spark develops between the two. Silent movies cease to exist as talking pictures takes its place. George finds himself struggling for a purpose to live as his identity as a silent movie star fades into obscurity."

","Change. It's something that happens, sometimes reluctantly to people who have lived an event so long it becomes faded, out of date, and is being passed up by the wanting of ""the new"". Change is the central topic of The Artist. There was a time Hollywood was innocent, filled with lightness and fluff. The paparazzi weren't trying to tear actors images to pieces for no good reason. Movies were made for the sake of having a good time, not worrying about being the most financially successful or who will win the most Academy Awards. The Artist shows us that time, and though it's a delightful film, it does cross into some dark territory.<br/><br/>The Artist may look like is a bagatelle with no worries in the world, everyone is happy all the time. It does charm the smile right onto your face, but what surprised me is The Artist's gloomy periods of human struggle. The Artist also covers the subject of Hollywood Actors being discarded when their time is up. Studio executives treat actors like throwaway cards in their poker games. It's tragic when a person builds their entire life with one light guiding their every decision, then, without warning being dismissed forever. The smart choice The Artist makes is having a man experience this situation because it's cliché to think women only get this discrimination. It's the harsh fact of the entertainment business.<br/><br/>Yes, it does cover some deep thoughts about Hollywood, but the quality that distinguishes The Artist is the style in which the tells us the story to us. Back in the days when silent pictures were all the film world had, ""talkies"" were the films everyone was fascinated by. The Artist proves the irony of today's society being drawn to the silent picture approach. Silent characters allows the film score to become the life of the movie. The way we react depends on the score and what it tells us. The score works toward the making the images accessible to the audience, and the visuals are just as pleasing as the musical composition. The imagination and creativity used to plan out and project the images of this time are glowing left to right, in the stunning black and white photography.<br/><br/>The Artist's second life necessity to breathing is laughing. I felt like I was laying on a cloud and whenever they laugh, it's like you're being tickled with a me with a feather. It's a pleasure to sit through The Artist, you'll having a great time. The nostalgia for the days of silent movies is amplified even more through Jean Dujardin rocking the look of the classical actors. You have such fun watching Dujardin in the role, that you may not notice the acting the man has behind his character. He creates an uncompromising charm for the protagonist, as well as dwelling on the character's misfortunes in later scenes. Berenice Bejo is lovely in her role, as well, but doesn't quite have the well-rounded character Dujardin was given.<br/><br/>Make The Artist you're #ThrowbackThursday, because it glorifies and eventually tears down a significant time in the history of entertainment. Michel Hazanvicius directs his picture with all the gusto to make us enjoy the time we're spending with the characters. He doesn't smother the picture, instead just lets the picture live. The ending is perfectly executed, progressing the moving times in a cute and classy manner. As soon as I parted ways with The Artist, the more I reflected on the time I spent watching it, the more I found a deeper appreciation for it. <br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"CinemaClown","Null","3","5","9 August 2013"," A Vintage Tour That Guarantees To Put A Smile On Every Cinema Lover's Face.
","Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Artist is an awe-inspiring ode to the silent era of cinema and is filmed with such fine elegance & precision artistry that it was too difficult for me to wipe the smile off my face while watching it. An enthralling work of indelible charm, every frame of this silent feature pays its tribute in the most respectful manner possible but also succeeds in carving out its very own identity in the process.<br/><br/>Set in Hollywood during the years when talkies were being introduced into cinema, The Artist focuses on the relationship between a major silent film star & an aspiring young actress who bump into each other during the premiere of the former's latest film. But when their production house decides to do away with silent films & usher in the new era of sound, the career of these two actors turns upside down as one heads for ruin, while other rises to stardom.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Michael Hazanavicius, The Artist opens in the same manner like films of that era used to & it even feels like you're watching a feature from that golden period. Paying attention to the smallest of details, it's an intriguing look at how production was carried out in those days, and if the excellence in the production design wasn't enough, its two lead actors manage to take it to a whole new level with their expressive & energetic performances.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography captures the whole picture in the same aspect ratio & frame rate as was standard in 1920s, black-n-white photography has a vintage feel to it, the first half of the film is exquisitely paced while the second half stumbles a little but makes a sharp return in its final moments to culminate on a high with a memorable final shot, and Ludovic Bource's background score wonderfully captures the era this story is set in.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, both Jean Dujardin & Bérénice Bejo are a revelation in their respective roles of silent film star, George Valentin & aspiring actress, Peppy Miller. With no words to speak on camera plus complete reliance on body language & facial expressions, the two actors make their characters work stunningly well & even share a sizzling chemistry together. Of the two leads however, I liked Bejo's work much more than Dujardin's.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, succeeding not only as a marvellous silent film but also a heartfelt drama with romance at its heart & nostalgia written all over it, The Artist is a skilfully executed cinematic feat from a passionate filmmaker who admires the beauty & art of a bygone era, and is a triumph in all filmmaking departments. Definitely one of the best films of its year & absolutely deserving of all its accolades, The Artist comes as a must for every cinema lover out there."
"citizen-caveman","9","3","5","8 August 2013"," A very original piece of story telling
","A genuine original, clever, witty and engaging - rather like me in fact. <br/><br/>Original and witty in the way The Artist tells its story and that is what makes it so engaging. The story about some of the biggest stars of the silent era being unable to make the transition to talkies is as old as the hills. This way of telling that story it is as fresh as a daisy. <br/><br/>The way the audience engages with the film is noticeably different. In places you're almost lip reading. The Artist also underlines the point that is the story and how it is told that makes the film and not colour, FX, 3D, etc. <br/><br/>The theme is how the world inevitably changes as some people benefit because of some change while others do not as they are unable to adapt. George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) flaw that leads to his downfall is his overly conservative attitude and refusing to believe the tastes of the paying public are so very unlike his own (reminds me of a few film critics). As the paying public quickly take to talkies George rapidly becomes a dinosaur. <br/><br/>Of course it is essentially a love story. Berenice Bejo does a great job of playing Peppy Miller the reason why George gets his life back together. <br/><br/>The Artist is an uplifting tale told in an original way. The fact The Artist makes use of the conventions of the silent era suggests that it is not entirely forgotten."

","Bravo for the movie! Very positive and interesting, this film takes us to a time of silent black and white movies. With the difference that the character in silent films loses his voice for a brief moment of time, and in the end everyone start speaking by making the transition from silent films by including speech in them.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around the theme of love and reconciliation between the two types mentioned earlier movies. Directing shows interesting techniques as the main idea remains to return to the silent film in which the actors play similar to that of theatrical counterparts - it is much more expressive. Interesting experience is also the point at which the viewer hears sounds from the others in the room due to the lack of sound in the film.<br/><br/>The film is really interesting experience that will definitely knock out of the field of the dangerously capturing trivial.<br/><br/>http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"

","First of all...I loved the very idea of doing a silent film in 2011, although I wondered if the director could carry it off. To my delight, he did. The actor's feelings and emotions were easily conveyed through the film without being campy, and I thought John Jujardin and Berenice Bejo were simply brilliant in their roles.<br/><br/>If if there was one thing about the film that bothered me, I think it would be how similar the story line felt to ""Singin' In the Rain"", which is one of my favorite films. It wasn't exactly the same, but it felt like a bit of a re-telling. Also, because the theme music from ""Vertigo"" is so incredibly familiar to me, I felt distracted when it started playing on the soundtrack (""hey, that doesn't belong there!). But beyond that, I was taken in from beginning to end. The Artist absolutely earned its Oscars."

They didn't need dialog to express themselves.

We sadly live in an era where most people would overlook this gem of a movie either because it's in black and white and has no special effects or because it's mute. But if you ask me, it is truly amazing that films like this are still made! I found it incredibly funny, witty and brilliantly acted, especially Jean Dujardin. He gave the performance of a lifetime, as much as some of you say he didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Actor in a leading Role. Another great thing about it it's the soundtrack-so engaging and appropriate, going from uplifting to dramatic. Please do not miss this movie. It's an experience you won't regret."
"TinyDanseur27","9","3","5","26 June 2013"," Reminiscent of Singin in the Rain: a clever and fun film for the ages!
","Set in 1920s Hollywood, silent film actor George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin, quickly feels the rug pulled out from under him when the ""talkies"" start taking over the silver screen. His career falls by the wayside to up and comer Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, a newbie unafraid to let herself be heard.<br/><br/>What was so interesting about this movie though was not the plot. It was the style. This movie was in all black and white and (almost) completely silent! It even had the text windows that old silent movies used to have. I loved it! It really emphasized the drama and body language. Not having words to rely on made me all that much more aware of the thoughts and feelings of the characters. Dujardin was brilliant in his depiction of a washed-up silent actor. His eyebrows had a life of their own. Bejo was so cute, the ideal 20s flapper girl.<br/><br/>I thought that this movie was similar to the timeless classic Singin in the Rain for two reasons. Reason #1: both movies are about silent actors coming to terms with the advent of talking pictures. Reason #2: Jean Dujardin had something very Gene Kelly-ish about him. As I watched The Artist, I really felt like I was watching Gene Kelly with a mustache. Maybe it's his eyes. Maybe it's his smile. I don't know but I kept thinking of Gene Kelly throughout The Artist."

The actors do a really good job at what they do, they'll make you laugh whilst other times they make you sad and emotional. The music steals the movie, its comedic when it wants to be and subtle and sad when it wants to be and like the acting it can change the viewers emotions perfectly. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful as its displayed in the always brilliant black and white scheme. Whilst the story covers no new ground everything else more than makes up for it, it ultimately squashes that problem out of existence.<br/><br/>Why should I continue praising the film, the film is perfect in every possible aspect.

"commanderblue","Null","3","5","17 April 2013"," Indeed, the Silent Age was golden
","The Artist, a silent film in the wake of bombastic, noisy blockbusters, makes a strong statement in a very quiet way: by being beautifully silent for two untrammeled hours. It is directed by Michael Hazanavicius and stars Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and Jean's dog, Uggie. Everybody is brought together by fine on screen chemistry, and Hazanavicius (being a foreigner) has effectively rekindled the fires of older silent films that once glorified our Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Hazanavicius described The Artist as his love letter to old cinema, which has become something of a palimpsest thanks to 3D and other innovative media. Who's ever heard of watching a silent black and whitey on their iPhone? That's precisely my point. The Artist breathes and feels just like a film from that silent epoch, where Chaplinesque mannerisms and Moliere style performances devoured the stage and tickled our fancies. The lead star, Jean Dujardin, ought to have an Oscar placed at his feet for his dog Uggie to fetch. Resembling a suave Gene Kelly and Sean Connery, Dujardin embodies the archetypal movie star with obsequious pride and sardonic arrogance. We never hear him speak (owed to the fact that this is a silent film), but even then, Dujardin never breaks character. He's playing the role of a silent movie star, translating that character's grief just with body language, however gratuitous. There's a particularly fine scene where his character George Valentin suffers a nightmare of insurmountable sound—only he's lost his voice. We know that this isn't really the case (that Valentin is capable of human sound on a regular basis) but in the context of the movie, it exemplifies the future of sound in cinema. Silent stars like Valentin become extinct.<br/><br/>The opposite spectrum of the screen is shared by Berenice Bejo as flapper-turned-movie star Peppy Miller. This woman is a Goddess and steals the scene by smiling alone. Was it not the job requirements of olden movie actresses to flutter their eyelashes, seductively wink into the camera, shake their undulant hips and flaunt their pearly whites? Berenice Bejo is an obvious beauty and suitable for this role, but she brings an engaging performance that, like Dujardin, compels us without having said one word. Peppy Miller becomes a rising ""talkie"" star in the picture, but it's not her voice producers advertise. It's her fresh face.<br/><br/>The movie is pervaded by upbeat music and comic perfections. There's humor in seeing Malcolm McDowell or James Cromwell saunter on and off the screen. John Goodman is particularly effective; his husky voice is irrelevant here. To see him merely grimace is a joy in itself—a fine example of what we have taken for granted. The musical score is ubiquitous to the film and accentuates the romance, drama and comedy. Admittedly, I think Hazanavicius became too enamored for cinema; the usage of Bernard Herrmann's Vertigo score was a tad distracting. I guess I'll just call it a crime of passion.<br/><br/>The Artist is a delightful film in every sense of the word. It is evocative of our purest and most passionate feelings, and the subtleties it provides make us appreciate older films and consider all that we have taken for granted."

As I was being stupid about it, I decided to watch the movie to judge it and make a bad review about it, I was determined to do it ... I'm a very different person today. After the end, I was delighted me with a FANTASTIC film, I was surprised with everything. Michel Hazanavicius, who directed the ""OSS 117"" films, recreated the magic of the old cinema in a fantastic way. Grab on classics like ""Casablanca"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Charlie Chaplin"" films, mixing them all, and pum ... The Artist born, and born-it good. The greatest example of the old cinema in this film is the fact that there is no sound, only the background music to acting, movie magic alive every second of this movie. Jean Dujardin fully deserves his Oscar in this movie, the way it fits in the film and his character, and makes it so alive and so real ... is perfect, just that.

"RJBurke1942","9","3","5","11 February 2013"," What you get with a silent ode to the silent era of Hollywood.
","I finally got around to see this French production of a modern silent movie. It's a visual treat of old-fashioned, black and white cinematography in a picture perfect Hollywood setting.<br/><br/>There, we see an aging, Douglas Fairbanks look-alike star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who is unable to transition from the silent era to talkies after 1930 and who gradually fades from the scene, literally and figuratively. On the way down and out, he meets an aspiring, vivacious young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who makes it big, especially when the industry moves to sound. The fairly conventional plot then takes the viewer for a ride through the ups, according to Peppy, and downs, according to George, of Tinsel Town.<br/><br/>Along the way, we are hugely entertained by an Oscar worthy dog (George's constant companion), extravagant costuming, great music to accompany the silent movie, a bevy of well-known Hollywood actors, excellent acting and proof, once again, that a movie is always visual art, first and foremost.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin is superb - a perfect portrayal of a silent screen star. He's so good, it defies adequate description. His co-star, Berenice Bejo matches his performance, but is always overshadowed when together – except perhaps in the dancing scenes. There's a good balance between comedy and melodrama, with most of the former provided by Uggie, the dog.<br/><br/>Blending it all together under the direction by Michel Hazanavicius, the result is a cinematic experience that will probably never be repeated equally well, if at all. Sure, the story is ordinary, but structure, montage and mise-en-scene make this movie extraordinary – almost to the point that one feels transported back in time. That's entertainment, folks, and not to be missed, even if you've never seen a silent movie.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect, but this one deserves nine out of ten. Recommended for all.<br/><br/>February 12, 2013"
"DubhDoo","9","3","5","4 January 2013"," A classic of warmth, wit and charm
","'The Artist' is a sheer joy to witness from beginning to end. Why? Well, because it feels like such a breath of fresh air. In recent years, we have become accustomed to overblown CGI-fests, increasingly unfunny comedies and irritatingly saccharine melodramas. Then, out of nowhere along comes Michael Hazavanicius with a silent film shot entirely in black and white letterbox 4x3. To everyone's surprise it became an unprecedented hit both in terms of box office and critically, eventually garnering seven BAFTAs, three golden Globes and seven Academy Awards, winning Best Picture in the case of each, becoming the first silent movie to win the Best Picture Oscar since 'Wings' and 'Sunrise' both did so at the very first Academy Awards and the first black and white film to win since Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', in 1993.<br/><br/>Sharing similarities with the brilliant 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'A Star is Born', the film centres on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) a silent film star much-loved audiences. His fame is soon scuppered, when, in 1927 silent cinema is replaced the ""talkies"". Despite this, George decides to continue with what he does best, whilst Peppy Miller (a radiant Bérénice Bejo) a young actress rises to fame as the ""talkies"" continue to rise in popularity.<br/><br/>Akin to Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo', this film is clearly in love with early cinema, however unlike that film, Michael Hazavanicius populates 'The Artist' with irresistibly charming characters, and yes, that includes Uggie's enthralling turn as Jack. From the moment it begins to its wonderful finale, the movie's heart never stops beating. Its deep love for silent movies reverberates off the screen, helping to transport us back to an earlier time, immersing the viewer in the story.<br/><br/>It is also propelled by its two main players, Dujardin and Bejo. He gives George the movie star charisma with one gleaming smile, not entirely dissimilar to sleek good-looks of Gene Kelly. Even in his quieter and most thoughtful moments, the brilliance of his performance never falters, applying the character with depth and ripe emotion, despite the seldom appearance of title cards. Despite being a relative newcomer (she also appeared Hazavanicius 2006 spy-parody 'OSS 117: Cairo Nest of Spies'), Bejo manages to epitomize the kind of female film star that was so popular; she is positively gorgeous and captivating to watch, enjoying some great scenes with Dujardin. A third-act dance number between the two is a pure delight to witness. There are also appearances from more-familiar faces throughout, such as Malcolm McDowell, John Goodman and James Cromwell. Also worth a mention is Uggie who plays Valentin's dog Jack, offering some of the film's most amusing comic beats.<br/><br/>But this is more than just a love letter to silent cinema, because when you put aside all its old-fashioned filming techniques, this is an emotional film about love and loss, something our leading man has to grapple with over the course of its narrative. However, this is not some kind of dour drama, but the sort of film that leaves you smiling from ear-to-ear by the time the credits roll. It was so uplifting in fact, that during the closing scene, I found it difficult to remain seated the joy was so much. What a wonderful film 'The Artist' is. It is truly magical; a cinema lover's dream and also a fantastically enjoyable film for more casual viewers. I absolutely adore this film."

Of course it needs huge amounts of courage to make a black and white silent movie in the ancient 1.33:1 aspect ratio nowadays but does only this really deserves an Oscar?

To be honest my real problem is the film's short changes too much. His wife left him in a minute, he lost his job in a minute and ... <br/><br/>4. It is imbued with clichés. The loyal servant, the love at a distance, the failed artist who burns his works, the dog coming to the rescue and ... <br/><br/>5. In conclusion, The Artist is absolutely worthy of applause and a very enthusiastic recommendation, because to the aficionados of classic cinema, it will be a great nostalgic experience, and to the modern generations, it will be an extraordinary and hugely entertaining History lesson, which is much funnier and more emotive than any book about the cinema of the period portrayed in here."

","Somebody cares. Somebody understands. We need art. We need movies that move us, not send us to the devil. That's what TV talk shows are for. ""The Artiste"" is a fantasy come true for those of us tired of devil possession movies, too many computer generated special effects and horrendous acting by amateurs who think that film stardom is an adequate replacement for therapy. What this gem of celluloid is can be best described as payback for the audiences who have stayed away until a movie came along with them in mind: a Mondt in a museum full of stick figurines. Silent movies were not meant to dominate the screen for eternity, yet this film is more than about that. It is a combination of familiar stories, most obviously ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""A Star is Born"".<br/><br/>It was also a movie about the refusal to change with the times. Sometimes it is necessary, yet sometimes it comes with a price. Hollywood was young, if far from innocent, but its goals certainly were simpler. Make a buck, entertain and enlighten, but don't upset the censors. This film reminds us of simpler values, like helping others, which the silent film actor does for the future movie musical star who will be there for him when he hits his inevitable decline. The silent and early talkies are lovingly re-created, and the clunky dancing (and sets) in the finale are right out of ""Broadway Melody""."

The Artist is very reminiscent about the great Silent Movie Era and how an actor of the genre struggles to find happiness after ""talkies"" are the new craze. Love, loss, and a new found discovery of happiness play a big role in this fantastic movie. Michel Hazanavicius clearly understands that it is neither action nor special effects which determine the success of a movie, but rather the feelings it conjures inside the viewer and a dynamic and intriguing story!

","This is a very cunning piece of work- original only in its audacity- a tribute to the silent era in the shape of a silent movie about the era's end. What Michel Haznaravicius has done is to re-arrange the clichés of the early pictures to produce a film perfectly watchable by today's audience. The Academy went overboard and gave it five Oscars (best movie, director, costume, music and actor) but, hey, this is a movie for those who love movies. Apparently it cost $15 million to make and was filmed in 37 days, recovering nearly three times that at the American box office alone. Being silent (apart from the rich musical soundtrack) it should do pretty well in non-English speaking markets as well.<br/><br/>The artist himself, George Valetin (Jean Dujardin, made for the part), is a combination of Douglas Fairbanks senior and Errol Flynn (the latter of course did not start in movies until the early thirties). Handsome, dashing and acclaimed, as his career tanks with the advent of talkies, he finds refuge in the bottle. Meanwhile his one-time fan Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) prospers in the new medium, especially in song and dance.<br/><br/>Silents were a repository of family values and this is reflected here – I don't remember seeing more than a chaste kiss between George and Peppy. Supporting characters like James Cromwell as George's faithful chauffeur inhabit familiar roles. One thing this movie does not have is a baddie - no damsel in distress tied to the train tracks. John Goodman (delightful as always) the cigar chomping studio head is merely recognising the inevitable in laying off George who himself proves the point by producing a spectacular box office failure. Incidentally, it is the Wall St crash which wipes out George financially though his production failure would not have helped.<br/><br/>What this film does superbly is put today's viewers in the seats of the silent cinema. (""Silent"" is something of a misnomer since the showing was usually accompanied by music, though not usually as elaborate as here) As a time capsule this film is near perfect and no special knowledge is needed to understand it. We are kept enthralled despite suspecting we might be in for an upbeat ending. The whole thing is well done. Maybe there was more drama in the Descendants, but Oscar did at least recognise here the superb production values – an Artist's film indeed."

","This film is about a silent film star fading, as he could not cope with the fast changing times.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" is a black and white, and has no dialog. What used to be the norm back in the 1920's is now almost a groundbreaking experience. Stripping a film of its computer effects, lavish sets and even the dialogs, ""The Artist"" brings back a cinematic experience that is forgotten to the point that is almost foreign.<br/><br/>The music is captivating throughout. The story is well presented, with much emotional depth even without the use of dialogs. George Valentin's frustration, shattered pride and depression is portrayed; while Peppy Miller's secret admiration for George is noble and selfless. The climax is gripping, and I like the lighter ending. I think ""The Artist"" is a gem that deserves to win some Oscars."
"tomhemingway11","10","3","5","1 February 2012"," 'The Artist' is a flawless masterpiece
","'The Artist' is a pretty daring film. It has appeared almost out of nowhere with a relatively unknown cast and director and has taken the world by storm... And did I mention it was a silent movie? It's already tipped to be the big winner at the Oscars after taking best picture at the Golden Globes earlier this year. But amidst all the hype, is it actually any good? And can it possibly be as good as everybody says? It turns out that it is. After a few viewings, the joy felt when watching 'The Artist' still remains. You find yourself sat watching the film with a big grin on your face that will last for most of it's running time.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, the biggest movie star of the silent period. The film follows his success in the mid-20's and how it turns on him and his life with the introduction of talking pictures in 1929. That is the film in a nutshell. But really, it is about the nature of fame, ambition and the inevitable moments of reality that face everybody in life. Jean Dujardin is perfect in his role. He is smooth, charming, reflective and incredibly human without even saying a word. Rather than dialogue, his facial expressions do the talking and it's very easy to see why he has an Oscar nomination for this role. Watch for moments of subtle humanity beneath his celebrity exterior when he is preparing for his roles or in a beautiful scene towards the end of the picture which I won't spoil for you. All the other performances are predictably superb with Berenice Bejo and John Goodman supplying the charm expected in old silent movies.<br/><br/>Another reason the film is so captivating is in the attention to detail with all the technical aspects. Firstly, the film is presented in the aspect ratio all old movies were screened in, to not only capture the essence of the time but to put greater focus on the performances of the actors. It works. The audience will feel every bit of emotion in this film because of it. Additionally, the music is one of the best original soundtracks I've heard in a long time. The 80 plus minutes of music from this film is almost like a character itself; a scene can be viewed as serious or comedic just by the use of a few notes. A final factor worth noting is the cinematography, which makes this film look like it could have come from 1927. It is shot in beautiful black and white which gives the film an extra texture and depth that today's digitally shot coloured films cannot capture.<br/><br/>It is possible to write for days about 'The Artist' but all that needs to be said is how moving, beautiful, joyful and brilliant it is. For a film to come out as daring as 'The Artist' in 2012 and be only half decent is a good result. However, it does much more than that. It captures the essence of cinema itself with it's ability to entertain, surprise and engage audiences all over the world, myself included.<br/><br/>A Classic."
"OneMovieLover","9","3","5","31 January 2012"," Beautifully directed and amazingly acted masterpiece
","It should be made clear: many consider this film to be the best of the year. Masterfully made, ""The Artist"" soars in just about every redeeming quality thinkable: character development, exceptional acting, etc. It's difficult to talk about such a masterpiece without including a string of compliments. Actors in the film mostly use gestures and expressions rather than words, but it is still clear how they feel about something. It's full of surprises and is primarily a romance story, although it contains just as much comedy and drama. In one instance, music from the score of Alfred Hitchcock's film ""Vertigo"" is used, but it ends up still fitting well with the scene it accompanies. There's really no reason to not see this, and there's a perfect reason it received an avalanche of prestigious awards."
"thepsychocritic","9","3","5","27 January 2012"," Some things are best left unspoken.
","The Artist actually does all the things that it shouldn't be doing if it wants to appeal to the generic herd of moviegoers - monochrome, silent and not consisting of any cinematic behemoth to carry the mantle of wooing the audiences. It is undeniable that the allure of a black-and- white film of the silent era remains highly esoteric. 'It died for a reason,' one might say. 'Sound killed it.' Agreed. But the fact that The Artist does better than almost all the other movies of the year comes across as a rather delightful irony.<br/><br/>The transition of movies from silence to sound has been remarkably captured through the various perspectives of a plethora of those affected by Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard, to name two. The Artist seems inspired from the former, with its quirky sense of humour and all, while has a protagonist who shares the dogma of Norma Desmond as far as 'talkie' movies are concerned. The man is George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a conceited, debobair, illustrious actor of an era where facial contortions and subtitles did most of the talking. While celebrating the success of his latest movie, he bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), who later turns into the luckiest of his throngs of worshippers. There is the spark of romance there, but that flame is left unkindled, since Valentin is married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) despite rather unhappily. But his tidal wave of confidence soon tosses him ashore with the introduction of sound in cinema, with Peppy being one of the harbingers of the winds of change. With the writing on the wall being all too clear, it is Valentin's amore-propre that blinds him, as the zeitgeist sweeps through like a storm, leaving him stripped of everything but his vanity, as the artist now has to learn the artform of survival.<br/><br/>The movie is like a monologue of how change is inevitable and how we must adapt or get run-over by it. It preaches this lesson by drawing parallels between the old and new. The initial comparison is between wordless movies and cinema after the inception of sound and how the unfortunate former perished at the hands of sound. However, this comparison is also personified, as it betrays the appearance of a metaphor between the characters of George and Peppy - the former an imploding star, the latter a new sunrise. 'Out with the old, in with the new. Make way for the young!' Peppy says, as George overhears her. Just like soundless movies were annihilated out of existence unceremoniously, George realizes that it might be his turn to suffer the same fate if he doesn't embrace the change.<br/><br/>The performances are fabulous, with a special mention going out the dog, who deserves the honour of being the best canine I have ever seen. Dujardin with his pencil moustache gives his act a certain authenticity, while the gregarious, affectionate Peppy is right in her shoes. The differences brought about in the acting, as compared to regular movies due to the absence of a voice are palpable - subtlelties are paid special attention to, physical movements flow like a cadence and the eyes convey most of the emotions. Though the acting might seem overdone, with all the accentuation and exaggerated movements, one must remember that it does justice to its requirements and to history, and is hence befits the film.<br/><br/>But the movie has its shortcomings, some of which are too blatant to ignore. Primary of these is the rather hackneyed storyline. If you want a movie that talks about what a silent-movie-icon goes through once sound is introduced, you need to look no further than Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard. The only thing that movie did different from The Artist is track the downfall of its protagonist into insanity, while The Artist doesn't go that far. The parallel subplot about a youngling shooting to stardom as another falls has also been done before, though not to death (A Star is Born, for instance). So, that's hardly a surprise too.<br/><br/>Since the film begins as a comedy, and masquerades like one for a sizeable proportion of its run-time (heck, it won the Golden Globe for Best Picture Comedy), once it gradually descends into a tragedy, The Artist fails to get its viewers along, who happen to get stuck in a limbo between laughter and sympathy at the protagonist's fate. The seriousness that one needs to empathize with Valentin is amiss because the movie begins on too much of an upbeat note. This failure, arising from trying to balance on two rafts at the same time, unfortunately, makes it a case of being lost in transition. <br/><br/>The Artist isn't merely a movie with a message, it is also an ode to movies of the day when Hollywood was popular as Hollywoodland. The movie exudes an air of the late 1920s and early 1930s - every third man wearing bowler hats, the paparazzi hobbling around with archaic cameras, movies that ended as soon as the director got bored of shooting. The film has a panache, a vivacity, that one rarely gets to see in modern times. However, the salute is accomplished when the film makes its final move - outdoing most other films of the year in terms of excellence, which shows that Valetin, actually, might have been right."
"saschakrieger","9","3","5","29 January 2012"," When Silence Talks
","It is not uncommon in times of crises, to look for solutions in the past which, as a rule, had always been better than the dreary past. And so it is not much of a surprise that, in an America tortured by economic crisis and its decreasing importance in the world, the most celebrated film of the year, the one Hollywood throws every accolade on it has to offer, is a black and white silent movie looking back at Hollywood's golden age. Alas, it was made by a Frenchman and its star is French as well. Even Hollywood, it seems, can be made better abroad. In a year that has seen remarkable films dealing with a society's identity crisis, the many awards may appear as a sign of escapism. Or maybe The Artist is just this good?<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Hollywood's biggest silent movie star, George Valentine whose career is cut short when he refuses to join the new talking movie era. He goes through a major identity crisis, almost commits suicide but survives through the help of those who love him and even gains new success by finding a language of his own which allows him to cut out a place in the new film era – or to put it shortly: by reinventing himself. Maybe there is a message for our uncertain times.<br/><br/>Be this as it may, The Artist works on so many other levels. In the beginning it is hard to remember that this is not a film from the 1920s, so spot on does it capture the esthetic of storytelling, imagery and editing – and, of course, the expressive acting style required by silent movies and brilliantly mastered by the films cast, especially Jean Dujardin, a movie star somewhere between Rudolph Valentino and Groucho Marx, and Bérénice Bejo, whose starlet Peppy Miller is a fascinating mixture of dumb blonde (although she isn't even blond) of adoring lover. Both seem to come straight from the silent movie era, Dujardin's George Valentin certainly would have made it there. And so would George's dog who is there in the comedy and the tragedy, an animal clown and a loving friend – and the secret star of this film. Nothing here is ever only one thing.<br/><br/>The Artist is, of course, first and foremost an homage to the silent move to a time where actors did not need dialogue because they had faces as a character in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard once put it. The film is full of reminiscences, styles and scenes taken straight out of the era's greatest films. The fascination, the wonder that early audiences must have felt, it is captured here, as the viewer also must learn to deal with the absence of the familiar. When, at the start, we witness a film premiere which culminates in thundering and yet completely silent applause, the modern viewer may, for the first time, learn that silence can be heard and that it can be painfully loud as in that scene towards the end when George and Peppy, who represent the old and the new, finally come together, without a sound, not even music.<br/><br/>Director Michel Hazanavicius manages a perfect balance between the comic and the serious, moves effortlessly from slapstick to tragedy and back into romantic comedy. It is a mix of genres in which everything from the world of silent movies finds its place and still it is more than a series of quotations. There are memorable scenes such as when Peppy helps George's empty coat to engage in a sensual embrace or when, in a nightmare, everything begins to make a sound yet George remains silent. The whole film keeps coming back to the language-silence topic: From the opening scene, in which – as part of a film – Russian spies try to torture George's character into speaking but he remains silent. Repeatedly, speaking appears as frightening, threatening, unbalancing.<br/><br/>And yet, at the very end, George says a word, in a thick French accent, which may explain his refusal to speak on film. So maybe it wasn't his pride, his insistence on being an artist rather than a puppet, after all? Who know? All we do know is that this is a fascinating eye- and ear-opener which works as an homage to an art form long lost, as a parable on the necessity of change, a declaration of love to love and friendship and, I'm sure, on many other levels. Maybe, at least once in a while, seeing things in black and white is not such a bad thing after all."

","There are so many wonderful aspects of this film, not sure where to start! First, I can say this film is an instant classic. There is no doubt about that as a fact. The production values are spot on, it feels like you are immersed in the world of the 20's. <br/><br/>The Cast performed in what might seem simple, performing their role without speaking. Au contraire, their faces, body language and nuances speak volumes. The other big supporting character in the movie is the Music. The Music brings so much emotion and depth to this great picture. <br/><br/>Some reviews here say the story is overrated. I am not sure they saw the same pic I saw. The story is wonderfully played out from beginning to end. A quick side note, if you see this movie and enjoyed it you may wish to watch some of the Silent era films on TCM. Every Sunday night they broadcast a silent film. The films pull you into another world, another aspect of the human condition. You see these films without voice sound but there is wonderful Music and acting that will make you laugh and tug at your heart as any great film from today would do to you. Again, ""The Artist"", C'est Magnifique!"

","When people hear of a black and white silent film produced and starring French actors American audiences go running for the hills. Haven't we moved into the 21st century? Are we not at an age where million dollar explosions and masked do-gooders gallivant across the screen in full fledged 3D? Why then would someone be as esoterically pretentious as to make a film like ""The Artist."" <br/><br/>Because its freakin' awesome that's why! OK...Let me rein in some of my enthusiasm. The tale begins with silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) on top of his game at Kinograph Studios. By chance he bumps into a would-be actress (Berenice Bejo) and helps her break into the business. But as 1929 rolls in, the invention of talking pictures derails George's career and threatens to destroy his life.<br/><br/>The story is as familiar as a piece of chocolate cake yet it is told in such an innovative way. Compensating for a lack of dialogue, the actors are forced to emote with every jaunty gate and jovial face crinkle. The music by Ludovic Bource follows along with the unfolding plot punctuating specific moments where it should. The implanted symbolism and confident camera movements recreate eerily similar tableaux from classic films like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Grand Hotel"" and ""The Mark of Zorro"" with aplomb.<br/><br/>It's a love letter to film and everyone should be reading it. Or rather watching each perfectly constructed frame. While some may believe the silent format is limiting, director Michel Hazanavicius proves it is anything but. He plays with the medium, toying with the lights, shadows, sounds and shades like an elaborate puppet show. Watching ""The Artist"" was almost like unveiling a Jackson Pollock on a cave wall. The canvas might be obsolete but the painting itself is stunning, striking, even provocative.<br/><br/>And as for pretension? This film is anything but. It's candy swathed in plain wrapping. A sugary sweet concoction well hidden in the upper cabinet of a gourmet kitchen. 100% pure entertainment for all ages or at least anyone who dares to laugh in silence and dream in black and white.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","Oh my! I'm going to ruin the ending to my own review by saying I absolutely loved this film! No suspense or skirting around the issue, it's absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>From the offset, I was transported into a time I wish I'd lived. The theatre was so busy, I had to sit at the back where I could here the projector, which only added to the ambiance. The irony of a silent film documenting the coming of sound is perfect. Sound in film is all we know of today, lest we forget, it ruined a lot of people's careers (Norma Desmond, even though she's a character, is a prime example). Single scenes show the transition of two peoples entire emotions and it's done beautifully, not rushed, just beautiful.<br/><br/>I really have nothing bad to say about this film, I'm giddy just writing about. Not having sound (or even the way they use it in doses) helps you to appreciate the subtleties. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are sublime, I even loved the dog. If only films like this could come along more often than a blue moon."
"Vickiwool","8","3","5","11 January 2012"," The Artist: Valentin's hubris or pure pragmatism?
","This film's plot seems to follow a familiar tragic pattern of foolish pride leading eventually to recognition and redemption. The pride would have to do with Valentin's old-fashioned and, it would seem, aesthetically-based disdain for talkies, just as Peppy's scorn for the mugging that goes on in silent films derives from a more progressive take on the future of cinema.<br/><br/>But the protagonist is a kind of Anglo-French hybrid. Described in the trailer voice-over as the anglicised 'George Valentine', in the cast list he is the intermediate George Valentin, and this seems but a minor displacement from Georges Valentin, a completely French name. And of course he is played by one Jean Dujardin.<br/><br/>The only words he utters, in the final dance scene, are a heavily-accented 'With pleasure', and with such mangled pronunciation he evidently IS French, and at a potential disadvantage. Which leads one to ask the question: 'Did he despise the talkies, or did he fear that they would be the death of him, as soon as he opened his mouth?' Certainly actors like Emil Jannings and Heinrich George beat a hasty retreat from Hollywood at the time, and indeed were in no hurry to return there from Germany even during the rise of Nazism in the thirties. Nor had the time yet arrived when Maurice Chevalier's English accent would be deemed cute.<br/><br/>Hence Valentin's heroic efforts to turn back the clock with Tears of Love can be seen as a reasoned attempt to reassert the primacy of the one of the two genres in which, because of his palpable foreignness, he could continue to reign supreme."
"dfranzen70","10","3","5","8 January 2012"," Masterful - one of the best of 2011
","What chance in the world does a movie in which virtually no words are spoken and is filmed in black in white have to succeed at winning the hearts of Academy Award voters? If any of them bother to watch The Artist, the chances should be astronomical. This is more than a work of art. It surpasses the medium and our expectations. First, let me explain about the mechanics of the movie. Like its ancestors, it is not really silent; music accompanies just about every scene. Sometimes title cards appear to indicate what a character has said, but these are employed infrequently. Even ambient noise, like a cup being placed on a table, are not heard. Each actor ""speaks"" his lines, and the most basic ones are easily understood by the expressions. It's not as difficult to follow as it may sound.<br/><br/>In The Artist, Jean Dujardin plays a silent-film actor named George Valentin (sort of a cross between Rudolf Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.). He is the star of his time and makes a good living. He's married to his frequent costar, played by Penelope Anne Miller, and he has an adorable Jack Russell terrier (a nod to the Thin Man movies). In an instance of kismet, he meets fan/aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), for whom he finds a job as an extra in his movie as a dancer (her name itself is probably a nod to the great Ann Miller). And meanwhile, his wife Doris is, shall we say, unhappy with George, noticing the chemistry between him and his new friend.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of A Star Is Born, Peppy becomes popular while, with the advent of talkies, George becomes less employable. No one wants to hear people talk, he rants at his boss (John Goodman). He vows to make his own movie – silent – with his own money. It opens on the same date as Peppy's big film, and it doesn't do well.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple rise-fall-rebirth drama. Its lack of complexity is a huge asset here, as so much must be expressed visually. And what visuals! The elegant shots from cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman evoke sympathy, stark reality, compassion, humor, and love almost effortlessly. The music is beautiful and well selected. This is a movie about movies, after all, and, much like Singin' in the Rain was about one actor's approach to the new-fangled talking pictures, The Artist shows us a different approach: George Valentin, realizing his career as he knows it cannot continue, simultaneously understands that he is not fit for the future, either. He cannot change, can he? Who, indeed, would want to hear him talk?<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that virtually no words are spoken. As in Mel Brooks' Silent Movie, there is some dialog near the very end of the movie. But Dujardin and Bejo are so astounding, graceful, and sparkling on screen that no sound is needed, let alone actual words. They are a remarkable couple, she with the big eyes, coquettish wink, and impish personality, and he with the debonair stare, the chiseled chin, and all the raging self confidence that a stylish leading man should have. They are perfect in this movie.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how powerful and moving this movie is. It's a stunning achievement and wildly entertaining. It's enthralling, capturing a far- off time with impeccable, glistening accuracy. Director Michel Hanzanavicius doesn't miss a step in directing his cast – some of whom are quite seasoned. There's Goodman as the studio head and Miller as the wife, and other familiar faces show up, such as Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Ed Lauter, and Malcolm McDowell. Hanzanavicius' movie isn't just evocative of the old 1920s films – it really seems to transport you to a theater in the early part of the 20th century. It's a lavish, loving film that is absolutely packed with emotional scenes. It is, at turns, joyous and devastating, but it is always, always a huge treat to watch. It is, most definitely, one of the very best films of 2011."

IMHO not often enough but it happened tonight in London. This film is brilliant, the acting, the story and the innovative way that it was filmed. It is mostly silent but I loved the way that when sound was used, it was effective and surprising. The old cinema and the 20's are depicted as they would have been in films made in the period.

It won't really matter because though it's a bonus for the likes of me, they work so well together that it's an unalloyed joy to check them out. Trivia buffs will recall another Brazilian actress who married a French director and appeared in his films (Vera Clouzot, anyone) and we can only hope that THIS actress does not follow too closely in Vera's footsteps (she died tragically young).

","It's rare that I go out to a theater these days to see a movie; I usually wait for Netflix. But ""The Artist"" was the exception. When I heard about this silent black & white film (with the great reviews) my curiosity was peaked. And it surpassed my expectations. I left the theater feeling like I'd just had a three-day weekend. This is a movie you can trust with your emotions; it won't let you down. I just wish it were playing in more theaters because I wanted to buy tickets as gifts for my family members in other cities. ""The Artist"" is about a silent film actor who rejects the new technology of ""talking movies"" in the late 1920s (anyone who has ever cursed a Microsoft release should relate to his resistance to new technology; couldn't resist). His journey of fame, wealth, hard times, and love opens like a Christmas present on the big screen, with a fun musical score, fine acting, original screenplay, and -- of course -- an adorable dog."
"alex703","9","3","5","10 December 2011"," Absolutely Splendid
","I don't think I have seen a single negative thing written about this film, so going into the theater, it is fair to say that I had high expectations.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" fulfilled all of them. The acting is fantastic, reminding us that body movements and twitches can convey a great deal of emotion. George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) expression and posture slowly change as his life falls apart, helping the viewer feel what he is going through viscerally. Pippyy Miller's (Bérénice Bejo) smile conveys spunk and charm in a way that many actors cannot with large chunks of dialogue at their disposal. John Goodman portrays an incredibly stereotypical business-oriented Hollywood director brilliantly, his comical frustrations supplying much of the comedy present in this movie.<br/><br/>From a cinematographic point of view, ""The Artist"" is stunning as well. Memorable shot after memorable shot showed up on the screen, whether it be a couple of fictional native Indians appearing on a bar counter to harass our protagonist, a suit fitting a reflection of him wonderfully, or a screen separating our destined tap dancers. The director, Michael Hazanavicius, also plays with sound wonderfully, with a lovely soundtrack providing plenty of audio-stimulation. However, in the climactic scene, there is absolute silence, actually provoking surprisingly strong emotions in the viewer. The last scene is absolutely brilliant on a number of levels, but I will not mention it here because it is worth experiencing without being told what happens.<br/><br/>But as well done as these two elements are, it is conceptually where this movie excels. ""The Artist"" tells the story of the change from silent films to ""talkies"", and the difficulties it could cause to some of Hollywood's past stars. It's key message seems to be: ""Go with the flow"". Pride and vanity will leave you by the wayside, and in the case of our principal character, suicidal. It is ironic (and certainly not accidental) that this is a silent movie about the transition to ones with talking, and it uses a great mix of 1920's style scenes with ones that are undoubtedly modern and current, showing that the movie itself is not afraid to do what is new or unexpected (and then, of course, it is funny that a black and white silent movie is totally out of the mainstream now).<br/><br/>My only gripe would be that the all-knowing dog is relied upon too much. I understand that it is an exaggerated character designed to emulate similar plot devices from the time period, but although it works greatly as a sidekick, when it takes over the action, its charm wears off.<br/><br/>This was a pretty poorly conceived review, but it includes all of my basic ideas about ""The Artist"". Go see it for yourself!"

","The fact that a silent movie was made is uncomprehending.perhaps the director should have done a little research and find out that a talking feature was made in the year 1927. Making a talking movie a few years after that is acceptable given the price. but now that was 84 years ago. just because a movie is silent does not mean that it is good. following the plot of this movie was not a problem for me at all. it was very simple. this review is not condemning the plot of the movie it is not terrible, but its not great either. This movie is a joke and the academy is only nominating because they are a bunch of snobs. their decision they make for choosing movies isn't based on what they enjoyed. it is decided based upon what makes them smart. for instance the academy would never chose the movie ""Drive"" because choosing that would make them appear as non intellectuals. the academy and anyone who likes this movie calling a film for the century is a snob."

There isn't breathlessness in the movie, but there is a throw back to the essential, only to what is really needed.
Thanks to the absence of speaking, in this silent movie we can pay more attention to the details of the facial expression, the eyes, the face and the non verbal communication.
Every element is in the right place."
"JSVoid","9","4","8","25 October 2018"," A fantastic modern film, perfectly capturing the times of silent film.
","This was a fantastic film, and almost perfect in every aspect.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film is very well written, even though it is a silent film. With every movement perfectly planned, and every scene looking gorgeous and interesting.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of Hollywood ""product"" films, this was purely made from love and passion, and it was very clear throughout the entire film. The set pieces and costume design was absolutely transforming, and captured the world so well.<br/><br/>The character motivations and arcs were very well done too, which I find difficult to find in a lot of cinema I watch. I felt for the characters, and related to the main character a lot, and I could tell exactly what he was going through throughout the whole film, which is beautiful, and highlights the amazing acting.<br/><br/>The character arc of George Valentin is a perfect example of this, because it makes perfect sense why Valentin would be going through this, as the whole business and structure was changing into talkies. Which, illustrated the time in parallel to the character, especially considering everyone around him was surpassing his witty and charismatic talent simply because they were in talkies, and no one wanted him in them, and left him in the dirt.<br/><br/>Symbolism and deeper meanings were also perfectly done as well. The cinematography showed how Valentin and Peppy were growing apart, and she was growing much higher than him, even though she was previously adoring and admiring his talent and fame.<br/><br/>There were two shots in particular, in which the two characters were split, both symmetrical shots beside them, as they were on either sides of the screen, and in the first shot divided by a railing that was perfectly in between them. I have big respect for these shots, because symbolism in films, especially in cinematography is very important and interesting to me.<br/><br/>The symbolism through the dream sequence was also very unique, in which Valentin can't speak, but sound is starting to erupt, as symbolism for him not in talkies, and everything else is prominent in sound.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was perfectly constructed with love, and a great homage to cinema in general, and the silent era of film."

The story is about the pride and reluctance of an old silent movie star to make the move to sound, and the tragic consequences to his career. On the other hand we see the rise of an actress who makes the move seamlessly, and as her star rises his wanes.

","THE ARTIST (2011) **** Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell, Uggie The Dog. Wonderful valentine to the silent film era from French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius about Hollywood star George Valentin (Dujardin, channeling Douglas Fairbanks, John Barrymore and Errol Flynn) facing a career pitfall with the advent of sound and encountering invigorating rising starlet Peppy Miller (the beguiling Bejo, Hazanavicius' real-life wife and dead-ringer for Natalie Wood) who may be his saving grace. Captured with brilliant production design by Laurence Bennett and gorgeously shot by Guillaume Schiffman in scintillating black and white evoking the silent era to perfection. Glamorous and hear-felt with genuine pathos and peppered with enough knowing laughs (thanks largely to Uggie The Dog as Valentin's constant companion) the film is a masterpiece about movie-making and the magic of the movies. One of the year's best and a must see for cinemaniacs!"
"Nibbler007","6","5","11","28 February 2012"," Something was very wrong with the Oscars...
","I just watched The Artist and let me tell you... those guys in Hollywood they've committed one of the biggest mistakes giving this film an Oscar. It's beyond my belief that you could sustain an award-winning picture on the tricks of a dog, the lavish grin of a few (good) actors and such a naive, yet unlovable script. <br/><br/>Yes, I know... you can say that movies in the 20's and 30's had this kind of gimmicks and they lacked this thing that has evolved during the many years of cinema: an argument beyond a foolish, childish, non-sense love story. <br/><br/>Let me tell you I love these kind of films, I've watched too many. Even the original stories are a little sharper than this. <br/><br/>Even worst, mr. Hazanavicius offended me as a viewer a few times with these cheap analogies, like the one you see when the beautiful Berenice Bejo is watching Mr. Valentine (an obvious surname for a love-story character), being swallowed by sinking sands in the cinema, just as the same time he was ""sinking"" in his career... is that a joke, Mr. Hazavicious? There were a few more, though, like the scene when Mr.Valentine is ""going down"" the stairs (and so does his career) as Ms. Miller ""goes up"" the same stairs as she ""climbs up"" for the stardom. I don't like directors who mocks so deliberately from their viewers. Anyway, I'll take the offence. <br/><br/>What on earth did the critics applaud? <br/><br/>I think maybe this picture had to be rolled in color and with dialogues. So we could see the shallow script that unfolds in front of us. So we could see the mocking, childish pretension to be thought-provoking. This movie has nothing to do with the 20's nor the 30's. If you want to see that kind of movies, well... you know what to do. We don't need another foolish tribute, we need to think! We need to feel the experience of cinema! And with The Artist it happens almost never. You never get fond of any of the characters except for the astonishing beauty of Ms. Bejo. <br/><br/>But you never get too involved. It is all packed, you know it will end like you want to, you know the love story will end good. My god! Even Casablanca had better intentions in its script! <br/><br/>Please, don't mention that I said Casablanca and The Artist in the same sentence, since they had nothing to do with each other, and the second has got nothing to do with the award merit.<br/><br/>Take Hugo Cabret, for example. Merges the 2011 way of thinking, sort of speak, but makes wonderful things with the ghost of Geo. Melies. I laughed, cried, loved each and every one of the characters... Scorsese astonished me in so many ways... He did deserve the Oscars. Strongly. And so did his beautiful Hugo.<br/><br/>But this movie goes and wins the Oscar... oh, what a bluff. I'm speechless.<br/><br/>I suggest to the members of the Academy to go and see The Great Dictator if they wanted to like a silent movie, and give the retroactive Oscar to it. It deserved it, and Chaplin deserved the Oscar they never gave him for that awesome piece of cinema. <br/><br/>As a conclusion... The Artist wasn't a bad movie, but the best rating I can give to it is a 6 since it leaves with nothing but deceit. You will ask yourself as I did: did the Artist really deserve the Oscar's best picture? <br/><br/>I'll give it a 6/10, And pretty much of it, I should blame the marvelous score who did deserve an Oscar. <br/><br/>Go and see Hugo. <br/><br/>Cheers from Argentina!"

","George is a famous and widely adored actor in the silent-film era of the 1920s. He gives one of his fans, Peppy, a moment in the spotlight and it unexpectedly creates a path for her into stardom. As Peppy rises, George falls. He does not adjust to changing circumstances or new technology, and the advent of sound in film leaves him broke and alone. Peppy is the last person that still has faith in George and she reaches out to him, but he may be too far gone.<br/><br/>Shot in black and white and virtually without the sound of anyone's voice, this alluring, unconventional and heartwarming film surprises and delights. Jean Dujardin (George), Berenice Bejo (Peppy), James Cromwell, John Goodman and Uggie (Jack Russell terrier), reveal the power of communicating without speaking. The Artist is a true gem. My girlfriend and I saw it before it was widely released. It felt then like the film was going to be as heartwarming for others as it was for us. Winner of five Oscars including best picture. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.<br/><br/>I love Parasite and am overjoyed that it won best picture, especially because it is a foreign and independent film, but technically at least one foreign film won an Oscar for best picture before Parasite, right?! Hardly anyone talked in The Artist, so it really can't be said that it is an English language film. Perhaps it was not considered a foreign film because the setting was in California? In any case, The Artist is an amazing and daring film. It is daring because there are virtually no voices and is a throw-back to another era."

","I was speechless watching it, is such a pleasure-filled, opulent, beautiful, complex adaption of the end of the silent film era... both beautiful time document, remake and ART FILM in one.
I can't even name ALL the beautiful elements that played together so well: the art department for sure did a SPLENDID JOB. The sets, the costumes, the props, the VISUALS, the typography, the special effects (like analogue film stripe edges on screen)...
and the cinematography! Perfectly mimicking and interpreting the historical accurate shooting styles and film format. Also the blurred filters on the beautiful main actress as silent film diva, the angles, the overlays, the overall scene construction... the editing! Combining the pace, tone and scenes in a rich composition - it made it feel so VERY MUCH like an original from the old time, that's how accurate it is.
Also, the acting! A perfect cast, both skilled and visually fitting into the 20s preferred movie star types.<br/><br/>The thing, that finally blew my MIND was the sound: both the classic silent movie soundtrack composition AND how the film used sound in general. The nearly whole film uses music as backdrop, but there is a moment where it stops (and so powerful!): At some point the main actor experiences his life becoming a TONE film instead of the silent film, but HE can't create a sound with his voice when he tries to speak. Meanwhile we see and hear focussed noises of feathers, girl laughter - clearly metamorphing into the tone film era.... and then he WAKES UP from a nightmare. And there we are, back to the silent music, which follows him til the end of the film. This way, the theme of the story becomes part of the medium itself, a story within a story - a (for me) perfect combination.<br/><br/>There are clearly so many things that are well thought of, well composed and very well put together in this art piece. I am so happy I finally watched it and will watch it again and again a few times. A master piece of film making."

","This film is better as a concept than it is in execution. Leaving the actors aside for the time being, what I liked most about it is the moment when stray sounds begin to be heard, heralding the arrival of the talkies, even though none of the on-screen characters is speaking audibly -- only in silent movie captions. It's a brilliant touch, leaving no doubt about what's happening outside the silent film framework. The plot is a cliché: the silent film star fades into obscurity, the obscure actress becomes an overnight sensation. However, the four stars are excellent. Four? Yes. Jean Dujardin as the silent film star, Berenice Bujo as the talkies meteor, John Goodman as the studio head, and the best dog actor I ever remember seeing. It remains to be seen whether Dujardin has a future in a speaking role. Ms. Bejo, a well-established French star, is sensational in this movie. John Goodman is a familiar figure and is outstandingly funny as the fickle movie-maker who abandons his silent film star to make talkies and later takes him back because Peppy Miller, Ms. Bejo's character, now a screen sensation, announces that she won't appear in his next movie without Dujardin as her co-star. The movie concludes with the best dancing scene -- Dujardin and Bejo side-by-side -- to grace the screen in a couple of decades. The two stars execute their routine with a skill that can't be faked (although it might have been filmed numerous times to assure that the coordination was flawless in the final print - - if that's still an appropriate term for what today's filmmakers actually produce). The choreography is superior to anything we've seen since the heydays of Ginger Rogers/Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Ray Bolger, Syd Charisse and their peers. I don't know if there's another role for the dog out there somewhere but he/she is a headliner in this movie. There's a major flaw in this film in my estimation. The down period, when the silent film star is experiencing a major depression and is ready to commit suicide even after Peppy Miller first comes to his rescue, lasts longer than it should to make the point. On the whole, however, The Artist is well worth seeing and deserves the prizes it won even if, as critics have noted, it's another occasion for Hollywood to celebrate itself as it has done many times in the past. I'll be looking for Ms. Bejo's French films and hoping that Hollywood will find roles for her as it has done in the past for other French, Italian and Spanish-speaking beauties. I also hope Mr. Dujardin will appear in further films that can make use of his unquestioned talents."

","The Artist is a silent film and it is so touching. Besides, the movie mentions about love. For example; love between the man and woman, love between man and dog, and love of cinema. The other important thing is that it's silent. And in black and white. George Valentin is a famous silent movies star and very successful Hollywood actor who is loved by his fans. He meets , by chance , coming actress Peppy Miller and he is in love with her. The problem is that Peppy is making it big in Talkies and George finds that silent movies are dying along with his career. On the contrary, unfortunately, the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of silent films in general because of the lack of dialogue. I liked silent movies thanks to The Artist and brilliant performances from Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and little Jack Russel. I would highly recommend watching this movie.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

And, in contrast, there are those who quickly find themselves better off than they were before. We, of course, know what happens to the latter, but what of the former?<br/><br/>On his way into the theater for the premiere of his latest film, silent movie star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) encounters young aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) and the two are photographed by the many reporters by the entrance. By the next day, Miller (Bejo) is on the cover of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Valentin's spouse, Doris (played by Penelope Ann Miller) is annoyed while Peppy (Bejo) is ecstatic. When she auditions for a role in Valentin's next movie, the studio is hesitant while Valentin is insistent. Over time, Miller's popularity increases to the point where she no longer needs Valentin's patronage. In the same amount of time, Al Zimmer (played by John Goodman), the head of the studio holding Valentin's contract, announces they will be halting production on silent films in favor of sound. Valentin believes sound is a fad and decides to produce his next silent film without the studio. Only to have the opening go unnoticed thanks to Peppy Miller's latest offering being released on the same day.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of Dujardin's or Bejo's previous films. And, while I recognized members of the supporting cast, their roles were much less significant. Also, given that the majority of the film is silent, it was an unusual experience. I was tempted to switch on my iPod at times, but somehow I didn't think AC/DC was compatible with the tone the film was trying to set. Leaving all that aside, this is a brilliant film and I enjoyed it immensely.

","When was the last time you actually saw a black and white movie? Don't worry, I didn't remember until I saw this one. The Artist film (silent) is certainly an Oscar winner, it was directed by French, Michel Hazanavicius. It took place in a vintage, black and white Hollywood air. With not so many good graphics nor dialogues the movie spoke by itself, the actors played very well their roll, the soundtrack was lovely and it was also self-understanding in a mesmerizing way; however, the movie had few invaluable scenes; as a result, it went a just a little bit long for my taste.<br/><br/>On the other hand, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) along with Peppy miller (Bérénice Bejo) drove a pleasant scenario where tears and laughs came along very well. Both were classically dapper, they acted delightfully surprising. Moreover, a swooning soundtrack by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra backed up the romance film. The way music merged with the scene was truly enchanting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, old movies seemed to be a little bit dull for me, yet the Artist changed my whole perception. The characters transported me to 1927 without a single word; as for that reason, and many more, it was in every sense of the phrase an original, outstanding and a beautifully hand crafted 4 stars film.<br/><br/>Eric Rivas, Dominican Republic."

","When I was in college, I tried to convince my friends to come together and do a silent, black and white short film project as a little homage and a bit of fun. I was shot down repeatedly and told that no one shared my interest in the classic style, and I'm so glad that THE ARTIST came along and proved them wrong in a big way. As I'm sure you're already aware, THE ARTIST is a silent film and presented in black and white, going so far as to include the piano music we expect with your usual silent film. THE ARTIST is a great movie and I was excited to see it garner so much attention (and a crap load of awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture). It's nice to see that a movie that could be considered the polar opposite of mainstream in any real sense would be so popular. The film is set in Hollywood in the late 20's and early 30's when silent film was at it's peak and the introduction of talking pictures was on the rise. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is cinema's top leading man, a class act with his trusty dog. Valentin is the most beloved actor of his time, but when talking pictures become the next big sensation, George finds it all a little far-fetched and decides against joining the fad. When talking pictures leave silent film in their dust, Valentin's star dims and the world obsesses with Peppy Miller, a beautiful and charismatic young dancer who made her big break as an extra in a Valentin film.<br/><br/>THE ARTIST is a wonderful film in a myriad of ways. It's a true homage to a style of filmmaking that's been gone for decades. Most people probably haven't even seen a silent film, and I know I've encountered a dozen or so people who won't even watch a black and white film because it's ""old"" or ""boring"". THE ARTIST and all of it's awards/attention might be enough to get people who wouldn't otherwise give a silent film their time the motivation to give it a chance. This is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It glitters and shines like you'd expect from an old school Hollywood spectacle back when it had class. You can't help but smile as you watch the film because the characters are so charming and the fun is contagious. This is an ultimate feel-good movie, even when it reaches its darkest point. Director Michel Hazanavicius has created a glimpse into Hollywood bright and shining history. The stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo (whom I didn't even recognize as the lady-in- waiting from A KNIGHT'S TALEman, she's come a long way), are fantastic. Dujardin is charismatic and fun, you are drawn into his struggle when he becomes Hollywood's old news. Silent films are out, and Valentin is too stubborn and set in his ways to change. His replacement, Peppy Miller (Bejo) is everything you'd want in a Hollywood starlet. She's beautiful, perpetually happy, with big eyes and an infectious smile. Plus, she's got talent. She quickly rises through the ranks to the top of the movie scene, where a dejected Valentin can only watch with regret.<br/><br/>While THE ARTIST is a pretty amazing movie, it's not without a few minor flaws. Really, my only complaint with the film was that it did feel its lengths at times. Towards the middle of the film when Valentin's downward slide is nearing it's conclusion and the stage is being set for his eventual revival, it feels a little long but not unbearable. You just become eager to see the next phase of his struggle. And one minor, albeit aggravating complaint, on my part: why is Malcolm McDowell given billing on the home video and marketing materials when he is literally in the movie for a minute? Seriously, I was excited at the prospect of McDowell in the film but he has a brief cameo assupposedly a butlerI'm not sure. He's just sort of sitting in on an extra's casting session. He's there and then he's gone. Still, the movie boasts an impressive supporting cast with James Cromwell and John Goodman, both putting in great performances. There is a lot to love about this film and I'm sure it deserves plenty of recognition but I'm sure that there are some out there that will say it's only being held in high regard because it's the first silent film in years and it panders to old Hollywood. That might be the case, but I couldn't care less as it's a really enjoyable film."

","It is the late 1920s, and a silent screen idol is at the height of his fame when a chance encounter with a girl in the crowd starts her out on the road to stardom, while his own hubris will cause him to risk everything when the coming of sound changes their fortunes.<br/><br/>If a few months ago, I had suggested that the best film of the year would be a completely silent movie shot in black and white, with intertitle cards, a 1.33 aspect ratio and all the rest of the 1920s movie trimmings , what might have you expected? Most likely a cunning spoof or skit on early movies, made with a knowing wink to a modern audience? Or perhaps a resolutely technical exercise? a slavish copy of the authentic article, perfectly reproducing every nuance of the form for a minority group of buffs to stroke beards sagely in appreciation of?<br/><br/>The wonder of Michel Hazanavicius' slice of silent heaven is that all the skills needed for the above, and more, are deployed invisibly, seemingly effortlessly, in creating pure, unabashed entertainment. This is a simple, but expertly honed tale of fame and fortune, of loss and despair, of romance, friendship and second chances. It is exactly the sort of charming, snappy caper that they (we are oft told) don't make 'em like any more, and the seemingly bold move to make a movie, about silent movies, as a silent movie, is no arch piece of artistic grandstanding, but a spot-on decision from a master craftsman to put film-making form totally at the service of the story being told.<br/><br/>Great performances abound across the board. The central couple of Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are wonderful as the debonair, self-obsessed matinée idol, and the perky starlet-in-the-making. John Goodman has never been better cast than as a cigar chomping Hollywood producer, and the ever dependable James Cromwell oozes quiet dignity as a faithful assistant. But it is no poor reflection upon any of these uniformly superb players to note that they are nonetheless repeatedly acted off the screen by a Jack Russell named Uggie!<br/><br/>Whatever you may be expecting, whatever misgivings you might have about the idea of sitting for two hours in a darkened room watching what one could reasonably imagine to be some kind of quirky satire or art-house indulgence will swiftly be forgotten. The Artist is a perfect little gem of a movie, a joy for anyone who loves cinema."

","Brilliant. This creative and imaginative use of silence really shows us what modern films are truly missing out on. The casting was mostly acute, and Michel Hazanavicius was ingenious as he recreated the 'golden age' of Hollywood. I felt the characters chosen and the story told was creative and inventive. All though not all the facts were accurate, cleverly the story could appeal to modern day dim-witted viewers while still reflecting the classical 30's era. Jean Dujardin was absolutely sensational and his acting was all on par and he definitely deserves the awards he received. Berence Bejo on the other hand did not meet the standard that the other actors, director and camera work set. I felt as a main part she was over shadowed by other workers and I was not all impressed. However this did not affect my overall experience of the Motion Picture and my complete recommendations to anyone wanting to see the film. As a summary; The Arist is both and entertaining and proof that they do still make 'em like they used to!"

"knowyourmovie","8","2","3","29 August 2012"," ‎""The Artist"" - far better than your average Hollywood mass-production, but lacks the important qualities of a true cinematic masterpiece...
","""The Artist"" is one of those movies often misunderstood for different reasons by different groups of viewers.<br/><br/>One group that got ""The Artist"" wrong was those simple souls who honestly complained: ""What? A silent movie about actors?? With a weird music and a silly story set in the ancient 1920s when people wore strange clothes and even did not have cool iPhones yet??? And just I missed my favorite TV show because of that so-called masterpiece????""<br/><br/>On the opposite side of the specter were those who ecstatically muttered something like ""Wow! A silent movie about actors!! With a heavenly music and a charming story set in the Roaring Twenties when people wore beautiful dresses and those nasty iPhones were not yet invented!!! Oh, this is so much better than that primitive show that I quietly watch on TV every day in deep secret from all of my super-sophisticated esthetically advanced friends!!!!""<br/><br/>It took me a while to find a suiting metaphor for ""The Artist"", but eventually I came up with the ""antique furniture"". Many people enjoy antique furniture – wealthy collectors and curious museum exhibition attendees alike. Antique furniture is often a finest, elegant, unique work of an imaginative and resourceful artisan, a work full of style and harmony. <br/><br/>However, there is a clear distinction between a mere craftsman and a genuine artist, between the finest piece of antique furniture and a true masterpiece of art - a painting, a sculpture, a poem, a piece of music.<br/><br/>Back to those who misunderstood ""The Artist"" - the ""antique furniture"" metaphor turned out to be a helpful tool for better defining the two groups of viewers mentioned above. People in the first group were not even capable of noticing the tastefully refined, unique, and overall very impressive antique trinket. People in the second group did notice it, but mistook the exquisite, nicely made knick-knack for a piece of true art. <br/><br/>At the end, ""The Artist"" does for the slightly more sophisticated audience the very same thing that the endless cookie-cutter comedies and action movies mass-produced by Hollywood do for the slightly less sophisticated audience: it simply entertains, nothing more and nothing less.<br/><br/>Yes, ""The Artist"" admittedly entertains the target audience more elegantly, with impeccable style, in more refined and sophisticated ways than many other movies. It boasts strong, clever directing and exquisitely smart screenplay filled with sparkling humor ( Michel Hazanavicius), great acting ( Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, James Cromwell, John Goodman, Malcolm McDowell and others), and is quite distinguished in many other areas: from music (Ludovic Bource), to costumes (Mark Bridges), to art direction (Laurence Bennett, Robert Gould), to cinematography (Guillaume Schiffman).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""The Artist"" lacks something fundamentally important, something that made ""SunsetBoulevard"" (the famous 1950 movie with a similar premise - a former Hollywood silent movie star fading into obscurity) a masterpiece - the power, the depth, and that elusive magic of a true master work of art.<br/><br/>A great work of art mysteriously molds the content, the form, and the execution into an indescribable heavenly harmony beyond mere mortal's comprehension. While the creators of the ""The Artist"" can be commended for the superior execution, both the form and the content of the movie demonstrate certain regrettable weaknesses.<br/><br/>Neither fish nor flesh, the film ends up as a funny sentimental fairy tale - not hilarious enough for a great comedy, not serious enough for a great tragedy, and not deep enough for a great drama. It is entertaining but unmoving, elegant and stylish but superficial.<br/><br/>I liked the ""The Artist"", but I was far from falling in love with it. It was cute, unique, and charming but far from overpowering or irresistible.<br/><br/>Far better than your average Hollywood mass-production, ""The Artist"" can be a great entertainment for those able to appreciate the movie at its true value. It nevertheless lacks the important qualities that mark a true cinematic masterpiece. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

","Anyone who loves cinema will love 'The Artist'; a gem of a film that harks back to the early days of Hollywood. Fitting then that a Frenchman should have made it since the Lumiere brothers are credited with the world's first public film screening on 28 December 1895. Judging by this film, it appears that the heart and soul of cinema still reside with the French, a medium that has always been viewed as high art and culture in France and much respected and patronised by all sections of French society. You only have to look at the flourishing film industry in France to realise this, something that the British government can learn lessons from in developing the British film industry.<br/><br/>The story is simplicity itself charting the fall of a great silent film star to be replaced by a young Hollywood starlet who embraces the 'talkies' as the future of film. It's a feel good movie, a history of Hollywood and a love story all rolled into one. All films should be made like this with an involving storyline, characters you care about and a feeling of happiness at the end. Both the costumes and the music complete its throwback to 1930s Hollywood glamour. The film will surely be played in cinemas with a live orchestral accompaniment and this will be a sublime experience indeed.<br/><br/>The French leads, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, have the look of 1920s Hollywood film stars and resemblances to Rudolph Valentino and Clara Bow are not accidental (Dujardin's plays George Valentin, but there is also a heavy Fred Astaire/Gene Kelly vibe, as the ending of the film makes clear). Bejo's character, Peppy Miller, also echoes the youthful vibrancy and age of Hollywood at its height. The film and its stars have already garnered many critical awards at film festivals around the world and I am sure will be favourite to win at the Oscars. It will, however, be impossible to separate Dujardin's performance from Bejo's and both should win the main acting prizes along with Best Film, Best Director and Best Music. The film will bewitch the voters at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences because it is a warm, nostalgic reminder about the Hollywood of its youth – an age in which cinema was tightly entwined in the zeitgeist of its time where anything was possible, no less the American Dream."

","Even the most lavish aristocratic banquet or the excessive intake of special drinks of variable alcohol content in any decadent soirée would not have caused this Herr Graf to imagine that, during the first decade of the XXI century, silent films would come back in fashion after having vanished almost 100 years before.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" (2011) is the picture in question and Herr Michel Hazanavicius the director; a silent film that has won considerable success with the public and the critics all around the world. Amazing that in these modernen times with its endless procession of noisy gadgetry that such a film has achieved vast approval. And if we add that ""The Artist"" is a French production concerned with how the coming of sound affected many actors, namely ""American"" actors, then this Her Graf doesn't understand a word, although probably the reason of this was that the film in question has French intertitles<br/><br/>However, while this Herr Graf was watching ""The Artist"" at the Schloss theatre, he felt something very strange in his stiff heart, a turmoil of different and contradictory feelings that gave him a particular sensation or as French commoners said, a ""déjà vu"".<br/><br/>This German count does not, in any way, want to lecture or to rant about the tricky aspects of a film such as ""The Artist"" or what is supposed to be the quintessence of a silent film, and how this particular vision is almost a parody of its subject and uses many stereotypes about the era. Rather, since the film is celebrating silent movies, this Herr von can only applaud Herr Hazanavicius. He accomplished a formidable task given that most people today have never even seen a silent film or even one in black and white. He had to approximate a silent film in a rather cliché' way in terms of story and the style is more like a talkie than a silent but this had to be done to overcome the prejudices of modernen audiences.<br/><br/>So, consequently the fact that a ""new"" silent film like the ""The Artist"" has been given the support and approval of the public is fit sociological subject. Will this lead to the new longhaired generations appreciating silent film? If that does happen it will be the most incredible and shocking news to this Herr Graf since his fat and rich Teutonic heiresses decided to get rid of their corsets.<br/><br/>And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must put on again his old but now fashionable tuxedo."
"happipuppi13","10","2","3","13 March 2012"," The Artistry of ""The Artist"".
","The first actual silent movie I ever saw,was ""Seventh Heaven"". It was on TV one day when I was 11,in 1979. I saw this before I even had seen a silent comedy and despite my age,I didn't turn the channel. Instead,I watched it all.<br/><br/>When I got around to the comedies,I liked them also,mainly because I can look into a time long before my own.. So with ""The Artist,I get to do that as well but in a modern film. This movie is a must and great up to date way for those unfamiliar,<br/><br/>Sure,all the actors are from this era but they have done such a convincing portrayal here,it's almost as if they actually entered a time machine and made a movie in the 21st century. <br/><br/>The filming style is of that era,I can only guess they located the same kind of film somehow,the fashions are perfect and the storyline plays just like one of the ""real"" movies of that time.<br/><br/>The scene on the multi-level staircase,reminds me of how they filmed some scenes in ""Metropolis"". I believe many a silent classic is honored here,including the comedies. <br/><br/>The sound moments are,in a sense,like when Al Jolson made ""The Jazz Singer"". Mostly silent but some sound moments thrown in. Those moments here are done in a brilliant and creative way. <br/><br/>The storyline is right out of early Hollywood....ala ""A Star Is Born"". He's a long time success,she's a newcomer and later,their places are reversed on the Hollywood ladder of fame. <br/><br/>He absolutely refuses to do ""talkies"" and (like most then) thought they were a gimmick and wouldn't last. She,being younger,is all too happy to comply. <br/><br/>John Goodman's role is very funny as the put upon studio head who can't get Valentin to see that the silent era is over and must make a change or be shoved aside to history.<br/><br/>I wont go any further if you have yet to see it,if you have you know the rest. The ending is a very clever and fun one as well. This picture deserves every bit of praise it's been given. <br/><br/>10 stars for the artistry of ""The Artist""."
"Anurag-Shetty","7","2","3","12 March 2012"," A very unique film.
","The Artist is a story about silent movie star George Valentin(Jean Dujardin). When the era of silent movies end, Valentin is worried whether he'll lose his popularity in the new era of movies. Whereas Peppy Miller(Berenice Bejo), an aspiring dancer is on the verge of a big break. I really loved the idea of making a silent movie after all these years. The story of the movie was really emotional & touching. You really feel sad for George Valentin when people lose interest in his silent movies. However, the movie was a bit dragging in the middle. Jean Dujardin has done a spectacular job in his portrayal of George Valentin. Berenice Bejo is impressive as Peppy Miller. The supporting actors have done a good job as well. So, I would like to conclude by saying, The Artist is worth a watch. Is it Oscar worthy? Not really."
"samuraifa451","9","2","3","3 February 2012"," ""The Artist"" is a Worthy Tribute to Silent Cinema.
","Daring to look back onto the world of silent cinema, ""The Artist"" springs to life as both an homage and period piece about the rise of sound and the stars that were effected by it. During the 1920s, silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) was at the top of his game, entertaining audiences all over in cinemas. However, as talkies start to slowly emerge, Valentin stands in protest against it while slowly charming up to a rising star (Berenice Bejo) who is taking the ""Talkie"" world by storm. ""The Artist"" is one of those films that is living proof that less truly is more. Both Dujardin and Bejo have tremendous chemistry together without ever hearing a single word they say and still one could argue that Valentin's lovable dog (Uggie) ends up stealing the show. Aside from this the story unfolds in a way that is funny, upsetting, heartwarming and even romantic that draws interest more and more as it goes along. For some, the fact that film is mostly silent (there are a few spoken lines at the very end of the movie) may seem overpowering but the film immerses the audience so quickly into its world that eventually its barely even noticeable. Although ""The Artist"" may not be for everyone, those who love a good story with a little bit of period piece for dramatic effect, ""The Artist"" is well worth it."

The story line is quite silly, but delivers some goods.<br/><br/>The actors are so good, mainly the duo Dujardin/Bejo, both can express the gestures and expressions of the silent era. I agree with all the awards the film has been getting recently. I'm not sure it will get the Oscar for best picture, but I'm pretty certain that Jean Dujardin will get the statuette. I recommend this film for everybody.<br/><br/>INn a Nutshell: The Artist is a worthy seeing picture because it has a good story and a good cast.

"dalelawson-1","9","2","3","29 January 2012"," Great homage to the silent era, gripping narrative and fantastic use of sound, when it is used
","The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) focuses on the career of a silent film star and his transition into the classical Hollywood era where ""talkies"" dominate. His career is contended by the incredible performances of a new star, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). The film progresses, following her rise and his demise.<br/><br/>The Artist is colourless and silent which can be off-putting for the generic film going audience who would prefer to watch another Transformer film. The story is an interesting one and pays great homage to the films of the silent era. Through the lack of sound I became more engaged with the plot and characters of The Artist as there were no conversations or sound effects to distract ones eye or ear from the films narrative. When watching it, comparisons between The Artist and Singin' in the Rain (Dir. Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952) cannot be overlooked. They both contain very similar narratives, where one actor is forced out by ""talkies"" while another succeeds.<br/><br/>Unlike silent movies from the early 20th century, this film does incorporate scenes of sound within in the film. Counting it up after watching the film I believe there are in-fact only two scenes in the whole hour and a half that use diegetic sound. One scene occurs early in the film where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the film's protagonist, suffers a nightmare on how he won't cope with the transition to sound. This scene is superbly produced. All the objects Valentin contacts with, in the dream, make sounds as he interacts with them, but he himself cannot speak. This scene is hauntingly spectacular as the footage that precedes and follows this scene is silent and accompanied but a music hall soundtrack. This nightmare scene, however, has no soundtrack and only the diegetic sound of the objects Valentin touches.<br/><br/>The camera work and editing techniques are similar to that of film- making in the 1920s. Modern techniques are, however, used within The Artist as well. At multiple points newspaper headlines are layered onto the film so as to provide more of a narrative. These techniques were used in early cinema, but not to the extent or effect that they are in The Artist. As I mentioned before, this film pays a great homage to the classics created by the first film-makers.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy aspect of this film is the acting. For a French film there is a large number of popular American faces. This will be due to the film being set in the United States. Actors John Goodman and James Cromwell play producer Al Zimmer and Valentin's butler. These actors are fantastic, along with the previous mentioned Dujardin and Bejo, and create an unforgettable film. Another actor that needs recognition is Valentin's dog. It is one of the most important characters in the film and also provides great comic relief; the inter-titles near the end of the film states that Valentin ""owes his life to that dog"", referring to a house fire. But subtly I think the inter-titles are implying that the dog helped make Valentin's career.<br/><br/>The idea of silent films is often off-putting for a generic film audience, as mentioned. But this film should seriously be considered for anyone who enjoys a good film. I also heavily recommend viewing it at the pictures as cinema is the medium films like this are intended for. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review then check out my other reviews on: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","3","29 January 2012"," A triumph that may never be replicated
","This is an audaciously original movie that succeeds spectacularly but it is hard to see how such success could ever be replicated. In the age of American widescreen blockbusters with glorious colour, crashing sound. sharp dialogue, and computer- generated special effects, who would have expected the creation of, let alone the acclaim for, a Franco-Belgian 1.33:1 aspect ratio, black and white work with (virtually) no sound and only old-fashioned visual effects?<br/><br/>Above all, this is a triumph for writer and director Michel Hazanavicius. Much of Hazanavicius' television and film work is a pastiche of earlier cinema and ""The Artist""is a homage to a past era. It is set in Hollywood at the time that silent movies were being being surpassed by the talkies, a transition that ruins the previously-feted eponymous, handsome George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) but plays to the strengths of the winsome newcomer Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo, the director's wife). In France, Dujardin is something of a national treasure but, until now, he has been largely unknown outside his Gallic homeland. The two French leading roles are supplemented by those of two familiar American actors, James Cromwell as chauffeur to Valentin and then Miller and John Goodman as director of both. But the fifth star of this most unusual work is a talented canine who gives us the biggest laughs: a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie.<br/><br/>Those who know their cinematic history will delight in the many cultural references, perhaps above all to John Gilbert who failed to make the transfer from silents to talkies. Those who have longed for a movie with a plot that one can understand, despaired at trying to catch snatched lines of dialogue, and feared that too much contemporary cinema is callous and cynical will thrill to a simple and humanist work which has its share of pathos but leaves you with a huge smile on your face."
"Reel_starz","8","2","3","19 January 2012"," The stuff dreams are made of
","Like so many movies released in 2011, from Hugo and Midnight in Paris to Like Crazy and even Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Artist is about someone who clings to the past, who insists on lingering in some idealized Golden Age even though the rest of the world has moved on. When the movie's protagonist, the once-celebrated silent film star George Valentin first encounters the burgeoning phenomenon later known as ""talkies"", he laughs in scornful defiance, believing with every fiber of his being that this is just a transient fad, nothing more; even when his studio ceases production on all silent films, essentially putting him out of a job, he refuses to accept the fact that he has become passé, that the audience that used to adore him has lost all interest, and starts to produce and direct his own movies. This fall-from-power storyline, made popular by such ancient Greek dramas as Oedipus Rex and Agamemnon, is hardly original, yet Michel Hazanavicious's The Artist lends it a new poignancy, for in our modern-day world of constant motion, Valentin's fate seems all too real.<br/><br/>From the second it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last May to apparently resounding applause, The Artist burst onto the scene as a prime Oscar contender. Critics lauded Hazanavicious for his clever ode to the era of silent film, and audiences fell in love with the charming characters (especially the beloved dog Uggie) and winning, feel-good story, which never loses its endearing vivacity, even when it strays down a surprisingly dark road. In short, the movie is almost impossible to dislike. From the moment the opening credits flicker on screen in delightful, old-fashioned black-and-white (a touch sure to induce nostalgia in anyone who has seen a movie made before the advent of Technicolor), it sweeps the audience back to a time when sincerity was admired, and the public still swooned unashamedly over the pure ingenuity of ""moving pictures"". The whole thing would feel gimmicky if it didn't feel so real, so heartfelt. For the first ten minutes or so, the mere novelty of it all is its own kind of magic, but then, it wears off, and you're no longer watching a 21st century silent, black-and-white film – you're simply watching a film, one filled with boundless energy and passion and emotion, one that's enchanting not because of its old-fashioned visual aesthetic but because it genuinely wants to tell a story, which sadly seems to be quite rare these days, when many filmmakers are content to clobber together a random series of set pieces and call that a ""plot"", and even dramas are increasingly described as ""character studies"" and ""explorations"". Needless to say, Hazanavicious pulls it off with seemingly effortless grace. With the help of an animated cast and a vibrant, suitably dramatic score courtesy of Ludovic Bource, he weaves a tale that is simple yet beguiling and, ultimately, heartbreaking, full of humor, drama, pathos, romance and suspense, along with an extra helping of panache.<br/><br/>Speaking of the cast, it's no wonder Jean Dujardin, a French actor formerly known for the OSS 117 James Bond spoofs, has become a favorite to win the Oscar for Best Actor, a category that will probably include such Hollywood superstars as George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Blessed with a naturally expressive face and old-timey movie star looks, Dujardin is perfectly cast as Valentin, oozing charisma as he smiles and dances and intermittently raises his eyebrows, and even when Valentin plummets down a death spiral of depression and arrogant self-pity, he remains almost brutally likable; to say that it's easy to see why he was adored by movie audiences would be a glaring understatement. He also shares some nice chemistry with Bérénice Bejo, who plays up-and-coming actress Peppy Miller with infectious vigor, and despite never saying an audible word to each other, they make an exquisite couple, simultaneously sweet and believable. The rest of the main cast is rounded out by Penelope Ann Miller (Valentin's wife, Doris), James Cromwell (the butler, Clifton) and John Goodman (the director, Al Zimmer).<br/><br/>But lest anyone get the wrong impression, The Artist is neither stuffy ""Oscar-bait"" nor a cutesy indie; in fact, with its lighthearted, effervescent tone, it could not be more accessible or crowd-pleasing (though this will inevitably lead some critics and more hardcore film buffs to dismiss it as sentimental fluff). Also, although the marketing campaign has focused largely on the movie's attempt to replicate/pay tribute to classic Hollywood, its story and themes could not be more timeless or universal: while I can't say it's the overall best movie of 2011 (my personal favorite is J.J. Abrams's Super 8), The Artist does the best job of all the nostalgia-themed films released last year – and there were many – of depicting that intense sense of longing for a bygone era. For unlike most of the other movies, as good as some of them are, The Artist doesn't simply portray nostalgia as a wistful fantasy but also acknowledges that it is essentially rooted in stubbornness, a refusal to accept change that may not be idealistic so much as willful and irrational. And maybe that is ultimately what makes the movie special, what elevates it above sentimental fluff. For the very existence of The Artist, a 21st century silent film, as well as this recent trend of movies that romanticize the past, is proof that nostalgia is always relevant. It's a little sad to think that, even after all these years, we are still like George Valentin, struggling to revive silent films. Perhaps the real tragedy is not that the Golden Age is gone but that even today, we still miss it."

I don't mind the lack of originality too much, but I find some holes in the plot annoying, mainly because this such a great film it deserved better. There's no need to excuse the black and white, or the lack of speech in the film, not only because it makes cinematic sense, it practically works for the film and improves it. The cinematography is super, the acting is superb, with the two leads excelling beyond everyone else, mostly because they do have great characters written for them, but obviously also because they're up for the task.<br/><br/>Go see this film, and try not to dwell too much on what's missing in the story, what we do get to see is so well done it makes up for it."
"billmd","10","2","3","19 January 2012"," Brilliant rendition of a silent film story
","""The Artist"" is an amazing film in so many ways. In an age of color films with lots of noise and special effects, ""The Artist"" is a silent film in black and white with few effects. And it is brilliant, almost certainly the best film of the year. It is entirely original, taking advantage of modern technologies and techniques that could not have been used when silent movies were on offer. The story is almost entirely visual, with very few dialogue placards -- and the visuals are stunning. But the most creative thing about the film is the use of sound conveyed at times by orchestra, at times by ensembles and at times by single instruments. And the most stunning thing of all is the use of total silence at a climactic moment of the film This is like no silent movie I've ever seen -- for that matter, like no other movie I've ever seen. Go see it in a movie theatre, not on your television."

","When I first saw the trailer for The Artist, it convinced me to go see the film. I didn't know it was a ""silent"" movie. I only found that out later. Then I became more intrigued. How would they pull this off without losing the audience? As I sat down in the cinema, nothing could prepare me for this wonderful movie. I don't make a habit of watching dramas. A trip to the pictures is too expensive for me, so I only go to see something special. And this was it. Beautifully directed, with a smart and inventive script, and mesmerizing performances from the elegant and very funny cast. But as if that wasn't enough, something else happened inside that cinema. Something magical. People stopped tapping and rustling and talking and... listened. It was the first time I have ever heard a cinema so silent. This film is genuinely affecting. Funny, moving, sad, joyous. And a little tap dancing thrown in for good measure! So my thanks to the filmmakers for such a great evening. And for those of you who aren't sure... go see it for yourself!"
"soxlade","9","2","3","18 January 2012"," Pure Retro Joy
","George Valentin is the silent movie star. He and his dog, Jack, are the stars of many a hit film. They are loved by their public and boy, do they know it. But George's life is about to be turned upside down by the advent of a new technology - sound. George's pride and arrogance make him blind to the fact that the audience want to hear their stars as well as see them, and so begins his slow slide into obscurity.<br/><br/>The story to the Artist is a well worn one, and one that was a staple of many of the melodramas of the period it recreates. It is a good enough story, well told and well acted even if it drags a little towards the end, but it is not where the true joy of ""The Artist"" lies.<br/><br/>The Artist is wonderful for a huge number of reasons. Firstly the performances from everyone involved are superb, delivering their (silent) lines with the perfect collection of facial expressions and body language. You may not be able to keep up with what they are saying, but you understand what their characters are feeling. Those of you who may be worried about enjoying a silent film, don't be. The film draws you in and involves you with the characters and their story. You don't miss a thing.<br/><br/>Though the entire cast are spectacular, especially Jean Dejardin and Berenice Bejo as George and Pepe, I felt a special love for Penelope Ann Miller as George's wife Doris, James Cromwell as Clifton, and a fantastically curmudgeonly Malcolm McDowell as an unimpressed extra. Auggie the Dog though, as George's most loyal friend, is spectacular. He delivers a genuine performance as opposed to just seeming to be a collection of cute tricks. What could have been cutesy or mawkish comes across as genuinely believable.<br/><br/>On the technical front the film is unusual and innovative. The film makers commit to a historically accurate 4:3 ratio image, to title cards and simple graphics to highlight their story, but this also allows them to play around with the conventions. The locked off, fixed cameras of the silent era is often mixed in with more modern dolly shots; there are hints of colourisation, occasional graphic touches appear that were beyond film makers of the late 1920s. All these little touches highlight a point, emphasise a character or underline an emotion. <br/><br/>All of this technical detail is enhanced by the wonderful score which swells, drops, meanders, dances, mopes and soars along with the audience's emotions. Because of the lack of dialogue and sound effects, ""The Artist"" highlights the power of music and moving pictures to deliver emotion to the audience.<br/><br/>The re-creation of early Hollywood and Burbank is detailed but not glorious. Unlike beautiful re-creations such as LA Confidential however, the Hollywood of ""The Artist"" feels a busy, lively and warm place. There is a sense of community throughout the film: people may forget who you were, but they don't forget that you are a person.<br/><br/>This is key to the film's charm. It isn't mean-spirited. It reminded me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", a film that never fails to make you smile.<br/><br/>But most importantly of all, it reminds you of the power of moving pictures. One wonderful sequence is a long static shot of two floors and an interconnecting staircase on which our leads stand, conversing. Around them, above them, below them, past them, rush busy people. All this movement all around the frame just serves to underline the immobility of our romantic leads - so involved are they in each other, the world is literally passing them by. It is wonderfully romantic, warm and delicate scene, but achieved without the use of sound, speech or even our leads in focus. <br/><br/>It isn't perfect, some on-screen prompts come across as clumsy and the shallow plot sags just a bit in the final third, but the charm and wit of the piece easily surmounts this minor quibbles. It is hard not to dislike a film that delivers its fair quotient of zingers via the medium of text.<br/><br/>The film is warm, romantic, witty, smart and utterly charming. It deserves to win many an award."
"ma-mason","8","2","3","9 January 2012"," Speaking Volumes
","I don't think there has been a recent film which so closely expresses the joy of the art of motion pictures than 'The Artist'. Some may view it as pastiche, others may not see the point at all, especially in a world stuffed with theme park ride movies, but in my opinion, 'The Artist' expresses the love of the essentially visual medium of movie making. I grew up watching silent movies on TV in the 1970s when the BBC often scheduled features, shorts, and compilation shows hosted by Mark Curry and Bob Monkhouse within Children's TV. Although the central character (played with natural ease and perfection by Jean Dujardin)is obviously based in part on Douglas Fairbanks (the character watches, Norma Desmond-like, one of his old movies - recreated clips from Douglas Fairbanks 'Zorro'), George Valentin is more accurately based on actors no-one mentions in reviews because they are now largely forgotten. John Gilbert's silent career as a romantic lead was destroyed when audiences heard his thin willowy voice, and in France, the great actor and comedian Max Linder, who's films inspired all the American silent comedians and film makers. His career declined after the 1st World War. Linder has been virtually erased from Cinema History by dominant American Mythmakers who staked a claim on the pioneering performance and filmmaking of this artist. Check him out. Actors like Charlie Chase are also in the mix. Interestingly, the first 'movie' we see the character starring in looks to be based more on French silent film series like 'Fantome' and 'Judex' than anything Hollywood which is a quiet comment on the international market in film distribution and celebrity that thrived during the silent era. Then there's Peppy; comparisons have been made with Clara Bow, but she was as much a victim of the end of the Silent era, her career being finished in 1933 when she retired. Peppy is more representative of actresses like Joan Crawford who started as an extra in silents but only came into her own when talkies arrived. The film is a film lovers treat, there are moments peppered throughout the film inspired by silent, and not so silent movies. From the still couple on the staircase while the extras plough up and down, down to the choice of typefaces in the captions. Even the dog character stretches back to Cecil Hepworth's 1905 British film 'Rescued by Rover'. And this is why a silent movie(albeit draped in some of the most sumptuous and evocative movie music I've heard since Max Steiner, and some deftly placed sound effects in one sequence) still works and why it still has validity as a style of movie making: The visual becomes paramount, everything that is put into the shot matters, and is there to say something. It is the images that talk, you see the thoughts and the feelings of the characters not only in the way they move or look, but in what they are surrounded by (note the 'Lonely Star' Cinema display after the auction), how the scene is dressed and lit, and what the camera is doing. I was told by my English teacher to 'read the pictures' as well as the words. A silent film heightens the visual. When the camera is tilted during the mirror table scene, it is talking to us (this scene, by the way, cleverly nods to the pool scene in the opening of 'Sunset Boulevard', and at the same time explains how the shot was achieved) Sound, and especially dialogue would have made some scenes impossible or ridiculous; Peppy slipping her arm into George's sleeve speaks more than words could ever do about her feelings, as does the reflection of George on the suit in the clothes shop window and the shadow with a mind of it's own. (All moments inspired by original silent movies) The only point which bothered me was to set 1929 as the point when talkies were to be the new thing, that started as early as 1926, with the Jazz Singer following in 1927 and the first all talking film in 1928 (Lights of New York). By the end of that year all the major studios had converted fully to sound production. A few silents were made through 'til 1933, but not many. It seems like the date was chosen to coincide with the Wall Street Crash, but that event had a greater effect on sound films. If this movie inspires people to look again and reassess their view of silent movies then that is to be hugely welcomed. I would recommend viewers search out old TV series such as 'Cinema Europe', 'Lumiere's Children' and 'The Last Machine'. If you know nothing of silent film and want a unique night out at the Cinema which may well change the way you SEE a film then watch this. To those of you who think silent cinema doesn't have the power to grip in this widescreen 3D download your own theme-park era, I have only one word to quote from the film for you - 'BANG!'"
"Greigx3","9","2","3","8 January 2012"," celebrating the beginnings of cinema as an art form
","The Artist is not trying to be an authentic silent film, but instead wishes to present a novel but respectful nod to the silent era of Classical Hollywood. It is full of references and reads like Hazanavicius' love letter to an era of filmmaking which he – and we – are indebted to. In a time when films like Avatar are attempting to revolutionise cinema by making IMAX 3D the next coming of sound, I'm surprised The Artist was even made. But I'm glad it was. To me it serves as a much-needed look back at the essential beginnings of the art form. Already receiving considerable popular success, The Artist could herald the beginning of an era when mainstream filmmakers and audiences alike become more aware and influenced by the origins of cinema. Apart from all that, The Artist also stands alone as an altogether sad, funny, compelling and entertaining film.<br/><br/>http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/"
"cinematic_aficionado","10","2","3","6 January 2012"," Uplifting and refreshing an oasis of a movie
","From the opening credits, the audience is instantly transported to the golden age of Hollywood. We then follow the story, set in the 1920's, of George Valentin, a renowned silent era actor who refuses to adapt to the new technology that introduces sound to the films and pays the price, and his acquaintance with dancer Peppy Miller.<br/><br/>I would rather stick to impressions of the film without further references to the development of the story out of concern it might spoil it for those who have not yet seen it.<br/><br/>As one watches ""The Artist"" feels like being part of another era, bygone, of cinema; the glamour, the originality, the ambiance is all there. The story line flows seamlessly and is enriched with elements of emotion, tension, consequence of pride, as well as struggle with conscience. The audience is not just in for a great film but will be effortlessly seduced by its abundance of charm. Though silent it speaks loud and it will also move, perhaps even stir its viewers. In times where hi-tech visuals often carry the weight of films instead of its actors, it was refreshing to see a movie where technology actually serves hypocritic talent. To the above we must add spotless performances by the leading actors and an exquisite cinematography, whereby every scene is skilfully and beautifully shot.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a cinematic delight that will cause joy, sorrow, sadness, even anguish, thus leaving the theatre with a sense of exhilaration. And that's no little feat."
"pathaniav","8","2","3","6 January 2012"," A delightful slice of nostalgia
","I am a big fan of The Thin Man series, and connected instantly with Valentin's pencil thin mustache, cocky little smirk (in the first half of the movie), and the dog! Of course, the story line is very different. It is a simple story really. Boy at the pinnacle of his career meets struggling girl and gives her a helping hand. Then boy meets girl once again, this time as he is going downhill and she is climbing up. This midpoint is captured rather literally although still prettily on the screen with a set of staircases with Valentin coming down after a disappointing business meet and an upbeat Peppy bouncing up the steps. I won't go on with the rest of the story so as not to play a spoiler. It is an old fashioned love story - you will come out with a broad smile. <br/><br/>A note on B&W silent cinema - no sound, little animation or special FX - with so little to work with, the best directors of the time wove magic on the screen. And this retro gem of a movie does the same. Comedy, drama, and romance all come together in a clever mix. The acting was top notch - the two main actors were superb. The movie swept me up and took me back in time into the 1920s and 1930s Hollywood as old superstars of the silent era gave way to the new talking stars.<br/><br/>Catch it in the movie halls if you can."

","What a pleasant surprise The Artist is. I was expecting something pretentious but what I got was a charming and entertaining romantic comedy. The fact that it is shot in black and white is silent (it has a very good accompanying original orchestral score with a slice of Bernard Hermann thrown in for good measure) and framed in a non wide screen academy format only adds to the movie.   The cast are universally excellent especially the two leads Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Miller excelling in their roles with James Cromwell and John Goodman  giving  great performances. The direction is spot on and really does portray the style of movies form the late 20's early 30's and using authentic locations really helps.   I watched the movie in an almost full cinema on a very large screen. The audience laughed and gasped throughout the screening and there was a spontaneous round of applause at the end. I would recommend seeing the movie in a cinema with an audience to get the full impact. Highly recommended."
"MatthewKerr","10","2","3","4 January 2012"," Never Before Have I Seen Something This Unique---
","I must say, I was a bit skeptical walking into 'The Artist', for as I glanced at the members of the audience, I just saw many senior citizens. I expected it to be much like The King's Speech, which I strongly disliked due to its genericness and overall boring tone. I am young, 13, and I was almost preparing myself to be disappointed. This film, however, automatically won its way to my top 10 of 2011 list. I was completely blown away Jean Dujardin's performance. He was absolutely outstanding, and it's a shame that people believe George Clooney tops him. He really is a breakout star with his incredible performance in this film. His facial expressions, his movements, he became the character: A greedy, self-obsessed film star who must come to terms with the fact that his career is dying, under the brand new impression of 'talkies'. Meanwhile, Berenice Bejo casts lightning with her profound ability to act out Peppy Miller a 'Peppy' (pun intended) girl who is on her way to becoming a true star. She really does capture the screen in each scene she is in, with both her beauty, and her true emotions that are extracted as time plays out on the screen. The original score- Marvelous. The costume/set design- Incredible. I could go on and on forever about how great this film was, but I will just sum it up in words. The Artist, is a unique, creative piece that provides relief from big-budget action films, bringing long-time film lovers and brand new audiences into the simpler time of the silent film era. Thriving off the performances of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, The Artist is a one of a kind masterpiece. <br/><br/>*****/*****"
"daneldorado","10","2","3","1 January 2012"," Best film of the 21st century
","The critics have been raving about the new silent film ""The Artist"" (2011), and in my considered opinion they are right to rave. ""The Artist"" is the absolute BEST film I have seen, made in this century! <br/><br/>If you ask, what is this movie about? and someone tells you, ""oh, it's a black & white film about what happened when the movies went from being silent to having sound..."" then you will have a general idea, but you still won't have a clue as to the greatness of this film. <br/><br/>Producer-director Michel Hazanavicius recaptures silent cinema in ways no talkies film maker has before. For one thing, he shoots his picture at 22 frames per second, making the viewing experience resemble the look of a silent film to today's audiences. For another, he uses visual metaphors, such as a scene shot in L.A.'s downtown Bradbury Building, where we can see the heroine (Berenice Bejo) ascending one flight of stairs while the down-on-his-luck actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is descending another. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a movie about two movie actors, one male and one female, showing the male's descent from public favor while the female grows in popularity. But no, this is not just another re-make of ""A Star is Born"" (1937). While that picture ended tragically, this one is a romantic comedy... and Hazanavicius makes no effort to tie them together.<br/><br/>Back in about 1950, we could hear silent screen queen Norma Desmond smirk, ""Who needs words? We didn't need dialogue. We had FACES!""<br/><br/>You may be willing to agree with her, once you've seen and enjoyed ""The Artist."" It is filmed in black & white, in the old boxy 4:3 format we knew before Cinemascope came along. And - - get this -- there is NO dialogue we can hear. Well, just a couple of lines as a gag; but they have no bearing on the story, which is magnificent.<br/><br/>As for those ""faces"" that Norma Desmond idolized, one of them is plainly suggested by Jean Dujardin as the lead character. He has such an open, expressive face, you come to believe he belonged in silent pictures. But his talents have also graced modern spy spoofs such as the recent OSS 117 comedies, both of them warmly received by the critics. As for Mlle. Bejo, she is near perfection as the 1920s' flapper George Valentin comes to love.<br/><br/>Of course, ""The Artist"" has background music and sound effects, much as the later silent films did.<br/><br/>In New Yorker magazine, critic Anthony Lane wrote ""silent cinema really was the purest and most binding incarnation of the medium, one from which we have torn ourselves, to our detriment, ever since."" <br/><br/>The critics are raving about ""The Artist.""

Set in the era of silent movies but on the cusp of radical change, Hazanavicius has unravelled a tight story with playfulness and pathos; based around the rise of one star's career and decline of another's. <br/><br/>Rarely present in films, both leads show genuine star quality with compelling chemistry drawing them together as circumstances and pride conspire to keep them apart. Over the years I've resisted leaving a review on IMDb but have eventually succumbed here, believing that this film deserves to enjoy the success of its many virtues. 'The Artist' has the rudiments of a solid, classic film – a well-paced, empathetic and evolving plot, characters with likable personalities and an interesting, brave medium in relating the story. This film has a lot to say and does so in style.<br/><br/>If you love going to the cinema then please see this movie but if you don't like films much then this may change your disposition...I hope it will delight and move you as much as I.

"katie-sirles","10","1","1","30 December 2011"," The Artist: Romantic and Magical
","Was becoming a siren of the silver screen ever as easy as being in the right place at the right time? It was for Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). When Peppy goes down to Kinograph Studios in – where else – Hollywoodland, she has a fateful drop of a pocketbook and literally bumps into handsome silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). A brief moment of mortification turns into a laugh and a laugh turns into front page news. A more realistic idea takes place after this meeting, as it really is who you know and not what you do when it comes to getting into show business. Thankfully, Peppy's wild curls and pearly whites were enough to catch the eye of George Valentin and she gets her first role in a big screen picture. The on-screen chemistry flows over into real life chemistry. George's wife is nonplussed with all of this and not even his adorable antics with his faithful pup can get him out of this one.<br/><br/>Aside from his marital troubles, George has an even bigger matter keeping him up at night. Talkies have just been introduced as the next big thing. Now, I don't understand why George wouldn't just make the transition myself, but the film makes it incredibly clear that he is quite proud of his silent films. Fortunately for Kinograph, the wildly adorable Peppy Miller isn't afraid to get on camera and speak. Speak, sing, whistle she'll do it all. Guess this means they don't need George anymore. Cue sad, washed up music Call me a sucker if you like, but that silent film song and dance (no pun intended) always gets me. Black and white makes everything so glamorous. When you throw two attractive people into the mix, it's a guaranteed hit. I'm not the only one who ate this movie up. Hollywood will surely be kissing director Michel Hazanavicius's feet come award show season. Dujardin already won Best Actor at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and the film is carrying six Golden Globe nominations. God only knows what will happen at the Academy Awards, but I imagine that THE ARTIST will do just fine.<br/><br/>There is just something so charming about actors that can dance in tap shoes and look damn fine doing it. Old Hollywood is always regarded fondly and with the way things are going there these days, I wouldn't mind seeing some of that again. The only thing fake about Peppy Miller is her mole. Oops. Spoiler alert. There's an innocence to this movie that our society doesn't experience anymore. Also, Ludovic Bource -, the man behind the score for THE ARTIST – truly captured the sound of the era. A lot of simple piano is a good way to stir emotions and make the viewer believe they are watching a movie that is really from the late 1920s – early 1930s.<br/><br/>THE ARTIST took second place in my favorite movies of the year. Really, it is a fun movie with lots of pretty imagery and good toe-tapping music. It also flies by. It proves that we don't need boner/fart jokes and profanity to make an enjoyable movie. I don't mean to go all Will Smith 1999 MTV VMAs on you, but it truly is rare to find a film that makes us laugh and cry and emote all over without nudity/profanity/bodily excretions. In fact, not a word is spoken in THE ARTIST until the very end. It is just really well done and even though it is very obviously appealing to the vintage Hollywood style of doing things, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"ghost_dog86","10","1","1","24 December 2011"," Can a silent film really win Best Picture?
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Thank God for new ideas! With aspects of sound films such as ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""Citizen Kane"", as well as almost every silent film I ever saw in film school, ""The Artist"" is a silent film inexplicably released in 2011; and a modern masterpiece to boot. Without audible dialogue director Michel Hazanavivius creates a visual feast for the senses, merging his vision with a stellar soundtrack, which navigates the viewer through a whirlwind of emotions, just as a more conventional/modern sound-film would. ""The Artist"" tells the very intriguing story of George Valentin, played by Jean Dajardin, an actor with the charisma of a Rudolph Valentino, but with an attitude that rivals Chaplin. In 1927 Valentin stands as the biggest star of the Hollywood silent era, making countless films with his sidekick, a happy-go-lucky dog. But with the emergence of the talkie (the talking picture), and many younger actors, specifically a young actress named Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, Valentin fears that he will not be able to (and frankly doesn't want to) make the transition into a future dominated by sound films. Hazanvivius has constructed a very entertaining as well as historically accurate storyline, all while paying homage to the groundbreaking era in which this story takes place. Using old fashioned wipes and cuts, he allows the audiences (even some who haven't seen silent films) to experience a slice of film history (the silent era) as it should be experienced; in a more or less silent format. And in this day and age, where the Hollywood formula seems to be either an abundance of explosions, which destroy the senses and/or sexually irresponsible teenagers being moralistically decapitated, ""The Artist"" demonstrates a refreshing acknowledgement of how movies can be fun again with some simple yet visually breathtaking storytelling. This is very much cinema at its richest. What can I say? ""The Artist"" made me smile.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" is a silent film about silent films; that is not entirely silent. BUT how these rare introductions of sound are interwoven into the story demonstrates a real stroke of genius from Hazanavivius. In fact, there are many broad strokes of genius at play during ""The Artist"", from the director's intricate attention to detail, in terms of the striking look of his cinematic vision, to the actors who all give performances of a lifetime. Everybody is perfectly cast (yes, even John Goodman, who is only in the movie for a short period). In fact, it would be very difficult find better lead actors in 2011 than Dujardin, who is polarizing as the once prolific Valentin, and Bejo who is phenomenal as the strong rising star/love interest Peppy Miller. Both show off their strong acting skills as they play necessarily overdramatized and flawed characters, without resorting to campiness. Furthermore, if there was a best supporting animal performance, the dog in ""The Artist"" would be sure to win. And if the dog is worthy of an award, shouldn't that be the truest sign of a great ensemble cast? Final Thought: Please don't disregard ""The Artist"" just because you heard that it is a silent film. This film breaks down every generational or genre barrier known to man. This is a comedy with genuine laughs, a tragedy with genuine tears and a drama that is a monumental achievement in modem cinema.

"howard.schumann","9","1","1","22 December 2011"," captures A time of simplicity when movies reflected creativity and imagination
","French director Michel Hazanavicius' surprise hit The Artist is a charming recreation of the silent film era of the late 1920s that focuses on how the advent of talking pictures spelled the end of careers for those silent film stars who could not or would not make the transition. Shot in color, then transferred to black and white, the film's combination of form and style captures a time of simplicity in which movies reflected creativity and imagination as much as their ability to make money. The film introduces the wonderful French actor Jean Dujardin to Western audiences and he is irresistible with his broad smile, thin mustache, and snappy dance steps that suggest Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.<br/><br/>The artist in question is George Valentin (Dujardin), a silent screen star who downplays the advent of talkies to his gruff producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman), calling it a passing phase. George still has thousands of loyal fans who swarm around him at every opportunity and lives a life of comfort with a huge house in Hollywood, a lovely wife, and a loyal dog. All of these comforts are threatened, however, when George meets Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), a dark-haired beauty who is a talented dancer and actress with potential star power.<br/><br/>Valentin begins a flirtation with her and, much to the chagrin of George's wife Doris (Penelope Anne Miller), they are photographed together in Variety magazine, an incident that reminds Doris of how unhappy she is with George and eventually leads to the breakup of their marriage. George is called yesterday's man by his producer and, as Peppy starts to climb the ladder to success, George's star recedes, but he does not give up easily. Refusing to participate in talking films, he leaves Zimmer and sets up his own company to produce a silent adventure film but it bombs at the box office while people line up to see Peppy in her debut films.<br/><br/>As a result of George's reluctance to act in talkies and the stock market crash of 1929, he loses his loyal driver Clifton (James Cromwell) and falls into bankruptcy and flirts with alcoholism. One member of the family always by George's side, however, is his loyal dog, a loving companion whose swift-footed action saves his life when he is trapped inside a burning house. Peppy remains his friend and looks after George when he is injured in the fire and brings him to her house to convalesce. Though she admittedly used him to get her break in the industry, Peppy sincerely wants to have George get back into acting and offers him a script reluctantly approved by Zimmer, but he demurs.<br/><br/>Before despair takes further hold, however, the film takes you where you would least expect to go and surprise follows surprise. An homage to the comedies and musicals of the silent era, The Artist is a film that bursts with enthusiasm and life. Though it may be lightweight (some have even called it ""fluff""), it can nonetheless break new ground if it can serve as a reminder, not only of what we have lost in our films with their increasing subservience to technology and corporate greed but, more importantly, of what has gone missing from the quality of our lives."
"Dr_Coulardeau","Null","5","12","29 October 2011"," Courage and change
","The film is very well done and that was the main point here: to make a silent movie in 2011 was a real challenge. And yes a silent movie today can still be possible even if the antics of the old silent films are no longer possible. The film chose the 1927-1932 period in Hollywood when the cinema moved from silent movies to talkies. Hence it was natural to give us a completely silent universe, though entirely musical.<br/><br/>Yet the film seems to be thought slightly differently. All the actors spoke though silently but their lip movements must have been perfectly calculated since today quite a few people do read lips, and not only deaf people, just people who like the cinema and TV series. After all they all followed the advice of Ronald Reagan: ""Read my lips!"" But the film is fascinating because it considers a change in society and in the film industry that could have meant the end of it, its death and that meant nevertheless the death of a whole generation of actors and technicians, the death of a whole medium, the silent film. And when an industry or an industrial branch dies there are casualties along the way because some people cannot follow, cannot recycle themselves and they have to get out of the way since the show must go on.<br/><br/>The trick used here is that the main silent film star is going to find a new dimension by using one of his talents that is visual more than linguistic, dancing. We can think of some actors who actually did that in that period. We all think of Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers or even Gene Kelly. But others like Charlie Chaplin went through always by using the visual side of the cinema at least as much as the talking side of the new talkies. And they discovered then that language in a very visual treatment of a theme can become a multiplying factor that energized and strengthened the film.<br/><br/>By centering the film here on a couple of actor and actress, the actor a famous silent film star and the actress an upstart cinema dancer who can have a big career because she can speak in front of the camera, their relationship and their drama that could have been a tragedy, it makes the change a lot more human than it is in textbooks.<br/><br/>The trick of this film though is the use of a dog as a full actor who just needs to speak to be human, but that dog is a central character in the plot. That shows how a film can revolve on a voiceless, speechless character who can be crucial though unable to say a word. We accept it from a dog, but we have some difficulty accepting it from a man. The novelty of some technical improvement becomes a fad at once and no one can stop or reverse that evolution.<br/><br/>The modern world where a major invention happens always faster and today in a few years, pretty soon in a few months, is a cruel world for human beings who are not flexible and adaptable enough to change along with the world. But be sure of one thing: the world will go on changing and always faster. So maybe we should set the emphasis in our societies on that necessity to be flexible; adaptable and to accept change as natural and not as a disturbance. This is all the more difficult in a society where pensioners and senior citizens become more and more important in proportion, though some of them might be more flexible than some young wolves of upstart economy or upstart politics.<br/><br/>That film is a great lesson in courage in front of change and crisis at critical times in the life of humanity, and today is such a critical time.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"ajhclarke","3","7","19","13 February 2012"," Minor exercise in nostalgia -- but how it drags
","Take 'A Star is Born', throw in a bit of 'Singin in the Rain' and a touch too of 'Sunset Boulevard'. Keep all the clichés and throw out any real plot development, and you have this fairly flat soufflé which just refuses to rise. It's supposed to be an homage to silent movies but is way short of the best of that genre. It could have been worthwhile if the script had contained either more wit or more real emotion .. in this one, everyone seems just to be going through the motions, though I must confess that the star, Jean Dujardin, does his best with the lame material. An Oscar chance? It shows how far cinema has regressed almost 85 years after the introduction of the talkies!"
"samuellickiss","10","4","9","28 December 2018"," A simple, charming film that deserves the praise it gets
","I would love to see a transcript of the pitch meeting for The Artist. A silent film, you say? Why? We have digital cameras and CGI and 3D and this and that nowadays. Why would you want to downgrade the technology?<br/><br/>The thing is, people were entertained by silent films in the 1920s. Children today are still entertained by films from the early era of colour like The Wizard of Oz and Snow White. Star Wars is forty years old and still entertaining. It's A Wonderful Life remains a Christmas staple.<br/><br/>Good stories are good stories irrespective of the technology used. Good film-making will always be god film-making. We rightly praise the special effects-heavy blockbusters like Star Wars for being visual spectacles, but silent films like Metropolis have effects and visuals that hold up today: George Lucas was not alone in borrowing plenty of imagery from Fritz Lang's masterpiece.<br/><br/>So now The Artist. A modern silent film. It's unashamedly a homage to film history. While it shuns dialogue, it has been updated for modern tastes with panning camera shots and tracking shots (things rare in true classic silent films), relatively short scenes and plenty of title cards. It's edited largely like a modern film to keep the pacing and conventions that we are used to.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: a egotistical silent film star falls on hard times as the talkies become popular while a young actress rises in fame. If that sounds like Singing in the Rain then you're right: it is. There's nothing to 'get' about The Artist. It's a simple, undemanding plot. It's not pretentious.<br/><br/>There's nothing really not to like here. The acting is superb, featuring the talents of John Goodman, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, among others. The casting is perfect: you can fully believe that these are people fresh from the 1920s. The film is beautifully directed and nicely paced. The soundtrack is wonderful: a nice combination of a original score by Ludovic Bource and period pieces. The set design demonstrates a real attention to detail (and while a few anachronisms a present, unless you're an expert or overly pedantic you won't notice).<br/><br/>Silent films are pure pieces of film-making. 'Film' ultimately consists of a string of still photographs produced by the interaction between light and chemicals contained on, y'know, camera film. This is what it is: moving images - movies. The audio came later. Being able to appreciate silent cinema is being able to appreciate the most pure form of film.<br/><br/>It's widely noted that nowadays people's concentration spans are shorter. Classic silent films are often extremely long with long drawn-out shots where relatively little happens, something modern films would edit out or replace with a throwaway line in a few seconds. The Artist does dispense with a lot of this to cater to modern tastes, but even so, a lot of modern viewers will be urging the film to get a move on.<br/><br/>To those people I say: calm down and take the opportunity to fully watch the film. Look at the actors' gestures and expressions, note what's going on in the background and just enjoy the music accompanying the visuals. You can't do this in most modern films - they just move too quickly. People enjoyed these films a hundred years ago and there's no reason we can't enjoy them now."

George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and will eventually set his oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) it seems he sky's the limit, major movie stardom awaits for her.

","I first saw The Artist back when it came out in 2011. I was only 9 then but was still able to enjoy the visuals and how it's a silent film that was made in the 21st century. But after seeing it 7 years later I was very pleased by how good it came out to be. I did not realize that it was about the transition from silent films to ""talkies"", and how it affects silent film stars. This film also has a lot of connections to other films, in specific Sunset Boulevard, which also deals with the transition from silent films to talkies. The performances in the movie are all full of heart and soul and are very believable, especially Jean Dujardin who plays as the lead character. It's very sad to see the two main actors in this movie to not be in big movies that come out today, but that happens. I just want to recognize the performance by the dog Uggie who plays as the main character's dog, it's one of the best animal performances I've ever seen. But what this has going for it is how it is going to age in the future."
"Unbilled_Role","6","4","9","28 February 2012"," Crafted to Please the Masses -- Failed to Steal My Heart
","The Artist was not nearly as bad or ""boring"" as certain IMDb viewers have reported, with their paltry 1-star ratings. Having said that, this movie leaned too heavily on the easy tricks that convince an audience to swoon. Bound up in its reliance on romanticism, the core plot was traditional and safe. And the adorable mutt (Uggie) who always seems to save the day (with his cuteness) helped to boost the likability factor.<br/><br/>What can I say? It's the feel good movie of the year. But this does not a great film make. The Academy members recently elevated it to their top Oscar choice. Their vote was unsurprising, but disappointing.<br/><br/>Regarding the charming actor Dujardin, whose eyebrows do little dances all their own, I would like to see more of him--in another context. The natural grace and talent of Bejo were lovely, but she and Dujardin did more than their fair share of hamming it up for the camera. <br/><br/>Whenever actors try too hard to please the audience, a part of me shrivels up inside. But the actors cannot bear total responsibility for this. It's the producers and the director who issued this shallow interpretation. At times, it felt like some vaudevillian beast had taken over the stage, and the vibe was trying too ""vamn"" hard.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The film was pleasant enough. I suppose I'm glad it inspired many people. But, I was not so easily convinced. After witnessing the likes of Master Chaplin, I'm afraid that many others will pale in comparison."
"tbmforclasstsar","10","4","9","27 February 2012"," a charming homage to silent cinema that won't get lost in the noise of modern movies
","For years, silent film seemed all too much like a distant memory. Talkies are a thing of the now, see? After seeing one film this award season that gave homage to the films of George Melies and other early silent films (""Hugo"" for those that haven't heard), I was blown away once more by a film that is a tribute to our early cinema.<br/><br/>Filmed in black and white without audible dialog and set in the late 1920's and early 30's, ""The Artist"" is a charming film that gives tribute and careful reverence to films that placed the stepping stones for the films we see today.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, ""The Artist"" is a clever and well thought out period piece that fits romance, comedy, drama, and art all into a historical tribute that is nothing short of breathtaking. The film follows silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), his relationship with a young actress named Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), and his fall from fame with the revolution of talking films. Struggling to make films combined with the stock market crash, George's life falls apart, while Peppy becomes the talk of the town.<br/><br/>The relationship between George and Peppy is truly a romance that can only be compared to those of the films of old. Hazanavicius is careful in his story construction and character development, never pushing the romance to sappy levels and always keeping the speed of the film at a light and slow pace. Carefully developing these two makes for a brilliant relationship that the audience strives to work, but understands when it doesn't always pan out. Pride, fame, and misfortune all take their toll on both characters and the struggles they find are similar to many classic silent films. The slow and careful pacing reminds me of the relationship between George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor in Murnau's ""Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans.""<br/><br/>The brilliance of the story also comes from the acknowledgement that this is an homage and not an original silent picture. Signs that read ""Silent"" on them, actions that have distinct sounds we would expect to hear missing (i.e. whistling or car horns), and elongated pauses that add to the effect of the missing sound all add to the tribute and respect being shown. Displaying that an entertaining film can still be made with no sound and black and white images reminds us how great some classic films are and the magic that can be made from the simplest of cinema.<br/><br/>Hazanavicius also chooses a fantastic time for the film to be set in. At the years during the transition of silent film to talking film, it is clever and interesting to watch the changes of the silent film we are watching going to a story about talking film. Where a film like ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a colored talking film that tells both the silent and talkie parts of the film with vivid colors and audible sound, ""The Artist"" is the exact opposite. As George laughs at a test screening for talkie film, we don't know if he is humored by the concept or if the actress just sounds bad (i.e. ""I Can't Stand 'Em"" in 'Singin' in the Rain').<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that this is a silent film means there is a lot of dependence on the score of the piece. The original music created by Ludovic Bource is both perfect for the film, as well as a fascinating look at the effect of music in film. I am personally a huge fan of film scores and the effect music has on a film, and it can be shown even more in a silent piece. If you were to cut pieces of this film out and show it to someone as a series of vignettes, they could immediately understand the atmosphere of the scene by Bource's score. Not to mention, the film also uses Bernard Herrmann's ""Love Scene"" piece from 'Vertigo' (a personal favorite) and this film hit the music right on the money. Beautiful imagery combined with moving scores always spells brilliance in my book.<br/><br/>The film also has an incredible series of settings, most notably large scale sets and streets that were clearly constructed to authenticate a film that is supposed to be made in the early 1930's. There is a scene on a stairway that is shot several times from a deep distance that shows the stairs extending more than three stories. This set has the exact look of sets that would have been constructed and seen in silent films of old. Outside of the images, there are also quiet sounds of a needle first hitting a spinning record before music plays that adds the nicest touch. These small details that are carefully placed within the film are never overpowering, but always a neat little reflection on older films.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" also contains two of the most fun things seen in film this year. First, there is the most adorable dog that steals several scenes throughout the film. If you can't laugh or find something cute out of this character, you may not have a heart. Also, the film contains maybe the most clever dream sequence I have seen....<br/><br/>Read the rest of the Review at CustodianFilmCritic.com"

","It is a great film. I think the director absolutely deserves the Oscar. All other factors are surely important when it comes to movies, but especially, The Artist makes me believe that editing takes a really huge part in movies.. I don't know about editing because i have never studied, but here's some points I liked about the editing of The Artist. When Geroge dreams about him getting start to hear everything beside his voice, I was just stunned while watching it. I could feel almost everything at once. his feelings, his fear, and even about the era when the silent film days were replaced. It was amazing to see how the movie describes the era and history. Furthermore, i was also impressed when George met Peppy at the company and walked down the stairs while Peppy went to the opposite side. The entire set of stairs and people ascending and descending looks like the life of people to me. George went down the stairs among a lot of people as if he walked out with the past. The scene was so great.<br/><br/>I want to say you should watch this film. it is so heart warming and moved. It helps to take a rest a little bit for people who are tired of visually splendid and wordy things. The silence of this film is filled with audiences' laugh, sigh, and others, just like the audiences did within the film. I think it is needed to hear the real story and heart of films instead of technical effects for a while."

","As silent film matinée idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin - Think Doug Fairbanks/Rudolph Valentino but portrayed by an actor who looks more like a combination Gene Kelly & Gilbert Roland) fades into obscurity following the advent or ""talkies"" (motion pictures with sound) his discovery Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) skyrockets to the top of Hollywood. Going in opposite directions in Dream City they each often reflect on how much fun they had working together.<br/><br/>She remains on top while he wallows in alcoholic misery. Run off the studio lot and forced out of his mansion after a one-sided divorce only his manservant and his adorable little dog stick by him. Out of pride he refuses to accept Peppy's help feeling stung that his old friend might pity him. Only after she conceives of a way that they can share glory on equal terms does he aquiesce resulting in a partnership which presumably makes them both bigger stars than ever.<br/><br/>No one has any excuse for not seeing this movie beyond simply not wanting to. Screening copies have sent out and leaked all over the internet like a carpet-bombing in what some may interpret as evidence of a brazen (yet sly and effective) attempt by its makers to influence Academy Award voters or conveniently misplaced copies that magically found their way into the hands of bootleggers.<br/><br/>The viewer can interpret the narrative of 'The Artist' in their own way. The most optimistic and politically correct way is in suggesting that people should put aside their differences and pride to share the spotlight i.e. power. Specifically as it relates to gender equity if you go by the casting equation. To me that Utopian Socialist gender relations interpretation distracts from the real message of the film.<br/><br/>The most cynical way to look at it would probably be my own personal view which is that I think it is essentially saying movie stars should stick up for each other more in order to have greater control over their productions without putting up the cash-risk that producers do. Gender doesn't come into it and neither, evidently do others involved prominently in film production.<br/><br/>If you look at it that way you can see why Academy Award voters (a voting block heavily influenced by the Screen Actors Guild) might embrace this title as that has been the message implicit in their voting for awards going back to the late 1970s.<br/><br/>We aren't talking about a Hollywood run by directors, screenwriters, cinematographers et cetera even though each has as much if not more right to refer to themselves as artists. We are talking about a Hollywood run by actors - a group often more concerned about sending political messages with their work when they aren't catering to other aspects of their own vanity.<br/><br/>As for the production value I have nothing nothing but raves and could gush over every single frame in this immaculately photographed movie. Black & white cinematography has never been equalled in the artistic precision with which it presents the photographed on the big screen though the 1970s colour palate is close as colour has gotten to it.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin as Valentin is the main beneficiary of this production with his star-making turn and may have a long Hollywood career ahead of him playing dapper villains since Tinseltown has few other kinds of roles for foreign actors pushing 40.<br/><br/>Other than that the makers can take their pretentious theme, self-serving message (The director is a former actor and is married to Bejo) and condescending attitude and shove them you know where."
"come2whereimfrom","9","4","9","27 November 2011"," Simply brilliant!
","I can honestly say that I haven't enjoyed a film as much as I did 'The Artist' in a long time; from start to finish this movie is absolutely superb. From the attention to detail in recreating the era of silent movies (it's black and white and even presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio) to the mesmerising acting, it is a loving homage that can't fail to entertain and charm. Dujardin, in a surely Oscar winning performance, is George Valentin a silent movie actor, who along with his dog (another scene stealing performance) is a big star, so what could possibly go wrong? Well the invention of the talkies and its rising starlet Peppy Miller (Bejo). Not only does George have a hand in the discovery of Peppy but he also falls madly in love with her. As her ascension continues Georges fame wanes and after a failed attempt to hold onto the old ways he admits defeat and becomes washed up, an outdated relic in a medium that's embracing the future. With amazing cinematography from Guillaume Schiffman it's a joy to watch as it recreates perfectly the films and feel of the time and while cleverly presenting a traditional love story it is both gripping and fascinating to watch. The music also goes a long way to help give it the desired effect as, apart from two scenes with sound, that is all you hear. In an age where we talk about the death of cinema and gimmicks like 3D are trying to woo audiences it's just so refreshing to see something that not only has a story but lacks the CGI that Hollywood so readily relies on. It was apparently the directors dream project and it shows but it was also clearly a labour of love for everyone involved making 'The Artist' simply one of the best films you'll see all year."

But this movie left me literally speechless. The way it is made!! Michel Hazanavicius made a fantastic job playing with the sound effects, and I particularly enjoyed the dream part, one of the only two scenes where you can actually hear sounds and voices. I found some of the shots extremely genius; especially the one where Valentin (Jean Dujardin) reflects himself on the table and then pour on it the glass of alcohol, as a sign of his desperation for himself.
The scene were Valentin was about to shoot himself with the gun meanwhile Peppy was running on a car to rescue him, left me amazed; you saw a ""Bang!"" written on the screen and you couldn't help to feel worried that the protagonist might have killed himself.
I loved the acting of the two main protagonists, the facial expressions, the way their bodies moved, it all reminded me of a real old movie.
At first I was skeptical, because I wasn't used to silent movies, and I thought that words were too much important in our society to be given up.

I like the different and creative camera perspectives of the film and the film team inserts the scenes where we have sound in the movie very good. Because it is a silent movie I find the way how the film team expresses the feelings of the characters very creative and I find it cool that, when a character talks in The Artist, the team didn't use every time text, but sometimes we can see through the actions of the characters, what they said before.

","No, they are not. All though movies with sound are great, there are still some silent movies that are a must-watch. This is one of them. I am generally not a big fan of silent movies, but I had no problem enjoying this masterpiece.
I love how Michel Hazanavicius plays with the sound, while the movie is still remaining a silent film most of the time. Another thing, that makes this film so great, is how he plays with different camera angles. He, for example, often tilts the camera a little bit to express the emotion of the protagonist. That makes the film so much better to watch.
Also, I know it's sometimes really hard to implement an animal in a film, especially if you want to put it in one of the main roles. Michel Hazanavicius however, does a perfect job with that. The dog of the protagonist George Valentin is one of the best animal-actors I have ever seen.

","Advancing age and retreating inhibitions have made me liable to cry at the movies and honestly, sometimes a tad more than I would like. But The Artist is one of those 'once in a blue moon' movies that leave you with tears of joy streaming down your cheek. An exquisitely judged, gloriously funny and achingly tender film by the French director Michel Hazanavicius, The Artist is a flawless pearl. The debonair comedy and pastiche are worn with airy lightness; the romance is gentle and yet unexpectedly passionate. <br/><br/>There have been 'accusations' that The Artist is an homage, splendid still, to the silent era. But I feel that it is so much more; no, to paraphrase, I believe it is much, much less and calling it an homage is an over-complication and an insult to its simplistic charm. The Artist ,despite all the appearances, is at its heart an utterly beguiling love story and a miracle of entertainment. And this (glorified, if I may say so) paradigm shift that ushered in the talkies serves as a mere subplot, whose only major relevance strikes up from the ramifications on the initially playful romance that is shared by George Valentin and Peppy Miller. However, The Artist, in its own insouciant way, also touches on the debate whether the magic of the celluloid was purer in silence. <br/><br/>The leads, both Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are pitch perfect(if such a term may be associated with silent cinema) in their roles as the embodiments of the two 'clashing' ages in the history of cinema.Valentin, and by extension Dujardin, is every inch the silent-movie icon: his hair slick, his eyebrows meticulous, his moustache finely traced and his jawline a perfect trapezium. Bérénice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so ""old"" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived of what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. <br/><br/>The cinematography of this movie is an art on its own. It is a treat to the eyes. The Artist is itself a silent movie and like its age- old predecessors, it expresses more than a million words could say. Rather than being a celebration of color and sound, it is, in small ways, a eulogy for monochrome and silence.<br/><br/>It will, in our age of mindless action, 3D blockbusters and multi- million-dollar budgets, remind film-makers and audiences of the many wonderful qualities cinema has largely lost: elegance, beauty and heartfelt emotion.<br/><br/>Drained of colour and sounds, The Artist might just be moving pictures, but they seldom make pictures as moving as this one. <br/><br/>The only flaw is that the entire movie felt a bit abrupt, perhaps a characteristic of the silent era itself, I felt that somehow the movie rushed through to the end. <br/><br/>Truly a masterpiece."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","3","6","9 April 2014"," Silence speaks volumes
","""The Artist"" is a movie about which you could honestly say, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore"". In an age of CGI-enhanced blockbusters, it's almost unfathomable that a silent picture would be greenlit at all. The fact that it wound up garnering five (well deserved) Oscars likely surpassed even the filmmakers' wildest dreams.<br/><br/>At once both timeless and contemporary, ""The Artist"" is a treasure for movie lovers. Although the plot borrows liberally from ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""A Star is Born"", the story is nevertheless highly engrossing. Comedy and drama are expertly mixed to create an affecting love story replete with the feel of good old Hollywood entertainment.<br/><br/>In the film, silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) finds himself left behind by the advent of talking pictures while spunky newcomer Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) watches her career take off. Although they share a common bond, George's stubborn pride seems destined to keep them apart.<br/><br/>The leads are fantastic, especially Dujardin, who found himself rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts. His effortless charm evokes memories of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Bejo, meanwhile, contributes a sterling performance of her own. In supporting roles, there's notable work from John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle and, particularly, James Cromwell as George's steadfastly loyal chauffeur. And let's not forget Uggie, the dog (seriously).<br/><br/>In terms of filmmaking craft, the movie is exceptional. The Oscar-winning direction of Michel Hazanavicius is continually playful and inventive. Being a silent film, the score is especially important, and composer Ludovic Bource did not disappoint. His Oscar-winning score is one of the movie's strong points. Another Oscar was awarded for the period costume design, while the cinematography, editing & art direction were all recognized with nominations.<br/><br/>Taken altogether, the movie excels both as art and entertainment. While I feel that the combination of comedy and drama may not be quite as finely balanced as it could be, that is a minor point in the scheme of things. ""The Artist"" is a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner and well worth anyone's time, regardless of their feelings about silent movies."

","I don't know if it's fair to compare this film against the ones from the pre-1929 'silent era', but I really can't think of any that might be better than this one with the exception of Chaplin's ""City Lights"". This was an excellent homage to those silent screen days while offering a competent history lesson on the transition that left one set of actors behind and propelled another toward stardom. For a couple of actors I'd never heard of, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo were outstanding in their roles, with a chemistry that transcended the difference in their characters' ages. Though it did surprise me to learn that in real life Dujardin is a mere four years older than his co-star. This picture managed to take on a couple of modern day filming taboos by going for black and white as well as attempting to tell a story without sound. Fans of cinema are the real winners here as this is a wonderful story told wonderfully, so don't let those pre-conceived barriers hold you back from seeing this picture."
"Andy-296","9","3","6","5 January 2014"," Warm, entertaining homage to silent cinema
","This French made homage to silent movies is a bit of a gimmick, being a silent movie itself, but is extremely well made. It would be easy to dismiss it as an amusing stunt, but director Michel Hazanavicius's hand is so sure and his actors so engaging that the movie deservedly won an Oscar for best picture. We are in 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the artist of the title, is a leading man of the silent cinema who is about to hit it tough when talking movies arrive. Bérénice Bejo (an Argentine born actress who is married to Hazanavicius in real life) is the perky, spunky Peppy, an irresistible starlet who rises to fame at the same time that Valentin falls. Also costarring are John Goodman as a Hollywood mogul and James Cromwell as George Valentin's butler (they are all very fine). The authentic Los Angeles locations, the reconstruction of the 1920s and the extraordinary photography help a lot. My only complaint, is that the happy ending seems quite weak, a bit of a concession to the public, given what went on before, though, of course, a sad ending would probably be even more disappointing."

The music playing through the whole book at most time is sometimes light with beauty and is sometimes sad. It becomes the thing to the feelings of the character and draws us into the world of the story more. In addition, to the contrary some scenes are silence on purpose, it attracts a glance and do it in the impressive scene.<br/><br/>The second is an expression of the actors. Because the works is silent films, there are not the lines. Therefore the personality of characters becomes clear, and the expression is rich. The feelings of two people of the leading role in particular are plain.<br/><br/>This movie does not depend on lines.

The black-and-white presentation takes you to a past time but the movie retains a vivacity that is lost with the films of the silent film era. Know what I mean? Watching a silent film from back in the day is always like watching home movies of your dead relatives. Not so with The Artist. It is very much alive, thanks to the standout work of Dujardin, Bejo, Cromwell, Goodman, and Uggie. Bejo especially adds infectious vitality to her role. Dujardin is also quite likable. Cromwell is a sentimental and loyal manservant. Goodman uses his talent at facial expressions to great effect. Uggie? Who wouldn't want a dog like him? He is a role model for canines everywhere. This film is unique. Imitators will likely fail,but The Artist is a winner."

","This movie is a gem. Bravo to the French, their movie industry is alive and kicking, and French people actually go and watch French films, not only US blockbusters with lots of CGI and special effects. I'm not French, but I like the guts of men like the producer and director of ""The Artist"" to embark on the adventure of making a silent b&w movie in these 3D times... Of course, with a lead actor as versatile as Jean Dujardin, they couldn't go wrong. That guy began as a stand-up comedian, went on to star in a very successful sitcom, then created a hilariously funny character called ""Brice de Nice"", a parody of a wannabe ""surfer"" beachboy with bleached hair (no way you can surf in the calm bay of Nice...). Director Hasanavicius, co-star Berenice Bejo and Dujardin then teamed up for the first time in two funny and anarchic spy spoofs, ""OSS 117"". And now this global success for the Artist - I'm sure neither director, producer nor stars would ever have dreamt to scoop up ALL the great movie awards. But they did, and rightly so. And in the midst of all this hype, they remain nice and modest. I was amazed (and happy) that the Academy in Hollywood recognized the quality of this film - just such a pity that on the message board, there's so much anti-French venom. Chacun à son gout, but one should leave politics (and nationalism) alone and just lean back and enjoy a charming peace of good entertainment."

","I always worry when I go to movie that has received a lot of hype. I'm afraid that I will be disappointed but that certainly wasn't the case with ""The Artist"".<br/><br/>How can a black & white silent movie work in this day and age? Perhaps it is because the most important thing in any movie is the story and the characters. In ""The Artist"" both of these draw the viewer in so much that the lack of dialogue is irrelevant.<br/><br/>The acting, especially that of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, also helps to sweep the viewer along in the simple tale of the contrasting fortunes of the silent movie star and the young starlet at the start of the talkies era in Hollywood. The scene where Bejo pretends to dance with her idols jacket is surely destined to become one of the all time great movie scenes. Dujardin brilliantly portrays the voyage from cocky superstar to has-been.<br/><br/>The score in a silent movie is vital and it succeeds brilliantly in setting the mood of each scene.<br/><br/>You can argue, and indeed you would be correct, that the lack of dialogue is a gimmick. If the same director and cast decided to make another silent movie it probably wouldn't work. However with this story it does work and it has resulted in the creation of a treat for movie fans."
"artalmarcelo","9","3","6","20 February 2012"," When Old Fashion is also refreshing
","The Artist isn't an homage to old movies, as you may read or hear around. The Artist is considerably more than that, and it's brand new. The Artist is creativity in its maximum expression, going all the way through from screen writing, directing and acting, since the very first minute to the last. The script is really fantastic and the director's vision of how to put that script down to images is even better. In a movie where there are no dialogs, every scene is crucial, and the director seems to understand that. Emotions are so well transmitted through the screen to the audience, that it really makes us think if dialog is fundamental in movie making. Well, the answer is no, when the execution is so perfect, but this is top notch movie making and especially top notch acting, which is probably the main feature of the whole film. The actors in this movie are so expressive that they don't need to talk to make you understand. You'll understand by only watching. You will laugh and you will cry, but more than anything, you'll probably love this movie, just as much as I did."

The lead actor is really really exceptional, his suave face and charisma is so fitting for the 1920's and he has an extremely handsome face to match, Berenice Bejo is just darling as it girl Peppy Miller, both actors are so extremely well cast that it just wouldn't have worked with anyone but them, and the supporting cast do well in their roles, in particular Missi Pyle.<br/><br/>I am a fan of silent films so I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to watching a silent film but even non enthusiasts would be charmed by this lovely film. Also worth mentioning is the scene stealer, the dog, hands down the greatest animal in film ever. This film is very funny, from the get go I was smiling and was charmed off my socks. The production is perfect, everything is recreated exactly the way it would have been back in the flapper days, the music, the costuming, everything is perfection.<br/><br/>After seeing The Artist it gives me faith that films like Return To Babylon could finally get released, how great it would be to see that film on a big screen, so hopefully with the success of this it may finally after so many years get a release.<br/><br/>Just watch and enjoy, you'd have to be a serious grump if you couldn't just go with it.

","The Artist has been an awards favorite for some time. It's a silent film in the way of 1920's cinema, so what's there not to like about it? It's a very simple film, but all the more glorious because of it.<br/><br/>The film is essentially about a silent film star who starts fading into oblivion when the ""talkies"" start taking over. On the other end, he forms a friendship with an upbeat and cheerful Hollywood-hopeful, who starts becoming the new big thing. Even though the film has been critically praised, I've heard some criticisms about this film. I've heard some critics call it too light, too simple to be anything incredible or meaningful. Some even call this a gimmick in some sort. I had some reservations because of that, but I couldn't disagree more. The film may have a simple plot with a simple arc, but it's directed with incredible energy and talent. I never once looked away, and no other film this year has made me as happy or had me smiling as much as this. It's not just because of how happy it is, but it's such an amazing technical achievement. The art direction is fantastic, and the cinematography even experimental at times. The music is amazing, and it had me grasped in it's ever-changing tone and melody. <br/><br/>The entire supporting cast is great, but it's the two lead characters who hold our attention. Bejo is charming and quite loving, but the real star here is Jean Dujardin. He commands the screen with his changing facial expressions and the pitch in which he performs. I haven't seen someone as charismatic in a very long time, and he has delivered what is the best male performance of the year. <br/><br/>Believe the hype. I sort of expect some sort of inevitable backlash by some people for a film like this winning major awards, but it is quite simply, one of the best of the year. This is why we go to the movies!"

Before his fall, he'd befriended the ingénue Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) who goes on to become a movie star; she rescues George, his career, his dog, & his chauffeur (+ more).<br/><br/>WOW!!!

","If you've heard anything about this movie, which won a Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes film festival for Best Actor, it's probably the fact that it's silent. As in no dialogue. As in WTF? This may explain why its screening on a Sunday morning in Cannes failed to fill the house. Apart from Mel Brooks' gimmicky ""Silent Movie"" in 1976 , isn't there a good reason we haven't had a silent feature film in almost 100 years? We don't generally revert back to obsolete technology; no one longs for the good old days of 8 track tapes, right?<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't all that excited about going to see a silent movie. Had it not been for the facts that it starred Jean Dujardin, was the opening night film for the festival, and being a French movie, I would not have rushed to see it. It's a good thing there were greater forces at work because this movie is wonderful! And I urge you to see it opening weekend, in a large, full theater. This movie is best seen collectively; it's the closest we may ever come to experiencing what it may have been like to see a movie when movies were new.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin plays silent film star George Valentin (the name perhaps a wink to silent screen star Rudolph Valentino?). Dujardin's theatrical experience gives him the chops to carry this film without uttering more than one word. He brings the same David Niven-like sophistication he brought to the OSS films he also did with director Michel Hazanavicius without the boorish-oaf element. (I loved those movies and highly recommend them: ""OSS: Cairo, Nest of Spies,"" 2007 and ""OSS: Lost in Rio,"" 2009.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his performance is weakened because it is difficult to read his lips; this contrast becomes apparent when John Goodman appears on screen. We don't need to wait to read the dialogue card to know what his character is saying. Bérénice Bejo, (another English-is-not-their- first-language actor) who plays Valentin's protégée, Peppy Miller, has the same liability to a lesser degree. However, this issue will not, should not be cause for interference. (I just wanted to give you a heads-up.)<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into much detail about the plot; the preview I've linked to hints that it concerns a silent screen star's issue with the transition to ""talkies."" Let me just encourage you to take note of one of the most beautiful shots I've seen in a movie all year: George is standing on a stair landing at the Kinograph studios; the frame encompasses three stories, he is the only still being in a hive of activity. In a film in which the story is told by everything but words, it is a sublime moment.<br/><br/>1920s Hollywood is recreated with ""Mad Men""-like attention to detail minus the wink to the present day. It's great to see a little less of John Goodman so we can enjoy his performance rather than worry about his health. Other than my previous criticism, there is not a false note, nor wasted moment in this entire movie.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie begs for the creation of a new category at the Academy Awards: Best Performance by a non-CGI-created animal: Uggie the dog would be a shoo-in."

What can you say about that dog? Or those dogs (there were three of them)? They are the canine equivalent of Jackie Coogan. Bejo, Goodman, Cromwell and Miller were so expressive.

","After watching ""The Artist"" for 1 hour I walked out of the theater. I was so bored and irritated that I preferred to stretch my legs in fresh air. Here are the reasons I have given this movie a rating of 3 out of 10: <br/><br/>(1) Visually, the movie is grainy and blurry. There was no need to subject the audience to such awful cinematography. The fact that the movie is in black & white is not an excuse to avoid employing modern techniques. Since the movie is without color, I had expected the director to compensate by making the movie visually striking. After all, black & white can be used to tremendous effect. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. Scenes, lighting, props, etc. are visually uninteresting.<br/><br/>(2) The movie insults the intelligence of a modern audience. It's insulting because it beats us over the head with one single message -- that the silent film actor is on his way out. We are presented with scene after scene that re-reminds us of this fact. I left the theater after the scene in which people are walking on top of photos of the main actor's face (on a flyer for his failed movie). OK, we got that message 30 minutes earlier. Isn't there anything else?<br/><br/>(3) The movie has minimal plot. Yes, the silent film actor is on his way out. We get that, but that is all that this movie presents to us in the first hour. <br/><br/>(4) When compared to the good silent films of the 1920s, this film comes up sorely lacking. It has none of the thrilling scenes, dramatic acting, comedy, etc. of those films (at least for the first hour)<br/><br/>(5) It is ironic that the movie is (in a very shallow way) about how talkies replaced silent films and here we are, stuck watching a boring silent film! It is also ironic that the only interesting scene is the one in which some sound is introduced.<br/><br/>(6) The music sound track is also very boring and unimaginative. <br/><br/>(7) I think it is fine to have grainy, blurry visuals, and bad acting when the movie is depicting scenes that are being filmed by the film company of that era. But when a scene shifts to something happening to the main character off-stage, then we should not be treated to the same blurry cinematography and bad acting.<br/><br/>Once I realized that I was horribly bored and that my intelligence was being insulted, and that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters (and, except for the main character, the others are all one-dimensional) then I knew I had to leave the theater. <br/><br/>What amazes me is that this movie is getting such high ratings."

","""The Artist"" is more of a novelty than a film. The fact that it is silent didn't bother me as much as the predictable story, hammy acting, and 16mm square format film. It's not a bad film but I didn't feel it was worth all the rave reviews and I certainly don't feel it should be a contender for Best Picture.<br/><br/>The story is very predictable. I always felt I was 2 steps ahead of the script and I was bored for much of the film. I wish the cinematography had been a little fancier to offset the lack of sound. It didn't look like it was shot in real black and white. It looked like it was shot in color and transferred to black and white which gives it a muddy look. The music was pretty good. My favorite character was the dog.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good silent film, my favorites are ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" and ""City Lights.""

","I am spending a lot of recent time with my list of essential films, reviewing and enhancing it. Several readers have suggested this film for that list.<br/><br/>It has several characteristics that appeal. It is a movie about movies. It is made with movie-making explicit: the thing is black and white, silent, uses lenses and positions from the era (mostly). That era was before Hitchcock and Welles, so the camera has no curiosity. The sets include some that while they depict 'real' life, are clearly stage sets. The acting early in the film, in both the film itself and films within are exaggerated. This and some other effects add up to highly selfaware presentation. Because this is done competently, it becomes attractive to me.<br/><br/>Using French actors to portray remote Americans is rather brilliant. That they both are unattractive people who present attractively matters as well.<br/><br/>More. Within this context, some rather powerful dramatic effects are woven, the most impressive being a foreboding dream that imposes the inner world on the outer. The effect is repeated later, more weakly. But thrown in are some gratuitous and cheap tricks. His shadow walks away at one point. Miniature characters from one of his movies haunt him while drunk at a bar. They cross well over the silly line.<br/><br/>The frame is intended to overlap that of 'Singin in the Rain' and it really would have helped if they had made this more explicit in the middle, so that at the end we would have known where we came from.<br/><br/>But doggoneit, with all the power this filmmaker turned on, he went nowhere with it. We do have an acceptable enough love story, but it gives us nothing of love. In fact it is hard to know what is going on between these two, and rather than ambiguity we are forced into disbelief. The love of the chauffeur was more genuine — and strange since it comes from the stereotypical lawyer type.<br/><br/>This is worth watching because the machinery is powerful, but the machine doesn't help us do anything with our lives. It should because it could.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

She sparkles in every scene she's in and really steals the entire show. WE'd love to see her in future productions. The actor who did Valentin was very clearly in the part and portrayed the character quite well, but he had an odd script to work with. John Goodman was excellent in his role as the ""Big Producer"". But we can't understand what in the movie made it an Academy Award candidate. Maybe it was because it was foreign-made. But we wouldn't see it again. It was ""okay"" on a rainy evening.

"richard-1967","10","4","10","18 November 2011"," An almost perfect movie, even though silent
","French director Michel Hazanavicius's beautifully self-contained film manages both to pay homage to the style and structure of silent films while still telling a fresh and warm story that succeeds as a modern film on its own merit. It is a silent movie not just in the absence of dialogue but in the entirety of its look and feel, and that makes it all that much better. Everything worked: the titles (in English), the squarer screen aspect, the music, and the acting.<br/><br/>The homage is never less than respectful. It succeeds in being charming, funny, melancholy, and sweet all without being derivative or striking a false note. And by setting the story at the end of the silent era and the transition to talkies, The Artist becomes a wonderful complement to Singing in the Rain.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin, who won the Best Actor award at Cannes, could easily earn a Best Actor Oscar nomination. As the silent film ""artist"" who glides through his life, he is smooth, stylish, amusing, and amused. And as the film moves forward in time, his characterization remains compelling. Bérénice Bejo, Hazanavicius's wife and collaborator, is almost his equal as the young ""peppy"" ingénue ready to launch her career. John Goodman is equally good as the head of their studio.<br/><br/>I say ""almost perfect"" because I thought the director could have cut six to ten minutes from the movie's second half. But that's a small nit to pick. This is an outstanding film. I don't see many movies more than once, but this is one I will."

","In 1927, on the eve of talking pictures a silent film star meets a young dancer and the coming of the talkies sends their careers in opposite directions.

A film that may have pulled it's message off better in a 30 minute short not a 100 minute feature.

Jean Dujardin likable actor that he is, but did he deserve best actor for this? no. Film is average."
"williampsamuel","9","3","7","6 December 2014"," A Fun and Fitting Tribute to Hollywood's Golden Age
","If someone had told me at the beginning of 2011 that the best picture of the coming year would be a French-made tribute to silent era Hollywood, I never would have believed them. And if they said it would be a silent movie, I would have thought them quite mad. And I don't think I would have been alone. Which is why it's both a shock and a delight that for the first time since the inaugural Academy Awards, a silent film has swept the Oscars and become the toast of Hollywood.<br/><br/>And how could it not? It's the ultimate exercise in nostalgia, albeit for a time few if any of us are old enough to remember. It's a portal to a simpler, more innocent, and more glamorous time, even if that's only the way we remember it. It pays tribute to practically every genre of the time, from swashbucklers and safari flicks to high society romances and the dance numbers of Fred and Ginger. True, its story of fading silent film star George Valentino and rising talkies actress Peppy Mills wouldn't have been all that original even then, yet that only adds to the timeless feel. Because the Artist doesn't hearken back to the silent era, it recreates it in near perfect detail.<br/><br/>The costumes, the sets, the title cards, all are all straight out of an old-time two reeler. The dances are exactly as they were in the twenties. The musical score, heavy on jazz and vaudeville, sounds like it was penned in Tinpan Alley. Just like a real film from the period, the footage speeds up during tense or frantic scenes. The only clue that the Artist belongs to the twenty first century is that the picture quality is so high; lacking the graininess and occasional dark spots of the old celluloid reels.<br/><br/>Even the cinematography seems to be from a bygone era, eschewing pans, tracking shots, and smooth transitions for the static camera shots and quick cuts that predominated at the time. Although this dedication to using period techniques does limit the variety of shots that can be used, the filmmakers compensate by filling the shots with movement and interaction between the actors. This is epitomized by a cutaway shot of the studio offices. As the protagonists briefly converse, dozens of figures pass them in every direction along two hallways and the wide staircase joining them. With more movements than the eye can keep up with, the scene reminded me of the grand spectacles of Metropolis and Modern Times.<br/><br/>And the stars are simply wonderful. Their gestures are broad and exaggerated, their faces wonderfully expressive as they convey shock, anger, or sadness. With a hesitant smile or a smug lift of the chin they say nearly as much as they could by speaking. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin bears an uncanny resemblance to Douglas Fairbanks, with just a touch of William Powell thrown in. At the beginning of the picture, he radiates strength, vitality, and the joy of a man doing what he loves. But as the years pass and his career fades, the lines on his brow multiply and his prominent chin seems to recede. It's almost like seeing Mark of Zorro and Prisoner of Zenda side by side.<br/><br/>Leading lady Bérénice Bejo doesn't strike a strong resemblance to any particular starlet of the period, but rather could pass for any young woman of the roaring twenties with her toothy grin, narrow hips, and flapper haircut. And of course the real star of this picture is Uggie, who may be the most photogenic canine since Nick and Nora's terrier Astra. His tricks are as impressive as any Lassie or Rin-Tin-Tin ever did, and even more adorable. I'm hopeful that this won't be his only role.<br/><br/>Although it may not be the deepest or most complex of films, the Artist is surely among the most magical and delightful. Its attention to detail and love for its medium make it a treat for fans of the silent era, and its simplicity and sweetness will endear it even to those less familiar with the classics. It would seem that this year in Hollywood, all that's old is new again."

","this is my very first review and iam obliged that iam starting with such a great movie... Before viewing this movie i read some negative reviews that being a silent a movie its bit monotonous and sluggish but i am happy to declare that its totally the opposite way .the movie is highly intriguing and well paced . It brilliantly depots you to the era when silent films were made,more importantly tells the story of transition of cinema from silent to talkies. it makes you feel the pain and agony that actors of that era must have undergone when talking movies popped in and they had no choice of either scaling up or quitting .Charlie Chaplin also underwent such a bend in his career when he was not ready to commit to talking movies. while pleasing the movie you just cant stop yourself crediting the actor Jean Dujardin for portraying the character so elegantly.he's remarkable in the role of a celebrity star of that era who carries the pride on his shoulder's effectively wearing a smile even in the hard times.there is an impeccable charm around him in the movie you just cant get your eyes of him.he deservingly won an academy for this. i just hope too see him around,hes got bunch of a talent..

"paul2001sw-1","9","3","7","3 May 2014"," Delightful
","I'm a big fan of movies I would describe as realist, and liked many of the films made under the Dogme95 manifesto (which was all about not using certain artificial techniques). And when I look at old movies, it often strikes me how clumsy and un-natural they feel. Yet stick a camera in front of real life and its unlikely that the edited footage would ever be worth watching. All film-making is art and artifice; they may be different (technology- or self-imposed constraints), and a different impact desired, but the film that appears realistic is just one possible style. Viewed in this light, new technology makes new styles possible; but can also lead to the abandonment of art-forms that had their own validity and purpose in favour of the shock of the new. And 'The Artist' proves this: a modern day film, made in the style of a black-and-white, silent movie that manages to be funny and emotionally affecting in spite of the director's deliberate choice to ignore the advances that (mostly) mean that films like this one simply aren't made anymore.<br/><br/>Self-referentially, the film takes the end of the silent movie era as its own subject; of course, this is not an unknown theme in Hollywood (think 'Sunset Boulevard', for example, although the back-story in that film is the primary narrative in this one). It's clever, but not just in a show-off way; what's noticeable is the attention paid to the smallest of details (for example, in the fonts in the movie posters on display); of course, there are talkies where the director has clearly worried over every visual detail, but in this film, it's obviously essential, and they can be enjoyed without competition. Director Michel Hazanavicius and male lead Jean Dujardin appear to have a great understanding of the positive qualities of silent movies (aside from the absence of sound). This isn't the deepest movie you'll ever see, but it's one of the most delightful. And when Berenice Bojo smiles her flapper smile, I challenge anyone not to feel a ripple in their hearts."

","After showing in limited release since November, ""The Artist"" was FINALLY released nationwide on Christmas Day. I was initially attracted to this movie because the poster bears a resemblance to the Broadway one for Disney's ""Beauty And The Beast."" Then when I saw that it was a black-and-white and silent movie (the likes of which has not been produced for over 75 years), my curiosity reached its peak, and I knew this was a film I JUST HAD to see. I finally saw it early last month.<br/><br/>This film is definitely reminiscent of classic silents ""The Gold Rush,"" ""The Mark Of Zorro"" and many others. Only fans of black-and-white and silent films would appreciate this movie, but it's definitely a crowd-pleaser, with something for everyone. Clean comedy ala ""The Thin Man"" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, chaste romance in the vein of ""The Gold Rush"" starring Charlie Chaplin and a great story like the best silent and sound movies (""The Mark Of Zorro"" starring Douglas Fairbanks, ""Singin' In The Rain,"" ""All About Eve,"" Sunset Boulevard,"" ""Casablanca,"" the 1923 and 1956 versions of ""The Ten Commandments,"" the 1925 and 1959 versions of ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Gone With The Wind""and the list goes on). There's also a nice dash of ""Vertigo"" in here. Excellent acting, writing, music and direction. Everything about this movie is top-notch. I definitely plan to add this movie to my DVD collection.<br/><br/>Biblically speaking, there's only one scene where a woman flips a main character off, a brief disturbing image at the beginning, and a mild curse word towards the end of the film which shows up in the inter titles, which is actually comical and not meant to shock. No sex, violence, or strong language, this is definitely a movie straight out of the 1920's and 1930's. Could easily have been rated PG instead of PG-13, but apparently, I think the MPAA thought that a higher rating, despite the minimal content enumerated above, would attract more people. (Rated PG-13 for A disturbing image and a crude gesture? Seriously? The ""Disturbing image"" has been used in the Frankenstein films of the 1930's and '40's and other movies, and there have been harder images in movies, IE. the violence in the 1983 Scarface)<br/><br/>Congratulations to writer & director Michel Hazanavicius and the rest of the cast & crew for making such a wonderful movie. And especially congratulations to them for winning all the awards they've won, and for winning Best Picture. It so earned every award it's won, unlike Titanic in 1997 which was given the 11 Oscars. This is a movie you'll love from beginning to end. The movie should have been rated PG."
"lasttimeisaw","8","3","7","21 February 2012"," The Artist
","Having watched this soon-to-be Oscar winner in the local cinema (after repeatedly brainwashed by its trailer in the multiplexes), indeed it's my third encounter with silent films behind SUNRISE (1927), and FINANCES OF THE GRAND DUKE (1924). The film is masterfully presented from the very beginning until the NEAR-end. THE ARTIST is among the laureates of 2011's film territory without any doubt.<br/><br/>But, in my very own opinion, the much-anticipated Oscar sweep is simply a victory of nostalgia. If it had been made decades before, say 60 years ago, it would be boosted as a silent version of A STAR IS BORN with an excellent cast and splendid score, smooth and melodic, and be ascertained as a major contender but with little likeness to procure the sure-fire ultimate winner kudos which it has now in 2012, when audience has been accustomed to talkies for ages. THE ARTIST is defying all the regular habits to remind cineastes that a silent B&W film could be so potently entertaining and watchable. My point is that I don't think the film itself should take all the credit, though the team behind does have a genius concoction to evoke the retro fixation to its core targets, film-related mass which are the pillar of the film industry (academy included for sure). I doubt who in the field will not love the film? It's a crowd-pleaser for filmmakers, especially the elderly rank. (Actually THE ARTIST and HUGO are holding the same slant here, but Martin Scorsese utilizes tons of money to invest a monolithic fantasy while a foreign no-name Michel Hazanavicius and his troupe achieves the same effect through a more lightweight and unconventional approach, so if the ballots are leaning towards THE ARTIST, no one should scratch their heads.)<br/><br/>Also another edge of THE ARTIST is that despite of the pungent situation of both film's languid box office income is embarrassing no matter who will win the game eventually, there is an essential difference between them, that is THE ARTIST has no difficulty to retrieve its meager budget ($15,000,000), meanwhile HUGO seems to be on the right track of becoming another commercial flunk like THE GOLDEN COMPASS (if not more) even though it's a Scorsese vehicle, which is not an encouraging exemplar for Hollywood tycoons to bankroll their future projects. <br/><br/>Digressing back from the film itself, Jean Dujardin is my current winning for BEST ACTOR, whose protean flair of balancing between comedy and drama is admirable and compelling; Ms. Bejo's ambiguous leading/supporting status maybe hamper her ballots but she is impeccable in the film. <br/><br/>The said ""NEAR-end"" incident concerns my thought of the final scene of the talkie moment, which is a regretful anticlimax for me (although sound and words are plied flawlessly during the middle session to underline the conversion to the talkie era), but Mr. Dujardin's French accent last word is not attuned with his character at all, which downgrades the film as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I could have rated the film higher, but my heart goes with HUGO, but who cares?"
"zorinant","9","3","7","19 February 2012"," What a film!

","""The Artist"" is the odds on favorite now to get the Oscar Best Picture crown, since it had just won the Producers' Guild nod. Everything about it will make you think twice before watching it. It is a SILENT film, in BLACK AND WHITE, with unknown FRENCH actors. Thanks to the awards hype it is getting though, audiences will search this out, as did I.<br/><br/>The story is not the biggest selling point of the film. It is silent, so there can only be so much that can be told by facial expressions, big actions and the occasional dialog card. The story line is very simple, and very familiar, and can be summarized in one sentence: It is about a silent film star who will eventually be surpassed in the industry by the girl he helped get into films, just as silents gave way to talkies in the 1930s. If this same story was told in the current way, it would have been panned. So the novelty gimmick of director/writer Michel Hazanavicius worked in this case, but I do not think it will revive a trend for black & white silent films.<br/><br/>The lead character George Valentin is played by Jean Dujandin. The starlet he helped launch Peppy Miller is played by Berenice Bejo. The lead actors were both very charming. They possess the facial qualities which convince us that they were indeed from that era of film. The debonair Dujardin, in particular, goes through the gamut of emotion without a word uttered until the very end. This will make him a prime candidate for Oscar's Best Actor, a prize he already won in Cannes. Much have been said about the character of Valentin's dog, played by Jack Russell terrier Uggie. He's cute alright, but to push him for Best Supporting Actor is a stretch."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","7","20 January 2012"," An homage, disguised as a great movie!
","It all seems so unlikely; not only making a movie about the silent movie period but also doing it completely without sound as well. A true daring and not so everyday project but it's however a gamble that truly paid off really well! <br/><br/>Clearly this is an homage to old Hollywood movies, of the silent- but as well the early black & white, talking era. But it pays homage by becoming the like the movie of its era, which it is paying homage to. It doesn't ever get into your face about it that this is supposed to be a love letter to old Hollywood. The movie is far more subtle than that really and greatly put together with lots of care and eye to detail on its own. It's simply being a great movie on its own, which in itself is perhaps the greatest homage the movie could had paid, to a time that is long gone.<br/><br/>It's a movie that does take you back to a time when movies and watching movies was still a totally different experience. A sort of carefree time, when movies still had a real innocence over them and were only made to purely entertaining its audience and give everybody a great time.<br/><br/>Watching this movie makes it very obvious that the filmmakers had obviously been doing their homework. I was able to recognize many different general film styles, from mostly the '20's and '30's in this but also styles handled by some well known directors of its era. It's a movie that truly references to some great movies of its era, whether it is with one of their characters, its story or simply a certain shot. But this all is done in a totally non-distracting way and everything works out beautifully and smoothly together. <br/><br/>Everybody could of course make a black & white movie, done without sound but making it look good and work out convincing as an old fashioned silent movie is of course a totally different thing. It's all about the details to get the look and feeling right and I believe this movie absolutely nailed it. The way the actors look and act in this movie is spot on but also some more subtle things, such as its lighting is absolutely perfect and helps to truly give the movie an old look. Yes, this movie truly looks and feels as if it got made like a true movie from the late '20's, also not in the least thanks to its music as well.<br/><br/>Its story definitely had a kind of ""Sunset Blvd."" to it, which is also a movie I absolutely loved. It more or less features a similar sort of concept, with of course as a big difference that this movie is without sound. It doesn't mean that any of the emotions or drama comes across as anything less. It's simply a beautiful, warm story, with real human emotions to it, which are all very sensible.<br/><br/>And just like ""Sunset Blvd."", this also a movie about filmmaking and gives you look of what went on behind the camera's in Hollywood, at the time. It shows the time when the big transition between the silent and talking pictures was taking place. For some it was a blessing, to others a curse. Careers got made during this era but just as many got destroyed. This movie shows both sides and what happens when a big star falls down and a young new star rises to the top.<br/><br/>But I also do admit that the story is what's keeping the movie still a bit down. It by no means is one of the best written or most original stories but it simply is executed extremely well and effective, so it perhaps isn't even a real complaint.<br/><br/>For the lead roles unknowns Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo got cast but the movie also still has some surprisingly big names in it, such as most notably John Goodman and James Cromwell. Surprising, since this of course was a low key production, with a not so everyday idea and approach to it. But no matter whether the actor is well known or not, everybody played their roles really well and all seemed perfectly cast in their roles.<br/><br/>A truly daring project and I'm glad to see its getting all the recognition and praise, which it truly deserves. It's way more than just a gimmicky movie. It's a true astonishing accomplishment and a beautiful piece of love and deep devotion to an extinct genre, from director Michel Hazanavicius. I'm sure of it this will be a movie that I shall watch countless times again, for years to come.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

As a silent film buff I was a little cautious when a heard that someone was attempting to make another in today's time but those fears were put to rest because THE ARIST is a tremendous success as not only a film but also as a love letter to cinema. It's funny to think that this movie as well as Martin Scorsese's HUGO would be released so closely together and give the silent films such a boom but both movies have their hearts in the right place and it's the viewers who are going to be treated. Shot in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and in black and white, director Michel Hazanavicius does a masterful job at pulling off all the glamor with the style. The movie is a very good replica of what silent movies are all about as we get some great laughs, good melodrama and of course a couple chase/action scenes. I thought the screenplay was so simple yet the director took what he had and did as much with it as he possibly could. I always say a familiar story can be told countless times as long as you have talent telling it. The film is obviously influenced by and borrows elements from A STAR IS BORN and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN but the story is catchy, it pulls you in and it's a lot of fun. Much credit has to also go to both Dujardin and Bejo. Both actors do a marvelous job in their silent roles. There are some insults about mugging at the camera, which play an important part in the story but both of these actors give it their all and you really do get a feel that they are giving what a silent performance should. Dujardin speaks so easily without words because you never have a problem knowing and feeling what's going on inside him. Bejo is just so charming and sweet that you can see why an actress like her would have boomed back in the early talkie era. The supporting cast includes strong work by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell and Penelope Ann Miller. THE ARTIST works on just about every level but I think it's strongest cord is the fact that it pays homage to a great age in movies. People complain about certain movies today and I always tell them that there are great movies out there but sometimes you have to search for them because they're not playing on three- thousand screens. THE ARIST not only breaks that tradition but it pays respect to the great movies that came before it."
"napierslogs","9","3","7","2 December 2011"," The golden hue of black and white silence and old-school charm
","""The Artist"" is an artist's film; a tribute to the golden age of movies. In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent film star at the height of success. When the studios turn their attention to talkies, George isn't ready to make the transition. He continues to watch the world in black & white and listen in silence.<br/><br/>If you haven't realized it yet, ""The Artist"" is a silent, black and white film, and it's great. Our hero, George Valentin, was created in the vain of the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. He is funny, charming, charismatic; he can do comedies, dramas, action-adventures; he has a wife, adoring fans, and a dog. The dog is star number 2, capable of playing dead or dancing in step with George.<br/><br/>An adoring fan finds herself absorbing the spotlight after a chance meeting with George. Not only can she keep up with him, but the world is ready to hear the voice of Ms. Peppy Miller. She is not named ""Peppy"" by accident.<br/><br/>We have a delightful story of love; love of success, love of movies, and love between George and Peppy. Dujardin has a wonderful comedic touch to everything he does in this movie that the simple story line is helped along with a healthy dose of comedy. He turns serious when The Great Depression hits, but ""The Artist"" keeps chugging along with its original, uplifting score, inventive scenes, and a finale that brings us into the future."

","Is this an invitation to re-score silent movies? If so, then good show! But it isn't, is it? No, in spite of good acting and dancing, this is fluff and no more than that. From the first frame to the last totally predictable.<br/><br/>I guess the hype derives from the fact that only few people look at silent movies nowadays. The originals, such as The Crowd, Sunrise and City Lights and, why not, Safety Last or The Mark of Zorro are all far better and far less predictable.<br/><br/>If this film catches your interest for the old silent films then it has done more than you could have expected from it, I guess."
"st-shot","5","5","15","15 February 2012"," Retro Rubbish
","Somewhere in this unreasonable facsimile of and on silent filmmaking a clip of Doug Fairbanks as Zorro appears for under 30 seconds. For the the rest of the film I lamented the fact I wasn't watching it instead of this pale imitation of an homage to a mix and match variety of silent fact and folklore. This corny clunker proves beyond doubt there ain't nothing like the real thing.<br/><br/>George Valintin is one of silent films great leading men (Fairbanks) that mocks the advent of sound before soon coming victim (Novarro, Gilbert) to it. As his star falls ( Norman Maine) a dancer (Vickie Lester) he once befriended and met in comical fashion riding a shooting one takes him in. His pride gets the best of him however and he begins to self destruct. Throughout it all his noble dog sticks to his side. <br/><br/>The Artist is to be commended for its attempt to give later generations a look at what it was like to see silents the way they were meant to be. But after two visually impressive opening scenes the compositions become mundane, the montage slow the prosaic storyline banal scraps of classics including sound work from Welles, Lean, Chaplin and Berkeley. When the film itself stubbornly hangs on to its' silent stance even after the advent of sound it literally stalls and stunts itself, and the idea becomes self defeating. <br/><br/>I'll do the cast a favor and mention no one beyond a charming Jean Dujardin for no one merits it save the adorable dog who doesn't need much to steal scenes from these ensemble dullard humans who offer little more than waxen posturing. They broadly parody the ""ancient"" style of film acting but lack the faces and the nuance of the originals. Director Michel Havavicius simply turns off the sound shoots his film in black and white and shoots a cliché ridden Singin' in the Rain / A Star is Born hybrid and from the looks of it wondered if he'd researched any silents at all.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated to the silent era and the masterpieces from it The Artist might be an exotic sea change from the impersonal computer generated 3 D world of cinema today but if one truly wants to see it done in all its antiquated magnificence then seek out theatre screenings of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Gish, Lon Chaney, Vidor and Griffith. The Artist is simply a slick repro with nothing under the hood."

","If I had to describe this film in one word it's ""nice"". Charming, warm, enjoyable are three more words.<br/><br/>But it's really nothing special.<br/><br/>My key problem is that there's no twist really to the movie. Otherwise it's a silent movie for silent movie's sake. And sure it's a nice change of pace, and reminds of us of film's rich history, but if you're just largely copying what was before then... what are you bringing to the table other than reviving an old format? At one point the main character has a dream, where he can hear things. And we the viewers hear things too. And this is where I thought the movie was going to really pick up. Almost a Pleasantvillesque slant... I thought it was going to be dealing with how he was self aware that he was silent and would then break into sound. As we hear a laugh for the first time in the film, it really is a magical moment after so much silence. I thought we may go on this journey as he discovers sound, or something to that effect.<br/><br/>But then... it drops that, goes back to telling a story... and nothing new is brought to the table.<br/><br/>It really is a nice movie, somewhat refreshing... but I don't come away feeling I've witnessed a masterpiece or something that will even remain with me for very long."
"basilisksamuk","6","4","11","26 January 2012"," It's All About the Image
","I went into this film with high expectations and came out disappointed. I attended an afternoon matinée expecting to have the cinema pretty much to myself but the place was full. The audience were fairly mature so I suspect there was a special admission price. On the face of it they might have been pre-disposed to like a film that referenced older productions. There was some very low key laughter at the antics of the dog but otherwise little reaction from the audience which I took to be a reflection of a general lack of engagement.<br/><br/>I didn't mind that the story was corny and I really really liked the music, especially when they let it rip in the dramatic sequences. But I was very disappointed with the cinematography and that's what killed it for me. The best (original) black and white films, sound or silent, have a numinous quality about them which draws you in and can make you gasp at its sheer beauty (for instance Sunset Boulevard, which the Artist borrows from, Rebecca or Lean's Oliver Twist). As someone who likes to SHOUT rather more than I do has pointed out, the film-makers seem to have achieved a rather muddy image only getting close to a good high contrast black and white look in the last few minutes! <br/><br/>The Artist is all about the image in more ways than one. The lack of dialogue didn't bother me but I expected the black and white to be rendered much more artfully. I suspect it's also about image in the praise it has received – the critics liked it and it and as praise is heaped upon it, it becomes more difficult to dissent.<br/><br/>The Artist isn't a bad film. It's a great idea, let down by the photography which just isn't good enough. It deserves an audience and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in watching it but it just isn't anywhere near as good as most of the critics and reviews on IMDb suggest."
"jadedalex","3","2","4","14 October 2019"," The Artist: Phony as a Glass Eye
","Easily one of the most manipulative movies I have ever seen. Not a 'bad' movie, this film reminds me of the line from 'Nothing Sacred'....'the truth, crushed to Earth, rises as phony as a glass eye'.<br/><br/>There is very little 'truth' to be found in this sickeningly nostalgic film, which won best picture Oscar. This movie makes 'Cinema Paradiso' look like 'Citizen Kane'.<br/><br/>Everyone is adorable. Even John Goodman. And if that wasn't enough, they throw in an adorable dog. I've never seen such manipulative cuteness since Paul Newman took Katherine Ross on a bicycle in 'Butch Cassidy', as the soundtrack played 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'. Who could resist? Nobody.<br/><br/>But I managed to resist this. A true lover of silent films and early Hollywood would see through the silly happy ending. It made me yearn for how beautifully done the original 'A Star is Born' was made. There could be no happy ending. We just see Norman Maine walking into the ocean. Which makes the real ending ring so true...Vicky Lester proclaiming herself 'Mrs. Norman Maine'.<br/><br/>The movie's lead is reminiscent of John Gilbert, who would not make it successfully into the talkies. It's a shame. His love, Greta Garbo, even did exactly as the character 'Peppy Miller' did in 'The Artist'. She would not make 'Queen Christina' without Mr. Gilbert. And I believe Gilbert was fine with the role, but Hollywood, and his own alcoholism, prevented this from ever happening.<br/><br/>Garbo, ironically, shared the same fate. In her second attempt at comedy, the public stayed away in droves to 'Two-Faced Woman'. No one wanted to see a happy Garbo doing the rhumba. What had clicked so well in 'Ninotchka' failed dismally in 'Two-Faced Woman'. That's the difference between an intelligent script and an uninspired one.<br/><br/>When I viewed the happy ending to 'The Artist', it made me wonder. If John Gilbert could just dance a few steps, all would be sweetness and light! He would have gone on to a successful new career, provided audiences wanted to see Garbo rhumba, which they didn't.<br/><br/>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I have no doubt the makers of this film have a love for a glamorous old Hollywood. That this film rings of so much false nostalgia is unsettling. I hate to mention 'truth' again. But part of what makes 'Sunset Boulevard' such a fine film is its cynicism. Billy Wilder had a talent for making movies that turned out quite prophetic. We can all relate to Norma Desmond's declaration: 'I am big. It's the pictures that got small...'<br/><br/>Imitation is one thing. Stealing music is robbery. We all know the great love the French have for Jerry Lewis. And incongruously, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. So I found it rather annoying that they copped Bernard Herrmann's music from 'Vertigo' for one of the scenes in 'The Artist'. Obviously, they must have gotten permission, but I doubt Hitchcock would be amused.<br/><br/>There are clever moments throughout the film, but the movie winds up being an insincere, sloppy kiss to nostalgic Tinsel Town. You want to see a sincere and moving silent film? Try F.W. Murnau's 'Sunrise'. It was made in 1927.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't post such a negative review, but I'm amazed at what passes for 'great films' in the twenty first century. At the end of the day, 'The Artist' is only so much politically correct fluff. Where is Billy Wilder's cynicism when we need it?"

","When I was 11 years old and innocently in love with the daughter of a Salvation Army officer in Guildford,I used to go to meetings and sit in the dark hoping my ""Start - rites"" would brush against her leather sandals as we watched ""Blood and fire in action"" and other epics about the Army's good works in the London slums. As light relief we were shown a few silent shorts and I was introduced to ""Easy Street"",extracts from ""Chrismas Tree salesmen"" and several episode of ""Tol'able David"" which sealed my fate as a devoted film - lover for the next 60 - odd years. Over the years I bought 8mm prints of many silent and they seldom failed to produce the tingle that was only partly induced by the scrape of shoe on shoe all those years ago. So when I watched ""The Artist"" I was slightly disappointed to find very little emotional engagement. Yes it's clever and perhaps an interesting conceit for a 20 minute TV slot,but it is constantly telling us how cute and funny the characters are and how many movies the makers have seen,which I found a little irritating. It goes on too long in telling its story which is not so much a re - telling of 1920s cinema but rather a re - telling of a 1950s take on 1920s cinema. It may be a simplification to declare that only comedy,melodrama and epic works in Silent form,but not much of one. ""The Artist"" is giving us a musical comedy (with no on screen music,obviously)with bits of drama thrown in. The cast is energetic,but in a 21st century post - modern - ironic way. It lacks the apparent spontaneity that was the genius of Chaplin,Keaton and Lloyd,and the loveability that emanated from Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy in every frame. Rather it is cold and calculating with a cynical eye on the camera. Comparisons to the contemporary ""Hugo"" - another tribute to early movies are valid and invidious despite the latter having dialogue in sound rather than just a musical track.It has what The Artist"" lacks - heart. In that respect maybe ""The Artist"" might have been better off with just a solo piano to reinforce the mood. Somehow a full - blown orchestra blasting out at inappropriate moments seems a little de trop."

","This movie makes me realize that in recent years we've all been obsessed with what twists to add to our stories in order to break the classic story structure, and it does so by deliberately choosing not to. Mind, they let you know that it is at their fingertips to do so if they wish - with a talkie dream sequence, with the drunk scene at the bar, and with the brilliant scene where even his shadow deserts George - but they don't. What they do is to just tell the story WELL (I know, split infinitive). Brilliant in its simplicity, ""The Artist"" somehow lets you know that it is aware of the mold that lets it take shape, and yet somehow avoids giving the audience the dull feeling of seeing just another of thousands of movies of the same story structure. It is so simple and well done that I rate it just short of groundbreaking at a rare 9/10."
"Tanay_LKO","8","2","4","18 June 2013"," The Artist: The Solemn Silence
","I don't recall being just simply happy and content by watching a film. Simple, ethnic and surprisingly adorable. I remember, some time back when ""The Artist"" was about to be released, I passed across the film's first look in a black and white poster, resembling the one of ""Gone With The Wind"". The old-fashioned look and the actors with French names, not quite recognizable by the English audience were what I noticed at that time. Well, I didn't pay much attention to this topic, till the time the film was released and became quite successful, both with the viewers and with the critics abroad. Curious as always in the matter of films, I Googled the film. Read a bit about it on Wikipedia that it was a silent, black and white film with semi-biographical theme of silent films, during the early '20s and '30s of the last century. Followed by this, I watched the trailer on YouTube. To be honest, I was surprisingly interested in the theme of the film. I did not know why, but I was. Since that day, which was a few months ago, I was desperately waiting to watch this film. Now, when I am done watching it, I could conclude that I wasn't at all bored, even for just a second, while watching this old themed film and moreover, feel nice about the whole thing. As aforementioned, ""simply happy and content"". The film tells the story of George Valentin, a major star of the silent films who introduces Peppy Miller, an aspiring actress and a fan, as a dancer. As the transition of silent films to talkies comes, Valentin loses his act and Miller being a newbie, gradually climbs the ladder of stardom. Though, in the process she never forgets Valentin and her love for him. Because of them, she even saves him from his suicide attempt and convinces him to make a comeback in the films by doing a musical with her, as they're both good dancers. The film concludes on a happy note with Al Zimmer, the producer - director of silent and then talkies, asking the duo to give another shot of a dancing sequence, to which Valentin happily replies, ""With pleasure!!"" And indeed, it was a pleasure to watch all of them. Jean Dujardin being the protagonist of the film was outstanding in the portrayal of ""George Valentin"". Berenice Bejo was adorable as ""Peppy Miller"". The supporting cast of John Goodman as ""Al Zimmer"", James Cromwell as ""Clifton"", the valet of the protagonist and not to forget, ""Uggy"" the faithful pet-dog and co-actor in all of the protagonist's films were delightful. Not to forget the writer-director-editor, Michel Hazanavicius and the producer Thomas Langmann for their approach and in making their efforts come alive, the D.O.P, Guillaume Schiffman and the music producer, Ludovic Bource and co-editor, Anne-Sophie Bion. The film however, tells a universal story on a wider perspective. The silent films made by the directors of yester years who went on to pioneer the art of film making, did something in pantomime that even talkies couldn't equal (without any disrespect). It might sound archaic now, but even today if one will watch a silent film, the sheer spirit of the people involved in it can't be neglected by a viewer apart from the obvious liveliness and mystical joy of the content."

","The Artist is a film that took what I thought was going to be a gimmick and turned it into an experience. The movie is about a famous actor in the twenties that struggles to continue his career when movies start to use sound. this is a topic that was also talked about in the classic ""Singing in the Rain"" but this movie sets itself apart in the fact that it is filmed in black & white and is actually a silent film. I went into this movie thinking they were going to try to hard to be artsy, that the whole silent thing was just a gimmick and would quickly get old or annoying if not done right. To put it simply I was dead wrong. This movie isn't only great but it proves that the silent film isn't dead just yet. The characters are fun and lovable, the writing is brilliant and the cinematography can be surprisingly brilliant at times. The camera work is done flawlessly with the idea of a black & white in mind meaning that we get to see some beautiful shots that plays with the color limitations. the acting is also extremely well done. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo have great chemistry on screen together and there expressions really takes this movie the extra mile. when these characters are sad you can feel it through that sincere look in there eyes. the writing was again great.

I liked Bource's vintage late-'20s-early-'30s tribute score but I also was entertained by Captain Green's more late-'60s-early-'70s accompaniment especially when they used a couple of Beatles' songs-""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""All You Need is Love""-for the climatic scenes. I do have to admit, however, that the sound effects dream sequence and the dialogue scene at the end was more convincing in the original version (since there weren't enough FX and no speaking in the live version). Either way, the performances of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are convincing enough that you root for them all the way and, oh, that dog is such a scene stealer, isn't he?

","The Artist is a good and entertaining film, and it may deserve the handful of Oscar prizes that it received. I missed it in the theaters, then I bought the DVD when I was in Paris, and it's only now that I got to see it. My conclusion is that it's good, but slightly over-hyped and something is missing for it to be the great film some people talk about.<br/><br/>Let me start with what I liked most. It's a film about cinema and specifically about Hollywood and it may be or it may be not surprising that it's been written and directed by a Frenchman and the star is another great French actor. After all it's the French who are the most respectful to the tradition of the great American cinema, and this is not something new, this lasts for more than half a century. While the American themselves criticize and change all the time the face of Hollywood (and it's good that they do it), the French seem to be permanently fascinated by the legends of the American cinema and the silent movies is the one picked to be the subject of The Artist, or better said the death of the silent cinema and the fate of its stars. The story of George Valentine (Jean Dujardin), the star of silent cinema in 1927, who refuses to acknowledge the revolution of the 'talkies' in 1929 and finds himself rejected and abandoned by almost everybody in 1931 is well and simply written and filmed with elegance by director Michel Hazanavicius. Dujardin gets fine replicas from Berenice Bejo as the growing star of the new era and James Cromwell as the faithful driver of the falling star. The two and the cute dog, who would have deserved an Oscar for canine performance if there was one, never abandon the hero, they actually all love him and cause us to love him despite perceived character problem. Eventually even the shark-producer acted by John Goodman will give to George Valentine a second chance in life.<br/><br/>So yes - it's a well written story, a respectful reverence to a crucial period in the evolution of cinema and its heroes, an interesting format which makes the story different. Why is it 'good' and not 'great'? It is good because the film could not have been possible in a different formula - the silent film that describes the transition of the world of cinema from silent to talking movies. It is not great because the formula is too obvious in a few places (when the film less creates emotions and more tries to show how smart it is) and because the ending contains a 'deus ex machina' type of solution that goes in the contrary direction than the whole film. But maybe I am wrong. If more great silent films will follow I definitely will prove to be wrong. I would be happy to be wrong in this case."

","The Artist is a romantic comedy drama in the style of a black-and-white silent film.It was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius.It stars Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo together with John Goodman,James Cromwell,Missi Pyle,Penelope Ann Miller and Malcolm McDowell.The story takes place in Hollywood, between 1927 and 1932, and focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the ""talkies"".<br/><br/>In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film, A Russian Affair, when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin ,Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment, but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.<br/><br/>One could spend hours talking about how fantastic The Artist is; how sublime Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are; how natural their movements and expressions are; how perfect the score is so expressive and lively and jovial and magical.This is the definitive example of great that, it's essentially a tribute to black and white silent films."

It disappeared because Jolson talked and others couldn't and we were on our way to what we have now. The limitations of cinematography created in silents demands that were hard to overcome at times, but through genius, the likes of Griffith and Murnau were able to trump those with varying degrees of success. Some of the best of these were silly comedies and, hence, that's what we have here. What we've asked it what the actors of the new sound era were asked, except in reverse. This is hardly a true silent movie. Because of the huge budget and the ability use techniques that are tried and true, it comes off slick as a whistle. I really enjoyed this but let's face it, not only as the technology passed, so has the era that spawned it. So by making this a period piece, I can only respond ho-hum. I think this is a creative piece with nice acting and some cool plot twists (though a little too much pride for my tastes), but I feel that the other Best Picture nominees should be suing."
"s-wesner1","Null","2","4","16 September 2012"," A Real Peppy Movie: Bringing back the Art of the Silent Film in the 21st century
","Suphie Wesner 9/16/2012<br/><br/>My Film Review of Berenice Bejo/Jean duJardin/certain other stars in Michel Hazanavicius' Oscar-winning film, The Artist..<br/><br/>Among the blockbuster stars in this film include fat-faced, sarcastic-personad, of Roseann's ex-husband in their comedy, Roseanne, as John Goodman, and Uggie, the dog...In general, this cast is so good because they are all extremely talented; also, Monsieur Hazanavicius is excellent as director, told by his award that he won for best director of the 2012 Oscar nominations, and Du Jardin won as best actor, a first- time event for any French actor crossing over into the American movie industry. The film is basically self-explanatory, the dog is really cute, du Jardin and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller in the movie), excel as dancers, and even John Goodman is really good as the film's casting- call, director within the film, who calls du Jardin a has-been, namely because he can only do ""silent movies"" while the industry is heading into the direction of eliminating silent, calling them old-fashioned, and instead wholly doing ""sound-based"" films. ""Uggie,"" the dog, knows a million well-rehearsed tricks, which is why he was chosen for the role, I suppose, and he must be a springer spaniel, or some sort of a Jack Russell Terrier, or, something. The charming aspect of this film is that most of the characters don't talk, they use their gestures, their faces, their eyes, instead, to relay the message they want to relay. At one point, Du Jardin puts a revolver in his mouth because he chooses to commit suicide, feeling so bad about the fact that he is no longer in demand. Fortunately, or for whatever reason, the revolver doesn't work, or, he no longer has the will to do it; the dog, for one thing, starts barking his head off when he sees his master in distress. Also, the film makes a point to show that Bejo cares about him and loves him, as they formerly were lovers, and she wants to prove the point that she is willing to follow through for him now; indeed, the movie shows that she has him in mind when she drives like mad, tongue literally in cheek, on her way to come save the day. It turns out, that, though she fails to rescue him in the end (it is he who saves himself), she had a thought-process that was correct, that he was in harm's way, and that she herself would make the effort to save him. . . Indeed the film is a lot about ""saving grace,"" about people coming through for others when nobody else will; about faith; about working together to create something bigger, about, well, getting along. It is appallingly long for short-tempered modern-day audiences who might balk at going without sound for over an hour; I myself thought that the film would go on for 27 chapters, but I guess I was wrong. The charming smile of Du Jardin, or, rightfully, George Valentin, and Peppy Miller's dance moves more than make up for that. The uniqueness and the creativity that went into the film, I think, the fact that modern-day actors and actresses can make such a sparkling revival of silent film is this movie's ""lucky star."" Uggie, the dog, who is able to play dead, seek help (like Lassie), and even, when ashamed or abashed, put his head between his front paws, is also a remedy for people seeking something new out of today's modern-day cinema. But when George Valentin (pronounced to rhyme with Valentino, I believe) suffers smoke-inhalation, I don't believe that he was severely burned, honestly, from a house fire started by his desire to burn off his own collection of personal movie reels he regrets having made with Peppy; things go to Hell and the film winds down. There may be a little bit of professional jealousy within the couple itself; he may have been hurt by the fact that she started winning all the roles with the skills and the talents imbued in her by him. But, all, in all, one has to admit that they work well together as a team on screen, and even come across as your modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, or, alternately, Fred and Ginger. A lot of time and efforts went into hair- dressing and special-makeup effects, too; Peppy herself lands a role in a film entitled, ""Peppy's Beauty Spot"" or something like that. France 24 also had a hand in this film, and it is clear that a lot of acting parts were used. Johnnie Burke and Arthur Johnston wrote a cute number entitled, ""Pennies from Heaven,"" and Ludovic Bource wrote the musical score. Indeed, Jon-Paul was the gang-leader, so, as you can see, there are many parts in this movie which are technical and skilled, and those often went to the French workers, it is just reality to say, and the parts that were more involved with acting, even small roles/bit parts, went to the Americans. One of the most sinister parts in the film, when Peppy arrive at Jean's mansion only to be hinted at by his maid that he is ""occupied"" is when it looks like it might be over for them. It is a cute film, rather slow-moving and wholesome, and rated pg-13 and produced by French studios in conjunction with American distributors ( in fact, there is one film studio in the whole thing entitled, ""La Class Americaine,"" but that isn't really a real American studio). It is the most-awarded French film in history, apparently, as said by internet researchers; it came out in 2011, but officially had a 2012 release date in America. It has English inter-titles on it, as well as, it is the first feature-length black-and-white film since the dawning of Schindler's List in 1993, by Spielberg. James Cromwell also plays a bit role as the butler of Jean. It is a great, jazzy little film with a lot of good musical numbers. The End."

","The Artist isn't the first silent movie I've seen, but it is the best. In fact, it's amazing, after the fuzzy, washed-out, one camera silent movies, to see modern techniques used like this. I wanted to see it, when it was in the theater, but I didn't get to. I guess I'll never get to see a silent movie in theater, unless they make another one. Please? Anyway, when I got it home, I watched it four times in a row. Dujardin is so expressive he really doesn't need to talk. You know when he's being a charming bastard, when he's feeling determined, when he's lost hope, when he's happy, and when he's scared. It stands out so well without the noise. The plot's about trying to reclaim lost glory in a present you don't fit into at all. I say to George Valetnin, yes, silent movie are great. What if you could choose? Would you like to see a silent movie or a talking movie, on any given weekend? Deaf people don't feel left out; you get some reading in while watching so you're smarter. And imagine contemporary actors in silent movies. The Artist is a well-layers story; I noticed more things every time I watched. I really liked it."

","A refreshing film so beautifully made that it's easy to be enchanted by its simplicity. You may wrinkle your nose up and be tempted to give up on it when you realise that it's a silent film depicting the era when silent films were being replaced by 'talkies'. But I encourage you to persist in watching this magic unfold with beautiful imagery that has been skilfully crafted by a talented crew. French director, Michel Hazanavicius's vision was explicitly carried out with exquisite costumes, sets, and impressive cinematography by Guillaume Schiffman. My favourite shot was when Valentin pours his drink over the glass table. Such creativity.<br/><br/>The story is simple yet captivating – enriched by fine acting from Jean Dujardin who won an academy award for Best Actor, and Bérénice Bejo, nominated for an academy award. I have to give special mention to Uggie, Valentin's dog, who no doubt stole many hearts as the unsung hero in the film. Dujardin plays the role of George Valentin, mega star of silent pictures who is mercilessly dumped by the studio head, Al Zimmer, played by John Goodman, when 'talkies' become the next 'hot ticket'. By this time, Peppy Miller, played by Bejo has risen to fame, from an extra to a leading lady, with the help of Valentin.<br/><br/>The film is not just about the end of silent films, and the end of an actor's career, but about loyalty, pride, change, despair, triumph and tragedy, and finding hope through love. That is what brings colour to this beautiful black and white film. It also honours the beautiful architecture, costumes, fashion, cars, and elegance of an era long gone. It is ironic that this film has won so much acclaim in this modern world we live in, where the old is tossed aside, as Valentin was, only to be revived by someone who cared enough to see the value of showing the newer generations the evolution of technology and the stability of human love, (let's not forget the loyalty of man's best friend). Our world is so noisy and busy that it takes a little while to adjust to the film's lack of dialogue. The importance of music is clearly apparent in helping the film to flow as there was a moment where there was no sound whatsoever and it stuck out like a sore thumb. It's strange how complete silence can make us feel abnormal. <br/><br/>It is also a lesson to scriptwriters, that copious dialogue does not enhance a film and is completely unnecessary. Skilled actors can tell a story with expressions and body language. The Artist is a pleasant surprise and another gem to be added to the collection of classic films. I encourage you to watch it, after all, it was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won five, including Best Picture, and Best Director."

","This film is so captivating without ""Sound"" it just slaps the normal films in the face. The plot is not novel yet once you start watching it, you can't take your eyes off even though you can see what's coming miles away. Second viewing is as much pleasurable as the first because this film does not rest its appeal on gimmicks, plot twists or tension. It's just a joy ride even when it's sad. The beautiful acting and the unforgettable scenes just ask it to be viewed again and again. You get so stuck on this film just like Valentin gets glued to Peppy Miller in the ballroom scene. There is music throughout the film yet never does it steal the focus from the visuals. A story told silently, it puts the films of today to shame which use colors, CGI, sound and now even 3D. The film shows what films should be about first and foremost - storytelling."
"Errington_92","Null","2","4","27 June 2012"," A Love Letter To The Silent Years
","If you judge The Artist on its plot alone, the film does not seem special. An established actor and a newcomer meet slowly building up to a love story while each other's careers go in opposite directions. Sounds pretty cliché but The Artist is not the typical movie. It is a self – described love letter to cinema mixing different genres together to celebrate the movies rather than presenting itself as a movie.<br/><br/>The mixture of genres play a large part in The Artist. They are conveyed in a charming fashion which creates a sense of nostalgia for this period of cinema. From George and his dog Jack play acting on stage in a delightful manner, Peppy strutting her stuff in a brief musical dance number and Peppy later acting out her passion for George by improvising with his jacket in a tender moment. All these scenes combine different genres to show how cinema has made us laugh, love and cry. The Artist creates a blank canvas by having no language barrier in order for the audience to have strong embedded emotions. Yet it's the drama aspect of The Artist which plays the most vital role portraying George's downfall.<br/><br/>When sound screen test begin to happen at the studio George laughs it off naive to cinema's evolution. Soon it begins to haunt George, scared for his career. Sat in his dressing room, George begins to hear the sounds of objects touching the surface, Jack barking and people outside yet George cannot hear his own voice. Moving around in a confused state captured in tinted camera angles dazed at the realisation of his future. Although it was only a dream, it is a nightmare reality for himself and for many others whose careers collapsed by the coming of sound. The Artist is not only a pleasant look at cinema's past but also a sobering reminder of the destruction Hollywood left behind in a number of lives.<br/><br/>Although The Artist has its charm in its expressive love for silent cinema by using different genres, it does unfortunately start to drag. The years quickly go by as Peppy becomes a sensation while George sinks deeper into depression. All the while Peppy longs for him and watches George from a distance. Nothing much happens during this period of The Artist which flattens the viewing experience. It's only once George manages to break out of his depression and reunite with Peppy that The Artist picks back up with a blend of romance, melodrama and a happy climax.<br/><br/>The experience The Artist gives us is not only a mostly alluring storyline but a musical score which to perfection embodies all the emotions The Artist contains creating it a tremendous inner feeling for a spectator. It brilliantly inhabits the shifting mood of The Artist as well as personifying the multiple genres. From the light hearted tone of George and Peppy unexpectedly meeting to the fast and forceful tone of George destroying his film reels, the musical score draws us into the core of the story.<br/><br/>Despite The Artist somewhat lingering in its storyline it does not dent its tribute to the early years of cinema which is its most important aspect. It lets those who may have never experienced silent cinema appreciate its great dramatic and atmospheric qualities where everyone can feel and understand the characters emotions without a language barrier. In this sense The Artist flatters and should rightly be remembered as a loving tribute to cinema."

","This film works on every level for me. Funny, entertaining and moving at times with a great love story. I know what some of you are thinking, but this is NOT the usual pretentious artsy film, snobby British film like The King's Speech or obvious Oscar bait. At it's heart is just a fun movie made by someone that clearly loved that era of cinema; the film just emanates reverence to that time and excels in it's tribute. I'm certainly not a fan of over the top musicals and it's not that either. It had just the right amount of dancing and was done in a really interesting, fun way. The film really just brought that time to life to me and I don't think I've seen anything quite like it to be honest; it's just very original (I know, ironic, given it's an homage film). And I love movies that show me something I haven't seen before or in a different way and this does that; really, really well.<br/><br/>I like this a lot because it doesn't take it self too seriously and that is necessary I think for this to work on a mass level. It's really a mishmash of a lot of the great things about movies from that era and surprisingly works really well. I was always entertained and never bored or uninterested (which I was very worried about heading in). And the actors did a great job of taking the viewer through the film. No matter the moment, the expressions, gestures and the musical score kept you in interested in what was happening.<br/><br/>Both actors were incredible and Jean Dujardin deserved his Oscar in my opinion. He had all the classic Hollywood actor features and traits; the smile, the charm, the humour, the look and most importantly, the acting when it mattered. I've seen a few of these films (and scenes of certain films) and he nails it; in every way. In a weak year I think Bejo would've snagged an Oscar, but not this year. She hit all the right notes and fit the mold of the era as well (had the look and the acting chops to match). I look forward to seeing what else she can do, she's clearly talented. Together, they make this film work with fantastic performances. And let's not forget Uggie! (the dog) who was just hilarious. The things they got him to do were pretty impressive and added a lot of light moments to the film.<br/><br/>You don't have to love silent black and white movies to really enjoy this, you just have to love movies. I just had this overwhelming sense of joy when I was watching it; something that is really rare in film today. It just made me feel good and I love it for that. For once in the last few years I've agreed with the best picture winner. And besides, it's a movie about actors falling in love in Old Hollywood as it evolves from silent to modern film. I don't think the Academy had the will power to not fall all over it self rewarding this film. But fortunately for us, the movie is actually deserving of it's best picture Oscar (unlike that highly overrated, pretentious The Kings Speech last year). And yes, I'm still annoyed that won. <br/><br/>So to summarize, this is an instant classic. A throw back tribute to Old Hollywood and is not to be missed. And yes, it's the best film I saw last year. <br/><br/>www.themoviesnob.ca<br/><br/>@the_movie_snob"

","""The Artist"", directed by Michel Hazanavicius, is an exquisite love letter not only to silent cinema, but to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Inspired by the likes of ""A Star is Born"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"", this five time Academy Award winner, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, successfully uses silent film technique to enhance the story rather than using it as a gimmick to attract attention.<br/><br/>If there is an artist in this film, then it is the director for brilliantly using all the devices of cinema to create a world that does not need sound: it is a world unto itself, inhabited by people like Jean Dujardin, who seemingly effortlessly make us understand his psychosocial and emotional state through his body language. It is a difficult task for any actor, but Dujardin pulls it off with aplomb.<br/><br/>The direction too is outstanding, fully utilising all manner of cinematic tricks to show what can be done; this is pure film using images to convey the plot without relying on dialogue.<br/><br/>In fact the only two uses of sound are marvellously handled: the first, in a wonderfully surreal dream of Valentin, his fears plague him with a nightmare about the coming of ""talkies"" to Hollywood. Then normal sound is restored in the very final scene and the effect is like watching your very first movie: magical.<br/><br/>The score by Ludovic Bource is very, very good, underlining the emotional resonance boldly, adding another layer of excellence to the film.<br/><br/>If it has any faults, it is that in quoting such a vast array of cinematic legends, from Fritz Lang to ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950) to Douglas Fairbanks, it sabotages itself by being too sophisticated and knowing; this is not a film that could ever have been made in the 1920's. However, it is a small flaw when put into perspective against the joy and freedom of expression found in the silent film technique that overflows onto the screen.<br/><br/>This is a consummate example of what the cinema can do when all of the film's makers are at the top of their talent and skill; breathtaking."

","IN A SORT OF all out display of a story about a silent Hollywood learning to talk and the problems encountered by those caught in the middle; the producers chose to do a real retro work and make a silent film filmed in glorious black and white. We couldn't have agreed with their choice more; for it had a great tendency to draw the audience into the story in the proverbially hook, line and sinker intensity.<br/><br/>THE TOPIC WAS one taken from many real life stories from the late 20's early 30's scene in tinsel town; although there is no one real life person's story being portrayed here. The subject matter had, indeed, been told before on the screen. We had been offered such fare as WHAT PRICE Hollywood? (RKO, 1932*) and no less than three versions of A STAR IS BORN having been produced over the span of some forty years.**<br/><br/>HOWEVER SEEMINGLY TIMEWORN and ""old hat"" the storyline may seem to be, the production team manages to render it all new and fresh, right before our non color stimulated eyes and their corresponding non sound-wave inundated ear drums. This feature, alone,gave the audience a sort of unique slant on the events unfolding.<br/><br/>THEY ALSO MANAGED to threw in just enough new and different elements to make it all new. Just when a viewer believes he has it all figured out, we find out NOT!<br/><br/>THERE WAS NOT one area of the production that does not fall short of the ultimate degree of quality. In every department, near perfection was achieved. The style of direction, the mime-like acting, the general appearance of the actors and the fine use of a strict Art Decco motif in set decor and even in the title cards, all ring true and equal possibly the best recreation of a silent feature film ever.*** <br/><br/>IN ADDITION TO all there previously mentioned elements, this film never seems to take itself too seriously; never going too long without the injection of a little dose of humor. The inclusion of the trained dog, indulging us with some well executed tricks and the use of the name of ""Peppy Miller"" as the new star's name, while the cast includes real life actress, Penelope Miller, in a major role.<br/><br/>WITH THE RELEASE of this Academy Award Winner, THE ARTIST, the Hollywood set has given us what it so seldom does, something original!<br/><br/>OTE:* This RKO feature starred Constance Bennett,Lowell Sherman and a young Nr. Neil Hamiton, who is best remembered for work in the sunset years of his life as Commissioner Gordon on the ""BATMAN"" TV Show (Greenway/20th Century-Fox/ABC TV, 1966-68).<br/><br/>NOTE:** Three very familiar Technicolor versions came out in 1937, 1954 and 1976, staring,respectively: Janet Gaynor & Frederic March, Judy Garland & James Mason, Barbara Streisand & Chris Christopherson. Yes, the 3rd release did somewhat depart from Hollywood for the Music business.<br/><br/>NOTE:*** Some may argue that THE ARTIST includes a soundtrack with music, sound effects and a brief run of dialog, making it a Sound Movie. We argue that it is still essentially a Silent; much in the same way that Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES sported music, sound fx and brief on screen voices."

It is definitely worth watching: amazing performances, great story, stunning visuals and magical music.

"miguela194","10","2","4","17 April 2012"," The Artist: A heartfelt ode to silent cinema
","""Less is more."" No phrase can better describe this magnificent movie by French director Michel Hazanavicius. In the years, decades since movies gained their voice, what has been produced as a result? A lot of good films, as well as a lot of bad films. Definitely nothing perfect, but after so many years of seeing the same formula, one always looks back to simpler, happier times. The 1920s, otherwise known as The Roaring Twenties, when jazz, liquor, and the movies ruled the United States, was such a time. With filmmaking having transformed, no longer a form of artistic expression, but a scheme for making money, how, just how, can that artistic value be saved? The answer, according to Hazanavicius: take it right back to its roots, back to where it all began.<br/><br/>The Artist compresses the entire history of the transition of silent film to the age of ""talkies"" within the course of just under two hours. It's about a silent film star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), who, in 1927, is a superstar, with his chiseled good looks, jolly attitude, acrobatic tricks, and his faithful, energetic dog (Uggie). While greeting his fans and the press after a premiere, Valentin meets a pretty young woman, whom, after trying to find her dropped purse, finds herself right in front of the famous film star. Ever the jovial spirit, Valentin poses for pictures with the girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), which makes headlines the following day.<br/><br/>Peppy, an aspiring actress, is inspired by this encounter with her idol to audition for roles. Although initially turned down by the producer, Al Zimmer (John Goodman), she soon gets a role as an extra with Valentin's assistance. Valentin continues to be a big figure in Hollywood while Peppy is, at first, put in small roles. Then comes the introduction of sound...<br/><br/>...And to say more would be giving away too much.<br/><br/>In addition to having the technical aspects, The Artist has the soul and feel of a silent movie. It tells its story mainly through imagery, and just a few necessary cue cards. When we see how Valentin reacts when seeing the sound recording, his look plants worry, both in him and us. Likewise, when viewing a montage of posters, we see just how the fortunes of characters change.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of superb. Arguably, the face that will stay with you long after the movie's over is Jean Dujardin's, as George Valentin. He takes a leaf from the books of Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino, giving Valentin a confident hero's smile and merry personality, though unlike the above actors, Dujardin doesn't focus merely on the actor side of Valentin. He goes deep into the human side of Valentin, that concealed, vulnerable side which Fairbanks and Valentino never let the press take photos of. As we learn more about his personal life, Valentin, whom we greet at first with just simple admiration and consider a hero, gradually becomes a sympathetic, real human being, someone who warrants our compassion and our (no exaggeration here) love, and who we want to succeed in the end.<br/><br/>The other important actor in the film is Bérénice Bejo as Peppy Miller. The actress has that lively energy that goes hand in hand with Dujardin's, and their chemistry is flawless. Their characters are the other's anchors; they keep each other up in times of misfortune for either of them. Likewise, Peppy, who starts off as just a girl who wants to make it in the big time, becomes a person who, like Valentin, deserves our sympathy. She remains a sensible individual, and never loses herself in her dreams even as they become reality.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is comprised of many great actors, all of whom do a great job, even if only for a few minutes. Among such well-regarded actors include John Goodman as the stereotypical overweight, bureaucratic producer Al Zimmer, James Cromwell as Clifton, Valentin's loyal butler, and Penelope Ann Miller as Doris, Valentin's strict, emotionally distant wife.<br/><br/>It should be noted that, although The Artist is filmed in the U.S., it's primarily a French production. Certain actors, like Goodman, Cromwell, and Miller, and executive producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, are American, but the lead actors (Dujardin, Bejo) and director Hazanavicius are big names in French cinema. But therein lies the magic of The Artist: the silence unites all actors, and all notions of nationality are forgotten. The silence makes them universal, so there's nothing foreign about them.<br/><br/>The Artist is one of those films that's so different from other films of its time that it merits recognition and praise. A silent movie that's made in a time when silent film is considered obsolete, The Artist is both a touching, heartfelt homage to silent cinema and a beautiful, emotionally profound film.<br/><br/>So I'd like to end this review by writing a famous quote that's said in a few certain theaters before showing a film:<br/><br/>""Silence is golden."" Yes. Yes it is. Rated PG-13. Four stars out of four."

I will admit that I've been an incurable fan of silent film since I witnessed my first non-talkie in the mid-1980s (Chaplin's ""City Lights""), so much so that my view of film as a medium has never been the same. However, ignore the baseless negative commentary, go see this masterpiece (this wonderful homage to all that was silent cinema), and be completely spellbound and enraptured in a darkened theater like you never have before."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>Was is a good idea to make a silent black&white movie in the age of ""Avatar""? - yes, (if you have an idea, passion to do this and not a lot of money). Is ""The Artist"" a good movie? - definitely. Is it worth of the awards it won? - definitely. Now the main question - was it wort of winning the Oscar for the Best Movie of the year? In my opinion - no.<br/><br/>As i said, ""The Artist"" is great movie, charming movie, made with a good idea, wonderful performances of two leading actors, and with a nice score. And yet, i would prefer ""The Descendants"" of taking home the Oscar for a best movie. It's when i first time heard all the buzz about ""The Artist"", and the love it portraits to Hollywood's ""history"", i could bet on everything that we already have a Best Oscar winner for 2011. It's a ""perfect"" winner. After watching it, i disagree with this award. Why? Here comes an ugly word for a movie review - it's just ""small"". The world's best film of the year never ever should look ""small"". <br/><br/>And yet, i truly recommending to see this movie to anyone who doesn't scare to spend an hour and a half with a silent black&white movie, you will have a really good time. And Bravo to Jean Dujardin - his performance blew my away. <br/><br/>By the way, just the fact, Michel Hazanavicius is a real native form Lithuania."

","This film is extraordinary, it stands out from the crowd. Only a gifted mind can create such a masterpiece. I loved the director's perspective of the Cinema at that time, a genuine appreciation of silent movies.<br/><br/>'The Artist' describes life itself perfectly, it shows how the changing and cruel society treats the human being and how difficult is to come through an inability. Both the main actors are magnificent in their roles. Jean Dujardin's lovely smile and Bérénice Bejo's classic beauty are remarkable. A special mention for the dog too.<br/><br/>Ironically, with this film, the French have scored a great goal against the massive American film industry."

","This is a good movie. The idea is not original but performance is. I must mention very skillful direction and excellent French cast (Americans here were only for marketing purposes, I presume). The story is a cliché but carried out in a perfect and original manner. Also, the movie is not completely silent (given the longest musical score ever, except for musicals, an two spoken lines at the end).<br/><br/>I guess that this movie won an Academy award because the Academy itself is filled with old and nostalgic people (that would also explain an Oscar for ""Hugo"", movie far below average, but with same nostalgic elements) who wanted to give something away before they die.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here. ""The Artist"" is a very good movie, and it is an European flick (a very important remark here). Hollywood has no such skill to produce it. Highly recommended."

In the art and entertainment world what better way to entertain than to produce a quality throw back. It works in music and it certainly worked for this gem of a production, thanks especially to best actor Dujardin whose energy and expressiveness carries the movie magnificently.(spoiler) Even without dialog, the score and music fill in nicely, and the nostalgia and period is warmly present. I also enjoyed the scenes with the dog. What a great way to bring back a connection with the past."

The movie's lead actor, Jean Dujardin, is not only sympathetic to watch (no easy task without the benefit of a speaking role), but also gives a very fine performance. I loved the music in this movie. I'm not sure if I will have the same experience, but the music kind of makes me want to see other silent movies that actually came from that era!<br/><br/>Prior to the Academy awards, I had seen about three interviews with Harvey Weinstein. It seems that, if not for his actions, The Artist would never have been so widely released and would never have made it to the awards show. I feel that there should have been more shout outs to him, each time The Artist received an award.<br/><br/>But, having said that, I still enjoyed the movie very much."
"itamarscomix","8","2","4","12 February 2012"," So much fun
","I confess that I'm a sucker for films about filmmaking; I love them in every form, shape and color. As a result I probably would have liked The Artist no matter what. It's a good movie by any measure, though; a beautiful homage to the Hollywood of the 20's, made with incredible amounts of love and respect. The black and white cinematography is perfectly gorgeous; it echoes the style of the 20's but with a more sensitive modern touch that makes every shot a work of art. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo both deliver wonderful performances; Dujardin in particular was clearly born to act in silent films. James Cromwell is also terrific, even if some of the others, like John Goodman, don't fit in as well. The Artist is entertaining, funny and also quite touching, Dujardin delivering huge amounts of emotion without talking.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece, though, nor is it the best movie of the year. The basic premise was explored long ago in Singing in the Rain, and The Artist doesn't have the same kind of timeless staying power; nor does it have the cynical wit of Mel Brooks' Silent Movie. The Artist is first and foremost a homage and a call-back, and it could have easily have gone for a completely different plot. It works for what it is; some clever things are done with the format, especially the first dream sequence. But in its basis it remains not much more than a very good silent movie, lots of fun for cinephiles and film history lovers - actually, scratch that: it's lots of fun for everyone."
"sbwk","10","2","4","11 February 2012"," Charming, clever, tribute to the movies -- but is there a Shyamalan twist?
","There are plenty of reviews of this inspired film, so I won't repeat what many others have said.<br/><br/>One thing about the lead character, George Valentin, that I have not seen mentioned: Is part of this story that the character is gay? Not that there's anyth (sorry, I won't even finish that) ... but considering the film from that angle, it may even make the love story between George and Peppy more poignant, because it's a loving friendship.<br/><br/>What makes me think this might be so: When his wife is about to leave George, she says ""I'm unhappy."" His response: ""So are millions of us."" Millions of who? Was this a reference to the studios' covering up of the orientations of their leading men? Was his wife merely a beard?<br/><br/>What else makes me this: The relationship that develops between Peppy and George is only platonic -- we never even see a romantic kiss. If you look back on it from this perspective, it's almost like the big twist in The Sixth Sense: Oh, he was (fill in the blank) all along!<br/><br/>This might even explain George's reluctance to appear in talkies. At the end, we hear his French accent ... But could it be that there was more to it than that, and that there was something else George feared the new technology would reveal?<br/><br/>And there are many references to George's ""pride"" being his undoing. What kind of pride, George? Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it is one more coincidence.<br/><br/>If I've written any of this in an insensitive way to anyone, my apologies -- I hope that's not the case. This just seems like a potentially big deal. It's almost like The Artist had one more trick of the early films up its sleeve in how it slyly camouflages this fact about its star."

","'THE ARTIST': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>2011's 'Best Picture' Oscar front-runner (as well as 9 other nominations) and the most critically acclaimed movie of the year is this black-and-white silent film! It stars 'Best Actor' Academy Award nominee Jean Dujardin and 'Best Supporting Actress' nominee Berenice Bejo. The film was written and directed by Berenice's husband, 'Best Director' and 'Best Original Screenplay nominee, Michel Hazanavicius. I didn't find the film to be quite as good as all the awards and critical acclaim it's received but it's definitely a very unique and original film going experience. <br/><br/>The film is set in 1927 Hollywood during the last great days of silent film. It focuses on one of the biggest stars of that era: (the fictional) George Valentin (Dujardin). Valentin feels his marriage, sanity and everything else he holds near and dear fall apart when he starts to become a fading star from a bygone era due to the arrival of talking films. A young rising starlet named Peppy Miller (Bejo), that he helped give a career boost to, fondly watches over him though as he continues to drift into destitution and madness. <br/><br/>The movie is a shining example of creative art and love for cinema, in that way I definitely admire it. It's also an honest story of self-indulgence, excessive pride and depression. Not the uplifting romance some people might be expecting but a quality drama nonetheless. The directing, art design, cinematography and acting are all exceptional. Is it the best film of the year?

"The_Film_Cricket","4","2","4","21 December 2011"," What a wonderful love letter to the cinema!
","What a glorious movie this is! What a wonderful love letter to the cinema! And what a risk it was to make this film in the 21st century at a time when Hollywood studios would rather swim in safer waters then venture out and take a risk. Here is a silent film, shot in gorgeous black and white that tells a familiar story, yet breaks free of being a gimmick and becomes one of the most touching and magical films of the year.<br/><br/>The story resembles most of the great epics about Hollywood, most especially A Star is Born, with a little of Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Blvd thrown in for good measure. It takes place in 1927, at a time when the art of the silent film was about the washed out by the advent of a new process called 'sound'. Many of the biggest stars in motion pictures were about to have their careers obliterated by this new process, especially those who were well into middle age - studios wanted young actors with young voices.<br/><br/>Standing at the precipice of this tidal wave of technology is George Valentin, a dashing romantic leading man whose fan-base mostly consists of giggling young girls (think of Douglas Fairbanks and you've got the idea). He is the star of a series of simple-minded action and romantic epics, usually featuring his trusty side-kick, an adorable Jack Russell Terrier named Uggy. George is happy in his life, although his wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) nags and complains that she's not only bored stiff, but uptight about his female admirers. George is a very likable fellow, genial, funny, romantic, with a handsome face and a charming, ever-present smile. He isn't smug at all. He loves his fans and, near the film's opening, he spots a young wanna-be actress named Peppy Miller and touches her heart. She is smitten by him, and it is difficult for him not to be smitten by her. He gets her work, starting as an extra and, very quickly, her career is off and running.<br/><br/>The initial introduction to sound doesn't ruffle George at all. Cigar-chomping studio chief Al Zimmer (John Goodman) is convinced that this is the future, but George isn't too concerned. ""If that's the future"", he laughingly tells Zimmer, ""You can have it!"" Soon, however, he finds that the process is no laughing matter and he is out of work. Desperate to stay in the business, he makes a bold move, financing a silent film himself with his own money, a silly adventure film that ends – prophetically - with George's character sinking into quicksand.<br/><br/>Financially ruined, George loses everything, Doris leaves him, and his only companions are Uggy, and his faithful driver Clifton (James Cromwell) who won't leave George's side even when he's been fired. Meanwhile, the movie bombs, and ironically opens the same day as another picture, a spy epic starring none-other than new star Peppy Miller. His kindness to her comes back, as she tries to help him boost his defunct career The results of the story aren't exactly surprising to anyone familiar with the formula of most silent films. What makes The Artist work is how much fun we have watching those old Hollywood movie conventions played out in fresh ways. This is no stale recreation, writer-director Michel Hazanavicius turns his film into something truly special, playing with our perceptions and reminding us of a time when Hollywood movies had a dream-like quality, before ""The Method"", when the prepared theatricality of motion pictures made us feel as if we were stepping into another world. He has fun with the over-dramatic moments that underline George's despair. He even has fun with the title cards, especially during one crucial moment when we think one thing has happened and it turns out to be something else – you'll know the one I'm talking about. Ever single facet of this film is extraordinary, from Guillaume Schiffman gorgeous black and white camera work, to Ludovic Bource' invaluable score that not-only punctuates the action but also touches our hearts at just the right moment. The Art Direction by Gregory Hooper doesn't try to find a realistic note, but tries to make everything look and feel like a set. And I must make mention of Mark Bridges' costumes, not only perfectly period, but perfectly luminous.<br/><br/>Yet, none of this would mean anything without the performances, especially by Jean Dujardin as George, a French actor that I am unfamiliar with whose performance here got him the Best Actor prize at Cannes. He looks and acts so much like a Hollywood leading man of the 1920's that we forget that this is a modern-day actor in his mid 30s. He has a charm and a casual ease on the screen that makes us totally comfortable with him. We like him, we care about him and he makes the movie work. <br/><br/>Movies like this are so rare. They inform us of all the things that movies were made for, to transport us to another time and place, and to allow us to enter a dreamy world if only for a couple of hours. The effect of this film on a true movie lover is not explained, it is only experienced. How effective is it? Let me put it this way: There is a moment early in the film, when Peppy enters alone into George's office. She finds his coat on a hanger. She slips her right arm into the empty left sleeve and wraps the arm around herself. It is so tender and so touching that it reminds us why we go to the movies."

We don't need dialogue, the gesture is enough to tell the story. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are like two characters with reciprocity, are interconnected, inspire each other, so are the actors.

","#TheArtist (2011) :
Brief Review -<br/><br/>Silence speaks louder than Words ! An Extraordinary Storytelling of an Ordinary Story by French Cinema. Experimental Film-making at its Best! The Artist takes you back to 1927-1932 when Silent films were ruling Hollywood untill Talkies arrived. The story of The Artist is written by Michel Hazanavicius and seems like he was a great fan of ""The star Is Born"" (1937) and ""Singin' In The Rain"" (1952) and he wanted to remake these films but morally couldn't do the copy paste so he decided to write a fresh story which will be a combination of these 2 retro Classics. The Artist is about a popular silent movie star George and a rising actress Peppy who later becomes sensation in talkies era whereas George sees a fall down due to the shutdown of silent films. They begin an unknown relationship in thier first two meetings but their careers set in opposite directions. Like i said the story of the film is ordinary and predictable but the storytelling is Marvellous. When Silence speaks louder than Words you can't miss the experience. The Artist could have been an average film if the Storytelling wasn't on high level like this. Every scene has deep meaning and hidden intellectual cuts we must notice. Entertaining elements doesn't make it look dark therefore it is hard to find a boring moment in this grippy runtime of 100 Minutes. If you ever wish to learn about quality filmmaking and how to put high range nuances in cinematic frame then The Artist is a complete syllabus for you. I loved it. I loved to point out those nuances in expressions, body frames, sound effects, cinematography and directorial efforts. Jean Dujardin packs a solid punch as an artist, yes i mean it, i didn't say actor i said artist because i haven't seen such an artistically brilliant performance like this recently. He took away a bunch of awards and he deserved all those. Bérénice Bejo is fantastic too, she managed to leave an impression during so many scenes. The silenct mourn by her looked even more emotional and impactful than any other mourn with sound. I have got couple of complaints for the writer because i had to call it an Ordinary story for some reasons. George's character character was a misfit to his behaviour. A popular star and a genius filmmaker having so much of pride and arrogant wasn't acceptable. He doesn't enjoy a happy married life and reasons are unknown (he didn't have any affairs). He declined working in the talking films as if he was a god and then it went untill suicide which seemed contradictional. At least he should have tried and failed, it would have at least made sense (negatively it would have hurt the climax). It seemes like Peppy Loved him since they first met but she never proposed him (same from the other side by George), she flirted with other young fellas but kept caring for him simultaneously. The relationship between George and Peppy was never explored neither it gets one crystal clear statement. It would have been better if they had either committed thier love or the respect for each other as an Artists but unanswered scenerio makes it go rough. Michel Hazanavicius did some mistakes as a writer but as a director there is not complaint to make, it was so perfect. Hats off.. This one would be a lesson for all the people who dream to become a great director. Don't miss The Artist and don't you dare blink or move your sight from display or you will miss some cinematic masterstrokes. I hate Oscars but i love you for choosing this experiemental French Classic as Best Picture of 2011.<br/><br/>RATING - 8/10*"

","I don't like to watch a movie under the conditions of understanding the plot, which will make me have preconceived ideas and affect my understanding of the emotions I want to express in the film. Therefore, this movie gave me a great surprise when it was completely unknown to me. In the first ten minutes of the film, I always thought that the silent film part would end soon. I never thought that the whole movie was a silent film. When I thought that there would be no sound throughout, the sound appeared in George 's dream in about thirty minutes. This is one of my favorite designs in the whole film: After touching the sound film, George had a nightmare, There were sounds in the cups, puppies, and footsteps in my dreams, and even the laughter of women, and the loud noise of feathers landing on the floor, but George could not speak, he could not make any sound. This dream fully illustrates George's rejection of, resistance to, and timidity in his heart. He believes that real art does not need to be expressed by sound, so he was eliminated by the times. The silent movie he insisted on did not achieve the ideal box office, and it happened to catch up with the stock market crash. As a result, he went bankrupt and his wife left him.<br/><br/>The character set of the actor is perfect-elegant gentleman, personable, humorous and cheerful, is a star of great attention. The heroine also fell in love with him. Although the heroine was also tempted by the heroine, the two did not cross that line. He told her actress, who had just entered the film industry that she was unknown, that she must have her own characteristics in order to become famous, so he painted a mole for her. Although the two people gradually lost their intersection, she was very popular in the sound movie. Later, the two had some misunderstandings, but she never gave up on him, she knew his pride, his self-esteem, and always helped him silently. In fact, this love is a bit cliché, but it touched me. ""Bang!"" On the screen when the man committed suicide is really a small joke of the director. It turned out that it was only the car of the woman who hit the tree at such a nervous time. She rescued him, and I couldn't help but smile when I saw here. Silent film can bring me such intense mood swings that I absolutely did not expect. A loyal driver, a smart dog, I am very touched by many parts of this movie. It was such a simple, pure feeling, no color, no sound, but it deeply moved my heart.<br/><br/>So, does real art need language? One of the most interesting points of this movie is that the male host still accepted the sound movie at the end. He did not turn over because he insisted on the silent movie. There was still a sound at the end of the movie, which shows that the choice of the era is still the expression of language and Communication; but as a silent film, the film is not the only dialogue at the end, and there is no word in the fierce situation conflict, but it finally defeated many well-made films and won many Oscar awards in one fell swoop. Even if the art of the artist can get away from the language, can it reach the heart of the audience? And the film ""Love Tears"" filmed and directed by the male lead in the film, although there is not too much display, but I can still feel that it is a touching story, so it can not be said that the male lead's attachment to silent movies Completely fail. I also thought of a movie I watched many years ago-""Assassin Nie Yinniang"". The whole film does not have a few lines, but it gives people a sense of loneliness. Isn't this the power of silent art?<br/><br/>The success of this film is largely due to the fascinating acting of the male lead. The performance of other characters is also remarkable. The best is the performance of the dog. The blockade of biting the trousers hard while committing suicide is amazing. In such an ever-changing era, even retro silent films will inevitably be contaminated with the taste of technology and form a unique style. It is outstanding because it is not a simple imitation and copy of silent film, but because it is full of an attitude of returning to the heart and pursuing art. The simplicity of this emotion makes this movie pleasing to the eye. Regardless of the ever-changing forms of film expression, we should uphold a sincere heart. Only by treating the movie and the audience with sincerity can we achieve truly great art."

A time when we didn't have to be clobbered over the head with blatant behaviors, over the top actions and, again, puerile imagery. All to sell a movie.<br/><br/>I found myself smiling practically from beginning to end, with a few moments of tears welled up in the eyes for good measure.<br/><br/>And the dog was comic icing on the cake.

","Set in 1927, when the advent of ""talkies"" ended the career of many an actor and actress, ""The Artist"" is a little French film that took the world by storm, even though it is a black-and-white silent movie. How can a silent movie be a musical you ask? Don't miss seeing this film and finding out for yourself. The performances of Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo are musical throughout the film in many ways, and the closing dance number tells more about the transition from silent to sound than Al Jolson did more than eight decades ago. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013"

","When motion pictures were invented in the last years of the 19th Century it was a huge revolution, and as shorts and features were made they were highly popular, but the bigger revolution came with the introduction of sound, in the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, so silent pictures faded away about two years later, but this was a magnificent return to that golden age of cinema that I was very excited to watch. Basically, set in 1925, George Valentin (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jean Dujardin) is a huge star of the silent films, and while attending the premiere of his latest picture A Russian Affair he bumps into a beautiful admiring fan, Peppy Miller (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bérénice Bejo), and they pose in photographs together that go on the front page of many newspapers and magazines. Peppy meets George again attending dance auditions, and he insists with the studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) she has a part in his new film they are making, and as she appears in more and more pictures her stardom grows larger. Two years later, and Zimmer announces silent picture productions will no longer be made, with the introduction of sound, but George insists that it is a fad and will not get audiences flocking to the cinemas, but in fact they do. With the popularity of ""talking pictures"" growing rapidly, and George's movie stardom fading, he tries his hand at making his own silent film, Tears of Love, with all his own money put in, but he is devastated to see that it opens the same day as one of Peppy's new sound films, and he is left broke and depressed as a consequence of its failure. George's wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) throws him out and he is forced to move in with his valet Clifton (James Cromwell), who he soon fires as he can't afford to pay him anymore, and with the 1929 stock market crash he is forced to sell off his personal effects to make some money back. Peppy meanwhile has become a huge star of talking pictures, thanks largely to the man who found her, and suggested her iconic mole above the mouth look, but George meanwhile has let pride get the better of him, and in a drunken and angry state he destroys all his film reels, starting a fire in his home. His faithful and trained acting Dog (Uggie) gets help and he is put in hospital with only moderate injuries suffered, and Peppy visits him, also to take him home with her to recover, and he finds Clifton working there as well. Peppy suggests he should let go of his pride and make a sound picture with her, and she demands this to Zimmer or she will quit the studio, while George himself discovers to his shock that Peppy is the one who bought all his personal effects in the auction. He returns to his burnt home, and he contemplates suicide with his gun, but Peppy arrives to stop him, and they reconcile with each other, and she reveals he has secured a role in a new film with her, but he still worries whether he still be liked speaking in a film. So they compromise and make a musical film together, and we see their fabulous tap dance together, and this is the point when sound enters and Zimmer applauds them, saying ""Cut! Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?"", and with a French accent George says ""With pleasure."", and they continue filming. Also starring Missi Pyle as Constance, Malcolm McDowell as The Butler, Beth Grant as Peppy's Maid and Ed Lauter as Peppy's Butler. Dujardin gives a wonderful performance as the charmer who almost loves himself and slowly goes downhill with his silent movie career dying, Bejo is also wonderful as the beautiful rising star who embraces sound pictures and goes from strength to strength, together they are a sweet couple as well, the other stars of the film with their facial expressions being key also do well, especially the adorable Uggie the dog who steals many of the scenes he is in with his clever tricks. This is not only a great homage to great films in the ""silent era"", where stars like Sir Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy were made, but filmed in black and white, with intertitles for dialogue, and set in Hollywood at the time that sound was introduced to film, it also serves as an accurate interpretation of how important this motion picture revolution was. The film only delves into sound three times, first for a nightmare where simple and increasing volume noises overpower and the lead character remains silent, second for a song, and thirdly obviously for the ending, but it has spectacular music (including a recognisable theme from Vertigo) to help tell the story and create the emotions, and overall it sticks with authentic traditions and conventions of a silent film. It is a remarkable recreation of past cinema, full of all the emotions you would hope for, and an astonishing power to entertain without having to rely on what now is an important feature, it really does feel like something made in the time, an amazing, genius, must see silent romantic drama masterpiece. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Director for Michel Hazanavicius, Best Music for Ludovic Bource and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Hazanavicius, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay.

Without the use of audible dialogue the actors are forced to convey their performances through subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body language, a feat which they accomplish with flying colors; this can be viewed as both a crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of a defunct era in filmmaking, as well as a study of two immensely talented individuals and how they deal with the differing trajectories of their respective careers.

","As you start contemplating which current Oscar contenders to check out, might I recommend a recent Oscar winner THE ARTIST<br/><br/>I know, quite a few of you are saying ""but, it's a SILENT movie! I want SOUND!"" I am here to tell you – ""NO, YOU DON'T"". A picture is worth a thousand words – besides, how many words are there in those comic books you read!<br/><br/>For those of you with memory issues – The Artist is a black and white SILENT movie set in Hollywood in the waning days of the Silent Movie era and the burgeoning days of the ""talkies"". It follows a dashing Hollywood Silent Movie Leading Man, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin in a deservedly Oscar-winning turn) as he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the change to ""talkies"" and the consequences that ensue. Dujardin is appropriately charming in this role without being annoying and he becomes the kind of hero that you will want to root for.<br/><br/>The surprise, to me, in this movie is Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller – the up and coming actress that embraces (and, in turn, is embraced by) the ""talkies"". In what could have been a standard ""A Star is Born"" turn, Bejo gives Peppy a spunkiness and charm that shows on screen. Remember, this is a SILENT movie, so anything that any of these actors do has to be conveyed through their faces – and Bejo's face speaks volumes. She was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance – and lost to Meryl Streep's powerhouse portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY – while I really enjoyed Streep's performance, and thought her Oscar was deserving, I preferred her performance over Streep. I can't believe I'm saying that, but it is true, nonetheless. I encourage you to judge for yourself.<br/><br/>As far as the other performances go, John Goodman steals just about every scene that he is in (of course) as the head of the studio, Al Zimmer. Goodman had a good 2011 having scene stealing supporting roles in not only this movie, but FLIGHT (a must see) and ARGO (an even bigger must see). Another supporting player that clearly steals every scene he is in from DuJardin, Bejo, Goodman (and everyone else) is Uggie, the Jack Russell Terrier as Valentin's faithful friend, confident and savior. I usually turn a cold heart to animal performances, but this one was touching and effective without becoming cloying.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with my arms folded across my chest in a clear ""I hear this is good, it better be"" attitude and was rewarded with a charming, fun, nostalgic and often-times touching experience. I would strongly recommend this to you and your family (certainly children in their teenage years would/should enjoy this). 9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)."

","Set at the end of the 1920's George Valentin is one of the top silent movie actors working in Hollywood and he enjoys the attention and success which this brings him. He accidentally bumps into aspiring actress Peppy Miller who idolises George and they begin to work together. He sees something in her, he knows she is talented but she needs to stand out from the crowd. And with George's help she does just this.<br/><br/>However, as Peppy gets more work and starts to become successful George has peaked in his career and as studio bosses stop the silent movie productions and move to the new 'talkies' he finds himself out of work. As he falls out of favour but Peppy is a sensation in the new medium and she becomes the biggest star in Hollywood.<br/><br/>We see George losing his wife, his home and dignity. However, always by his side is his dog and butler Clifton (Cromwell). At times George's canine companion is a scene stealer but he is magnificent to watch and brings humour even in unlikely scenes and you can't help but smile.<br/><br/>Shot in black and white and in 1:33 aspect ratio the film is true to the early days of cinema. From the wonderful opening credits through to the brilliant score which complements the story. Hazaanvicius has really captured the essence of the silent movie, a daunting task which is made easier by his excellent cast. Dujardin and Bejo excel in their respective roles and their chemistry is a joy to watch. Both are not only excellent actors but mesmerising dancers with routines which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers would be proud of.<br/><br/>I sat in a cinema which only had a few other patrons in it. I was able to sit at the back of the cinema directly under the projection booth. This added to the atmosphere as I could hear the workings of the projector, the mechanical sounds really complimented the silent film and I would urge anyone who goes to see this film to sit as close to the projector as possible.<br/><br/>Please go and see this film. It is a master class of early cinema which is compelling and enjoyable to watch. This film will not appeal to everyone and I had my own reservations about it before viewing it. However, I'm glad I did and you will be too."
"Marc_Israel_365","6","3","8","13 October 2013"," A charming allegory of silent films
","I am amongst the club that prefers ""anthying but Hollywood blockbuster"" films that refuse to take themselves seriously, whose story lines are so simple that many would consider them insulting..... and yet ""The Artist"" is much of this when you get down to it. It IS a Hollywood story, but what is fascinating is the context of presenting silent film making through silent film production. The music tells us what we haven't already filled in for plot, extra dialog not framed for us, as well as character motivation. This is fantastic direction of artists, but an homage, not a new art form in itself. Our stars are very accommodating and overtly charming, but not amongst the numerous earth shattering performances that we're accustomed to seeing in Oscar winning experiences. Simply put, that would be out of context of the film, as would a true serious nature (and dialog, for that matter). ""The Artist"" is a story about the perils of pride and progress. The experience is a recreation of a well emancipated nostalgia. At the end of the day, ""The Artist"" is a cute and charming diversion."
"SnoopyStyle","7","3","8","14 September 2013"," More homage than something new
","OK I get it. It's black and white. I don't want to play the meathead who can't appreciate the artistry of The Artist. But I don't think it's as profound as some have made it. There's a reason that kind of film went away and hasn't return in any significant way for 3/4 century. And I don't see this as a trend either.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin is pretty good playing broad as the matinée heartthrob who couldn't make it in sound. Bérénice Bejo is also pretty good. Without sound, that's one aspect that is missing from their performance and it feels the absence. If there was one way to break thru for me, it's to add much more physicality to the movie. Think of Buster Keaton, or Charlie Chaplin. The action is more cute than daring. The story is also cute and functional. Certainly there nothing ground breaking going on. The whole thing feels more like a homage to the silent era than creating something brand new."

"bob the moo","Null","3","8","29 January 2012"," Charming and warming story told with style and a wit that rises above it being a gimmick
","From a viewer's point of view this time of the year is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because so many good or worthy films are out in the cinemas because the awards season is just arriving – so it sort of works as the opposite end of the spectrum to the summer season where all the ""special effects"" movies gather, December/January is where all the potential award winners clump up. The downside of this is that some of them can be overly worthy button pushers looking for awards in a shameless way but also that genuinely good films can be over-hyped. This unfortunately happened with The Artist – the praise was all at an extreme so of course the backlash is equally extreme as people go expecting the film to be the most perfect thing ever, only to find that it is only a really good little film.<br/><br/>And this is what The Artist is – a really good little film that tells a simple story in an effective and charming way, using the device of being a silent film to very good effect. I'm not sure what some of those criticising it expected to see, but I guess it is hard to not be disappointed whenever every poster on every bus and every review in every newspaper seems to be suggesting it is the most brilliant thing ever – which it isn't. I really enjoyed it though and thought it was as clever as it was simple, producing funny bits but also moments that I was surprised they were as touching as they were. The plot sees a Hollywood actor in the silent pictures at the top of his game who falls on hard times when talkies see his fans deserting him – all as a young starlet who he gave a break to rises in popularity thanks to her part in the talkies. It is a simple story but it plays out very well and the lack of dialogue really doesn't hurt the film at all – it just helps create the era for the viewer.<br/><br/>It is never hilarious but it is consistently amusing but of more surprise to me was how moving and sensitive it was - the story is simple but yet it engages and charms. The cast are a big part of this because they give performances that match the ""big expression"" nature of silent film acting but they also deliver in the smaller moments so that it is not just the words they are saying that they show, but also their feelings and thoughts. Dujardin in particular does so much without a single word and I very much enjoyed how he led the film. Likewise Bejo is very OTT in her expression but manages to make it work while also being charming and natural at the same time. I'm not sure why faces like Goodman, Cromwell, Pyle, McDowell and others were all in here but they were nice finds in supporting roles. As director and writer Hazanavicius has done a great job and he deserves his Oscar nominations for this.<br/><br/>Overall The Artist is a lovely little film with a simple story that is told with invention, wit and charm. No matter how many awards it wins it will not cure you of your diseases or change how you approach life – so if you walk in with that expectation because of the hype then you will be disappointed, but come to it for what it is and you will find that it easily charms and entertains you."

","I have never written a review of a current film, but if there ever was one that deserved the time it takes to input this, THE ARTIST is it! It's outrageously terrific and the film-makers deserve 10/10 for their audacity. Jean Dujardin is wonderful in the role of a silent screen star and the sets, costumes and ambiance are very true to the period. There are many memorable - in fact, unforgettable - moments in this gem. At a screening in Los Angeles, John Goodman said that, like in silent films, the actors were improvising dialog as they went but because Dujardin and Bejo were speaking in French and Goodman in English, it was very difficult to concentrate. Bejo added that director Hazanvicius had music playing during filming. Hazanavicius has shown from his homage to the O.S.S. spy films of the 60's, that he can recreate filmic styles. THE ARTIST was a much more difficult venture. To even attempt a silent black and white film is completely counter-intuitive in today's marketplace, but trust the French to pull it off! The bottom line is - it REALLY WORKS."

","I give the producers and director enormous credit for being so bold as to make a SILENT, BLACK & WHITE feature in the year 2011. Jean DuJardin deserves all the awards there are for his fabulous embodiment (veritable channeling!) of a long list of great silent leading men, including Douglas Fairbanks (Senior & Junior!), Rudolf Valentino, Ramon Navarro, etc. But sadly there are a number of key flaws in the realization of this film that completely derail the extraordinary possibilities it offered. For one thing, the director seems not to know that silent films never played at natural speed. Much is made of the fact that silent films were shot at 16 frames per second and sound films at 24 frames per second. While this is a fact, makers of silent films all ""undercranked"" in order to perk up the action. The cameras were even designed to do this because, early on, they became aware that real-time -- without the realism of spoken dialog -- came across as very tedious. And that's exactly what this film is -- tedious. Furthermore, since the movie does eventually break its silence, I must say that the time for that to happen should have been MUCH earlier in the film. It would have been a wonderful touch for sound and dialog (and the revelation of the leading man's accent) to happen at the time that it becomes apparent that sound films have taken over at the box office. Instead, this movie draws it out -- way out -- until the leading man has finally accepted the way of history. It's terribly anticlimactic by then and comes way too late to make a point. Now here's a tip: just to test how this film would play slightly sped up, in the authentic style of silent movies, I watched it again. This time while in PLAY mode I pressed the "">>"" SCAN button just once, to speed up the picture. Voila! Suddenly it's very entertaining -- especially the part with the dog! If you're not a fast reader, you may have to pause briefly to read the narrative cards, but this is the way I would recommend viewing the film. I'm not joking. The music is not affected -- and you will be finished sooner as well."

Berenice Bejo was absolutely stunning.I can see why it was such a hit when it came out.<br/><br/>If this was American-made, it would have sacrificed story for character exposition. Since its a French film, it is an artistic study of an artistic time in Hollywood, when it was about the art (to a degree). A seventh art look at first film American art, so to speak. <br/><br/>It is a shame the silent film revival trend ended with this film.

","Don't get me wrong. I love silent movies. I teach film history classes and use silent movies. Everybody should watch at least ten silent films in their lives. Nevertheless, watching Best Picture winner ""The Artist"" left me feeling genuinely underwhelming. This imaginative homage to silent era cinema when actions spoke louder than words qualifies as trite, tiresome, and interminable. Talented ""O.S.S. 117"" director Michel Hazanavicius has written and helmed a movie about the changing technology in Hollywood on the eve of the Wall Street collapse and the Great Depression. He has forged a debonair matinée idol hero named George Valentin (Jean Dujardin of ""Lucky Luke"") who emerges as a synthesis of Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, and Charles Chaplin. George works at the Kinograph Studios where he is the top draw. The hero gives a new girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo of ""A Knight's Tale""),a break at movie premiere during a incident that the press capture. Eventually, Peppy becomes a big star. She ascends to stardom in talkie pictures. Valentin tries to buck the trend like Charles Chaplin did, but he doesn't fare as successfully at Chaplin. Chaplin made two more silent movies after silent movies saturated the market. Valentin makes ""Tears of Love,"" but this adventure film flops at the box office. He becomes box office poison, while Peppy becomes a stellar attraction. Eventually, the matinée hero slips into a malaise. He has to sell everything, but he doesn't have his heart in living. He fires the only friend that he has ever had, his chauffeur, Clifton, and sends him packing. The co-star of his ""Tin Tin"" like movies, a spunky Jack Russell terrier, remains faithful to him even when he wraps his lips around the barrel of a revolver. He cannot commit suicide, but at this point, you almost wish that he would. The chief problem with ""The Artist"" is that the plot is thinner than a strip of celluloid, while the characters are only slightly advanced. The lethargy sets in during the hero's bout with depression. Happily, despite its indebtedness to ""A Star Is Born,"" everything ends favorably at fadeout, but it is really no surprise. Worse, writer & director Hazanavicius stretches things out far too long. Clocking in at 100 minutes, ""The Artist"" is about 20 minutes too long and the characters lack charisma. The twist of fate that saves Valentin and assures comeback is too contrived to be entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, I've got to tip my critical hat to the Academy for trying to buck the trend. No, I don't think ""The Artist"" deserved any of its Oscars, but it isn't an entirely awful movie. Hazanavicius deserves praise for trying something different, but the difference here doesn't make the difference. Bernard Herrmann's love theme from the Alfred Hitchcock movie ""Vertigo"" adds nothing spectacular, just serves to make thing even more dreary.

","This is a unique film and worth all the industry acclaim it's received.<br/><br/>At first I was stunned at George's resemblance to a grinning Gene Kelly in Singing In The Rain. That lasted for about 5 mins. Then I reached a point that if I had to watch his grimacing for any longer I'd be forced to go wait for my sister in the lobby until the movie finished. 'Luckily' it did stop. Next I watched the beautiful tailoring of the costumes, hair do's (trying to work out if they were Marcel waves). 'Luckily' the story ran slowly enough to need to find other things to look at. Giggle number 1 at The German Affair scene. Nope, couldn't see anybody wearing timberland watches by mistake. Isn't the belt on John Goodman's pants too low? Shouldn't it be up under the armpits or was that a different era? Nice lamps. Restricted camera angles in street scenes so total control over what the audience see. Hmm, what else can keep me occupied until film ends... Oh clever, some sound there to highlight his nightmare while he himself is mute .... Sigh... ouch my coccyx has started aching. Can't get comfy.... Need to straighten legs... Sigh... still 45 mins to go... Giggle number 2 at the dog following the ""BANG"" Now what?? Why have my eyes started watering like crazy. Can't see a thing. Sis, do you have spare tissues in your bag? ... Yes sis, Jean Dujardin is a hottie and it's a great film (teeth clenched).... Oh joy, a final happy tap dancing scene. No longer mute.. french. The End. Sis, (sageful expression) that was probably a reference to silent stars often failing on the switch to talkies because they had rotten voices or heavy foreign accents. So it's awfully clever that George turns out to be french don't you think? <br/><br/>Can't fault the acting/costumes/concept. A must for ""intelligent"" types, film critics and people working in the movie industry."

","I hate to be a party-pooper but for me this is not the greatest movie of recent times. Yes, it's charming, even beguiling - and it's got the most appealing dog in cinema history! - but it's kind of slow and kind of, dare I say, not very original. One man's ""hommage"" is another man's piracy: SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, A STAR IS BORN and SUNSET BOULEVARD are a bit too strongly ""tributed"". Berenice Bejo's Peppy has an androgynous quality that reminded me of Jack Lemmon's Daphne in SOME LIKE IT HOT!<br/><br/>The scene where George has a nightmare with actual sound is surprisingly disturbing, and it's easy to guess there will be another sound scene towards the end. For me the lack of dialogue - and the period Muzakal score - became more than a bit monotonous. It might have worked better if George's scenes had been the only silent ones, with Peppy's and the studio scenes having sound.<br/><br/>The acting - with its ""hammy"" evocation of the silent era - is brilliant, as is the direction and the cinematography. Uggie the tricksy Jack Russell is so cute you want to take him home with you - but I wish I liked the film more."

This truly deserves to make the transition from art-house cinema to every multiplex around the world for its ingenuity, nostalgia, comedy, romance, drama, a wonderful score and the huge feel-good factor (i.e. the dog steals the show and could become one of those famous iconic dogs of cinema, up there with Lassie, Lady, Tramp and the Dalmatians!). There are so many magical and memorable moments from this film and you must see it for yourself to enjoy the full treat.

In the ideal world the artist should be the one who creates freely and mostly bohemian with none of all the materialistic aspects. The film portrait rising star journey of an ambitious girl who is in love of the pictures making and dreaming to be a star, just like her idol 'George Valentine' the great artist of silent movies whom his life will take nose dive as he refused to bow for the wind of change and give in up on his art n beliefs. The Artist is a story of dignified human who fights against the odd and swims against the current to be what he really believes in.

It was a huge risk to produce a B&W silent movie in this day and age, but they've done a magnificent job. It carries you along with charm and wit, and even plays a little with the silent concept, for added spice. The French leads are delightful and involve one right from the start. The acting is superb, right down to the supporting cast, as indeed it has to be to transmit the message without sound. A special mention for James Cromwell, who can be a really nasty character in some of his roles, but here turns in a wonderfully nuanced performance as the loyal chauffeur."

","This is a good movie, but it typically one that is overrated because it shows some kind of class, intellect and refinement to proclaim itself as genius. The production starts with 3 strikes against it. First, at times, it is a movie within a movie. Second, it is in black and white, and third, it is mostly all silent. With all the rave, I was willing to attempt an open mind viewing (zombie films are sometimes in black and white too).<br/><br/>These techniques were done to to give us the flavor of the films of the era. Even though those restored masters are available, who among the 5 star rave reviewers watch them? You could list them on one hand, or maybe one finger. In the silent era, the jokes were visual. The sound track created the mood, more so than it does today, and actors had to make dramatic movements to create emotions. They used their face...a term called ""mugging"" in the film. This was brilliantly brought out in the film, although we already knew that.<br/><br/>The film uses symbolism, such as when our star George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin)career is sinking, it shows him in a film sinking in quicksand. Good yes. Genius? Hardly. The script reminded me of ""A Star is Born"" (pick one) where a star launches the career of a new star only to see his fade. George is ""The Artist"" who believes talkies are not art. Besides the studio no longer wants George. They want fresh faces such as rising star Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo).<br/><br/>I liked the idea of doing the silent movie film to show us the transition from silent to talkies, I just didn't like the predictable script. Plot is important.<br/><br/>No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. You should be able to read lips after this film."

","I'll be short and unusually sweet.<br/><br/>I like the way this movie was made. I like it even more that others have not tried to replicate it since (so far). I'll keep my 'talkies' thank you very much.<br/><br/>From a technical side, the 'full screen' aspect ratio didn't take too long to get used to, in part because the film itself didn't take too long to get into. The design of the picture, everything about it, brings you back and allows you to believe. That's the great thing about movies, they can carry you to a time and era you've never experienced just so you can experience it.<br/><br/>I noticed right away how 'plain' the set decoration and lighting were back then. It would pain me to light a project like this because it's so simple and dull. The DP, Guillaume Schiffman, did do a fantastic job, and like the actors, had to learn a new technique to do his job I'm sure. It's so simple, it works on every level.<br/><br/>About half way through I began to realize how difficult acting in a silent film really is. As an actor in a silent picture you have to work really hard at getting your point across to the audience in actions, and not words; ""mugging"" as character Peppy Miller puts it. In saying that, the actors in this film would have had to train a little differently at being a silent film actor because all they've ever known are 'talkies' and their training as actors follow that basic necessity of today's movies - sound! In today's world, acting is more than just movement.<br/><br/>The Oscar for Best Picture is well deserved. Although this isn't a movie I'll watch over and over, it was a nice switch."

","Every person who is obsessed with movies and filmmaking has that one movie that made them interested in the medium, and for me, that film was The Artist. The film came out in 2011 and it was a black and white silent film, the same way movies were used to be back in the 20's and 30's, in fact, the film takes place in the final days of silent movies when the talkies started to rise, which is how they used to call movies with voice audio, the film is about a famous actor of the silent era and his downfall when this films slowly disappear, and we also see the rise of a young actress in the talkies era and a big part of the film is the relationship that forms between this two and how it changes through the years, what I love about this film is that it feels so much as a love letter to Hollywood and filmmaking in general, even though it was released on 2011, it feels like a piece of cinematic history. The acting is across the board excellent, everyone does an excellent job in convening emotion without saying words and this also comes from excellent direction, you can tell the director really love the medium, the music is also great, it really captures the style of the era is representing. Something that should be noted is that I never felt the movie was slow or boring, I felt constantly entertained, there was always so much movement in every shot, which makes sense considering this was a silent film, this is something very, VERY few people are familiar with nowadays but the pacing felt just right, there isn't really a scene that drags in my opinion. Overall the film is just fantastic and I can't really find much wrong with it, this is the film that awoke my interest in filmmaking and made me start to appreciate films in a way I didn't even considered before."

","2011 saw a lot of very good to outstanding films. After seeing 'The Artist', having heard so much about it but never got round to seeing it, for me it is up there with the best of them and one of the best films seen in a long time.<br/><br/>As someone who loves a lot of films from the silent era, having been vastly entertained by classics from the likes of cinema icons Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, 'The Artist' is magical film-making, a wonderfully endearing homage to the silent era and is much more than just a gimmick like it could easily have been in lesser hands.<br/><br/>For starters, 'The Artist' is gorgeously filmed in black and white with the cinematography along with the likes of 'Drive', 'The Tree of Life' and 'Hugo' being some of the best of the year. One of the most visually exquisite films seen in a long time actually. The music score, with a nice affectionate nod to one of the greatest music scores of all-time Bernard Hermann's 'Vertigo', is whimsical and rich in playfulness and charm, all the time beautifully orchestrated.<br/><br/>'The Artist' was clearly written with a lot of affection, with plenty of funny and poignant moments, and while the storytelling is simple it really uplifts and moves with the atmosphere of the silent era more than convincingly evoked. The direction is also without complaint. The characters endear and entertain, especially George and adorable Uggie, and nothing can be faulted about the acting.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin's lead performance is just wonderful, a more than worthy winner for the best actor award. Bérénice Bejo is similarly charming and has great chemistry with Dujardin, while the talented supporting cast are all stellar with no weak links. As for adorable Uggie, one of the best animal performances on film to me and award-worthy if there was an award eligible for animals (which one wouldn't say no to).<br/><br/>In conclusion, a sheer delight all round and, despite the competition being strong, its Oscar win for Best Picture was deserved. One of the easiest 10/10s given recently. Bethany Cox"
"willcundallreview","8","2","5","7 May 2014"," A very good throwback to Silence
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>The Artist is a silent film that although remains quiet throughout, produces a very fun little story and a dazzling acting display from the leading man. This film mixes comedy and drama, brings emotion and even action and makes a film that is actually for a movie we never see or haven't seen for near a century, pretty damn good. I felt this movie was strongly very good, and here below is why so.<br/><br/>The story is short but fun and as it goes along it reveals the emotion from our main character and who and what is making him sad. With a comedy vain running through it this is actually quite funny and just little bits can make you laugh, but also really feel something for the characters involved. This is a great homage to the silent movie generation and it's basic demise, this is shown in fantastically choreographed dancing and acting scenes which just add to the big show that unravels before our eyes. One last thing I liked about this was that it somehow mixes a bit of slapstick to drama to create a film that doesn't overdo either thing.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin does a fine job in the main role as George Valetin and no wonder he won an Oscar for this, he just somehow fits silent movie acting to a tee. Berenice Bejo playing the role of Peppy Miller is good but overshadowed by Dujardin who just seems to take all the credit with this film, and he fully deserves it. I would have liked to have seen more of John Goodman but with his trademark voice being drowned out in silence maybe it is OK, one of the best characters if not the best is Jack the dog(Valentins pet), he is such a fun dog for the film and the chemistry between Dujardin and Jack is just perfection, best animal duo for a long time.<br/><br/>Michael Hazanavicius directs and writes this wonderfully and he couldn't have done this much better with it's fun script and just little things he has told the actors to do that make it so much an adventure. With it being silent you may think this would be boring or hard to understand the plot, but the score for this move is one the highlights of this film and leaves you saying ""if this doesn't win best score at the Oscars, then I don't know film"", such a fantastic thing to accompany great acting.<br/><br/>I felt with this that although it is very good, it doesn't escape criticism, it isn't the most smart plot and you may see this is rated very highly but I did feel the story is fairly straight forward but still fun. See with this also with many it hasn't really got things wrong, it is just it's entertainment level and I know some will dislike it being silent for that long, but I also think criticism is up to you if you watch it.<br/><br/>People should enjoy this if you want a fun Comedy/Drama with a little Romance as it turns out fun and adventurous. Those who will dislike, well it is a silent film and I can imagine some won't want to sit through it all, albeit it is a short film though. This is a throwback of course to silent cinema and so anyone who maybe likes this era of cinema will love it as it couldn't be any different to back then, just good fun.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 8/10 meaning it is Strongly a Very Good film, bordering on being a great. With this you get silent cinema at it's very best and to say it is made in 2011 you may think it wouldn't live up or feel like it like others, but it actually is and makes you feel good after watching it, a true adventure. A final thing to say is that just have fun with this, watch it in a big happy mood and you will thoroughly enjoy this, and remember, look out for the scenes with George and Jack, cinema gold."

","The story of The Artist has been captured on reel since time immemorial. And I cannot fail to mention how clichéd it look when it became the most awarded French cinema. That being said, the music soundtrack is one bomb- shell kind of a factor which solely wins the situation.<br/><br/>Throughout the 100 minutes of melodrama about how a silent film actor goes down the line, the music stays to entertain. The highs & the lows of the orchestra and the crescendos induce sheer hearing pleasure to the rather hackneyed plot. And about the performances, Jean Dujardin got what he deserved. Such flawless acting with pinch of dance moves is a sure charm. The actress did very well, too. John Goodman supports well.<br/><br/>As a whole, it gives a cool vintage projection for people who are more into the trend-driven yesteryear movies. Recommended!"

The music is good too , not great , but good. The acting is decent and that's it . I don't see anything special in performances of Bérénice Bejo and Jean Dujardin . Oh , and the dog is lovely.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is with the screenplay and direction. The movie pretends that it says something important about cinema and actors , but good old ""Singing in the rain"" did it MUCH BETTER. Also the movie is completely soulless and heartless . The movies of silent era maybe weren't complex , but they certainly had heart and soul . They had a childlike sensibility that could make you laugh and cry. ""The Artist"" by comparison feels like a plastic. It has no charm , no humor (maybe with the exception of dog – he gave the best performance in the whole movie) . The story feels lifeless . It moves slowly , too slowly and quickly becomes boring . The directing is so awful you could wonder if anyone was directing this movie at all. Emotions ? None . Substance ? None.<br/><br/>I don't think that Michel Hazanavicius REALLY UNDERSTOOD what those old movies were about . ""The Artist"" feels like a cheap trick to impress the audience. Better watch one of those movies I've mentioned in the beginning of this review or any other TRUE silent era movie . Not some empty copy. This is movie about nothing .

Oh yes the period costumes and sets are quite good as is the brief dance routine at the end but so what.

There are some allegories that can pack a punch, hit you on an emotional level. For me, this film is not one of them. Unfortunately the very qualities that give the film its uniqueness also interfered with my ability to become engaged. Too self consciously original, perhaps.

To its credit, I imagine months or even years from now I will remember this film while totally forgetting other more engaging films that kept me riveted from beginning to end. Nevertheless, unless a film keeps one wondering, anticipating, caring – in short, feeling – I don't believe it deserves highest honors. It is more memorable as a curiosity than as a work of art.

This story has been told and better. Do yourself a favor and just rent ""Singin' in the Rain (1952)"" So why the 3? It is not entirely without merit and they won't let me give it a negative to balance the other reviews. This is not a good movie. It's a foreign film about a uniquely American experience and they have no idea. The more I write the madder I'm getting. Asking a foreigner to explain American cinema is like asking a hamster to explain the space shuttle. Back when we had a space program. Don't get me started.

I enjoyed the flashing eyes but they went on far too long. I thought the character's name was inappropriate. Valentino without the ""o""? In the coat rack scene there were fingers in the sleeve too soon. Oops! Some of the foreshadowing was good it helped create an American ending. A necessity I greatly feared they would mess up. Now for my American ending: I'm sorry I lost my temper, NOT! It was fun but to be fair ""The Artist"" (oh, ouch bad title, still I'm going to say something nice) has something. Probably style. The guy is handsome, the girl is pretty, the dog is cute. Yep! A 3, two full points above totally horrible. If Hollywood will just give this guy a chance and a whole lot of guidance he might make a good movie about France or something. It could happen. Probably won't but it could.

George was a big star of the silent era and Peppy becomes a big star of the new talking pictures. George finds it difficult to make the transition though and his career hits the doldrums.<br/><br/>The film is fairly entertaining, but I must confess to loving dialogue in movies. All of my favourite films contain great dialogue, so I found it a bit frustrating that the film didn't contain any words. It is undoubtedly very well done though.

Those who have seen this film will immediately notice how much The Artist owes to Guru Dutt. Even Dutt's film was inspired by Chaplin's Limelight. So I fail to see why there is so much noise about a silent film that is different from the two films I have mentioned in only an absence of sound. Kagaz Ke Phool had outstanding camera work by V. K.

Movie stars in Britain aren't officially movie stars until they start appearing in Hollywood block-busters . Not so in France where a film is judged as being a hit merely if it's a success within the French border . Indeed one of my favourite film trivia facts is that in 1993 the biggest grossing film in every country on the planet was JURRASIC PARK . The only exception to this was in France the biggest grossing movie being LES VISITEURS the time travelling comedy starring Jean Reno . It's probably not fashionable in being Francophile but you can't argue that the French really know something about the art of cinema <br/><br/>It's sad to report then that I wasn't highly impressed with THE ARTIST . A black and white French silent film that came out at the tail end of 2011 and ended up as a sleeper hit doing good box office and grabbing every award for best picture of 2011 . It's helped by the fact that there's no spoken dialogue and dialogue is conveyed via cue cards . For a French film it recognises Anglo-Saxon sensibilities very incisively and much of the charm is down by having a cameo by a dog and we all known have English speakers feel about mammals unlike the French who consider anything to be fair game when it comes to menus . THE ARTIST is definitely a charming film almost to the point that it's cynically charming and works best as a first date movie with romance and fully canine mammals . As I write this it's business as usual as I'm sitting alone in a lonely Edinburgh flat watching television which means the charm maniptutively engineered by the producers of the film doesn't work for me in the slightest and while I recognise the feel good factor I'm left unmoved by it"

And although I heard it was a mistake, only meant to be a temp track, using Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable music from Vertigo during the film's climactic sequence was jarring, to say the least, if not borderline criminal. The dog was great. The stars lacked charisma. Another film about film--and certainly no Singing in the Rain. Can't believe it was nominated for Best Picture. It's The English Patient all over again... See Seinfeld Episode #? Well... The automated IMDb message tells me this review isn't long enough, so... I'll indict the leading character's character in more depth--how can someone feel pity for someone who fires his loyal chauffeur, though with good intentions, and is shown in scene after scene after scene wallowing in self-pity. It was truly pathetic. What the leading lady sees in him after a certain point was very mysterious, but also pointless. A pointless film. Let's see if this is long enough..."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","2","6","2 May 2014"," A bit shaky at times and a little overrated, but the strong second half of the film makes it worthwhile
","Beginning in 1927, the Artist follows silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) during the height of his career. Whilst filming one of his films he meets a young dancer Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). The pair strike up a friendship and George persuades Peppy to become an actress and assists her in every way he can to make this happen. He succeeds in helping her, but finds himself being dropped as an actor when film director Al Zimmer (John Goodman)decides that he needs some young fresh faces to appear in his new 'talkie' films. As a result of this, Valentin finds himself on the bottom rung of the ladder whilst Miller's career and popularity soars as the new 'face' of talkies.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above in my summary, this film ended up being good in the end, Valentin's self destructive behaviour when he's dropped as a silent actor is the highlight of the film. It is harrowing and moving to see this man go from being at the top to being at the bottom - his wife leaves him and he is forced to sack his butler/servant Clifton (James Cromwell). He's also forced to auction most of his valuables and he also contemplates suicide. It's a testament to Dujardin's acting to be able to convey so much emotion without saying anything at all. I also liked Peppy Miller's character - she could have quite easily just carried on with her career making shed loads of money and forget all about Valentin, but she doesn't because she clearly has a conscience and she can't bear to see Valentin ending up with nothing. I thought it was very touching towards the end of the film when Miller refuses to do another film unless Valentin is included in its production - that final scene at the end where we hear everyone speak and see Miller and Valentin dancing together was a wonderful moment in the film.<br/><br/>The weak areas in this film for me were the first 30 minutes. Truth be told, I found the snippets of Valentin's film and his dancing around on stage with a dog to be rather boring (this film is billed as a Comedy/Drama so perhaps this part was meant to be the Comedy, but I didn't find it funny). I also didn't like all the scenes with Valentin and his wife - they were also quite dull. Her character wasn't developed at all and then she just ups and leaves him when he needs her the most. Very strange.<br/><br/>The Artist is a good film where its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. Dujardin won the actor for best Oscar, but I personally felt that every single person involved gave 110% in this film. Dujardin's fall from hero to zero is the strongest part of the film and thankfully it's this aspect of the film that gets the most focus.I'll concede that this is far from a masterpiece and garnered way too much praise when it was released but it's good enough for a recommendation."

","Last night I finally saw ""The Artist"" and after the easy digestion of this lite soufflé, here is what I typed: the concession of the main award from the American film industry to a French motion picture as best production of 2011 should not be seen as a cordial action whereby a national film form (specifically, American cinema in general) recognizes the art and skill of a foreign film form, but rather as the assumption by certain sector of French filmmakers (among them M. Michel Hazanavicius, director and writer –surely not ""author"", as Truffaut and Rohmer would claim– of ""The Artist"") of the way Hollywood makes, feels and shoots films, even if Oliver Stone says (as he told me in an interview) that ""Hollywood"" is only a construct. After heatedly arguing with the American negotiators to reach a version of the GATT acceptable to both Europeans and Americans (in which the memories of Beaumarchais, the French playwright, and British queen Anne were evoked, as Europeans defended their notion of copyright), it was agreed that film is something more than entertainment, so funds and incentives were guaranteed to continue the European production of motion pictures that express national cultures, and counteract the slow transformation of spectators into exclusive consumers of American products (thanks to monopoly), while their brains become smaller, very much in the way of the incredible shrinking man, with the small difference that as he got smaller his cosmic conscience grew. I think that the American negotiators accepted the deal because they knew that in the end many filmmakers from all over the world would end up making movies ""a la Hollywood"", in accordance with the so-called zero degree style (also ambiguously termed ""classic representational model""), as evidenced by ""The Artist"" and ""Buried"" from Spain, ""Night Watch"" from Russia, and ""Acquaria"" from Brazil. Of course every viewer will experience something different when watching ""The Artist"". For me, Mr. Hazanavicius, a former publicist with no outstanding work in his previous filmography, made a tiresome and innocuous movie. Tiresome because its predictable and clichéd story has been told a dozen of times, and innocuous because it is lightweight, because it is not in anyone's way, it is just there, a pretty centerpiece. It is possible that he did not pretend to make a masterpiece. I do not know his intentions, but because the film has been exaggeratedly praised it becomes more obvious that nothing was done that had been not already tried, tested and found effective: above anything, to narrate in black and white with images and inter-titles, and to use musical paraphrases to supply depth (which, to be honest, this story does not need, for everything is intentionally superficial). It is truly a merit that Hazanavicius has seen so many Hollywood movies, because he knows which are the best resources to evoke a time and a way of making films, contrary to many new filmmakers who are satisfied with Disney, ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and films by some weird director recommended by one of their teachers (while they refuse to see Ford's ""Stagecoach"") An rehash of ""A Star is Born"", Hazanavicius' film mixes a bit from ""Swing Time"" with many other film quotations that the Hollywood specialists will recognize, and a climax strangely edited to the cue that Bernard Herrmann wrote for ""Vertigo"" (curiously titled in French by the composer, as ""Scène d'amour""). We will have to wait for Michel Hazanavicius' future films to see what is behind this lustrous façade, bathed with 107 awards! But who cares the world is crazy, full of nostalgia, covered with the gimmicks of the old Californian movies. If you take it like that, then you can enjoy ""The Artist"", a little pill that is easily swallowed, without fatal consequences."

","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I suppose I was tired or not in the right mood. I just couldn't stay awake. I drifted in and out of sleep during the middle hour. The lack of dialogue, the samey music, the lack of colour, the uninteresting theme, the slow story -- it just didn't spark any interest in me. Yes, I know there was sound at one point. I missed that part, unfortunately.<br/><br/>This happened to me once before, with a movie called ""A Fish Called Wanda"". Everyone thought it was a great movie, but I just didn't get it. That's essentially what happened here.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the technical expertise in recreating the Hollywood of that era and what seemed like an authentic silent film. I liked the dog, I suppose. The main character, played by Dujardin, was unexpectedly attractive.<br/><br/>But that wasn't enough I'm afraid. Sorry. I'd like to give it a higher score, but how can I rate highly a film that had such a soporific effect on me? I promise to go a second time and give it another chance, this time when I'm wide awake and ready to appreciate its more nuanced artistry."

","For 'The Artist' to win the accolades it has done is pretty telling of the Hollywood movie industry as a whole. A silent remake of 'A Star Is Born'? In 2012? It's beautifully done, and a few gags keep up your interest, namely the dream in which Georges imagines himself silent among foley hell, and in the end where he reveals his impenetrable accent, and I suppose the dog, which out-Mooses Moose from 'Frasier' deserves credit. But essentially The Artist is a shallow melodrama, and that's something which bogs it down in silent-movie tedium.<br/><br/>In parts this movie was very much like, and better than, one of Woody Allen's period pieces, with the well known faces (James Cromwell, John Goodman), mugging for all they are worth, and the whole 1929 feel is excellent. But to what end? To tell a story that is no different from one of the cheesy silent film romances that are now forgotten."
"phd_travel","7","2","6","30 January 2012"," Unique but not best movie
","This movie is an interesting art piece with a nice look at old Hollywood. The silent aspect makes one watch carefully the emotions and facial expressions. The story is simple and pleasantly predictable about one star on the rise and one on the decline at the era when silent films gave way to talkies.<br/><br/>The plot of the first half is a bit frustratingly thin but the second half the story picks up. The infamous use of music from Hitchcock's Vertigo is good - actually makes me want to see Vertigo again.<br/><br/>Dujardin as Valentin the screen idol of the silent screen looks the part. Berenice has a harder role acting wise. Both are good and dance well. Nice use of John Goodman and Penelope Anne Miller.<br/><br/>Compared to the other good movies that came out this year eg War Horse, Midnight in Paris etc, the Artist isn't quite as good. It's only the timing of the release and the continental background that have people praising it beyond it's worth. I don't think it is best picture."

","OK, so being honest I found the first 1/3 of this film a bit dreadful. But with all of the fabulous reviews I stuck it out and am glad I did. It's not easy adjusting to a b/w film with no dialog for us ""non-artsy"" types like myself. I just like being entertained when I watch a movie, not artsy-fartsy'd to death. But in the end I got hooked into the plot although slightly predictable as it was. The acting especially on the male lead was excellent but really on everyone's part to be able to bring the emotion with no dialog other than the occasional written paragraph. And probably my favorite thing about the entire film was that little dog! What a devoted and amazing pal he was to George! I did love that at the very end - George speaks his only two words ""With pleasure"". That was cool! So yeah, I recommend this however it's certainly not everyone's cup-o-tea.

"markgorman","7","1","2","11 January 2012"," A thoroughly engaging and unique (these days) cinematic experience.
","It's been a long wait for this much heralded movie, the notices from Cannes were enthusiastic to say the least and early user reviews on IMDb have anointed it with must see status.<br/><br/>So, I went along today with an open mind and a hope that it justified its early 8.5 rating on our esteemed website. I have to say that it doesn't; but there is much to love in this delightful movie novelty.<br/><br/>First off, this is a novelty. Once you've enjoyed its fare you are left wondering ""what exactly was the point of making that"" because it has no real ""agenda"". I saw no political, religious or cultural allegory. What I saw was a lovingly crafted, beautifully photographic, gorgeously scored, excellently acted, art-house homage.<br/><br/>It's kind of a big idea but without an idea, instead it's a film built around executional excellence and in that respect is often near to perfection with some lovely retro cinematographic and illusions.<br/><br/>There's a particularly nice touch when Peppy Miller's movie opens in a cinema called the Reine (an in joke and nod to the production company that made it, La Petite Reine I suspect).<br/><br/>I didn't know the story before I saw it and I won't spoil it for you here because the story is fairly slight and not that big a deal, it's merely the skeleton for a series of set pieces and fun.<br/><br/>It's held together principally by the delightful Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), an up and coming ""talkies "" star who worships the ground that fallen idol George Valentin (surely a nod to Valentino) played brilliantly by Jean Dujardin walks on. However many scenes are stolen by the delightful Jack Russell terrier who is Valentin's only constant soul mate throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There are also two good cameos from American actors John Goodman, as the studio magnate, and James Cromwell, who you've seen literally hundreds of times without perhaps realising who he is, as Valentin's loyal manservant.<br/><br/>It's shot in a, 1.37: 1 ratio that these days, is virtually unseen, but was the format of choice in the 20′s. This, for me added further authenticity, as do the beautiful credits, captions and monochrome photography.<br/><br/>Sound is used cleverly throughout and the final scene had me grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>I really liked this oddball movie. No it's not one of the greatest ever made and I doubt will do much at The Oscars outside of the technical categories but it's a great hour and a half and an unusual and worthwhile feelgood movie experience."
"tabuno","9","2","7","17 January 2019"," A Powerful Visual and Auditory Romantic Drama
","8 April 2012. As the intellectually and visually gritty drama of Another Earth (2011), The Artist is as emotionally and musically riveting resonating on the more universal and familiar themes of human existence. Whereas Another Earth tells of a traumatic and unusual intense unfolding of the intimate human drama of tragedy, The Artist displays more of a silent and artistic version of the popular bigger than life love romance and adventure of The Titanic (1997). Whether or not The Artist will hold up in time is another matter because there is the ""different wow"" factor in play here. Being an unusual contemporary silent, black and white film with a huge reliance of music melodies, The Artist brings forth a substantial different movie experience based on rhythmic tones and gorgeously timed tempos of musical auditory emotions (like radio) allowing for less of the mental machinations than the emotive inner vibrations of sight and sound. The Artistic is able to take advantage the rarely used medium of music and silent dialogue which forces the audience to tap into a much more reflective and emotionally visceral level. Nevertheless, some of the film's creative and emotionally compelling drama and renewal comes from that sudden burst of the audience having to use rarely used sense over the duration of the whole movie. However, The Artist may have the fortune of retaining its brilliance and flair for the unique in its genre, much like Brazil (1985) has been able to retain is imaginative power and classic claim or Lost In Translation (2003) for its minimalist plot and immersive authenticity.<br/><br/>However, The Artist doesn't have the exclusive patent on the effective use of music or silent dialogue or emphasis on pure behavioral performances to make its resonating connection to the audience come across. Evita (2005) was produced with only singing throughout the movie. The Monkey's had their surrealistic LSD tripping movie, Head (1968) more than 40 years ago. Wall*e (2008) the animated non-dialogue version had that even more difficult time of creating emotive impact without the fine details of a live human actor's presentation. There's even Wait Until Dark (1967) with one of the best thrilling literally black climatic scenes in movie history with minimal dialogue or the horror film 1408 (2007) finds John Cusack alone by himself trapped in a hotel room for most of the movie. Solaris (1972) is also notable for its long passages without dialogue. Even Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1999) in its fourth season in ""Hush"" had no audible dialogue for most of the episode or Apocalypto (2006) with Mel Gibson had little use for dialogue has his character fought for survival or Jarhead (2005) that relied more on the ambiance and setting for its emotional impact than dialogue, or Touching the Void (2004) where most of the vivid power of the movie comes from the solo survival drama on a mountain slope. As for music, The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and even The Cooler (2003) with Mark Isham's score have already accomplished a great synthesis of music to film. Of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) likely can claim the musical backdrop and minimalist use of dialogue in capturing its audience in a vision beyond this earth and human understanding.<br/><br/>Both Another Earth and The Artist use share the strong element of the use of irony, where characters in the movie do not know of the whole events taking place, where the character George Valentin is in the dark much of times as to what Peppy Miller is doing whereas in Another Earth, John Burroughs is unaware of the identity of the Rhoda Williams in connection to his tragedy. Another Earth operates on a different level, focusing on the mental level and the internal emotions of thought and feelings while The Artist takes its power using the behaviorist, externalize primal visual and auditory feelings that propel this movie with its intense resonating emotions."

","I've seen The Artist a couple times now, and it held up both as a new and returning viewer. The use of silence to tell the story of a silent film artist was both clever and very effective- especially when it was inverted, such as in the dream sequence. This movie was definitely entertaining, and I enjoyed the nods to various movie tropes from the era with both the plot and the characters. The music was well suited to what was happening onscreen, and added a lot to the film. It really encapsulated what the characters were feeling, and helped make up for the lack of dialogue or ambient noise. However, the film occasionally dragged, especially with the lack of colour or non-musical sound that might normally have piqued the audience's interest. I think this film really works as an homage to the era that it depicts, although were it not doing so it might not hold up quite so well."

Personally, I did not hear anything about this film in Germany and was therefore very skeptical. But in my opinion, the film is highly recommended.
The acting performance of the actors of Peppy Miller and George Valentin is impressive. Because we now have a similar project in the classroom, you realize how much work there is and we have it a lot easier today.

This scene really stood out to me as probably the most creative scene of the whole film.

It's an utter gem of a movie and it's not just me saying this - look at the overall score! It stays true to it's self imposed restrictions: it's both silent and black and white, but if you think these are too limiting, think again. The acting is top notch and Jean Dujardin is so believable as a silent movie actor I found myself wondering if his character was actually based on one of the stars from that era. Likewise, Berenice Bejo is captivating and strikes just the right tone throughout the 1h 40m running time. As the credits rolled I felt that contented feeling you get when you've been thoroughly enthralled. The fact that this is a European film about Hollywood gives it a certain edge in my view.<br/><br/>Now then, a word about the naysayers... I guess there will always be some folk who simply 'don't get' a film because they aren't that bright, whilst others purposely take a contrary position simply because they like the sound of their own voice (or in this case, the self aggrandizing joy of seeing their own ill-judged opinions on the internet!) but forget them.

"brianhan-84901","9","2","7","26 October 2018"," Good Idea, Well Executed.
","'The artist' was a remarkable movie. Although I don't give straightforward compliments often, but when I finished the movie, I really, truly thought that that was a remarkable movie. This film, directed by Michel Hazanavicius,was a very peculiar ilm. The film sets it's date in the 20's, and remarkably uses the silent style of the films back then extremely well. Before being told by a friend, I actually thought it was a movie from those times! There is no doubt that this was an excellent idea, very properly executed.
The style of the film was not all. Even when there were no huge actors or actresses in this movie, I was very impressed with the power of acting in this movie. Being a silent film, it was utterly necessary to make exaggerated expressions and movements to bring greater emotion to the audience. And the actors in the movie just exactly did that, not too exaggerated, not to diminished by any means.
We cannot skip over the film's themes and plots either. The film's plot and story truly gripped me as an audience, invoking the emotions that the character himself is feeling. This was amazing, as I thought the film would lack emotion, as it lacked sound.
Truth to be told however, this wasn't an utterly perfect movie, as such one does not exist. Personally, I felt that the ending was rushed and did not live up to my expectations. There was no great satisfaction or bitterness, but there was only a small feeling of unreadiness. The change from the bitter scene of suicide to happy tap dancing was somewhat obnoxious and a tiny bit random. I felt almost no correlation from those two scenes.
However, at this point, this was just nitpicking. Good ending or mediocre, The Artist was a movie I would most definitely recommend."

"Christopher_Reid","6","2","7","5 October 2014"," Engaging and affecting but unoriginal
","Okay, so it's paying homage to silent films. But to really do that, you have to step up to the task and outdo the genre or it doesn't work. Just as Scream was better than most of the horror films it was mocking and Singin' in the Rain was possibly the best musical ever made. That's why they worked - they respected the past and improved on it. Speaking of which, this film was very reminiscent of Singin' in the Rain - to the point of feeling like a weaker version that made me want to watch the original. Much of the story and tone overlap. But of course, Singin' in the Rain came out 59 years earlier, had colour and singing and dancing and was hilarious and clever and still managed to pay homage to silent films.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin is very comically talented, a really good and charismatic actor (he coincidentally looks and smiles a lot like Gene Kelly). Bérénice Bejo was also very good and seemed to suit her role. But The Artist lacks a strong pull of its own. It's not particularly insightful - you learn nothing new about cinema. It doesn't make you think more deeply about the way we view films. The ending is a bit anticlimactic and too weak to make any kind of meaningful statement.<br/><br/>There are quite a few hilarious moments, almost solely due to Dujardin. His timing and natural facial expressions are joyful to watch. The movie is quite engaging but that's largely because it's well-shot and looks nice, not due to a sweeping or profound or original story. The music is generally good but is still mere imitation and doesn't breathe new air into the style it's mimicking.<br/><br/>It's ironic that The Artist reminds me of how unnecessary most dialogue is in films in general. Most films are full of vapid dialogue to an obscene degree. This has almost none and you can easily follow it and connect with the characters. So many movies would be better with all the talking cut out. The Artist believes in the magic of movies. It's very romantic (in the way that it's filmed). My eyes were glued to the screen much of the time. It understands the power of a silhouette, a gesture, a smile, a moment. But those are naturally powerful. It just takes a little guts to stick to them without trying to get flashy. But a great film still needs to say something with those things.<br/><br/>There were a handful of times where it neglected to show what a character was saying - I couldn't tell at all and watching a person talk at length with no sound is incredibly dull and pointless. In those instances, they should have either ""spoken"" non-verbally (with posture and expressions but no speech) or, if it was so important, the words should have been shown!<br/><br/>Unoriginality was the main weakness here. I immediately recognised the music from Vertigo which was casually used for what felt like 10 or 20 minutes. That music was written for another film. I was thinking about Vertigo and how good it is and how I wanted to watch it. That's a bad sign. Yes, Bernard Herrmann based his themes for Vertigo on Tristan und Isolde, but that was only his starting point. He didn't simply use it as it was. Plus, that was an interesting and meaningful artistic choice that he made. Here, using Vertigo's music was distracting, inappropriate and harmfully unoriginal. Yes the images and music affected me but put nice music to any vaguely emotional imagery and you get the same effect. I can't believe a film that does something like this could win an Academy Award. Imagine a film winning Best Picture which has 10 minutes of dialogue taken directly from a Tarantino movie. Music is its own language which deserves just as much respect.<br/><br/>Another small scene was a direct rip-off of Citizen Kane. Again, it wasn't a homage because it wasn't as good. It reminded me of the other film and how much better it is. Raiders of the Lost Ark pays homage to earlier adventure mediums successfully, it was the best adventure film ever made - it earned the right to play with the genre. In contrast, unfortunately, The Artist's most powerful scenes are when it blatantly imitates earlier films, following the existing tropes without adding anything. They're nice but not as powerful as their ancestors.<br/><br/>It's not anywhere near as funny or poignant as Chaplin's or Keaton's films. It's not as provocative or beautiful or haunting as many other silent films I've seen. It won't be influential. It makes no profound statement about silent films or life or anything else. However it is quite charming and heart-warming and enjoyable. It's a good movie. It reminds you of how powerful films can be - to make you cry or laugh within seconds.<br/><br/>It'd be really great to see Dujardin in a comedy with an original story, a role which uses all his skills. He's extremely likable and funny although clearly not a dancer (he did very well but I could tell). It'd also be great to see a new silent film which isn't about silent films but is simply silent because that's still a powerful and valid way to make new movies."

","I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one that thought this movie was over-hyped.<br/><br/>The concept was unique, but the story did not unfold in a tenable or compelling way. The main character is nothing but a self-absorbed shell of a ham actor who contemptuously refuses to transition a successful career into talkies. Why bother to care about this character or his self-destructive plight? He looks at virtually every person in his life with complete disdain from beneath a charming actor's mask. And how can one relate to the bubbly fan-turned-love-interest, who admires (then stalks) this shallow idol throughout her own blossoming career (a career apparently built on a fake beauty mark and a closet full of cloche hats)?<br/><br/>The music was distracting (scenes from Vertigo playing over and over in my head). The story was so uninteresting that the spangled costumes, glistening cinematography, and sets laden with vintage autos became the stars. And those soon felt clichéd to the point of unintended amusement. I lost count of how many times I watched a moodily-lit George Valentin toss down his last swallow of booze from a cut crystal old-fashioned glass. The ending fell flat with an awkward dance number finale and a main character unredeemed and unrepentant despite a revelation of sorts.<br/><br/>The dog, however, was delightful."

Who was he supposed to be; Charlie Chaplin? If so, that's an even bigger disservice to Chaplin, himself! The man was still a justly-revered figure in Hollywood, in 1927, and would _never_ have been relegated to appearing as an extra.<br/><br/>Were it not for the obvious chemistry of the two French leads, I would have given this little period piece only one star.

","The Artist (2011)<br/><br/>This is a movie Woody Allen would have liked to have made. And if he had, it wouldn't have been his best.<br/><br/>A fantasy and a romance, a time trip (with some intentional slippage with fact), and an homage to silent movies and to early musicals, which of course were not silent.<br/><br/>The leading man is tremendously alive and talented, though he has that French leading man quality that American audiences do not quite warm up to. The leading woman is the kind of French woman all audiences love--full of life, an over-sized smile, a big heart.<br/><br/>I think silent movie fans will be torn. I mean, this is essentially a silent movie, but anyone familiar with silents from before 1927 will know a different kind of intensity and sophistication. Even a different and better kind of plot. To some extent, this dumbs up (no pun intended) the silent movie aura, making fun of the industry, turning meaningful plots into clichés. Even as visually beautiful as this movie is, it doesn't match the best of the old silent films for depth and surprise, at least at times.<br/><br/>But then, ""The Artist"" does pull off a relatively rare feat, making the most of what seemed like a genre long gone. It doesn't use affected tricks like add scratches to the film or extra camera shake. In fact, there are little techniques that are wholly modern, like the very slow tracking-in shot when a character is going through some important thought or transition (this has become a standard, almost inevitable technique in the last 20 years).<br/><br/>I'm not talking plot because the plot is almost insignificant. It's fun, it's warm. And it's a rehash of a lot of man meets young pretty girl who then makes it in the world of theater, or dance, or yes, the movies. And there are so many references to that other, better, homage to silent films, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" it's almost painful. Or just sheer lightweight fun.<br/><br/>I didn't really love this movie, as you can tell, and I really love movies. It's really well made, sincerely artistic in its own 2011 way, and enjoyable. The sold out audience where I saw it last night loved it and applauded at the end. That's where most people are at, and if you go, you'll be happy. But I'll throw in that if you really do like the silent film aspects, and not just the referring to silent films as a kind of homage, you should look at some of the great ones from the 1920s. Really, truly, originally great ones."

","What a terrible movie. This is an example of how The Academy Awards are no longer about ""quality"" and more about: what is the political statement of the year or what is the fad of the year. Silent movies were terrible in the early 30's. The movies had awful actors (if you can call them that) who were more clowns than actors. Silent movies had zero characterization and very little to no plot. The performers would over exaggerate every single movement and it was more of a platform for physical comedy more than anything else. Now someone decides to make a silent movie about a silent movie star. The plot is hardly there, there is no characterization throughout the whole movie and it tries to rely on the dog to carry most of the plot holes from scene to scene. This movie is boring and it is even 20-30 years too late to be nostalgia to those who grew up in the silent movie age. Not worth watching unless you have trouble sleeping."

","Movie Review: ""The Artist"" – Three (3) words, ""HOLLYWOOD LOVES DIFFERENT""!!!!! Even if different means making everything OLD, NEW AGAIN (i.e. – shooting a 2011 film in an homage to the silent films of the 1920s). I have to admit that the first 40 minutes of viewing is a totally encompassing experience; however, it does quickly wear off, and I found myself constantly looking at my watch wondering when this film would finally end. Which brings us to the movie's plot and in my opinion, the film's downfall In a nutshell, it's basically just a remake of the 1976,1954, and 1937 films ""A Star is Born"" Old star at the height of his career, meets rising starlet. Starlet's career skyrockets, as the old star's career wanes. So once the ""newness"" of watching a silent film fades, and you realize that you have seen this film like a gazillion times before; there's nothing more to do but bear the burden of finishing the film. This film is (at best) an ""art house"" picture, and not intended for the ""mass"" market audience; made for $15 million dollar, the US grosses to date is only $18 million ($47 million worldwide). Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it will clean house on February 26, and is already the front-runner for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. If you are a movie connoisseur, you'll probably want to add this film to your collection, if for nothing more than owning a bit of nostalgia and viewing the novelty and pageantry that was the 1920s."

The movie itself is made like a silent movie from that period and the technical side is great (although they didn't go so far as The Call of Cthulhu did in ""aging"" the film; also, notice that only the early scenes are sped-up a bit like the old movies).<br/><br/>The entire production value is excellent (scenery, clothing, makeup, cars, houses), making the movie feel very authentic right from the start. Solid direction, good cast and excellent score (totally deserves the Golden Globe it got). My only complaint is that movie didn't maintain the amount of interest I felt in its beginning; I don't know if I should blame the script or the director, but more than once I felt that I'm losing my interest.

","A silent spectacle. One of the toughest films in recent times.<br/><br/>Right from the first frame, it engrossed me, pulled me into it, made me laugh at it and also made me think at times, without even a word being uttered on screen. Sheer beauty and exquisitely performed by the artists. It's a highly appreciable thing that audiences have embraced this film but what is more appreciable is the fact that there are people who would still love to make such movies. It's the same wine in new bottle, just that it caters to tast of the new audience which is 'said to be intelligent'.<br/><br/>A simple conflict of whether an artist likes sound in movies or not, is drawn to magnanimous proportions and one scene where the glass sound, the laughs of girls come along portray how much he is stuck and in love with silence. He is overtly adamant about silent films than being passionate about them. He hates the sound so much that he goes to even end his life, on hearing people speak. Such a character is tough to portray and Jean Dujardin does emote exceptionally well. <br/><br/>The dog named Uggy who is the hero and as written in the film, ""He owes his life to the dog"" has done a remarkably good job. The art direction was outstanding and so was the choreography. The music complemented each scene well whether it is the initial part of cinema where he performs for audiences, the comic sequences or the dramatic part. Also, the screenplay just flew. <br/><br/>Having said all the above, there are a few dislikes of which few are 1) This film has a completely predictable storyline, in fact me and my friend were talking to each other what would happen next and it turned out to be same 2) The story in itself is too very common and so is the treatment 3) The actress Berenice Bejo was good at places and at few times was just awkward, example the way she speaks to George Valentin on the stairs was like making a spoof of the old silent films. 4) Oh yes, its just too melodramatic, the final climax where she rushes in car as if she would definitely do an accident was uncalled for.<br/><br/>So going out with 3/5. Having said about the flaws, I would still say it's a must watch for those who love cinema for the way cinema is. I loved it, coz I go for cinema to be taken into it and pulls me into a path that it builds for me, and this movie did that in every sense to me. This is for sure, is the best actor movie I saw in recent times."

","Of course, the director Mr Hazanavicius and most of actors (especially Ms Bejo, Mr Goodman, and the dog) have done excellent job, but the storyline is rather simple and predictable. Similar to most of European (incl. French) films, there is a lot of romance, feelings, moods etc, as well as profound variances such as routine vs innovation, pride vs humbleness, past vs future. But due to few text lines and long scenes, I was quite eager to use forward function and got the whole picture in about an hour. <br/><br/>The film is not bad, but 5 Academy Awards is slightly exaggerated, in my opinion (as most other nominees were state-of-the-art films as well).

","This movie tells us through the drama of the main character what was the the tragedy of many actors and actresses of the silent cinema who haven't adapted themselves to the talkies when they came because of their voices and not only that (Greta Garbo of all). Some performers and directors rejected also the talkies for aesthetic reasons considering it was not good cinema. Silent cinema marked an epoch and even shaped a life conception. In my opinion it wasn't only a starting stage of the cinema as an art but also a different kind of cinema and which could therefore have coexisted with the talkies. The visual technique employed in it, the expressionist performance of actors and actresses, the romantic nature of most stories, all of that was its peculiar mark. Director Hazanavicius has opted here to tell the story in terms of a silent movie using for that all the usual visual and performing techniques proper to that kind of cinema which makes the viewer to integrate himself better in the story atmosphere and even to understand better the drama of the silent movie's actor who not only doesn't feel ready to act on the talkies but also that rejects their aesthetic value which makes him to sink in moral and material misery. His drama is stressed by the fact that the girl he loves from the beginning and that was brought by him to the cinema suddenly became a talkies' star. A good movie to which we cannot demand more since the story is somewhat limited."
"mvedprakasha","6","1","3","14 March 2012"," The Artist- Conceptual Review
","Director Michel Hazanavicius has made all effort for the look and feel of the 1920s, for the silent movie.The screen opens with the late 1920's with an instance of picture within another movie. That movie gives us an introduction about the lively movies which shall comprise of emotion, comedy, horror and all aspects which an ideal movie should consist to become a hit. The artist and the team watch the movie behind the screen in silence clearly delivering the message of his story is next to be screened in silence. The success of the movie being shown brings immense happiness to the artist, and when he shares it with media and press, introduces the 'Miller', who shares it along with him. Jean Dujardin-The artist makes small efforts to make her special with the help of beauty spot for her appraisal in the cinema industry. Meanwhile the introduction of the talkies starts slowly replacing the silent movies. Man is a social animal and has to sustain and adopt to the changes if he needs to survive. But the George valentine- The artist refuses the change , hence forth starts finding his down days, but Miller accepts the changes and turns successful.This nonacceptance of change supported by symbolism is very well depicted in the form of stairs when they both confront each other with climbing Miller and descending artist. The symbolism of psychology is also extended by the director when artist dreams of feather falls from great height, symbolizing his fall, but on the contrary the non egoistic nature of the feather of being light weight and flexible remains unnoticed by artist. The artist tries to overcome others in the competitive world by his own production to produce ""tears of Love"" which gives him only tears and not love bringing him to ""The End"".He gradually gets isolated represented by walking across market shop named ""lonely star"". The ""guardian Angel"" for him arrives in the form of Peppy Miller saving all his assets. Finally, the shadow of him which is also fed up of his failures walks out of screen leaving him alone. He starts burning all his ego which he finds in his own films. The last attempt of his killing ego which landed in in killing himself is stopped by Miller leading to the dramatic happy ending.<br/><br/>This movie can be compared with two already existing Indian movies. ""The dirty picture"" which also represents the fall of a person because of pride. And the second one is ""Pushpakavemana"" which is a silent movie enacted by Kamalhasan whose performance leads The artist. I also appreciate the Foley artists for providing the good sound effects which is highlighted as it is a silent movie. The actors effort of a blank and Blanca of 1927-1932, a five year story is thus satisfactory as it only of symbolism of ""pride ruins the game""."

Bejo was a revelation, a woman whose charm and style transcends mere fashion in any era.<br/><br/>But --- Best Picture? You have to be kidding. Where was the story? You could sum it up in 5 lines. Where was the depth of characterization? There was virtually none. What motivated the characters? Why were they so shallow? What reflection was there of the incredibly complex world events that characterized that era?<br/><br/>Granted --- the field was extremely weak this year. When Clooney's well- crafted but ultimately tepid ""The Descendants"" is getting raves---well, you know it's a thin field.<br/><br/>This lightweight little French pastry belongs firmly in the middle of the ""three star"" category, and deserves nothing more. (Although the dog certainly deserves Oscar consideration.)<br/><br/>Every year now, it seems, the Academy gets a ""grand idea"" in its head, and then votes accordingly.<br/><br/>A few years ago, the grand idea was to have a Female Director win, and the result was an Best Picture award for the searingly dramatic but unrealistic and deeply flawed ""Hurt Locker.""<br/><br/>Last year, it was ""The Charm of the Royalty,"" as the workmanlike ""The King's Speech"" won out over movies like ""Winter's Bone"", a film that was utterly riveting from the first frame to the last, and directed and acted with absolute brilliance.<br/><br/>And this year, it was ""Ode to Hollywood"" time, evidently. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most telling point about this film is that the guy writing the film's score (I won't dignify his efforts by listing his name) ran out of ideas at the film's most critical juncture --- its dramatic conclusion. So what did he do? He lifted Bernard Herrmann's brilliant music from Vertigo! A fine choice, indeed. But it put into stark contrast the distinction between the genius of Hitchcock and Herrmann, and the rather modest contributions of this film. Half the people writing rave reviews here probably have no idea where that music came from.<br/><br/>Consider ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"". Each film is a completely brilliant, completely original classic that broke new cinematic ground in its time. Yet neither won ""Best Picture"". Many knowledgeable film buffs now rate them among the ten best films ever made."
"darshancruz","5","1","3","10 March 2012"," The ARTIST : Watch it for its boldness & finesse in acting
","To start off things, Michel Hazanavicius brings to us a Black & White, silent movie, set in the 1920s. To make a film like this in the year 2011, the team deserves a kudos. The Oscars have continued their legacy of choosing boldness over stardom/story third year in a row (The Hurt Locker over Avatar, The King's Speech over Inception & now with The Artist)<br/><br/>The story is about an artist 'George Valentin'- a silent movie actor who is the audience's pet. His pride brings to us the memories of 'Howard Roark' in the movie/novel FountainHead. Since change is inevitable, there comes a pretty young lady 'Peppy Miller'' who can talk and our actor's job is sacked. <br/><br/>The second half tells us about our artist's downfall. His effort in acting/producing/directing a movie to compete with Peppy only leads himself to be buried further below (reminds us of The Dirty Picture where Vidya tries a similar thing). I did not quite like the idea of it being a silent movie and then dialogues being presented to us as full screen titles than subtitles.<br/><br/>Coming to the star cast, Bejo as Peppy does a fine job and Jean Dujardin as our artist is the soul of this film. He carries the film along with finesse and gets a deserved Oscar for the same. George's dog is also worth mentioning. His relationship with George comes out impactfully.<br/><br/>Keeping into consideration the boredom of a silent, B & W movie, the first hour is hard to go by, but then once you seep in, you realise you actually don't need dialogues to tell a story. Overall, this movie deserves a one - time watch for its boldness and the finesse involved in acting."

","The talk of Tinseltown right now is critical darling The Artist – a black and white silent film charting a black and white silent film star's struggle with the 'talkie' phase that hits Hollywood in 1929. It's a lovingly made picture by French writer-director Michel Hazanavicius and is unsurprisingly attracting huge Oscar buzz. However, putting aside the undeniable nostalgic value it holds for cineastes, is it actually entertaining? Well, yes, although not quite as much as the rumour mill would have you believe. The opening act is breathlessly exciting and the middle segment holds its own – a nightmare sequence which features some sound design is a highlight – but the laboriously repetitive final 30-40 minutes is a real slog. Jean Dujardin is fantastic in the title role that will surely see the flood gates open for his career and, like the audiences within the movie, I was awestruck by Bérénice Bejo's young starlet Peppy Miller. A must see for film buffs."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","1","3","7 February 2012"," I am not ready to call it a masterpiece
","Our value of cinema lives inside the phrase 'seeing is believing'. Film is a visual medium and we regularly find that movies dazzle us through the uniqueness of their stylistic form, rather than the distinctiveness of their thematic concerns. James Cameron's Avatar (2009) for example, is the instigator of the 3D rebirth, the highest grossing film of all time, but also a B-grade action film dressed in sheep's clothing. The Artist is at the other end of the spectrum. On a budget of just fifteen million dollars, French director Michel Hazanavicius has the impossible task of making the silent film era attractive for audiences again. Just like Avatar, it is the visual form and style of this film, rather than distinct themes, that are its defining qualities. This is not to say that the film is lacking in depth. A small minority have criticised the film for being 'style over substance'. Since when is image, if it is used to create meaning, not be regarded as deep or substantial? As a silent film today, The Artist is an affectionate tribute and homage to a period where films told stories and developed themes almost entirely through images. The only dialogue here is selectively provided through on screen title cards. Due to the expressiveness of the actors and the film's outstanding formal composition though, these are rarely needed. Hazanavicius is said to have studied the techniques of the silent era extensively and it shows in the quality of the impeccable filmmaking. With its precise, direct camera-work, shooting in the traditional silent era ratio of 1.33:1, The Artist could make a seamless transition back into the very era it is recreating. Great efforts have placed into heightening the mood of the piece, through dim lighting and shadows that detail an era of economic uncertainty. The film was first converted to black and white but Hazanavicius also employs what is called sepia toning, essentially a brown filter, to reflect the changing quality of the film stock over the years. <br/><br/>Although the film is silent for much of its length, there are select moments where sound is cleverly employed for dramatic impact. Deep into the film, Valentin has a dream where the sound of every person and object in his world is amplified. Raising the diegetic sound to these booming levels reminds us of its shattering power and intrusiveness over silence, while also enhancing the psychology of Valentin, who fears that this is the future of his entire life. While in isolation these techniques could be cynically viewed as gimmicks, along with the visuals they are employed to tell a story about the attractiveness of fame and in equal measure, its fleetingness too. Consider the subtly and the economics of storytelling in the following images: when we first see Valentin's home it is handsomely decorated with ornaments and artworks, including paintings of himself. Yet during his downfall even the essential furnishings of his house are barely visible. Entering Peppy's accommodation during her own and its eerily similar to Valentin's, reflecting the reversal of their fortunes. Two of the more distinctive or flashier shots in the film speak volumes about Hollywood. The first is a long shot, held for what seems an age, on a staircase in the film studio. The framing of both the rising and falling stairs shows that regardless of the state of your own career, show business rolls on without you. This is also reflected in a low angle shot of Peppy's billboard, towering over Valentin, alone in the street, realising that a new generation of younger and more adaptive performers have arrived. Further contributing to the story are the performances of Dujardin and Bejo, both of which are faultless in their expression of two people at different stages in their careers. The subtly and the selection of their body language tells us so much about their characters. Two really entertaining performances, three if you include the funny little dog Uggie, are on display here. <br/><br/>Despite the formal strengths and the quality of the performances, I wondered how well a story with more complex or distinct themes, rather than large, broader ones that bode well visually, would have fared under the restrictive conditions of silent cinema. They wouldn't have. Great dialogue is not a gimmick as people once thought. It is a powerful tool, used to strengthen more challenging themes and characters. There are certainly some sharp title cards here but I love films of constant wit and detail, where the most intricate or humorous line of dialogue is spoken in such a way that it adds layers to a character's complexion, history and desires. The Artist finds clever ways of visualising grand but very familiar themes, like fame, technology and generational change to tell a likable and accessible story. Amidst the boring CGI avalanche, where both theme and storytelling are disregarded, we hail a film like The Artist as fresh because of its unique formal style and identity. Save for one very tense moment towards the end of the film though, the story is funny and charming but entirely predictable. The direction of the narrative rarely surprises or moves us, mostly because it owes much to the superior Singin' in the Rain (1952), which covered the transition into the talkies with greater specificity towards the filmmaking process. It is also a serious disadvantage to have seen The Artist's overly revealing trailer beforehand too. With help from one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein, whose company distributed the film, The Artist may very well win the Best Picture Oscar. For me, Hugo (2011) will always be the superior film. It intertwines a clever mystery surrounding silent cinema, with 3D technology, to develop interesting, unique themes about the mechanical nature of humanity. It is a great film that satisfies our cinematic desires for the old and the new. While I appreciate The Artist's bravery and craftsmanship, I am not ready to call it a masterpiece."
"moonspinner55","8","1","3","5 February 2012"," ""With pleasure...""
","Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius' valentine to silent-era Hollywoodland, circa 1927, wherein bright young women who were fast-on-their-feet could find movie-work as extras, perhaps even meet a genuine film star along the way. Filmed in flat black-and-white at the ""Academy ratio"" of 1.33:1--with a modicum of sound and vocal effects, but with a smashing score--""The Artist"" is a genuine oddity for modern audiences, and may put some viewers off before the simple-but-sweet plot unfolds. Hazanavicius himself is a bit hesitant in getting things started, and an early scene with movie mogul John Goodman ordering aspiring starlet Bérénice Bejo off the lot is just a series of cuts back and forth without a grip on the narrative. Ludovic Bource's score (with an enormous tip of the hat to Bernard Herrmann) and Guillaume Schiffman's cinematography come to the rescue on several occasions, yet it is the performances of the dashing Jean Dujardin as George Valentin and the delightful Bejo as Peppy Miller which take the picture from an anomaly to a must-see (most especially for film-buffs). Embodying the never-say-die qualities of early Hollywood before the stock market crash, Dujardin pops off the screen like a cross between Fredric March and John Gilbert (with the voice of Charles Boyer!). It is nearly inconceivable that heretofore-unknowns, regardless of their talent, could pull off an honest-to-God silent movie (presented in the correct time and place) in the year 2011 and come up with results this lovely. ""The Artist"" is a black-and-white rose; it blossoms slowly, and in virtual silence, but the bloom is unique and beautiful to behold. ***1/2 from ****"

","We have seen this story lots of time: A Star is Born. So the director decided to do it as a silent movie. The performances are very good and Dujardin is amazing. The actors are so good that there is almost no need for dialogue and you know both in terms of plot and emotion what is going on without explanation. As a technical feat, this silent film is 10 stars, but you need to tell a story with depth as well. Dujardin does practically all the heavy lifting in this movie, but I just never got caught up in the drama of his descent or in Peppy's attempts to save him. I just felt like paint by numbers (maybe that's why silent pictures died).<br/><br/>So enjoy the craft of the actors, the feel of Hollywood as it transitions from silent to talkies, but not a great movie. Again Dujardin deserves an Oscar nomination."

","What can I say: I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>I've seen a fair number of silent movies: old silent films with updated soundtracks (Metropolis, Man With A Movie Camera); new silent films with live accompaniment(Koyaanisqatsi... ""silent"" probably isn't the word.) <br/><br/>Some people do not think The Artist is very original. By this they mean they would rather have seen the dog clamp his jaws to the heroine's throat, or defecate on the stage, or something equally original and symbolic as that. Probably they think the dialogue was a bit weak also...<br/><br/>My only fear on going to this movie was realized: the girl sitting behind me took the opportunity during a quiet part of the film to fumble around with a candy wrapper. She couldn't wait for the soundtrack to resume. Perhaps she did not think the film was very original either.<br/><br/>The music was fine. The photography was rich. The clichés were refreshed.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film? ""Witz plezure!"""

","Knowing that The Artist was a silent film and having grown up, as we all have, with nothing but those crazy, futuristic talkies, I didn't really know what to expect. The Artist, beginning in 1927 and finishing in 1932, tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) an extremely successful silent film actor whose career begins to deteriorate rapidly with the increasing popularity of talking films. Meanwhile, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) is just beginning her career and after she is shown how to 'stand out from the crowd' by Valentin, her career booms. There is therefore a strange link between the pair throughout the film, and whilst Peppy is going up, George is going down - this is effectively the situation that the film spawns from.<br/><br/>I thought the acting in this film was most impressive. I loved the way Dujardin smiled and I thought he really looked the part throughout, I can't imagine anyone else playing that role and I think that's the sign of a good performance. Bejo was also very good, probably not as good as Dujardin but then I don't think she had the same opportunity to perform as he did. What made their performances, for me, so impressive was the fact that they managed to entertain without words. That may sound very silly and obvious, but when you watch Chaplin in a talkie he's so fantastic at both expressing himself with words and as a mute. Whilst Chaplin had never done a talkie before The Great Dictator, I'm guessing no one in this film had done a silent film before and although perhaps one transition is easier than the other, there's no doubting that to make any sort of transition, and to do it so well, is very tricky. <br/><br/>From the directors point of view, I thought that the same was true. Hazanavicious tells a very good story. I thought that there were a couple of really good shots and clever interplay between live action and the little cuts to words being displayed. Also impressive were the shots of films in making and the creation of films in making (maybe I'm being an idiot and they're based on real films? I don't know) that looked very believable. Whether or not he intended to, Hazanavicious creates a really great tribute to film and cinema, as well as telling a really beautiful, classic feeling story. Without having seen it, it is very hard to explain the feeling you get after having seen it, but though I wouldn't say it was my favourite, nor the best film I've ever seen, it was a cinematic experience really quite unlike I had experienced before and that makes it quite special.<br/><br/>Music is also, obviously, a very important part in a silent film. Going back to The Great Dictator, probably one of my favourite scenes of all time, is the one in which Brahm's 5th Hungarian Dance plays because it demonstrates such character and such an entertainer. Whilst I don't think anyone even nearly matches Chaplin in this, I was still really entertained. The music in The Artist is flawless, it is so good, I would imagine music in films is something that seems far easier than it is. It always captured the mood perfectly and without it being so good the film would fail to convey to you the emotion that it does.<br/><br/>I have a couple of tiny trifles with this film. Firstly, there were a couple (and I do mean a couple) of times when the speech almost dragged on, it didn't work very well in silent and we were left with conversation through caption / text (whatever they're called) screens that felt a bit rigid and unpolished, but again I want to reiterate that this only happened twice. Second I think maybe the script or just collectively the film isn't quite there. Right now The Artist has a rating of 8.4 but I don't think it's worthy of being considered one of THE BEST films EVER, because it's just not. Don't get me wrong, I loved the film and really enjoyed it and appreciate that it's almost revolutionary never seen before, but it just lacks something that might have made it worthy, to be called one of the greats.<br/><br/>Overall The Artist is an absolute must see. It's a very intelligent film (which is probably why a lot of people from Liverpool walked out on realising that was silent) and a very enthralling / enjoyable film. Whilst, as I have said already, I don't think it is one of the greats, it is unlike anything you will have seen before and that is what makes it stand out from the crowd so much. Go and see it!"

","I loved this film. The lead character was charming, and made me understand completely what my parents and grandparents found so interesting about the cinema of their day. This film never really let me go, from beginning to end. It had a very specific tone, that was never violated (except for a purpose), yet never did I feel it was boring. Its surprises were (usually) subtle, probably appreciated more by those familiar with early cinema. Yet, even those who aren't, could be drawn into the story. Seems like everyone loves this film, and so there is little I can say about this film that hasn't been said. I did feel there was an underlying theme that those who don't love themselves can be loved and admired by everyone, but still have a really hard time loving themselves and others.<br/><br/>One other thing I would comment on is the use of the Bernard Herrmann score during a segment of the film. I thought it was an amazingly intelligent use of the music. The scene was getting just on the edge of being too much for the overall tone of the film, and the score's use telegraphed intensity, yet, because it was a recognizable score used in a previous specific dramatic context, it was almost tongue in cheek, and lightened the mood just enough – almost to melodrama – without losing the serious drama. Honestly, it made me LMAO, while still caring about the character's situation. I would dare to say Bernard Herrmann would have loved it too."

","This light-footed and -hearted soufflé of a movie is a reminder of just how much fun it can be to go to the movies.<br/><br/>A film about a silent film star struggling with the transition to talkies that is itself a silent film is the kind of cutesy high concept premise that could go down in flames in the hands of the wrong team. But writer/director Michel Hazanivicius and his stars, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, know exactly how to sell the material so that it all works beautifully. What I liked most about the movie is that it doesn't spend all of its time winking to itself for its own cleverness, as you might expect it would. It doesn't use its silent film conventions to make any kind of commentary on silent films. Hazanivicius and company wanted to make a silent film because they thought it was the best way to tell this particular story, and that's just what they've done, without apologies.<br/><br/>Dujardin and Bejo are being lauded for their performances, and rightly so. It would be easy to dismiss their work as being unchallenging, but I have a feeling both had more difficult roles than one might first assume, and that the fact that they both make it look so easy is part of why they're so good. And the movie looks stunning -- one of the benefits of it being silent is that with words removed from the equation, the images take on extra responsibility to communicate the movie's ideas to us, and what cinephile could resist anything that makes a film more cinematic? <br/><br/>This film and ""The Tree of Life"" both for the moment stand at the top of my list of favorite films of 2011, and it's interesting to me that both are examples of films that let pictures rather than words tell their stories.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"AMichaelL","8","1","3","19 January 2012"," The Magic That Was Lost
","This movie is special. Every now and then, a movie comes along that captures the magic behind cinema, but this film does even more than that. With hundreds of movies made every year, and many of those blockbusters, it is easy to forget film is an art form - and one of the newest at that. Films, before sound, had to rely on music and intensely physical acting to convey everything from plot to emotions, but now the words thrown at us are becoming less and less meaningful, which make the images less meaningful as well. Silent films are a small part of film history when looking at time, but when you consider that without silent films, 'talkies' would've never been possible, silent films are about important as film history gets. <br/><br/>What makes speech so much more compelling? It allows us to know rather than infer. But in this process, we lose a connection to the film. When someone says 'I love you' in a movie, we tend to focus on the words and miss out on subtleties in characters. In my opinion, inference is a much more important skill - and in a way, this movie may speak to why people nowadays tend towards social ineptness (that is, lack of attention to detail, perhaps through sensory overload).<br/><br/>In this movie, you are forced to watch real acting, in fact - it may just redefine how you watch movies (with an increased focus on the actor/actress's abilities, that is). Beware.<br/><br/>The performances were shockingly perfect in this movie, and I found myself smiling brightly and even shed a tear or two. Yes, the editing, writing, plot and direction leave some to be desired, but that is how most movies were back then - it is much more like a general homage to that era than a perfect silent film (of which, there were only a few).<br/><br/>Also, the dog is amazing in his (pun intended) tiny role. <br/><br/>This film is a love letter to film making, to nostalgia, and mostly, to love itself. Whether you love silent films, an actress, or a dog, love is universal - and losing it hurts, but it is when we dig deep and find the courage to love again that we find the most rewarding experiences. If you don't get that from watching it, you weren't really watching."

","A movie star finds his life falling apart when a technological innovation, 'The Talkies', arrives, and the old is swept out to make way for the new. However, salvation is potentially there, in the form of a young star who feels she owes a debt (and feels so much more), if only the star of the silent screen could let go of his pride...<br/><br/>You don't have to look far for films that document the cataclysmic effects of the arrival of sound to silent film - Sunset Boulevard, and Signing in the Rain, to name two genre-opposed examples. Stripping a film of dialogue is also not that rare - consider Daratt. And utilizing the retro feel of black-and-white in the modern age is passé since Ed Wood and Schindler's List. What is rare, possibly unique, is the combination of these elements to create a film that taps into the current desire for nostalgia and feel-good cinema.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin shines as George Valentin, giving a masterful pastiche of the eyebrow-dominant mode of acting of 1920s screen heart-throbs. His charismatic performance most skillfully evokes the period. Bérénice Bejo as the aptly named Peppy Miller poses, grins, winks and melts hearts while holding the pain of an unrequited love for the unwitting George. The directing perfectly complements the theme - George encounters Peppy first on equal footing, later when he is in his ascendancy, and then a bit later on stairs, framed in starkly geometrical terms, with a chastened George making his way down, and an effervescent Peppy going all the way up. They talk, with her occupying the elevated position.<br/><br/>""I will not talk!"" proclaims the opening title card, and the narrative never lets up in its exploration of this essential thematic strand. George won't/can't talk to his wife, Peppy and George never talk about their attraction, George refuses to talk on screen, his closest companion is a gesture-reliant dog...<br/><br/>I have seen this in the cinema on three occasions and each time the audience have applauded at the end. Whether this is a reflection of the quality of the film, and/or the desperate need in our times for nostalgia and uplifting cinema, I do not know. There is something about this film that touches people. A homage to cinema, and an unashamed crowd-pleaser (perhaps the only thing that gives away the fact that the film is French), The Artist is quite simply a triumph. I am not sure if it will last the test of time, but harrumphing about it now would be churlish. Well-crafted, great fun, worthy of the tears you will undoubtedly shed, I recommend it unreservedly."
"bennington13","8","1","3","15 January 2012"," Silence is Golden...
","The Artist has swept into UK cinemas on a tidal wave of critical acclaim, and a raft of increasingly major awards. Set in the late 1920s, just as the advent of sound overturns the Hollywood status quo, The Artist tracks the pride and fall of George Valentin (Jean DuJardin, best known over here for the OSS 117 espionage parodies) following a chance encounter with Peppy Miller (personified by the delightful Bérénice Bejo).<br/><br/>It's a credit to those involved, particularly writer-director Michel Hazanavicius, that what is in effect one of the oldest tales in Hollywood, spun in everything from Singing in the Rain to Sunset Boulevard, is a beautifully crafted homage rather than the empty, prattling cliché it could so easily have become. DuJardin is terrific as the charming but conceited Valentin, with all the old school grace and swagger of Old Hollywoodland heartthrobs, from Douglas Fairbanks to Rudolph Valentino. By the same token, his co-star Bejo, though slightly sidelined at times, is captivating as the aptly named Peppy, big-eyed and beguiling from start to finish. <br/><br/>Yet it's worth pausing to consider that The Artist is not, strictly speaking, a silent movie - it's actually a movie that happens to be silent, an admittedly specious, but nonetheless important distinction. It's a modern movie shot in black and white with only a single line of dialogue and virtually no sound apart from the musical soundtrack. But silent movies were a distinct genre. The absence of sound and dialogue necessitated a different approach to storytelling, with an emphasis on movement and action, not to mention brevity - the average length of a silent movie in 1910 was about 30 minutes. <br/><br/>By contrast, The Artist is 100 minutes long, positively curt by modern standards. But without the crutch of dialogue to lean on, 100 minutes is perhaps too long in this case. Instead, the audience is virtually required to spend portions of The Artist lip reading during scenes which, had they been cut, would undoubtedly have strengthened as well has shortened the film. Because The Artist works best during the (majority of) scenes that require little or no speaking. Shots of audiences applauding, of Valentin wandering the streets alone, the discovery of an anonymous but humiliating act of charity - all of these moments are as gripping, perhaps more so for not being accompanied by hackneyed dialogue. Bejo and DuJardin excel at pratfalling, their shameless mugging and jazz age japes only serving to highlight the pathos they evoke elsewhere, all the more startling for being totally reliant on their physical performance alone. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say I suppose is that The Artist is a wonderful movie, but one that perhaps panders to critics and fans of early Hollywood movies a little more than the average modern cinema goer - the final line (spoken out loud), may feel a little anti climactic for some, but it's rich with meaning and Tinseltown history. It's a film that wants to be clever (the much mooted dream sequence) as well as heartwarming (any scene involving James Cromwell's Driver or Valentin's adorably faithful mutt), but occasionally finds it difficult to reconcile the two (the final set of intertitles are the punchline to a joke that feels a little jarring). And yet by the time the final foot has tapped, all such minor (and in the grand scheme of things, they are minor) flaws will be forgiven.<br/><br/>Go because the media has stoked your curiosity, but stay because of the unabashed feelgood factor. If you can escape the relentless buzz around The Artist, it is a gem of a movie that will help you relocate the cockles of your heart."

It turns far darker then I expected and maybe runs a bit long but that doesn't diminish my overall fondness for this picture. Yeah, that's right, this is one swell picture with a cast of good eggs!

"moviexclusive","10","1","3","18 December 2011"," A glorious tribute to the era of silent movies, 'The Artist' pairs a classic love story with brilliant filmmaking technique and is simply one of the best movies this year!
","There was a time when going to the movies was a guaranteed feel-good experience, where you laughed, cried (sometimes because you laughed too hard) and swooned at the characters and their guffaws. Such was the experience when silent movies in the 1920s were still the rage, and 'The Artist', a black—and-white silent film, is a glorious throwback to the wonder of that age when the medium had just started working its magic into the hearts of people around the world. <br/><br/>George Valentin (played by French actor Jean Dujardin) is a film idol of that era, and when we first meet Valentin, the year is 1927 and he is on top of the world. Valentin is also a showoff, not in the arrogant sort of way many of our celebrities are today but rather someone basking in the public's love and attention lavished on him. It is at the height of his popularity that he meets an aspiring young starlet Peppy Miller (Bejo), who breaks the line of fans outside the cinema and accidentally bumps into him. His false affront quickly melting into a golden smile, which she reciprocates with an equally radiant beam, finds its way to the front page of the next day's Variety newspaper with the headline 'Who's That Girl?'. <br/><br/>Turns out she's also auditioning as an extra for his next movie, 'A German Affair', and an irresistibly charming on-set encounter where he imitates her dancing moves behind an opaque white screen blossoms into an immediate attraction between Valentin and Miller. He also practically hand-twists his boss Zimmer into giving her a bigger role in the movie, and soon the duo are seen shooting a scene in multiple takes while cracking each other up. <br/><br/>By this time, we guarantee you that you would already be won over by their romance, charming and delightful even without the utterance of a single word. Sure, there are the occasional inter-titles to punctuate the music on the soundtrack, but by and large, director Michel Hazanavicius simply trusts in his actors' movements and expressions to convey their characters' feelings for each other. Till this point, the mood is light, buoyant and upbeat, but Hazanavicius isn't content just with a fluffy silent-movie tribute. <br/><br/>You've probably heard of the story of the silent film actor, who unable to make the transition to talkies (or movies with dialogue) falls into a sad state of booze and drugs and eventually to obscurity- and so it is with Valentin. ""I'm the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me,"" he says, taking out his own movie to write and direct a big- budget silent picture that unfortunately few come to see. Meanwhile, Peppy's celebrity marquee soars, with Zimmer embracing her as the studio's future-, and her new picture, which opens alongside Valentin's, easily trouncing the latter. <br/><br/>It's a sad tale, but one that is no less relevant then as it is now. To stay in favour means to pander if necessary to the demands of your audience, and the lesson Valentin learns in the film is also an admonishment to the fickleness of us the viewers. Besides his Jack Russell terrier, Valentin finds that only two people have stuck by him- one, his loyal butler Clifton (James Cromwell); and the other, Peppy. Yes, there's a lot more heart to Peppy than what meets the eye, so don't be too quick to rebuke her and what she represents for causing Valentin's fall from grace. The age-old adage goes that pride comes before the fall, and indeed it is ultimately Valentin's pride that causes him to resist the goodwill of his few remaining friends and descend even further into self-destruction. The ending here however is solidly Hollywood old-school, as befitting of the movies of that era 'The Artist' tries to emulate as well as a perfect panacea for these gloomy depressing times of late. <br/><br/>Hazanavicius' film is as much about the story it wants to tell as its method, and it excels as much in the former as it does in the latter. So much is conveyed using so little, amazing it is to realise how much can be told just through moving pictures. There are also brilliant analogies here- in particular, one where Valentin is standing at the back of an almost empty cinema trying to gauge the reception to his latest movie, while the screen shows his character sliding slowly into quicksand stretching his hand out for help. The technique here is as rich as the emotions on screen, and establishes Hazanavicius as a bona fide filmmaking talent. <br/><br/>Of course, Hazanavicius has some generous help from his lead actor, Jean Dujardin, who gives one of the best performances of the year. He portrays with subtlety, grace and nuance the transformation of his character's fate from adulation to apathy, an even greater achievement especially when you consider his comedic flair in the film's first half- hour. This flair is well-matched by his co-star Bejo, sassy with a positively infectious vibe at first and then surprisingly affecting later on. <br/><br/>In 'The Artist', Hazanavicius has created a film to be loved by both cinephiles and casual audiences alike. Those with both love and knowledge for the medium will certainly appreciate his many references; while those with less of the latter will still be taken by his panache for telling as much, and perhaps even more, of a story than many of today's films without sound. At its heart is a touching love story, one drawn out of the ilk of the enduring love classics of old and infused with modern-day wit and zest. Mark our words- 'The Artist' could very well be next year's Best Picture, so don't let this work of cinematic art slip you by. <br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

","Made as a homage to the era of silent cinema The Artist was a huge critical high back in 2011 and won a number of awards including the Academy Awards for Best Picture (making it the first French film to win the award), Best Director and Best Actor, six César and BAFTA Awards each and the covered Palm Dog Award.<br/><br/>In 1927 George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie star of swashbuckling adventures like Douglas Fairbanks was and by chance he meets an aspiring actress and dancer, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), a woman who admires the actor. However George's career and life as a whole takes a downward spiral after the advent of sound. As George star falls and Peppy is on the raise.<br/><br/>The Artist was a film that made by people who had affection for the silent era, it is not just a gimmick to get awards and critical attention. Director Michel Hazanavicius and his team replicate the style and techniques used for during the period - it was shot in the 1:33 ratio instead of widescreen, they is a constant score throughout the film especially a soft piano track and uses editing techniques that were popular like wipes and transitions. It could have been a film back at the time.<br/><br/>Though The Artist is classical in its approach some modern techniques were used, but this is done for dramatic effect. The best example being a dream sequence where George starts hear sounds, indicting his type of film is dead.<br/><br/>The Artist was marketed as a romance and there is an indication there's a spark between George and Peppy during the first act. In reality The Artist is a tale about film making and Hollywood like Chaplin, Sunset Boulevard, Ed Wood and Hail Caesar just to made a few. Like the Tim Burton classic Ed Wood The Artist is made to look like the films that it is about while the likes of Chaplin and Sunset Boulevard reference the changing time and nature of cinema and like Singin' in the Rain The Artist is about the risk the invention of sound in film has on actors who don't have the voice for talkies. Although Hazanavicius tries to inject some commentary about the filmmaking world of the late noughies/early 10s where the use of 3D was increasing with the George character saying you make popular films, I'll make great ones.<br/><br/>Dujardin won the Oscar for best actor for his performance and he has darker, more interesting role as a riches to rags story, a man who tries to keep his fame and wealth and fails miserably. It takes a lot for a actor to express themselves and Durjardin was able to manage it. Bejo was also deserving of praise, her wide smile and expressive eyes being perfect for silent film. Bejo portrayed as a upbeat, kindhearted person and was a wonderful beam of sunshine in the film. She should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Durjardin and Bejo also had wonderful chemistry together, whether it was meeting outside a premise, dancing during a film shoot or Peppy looking in George's dressing room.<br/><br/>The Artist is a unique film in this era of cinema, a nice throwback to silent cinema. Running at a brisk 93 minutes it is a simple story well told and a delight for anyone interested in classic Hollywood."

","While 'The Artist' is sure to go down in history as a must-watch for Movie critics and student. For those who want to study films, for those who pursue cinema relentlessly, and also for those who just watch movies because they just like to. If you're wondering why a silent film, the movie not only answers it, but makes you fall in love with the medium. it's clearly a product of a thinking director, where every thing in the scene has a story to tell. Whether it's the ironical film posters, street signs, or just a little dog barking quietly in the corner. <br/><br/>I don't need to comment on the talents. The Best Actor award at Cannes 2011 has done that already. I will however mention the four- legged supporting actor in the movie. Best performance I've ever seen so far!<br/><br/>here's an evocative score, an imaginative use of silence, wonderful locations and costume. All rounded off by a top notch cast which includes a brilliant dog. Dujardin is every inch the charming 20's star and Bejo is sassy, surefooted and gorgeous. Go see this people. They do make 'em like they used to!"

","It takes a lot of guts to make a silent movie in this time in history. Audiences, especially in America, want to be entertained instead of seeing something artistic. ""The Artist"" returns a few decades back to where movies were silent, no dialogue and hardly any sound besides music. French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius does something truly unique in this film, telling the story of a silent movie star who meets a young dancer, but the arrival of talking pictures sends their careers in opposite directions. Embracing the historical aspects of filmmaking and using it as a metaphor for his aging lifestyle and change in life works beautifully to incorporate both cinematic art techniques and character development. The French George Clooney Jean Dujardin gives a tremendous and equipped performance as actor George Valentin, not saying a word and yet revealing the most important and daring parts of his complicated and stylish character. Every actor does great work in a type of film that hasn't been done for decades. Each actor shows how much time he or she put in to mastering the silent film character. Director Michel Hazanavicius does great work on mastering the black and white filming, while blending all kinds of history into this film and yet developing his themes and characters beautifully. This is a once in a great while film that, despite some plot errors and points of boredom, does some quite extraordinary."

","A one-off sheer delight for anyone with a love and appreciation of cinematic history and good old-fashioned clean entertainment. Set-up as a tribute to the days of the silent movies, it does so cleverly, lovingly and imaginatively.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot in monochrome with many scenes worthy of pause, it's superbly edited using old-style dissolves for the transitions. The plot happily evokes so any vintage Hollywood classics, most obviously ""Singin' In The Rain"" and ""A Star Is Born"" but there are references to ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Lost Weekend"", ""Lassie"", ""Swing Time"", ""Citizen Kane"" and probably many others too. The score also is sympathetic to the action, drawing in themes from classic soundtrack, most notably Hitchcock's composer Bernard Herrmann but there's much more to the film than just playing ""spot the origin"".<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are just so cleverly staged and written, like Valentin and Peppy's meeting on the stairs with a cast of extras in constant motion around them, the irony of a silent-film star who can't speak to his wife, Valentin's nightmare in sound, I could go on and on.<br/><br/>I really liked the two French lead actors, previously unknown to me. Juan Dujardin as the male lead, George Valentin, an action-hero matinée idol with the athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks Sr, the stubbornness against the talkies of auteurs Chaplin and Keating with a smile as wide as Gene Kelly. With his ever-faithful mutt at his side, his fall from grace is precipitated by his failing marriage then exacerbated by his ostrich-like dismissal of the arrival of the talkies before he is ruined by the stock-market crash the same year. Too proud to accept help from anyone, especially the young female protégé whose career he launches, he falls down a long way before finding redemption at the very end.<br/><br/>Berenice Bejo as Peppy is a delight as the new ""It-Girl"", who makes the most of her lucky break but never forgets the man who gave her it. I personally could have done without the presence in the background of familiar faces John Goodman as the cigar-chomping producer and James Cromwell as Valentin's faithful butler which isn't however to denigrate their performances in any way.<br/><br/>Thoroughly deserving of all its awards, sure it helps if you're a Golden Age Hollywood fan but as a refreshing balm to latter-day Hollywood's predilection for loud super-hero, car- chasing so-called blockbusters, ""The Artist"" really is a veritable oasis in the desert."

","This film is a silent and black-and-white movie. This story is love story. Of course, there are no lines, however, instead of using lines there are much background music. Those music are very nice, I'm deeply moved those. Thanks to a lot of background music, we can feel character's affections. Moreover, even if there is no color, we can feel color through background music and cast's expressions. Those music and expressions show very sensitive feelings. I think those are the special aspect of silent and black-and -white movie. Though cast's acting is awesome, I think the best actor in this film is a dog. I'm really surprised it because it's really look like human actor. I can't call the dog as It, I should call the dog, He. I've never watch such a good dog actor in my life.

"aesgaard41","Null","1","4","11 September 2013"," Brilliant Salute And Homage to the Silent Movie Era
","After ""The Artist"" won five Academy Awards, there was kind of a joke going around on Twitter that it was one of the most praised movies that no one ever bothered to go see, so, I just had to rectify that by renting the DVD at my local movie place, and I am glad to say that the people making those jokes really don't know what they're missing. No, people don't go see Silent Movies anymore, and that's a crying shame because among the movie-going public, there are those among us who actually miss the Golden Years of Hollywood before we were inundated with sequels, computer-generated effects, bathroom humor, movies based on television shows and endless god-awful references to drugs, alcohol and pornography. There's a reason it's called the Golden Age of Hollywood, and Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo demonstrate that so eloquently in this movie by creating characters that we both love and reach out to without uttering a single line. What they have created is not just a modern Silent Film, but also a profile of a fictional Silent Film star and an analysis of the era in general. Contrary to the movie, several Silent Film stars actually went on to bigger success under sound once they embraced the technology, but a few, like Dujardin's character, faded into obscurity and later became icons of a lost age now finally appreciated by film students and aficionados of the old classic movie. ""The Artist"" shares moments of great humor and sincere drama with levels of extreme pathos, all without a single character saying a word. If this movie was taken back in time to pre-1925 Hollywood, I think it would have fit in very well with the works of Douglas Fairbanks. Errol Flynn, Harold Lloyd and Buster Crabbe. If you haven't seen ""The Artist"" yet, what's keeping you?"
"fellow456","6","1","4","10 March 2013"," Mostly Celebrating Hollywood's ""Golden Age""
","Pros: Obviously, a 1920's-style silent film is going to depend even more upon its acting than your average modern movie, as it doesn't have the benefits of advanced visual effects, sound effects, Technicolor, or, you know, dialogue to flesh out a story. That being said, this movie did a great job of casting the leads with actors who could fairly effortlessly convey emotions and thoughts merely through their facial expressions, body language, and general pantomiming. Jean Dujardin especially had a very expressive face, and the director hit a home run in casting his dog, which was, of course, adorable.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was probably the dream sequence, which pretty deftly sums up George's mental and emotional state. That being said, I also enjoyed viewing the film with an eye for any anachronisms within it. They were clearly trying to mimic a 1920's production, but there were some things that they did in the movie that would not have been possible in a silent film from that era. There is a fun list on IMDb of actual anachronisms in the movie, which people- with-way-too-much-time-on-their-hands have noticed and detailed. God bless IMDb.<br/><br/>Cons: I know I said the acting was strong enough to carry the film in spite of the other missing elements that we have all taken for granted with modern movie making, but if I'm going to be honest... I like those other elements. A lot. Specifically the spoken dialogue part. It allows for so much more depth in a movie, and a significantly higher entertainment factor. Also, in order to properly convey emotions and thoughts in a voiceless movie, actors are forced to be pretty campy and mug at the camera a lot. I've just never been real big on that kind of overacting, which was prominent in earlier movies, also due in part to the legacy of stage acting in film.<br/><br/>Overall: I appreciate the attempt to rekindle an older style of storytelling, but I'm pretty confident that there was a good reason for the advancements in movie-making technologies, and I'm generally appreciative of the effects of science here. Now, I'm aware that the mere presence of these technologies does not mean that every movie these days (or even the majority) contains those extra layers, but luckily they're still available. While I don't regret having seen this movie, I wasn't particularly enthralled during the viewing, and I have no overwhelming interest in seeing it again. In the end, I couldn't kick the feeling that it was just one giant exercise in glad-handing the glorious history of Hollywood, so I glad-handed it a 6 out of 10."
"kenjha","7","1","4","26 December 2012"," Not Talking' in the Rain
","As Hollywood makes the transition from silent films to talkies in 1927, a silent star is not able to adapt. Not only does this film cover the same theme as ""Singin' in the Rain,"" but Dujardin looks like Gene Kelly. While nicely crafted and well acted, much of the praise that the film has garnered is due to the gimmick that it looks like a silent film. There's a reason silent films have not been made since talkies emerged. Talking adds an important dimension to films. Without this dimension, this simple film runs out of steam half-way through. Dujardin is expressive, but his character is too aloof and self-centered to elicit much sympathy. Bejo is charming. The dog is adorable."
"Doylenf","8","1","4","6 July 2012"," Delightful romp succeeds largely because of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo...
","The chemistry between Jean Dujardin, as a fading movie star of the silent era and Berenice Bejo as a flirtatious flapper type heroine, is what makes this dazzling B&W film work. Of course, tributes must also be paid to the detailed B&W sets and costumes and to director Michael Hazanavicius who makes it all sparkle.<br/><br/>There's a bit of deja vu when it comes to the script, which more or less follows the path of previous films on transition to sound, such as ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Singin' in the Rain."" Mr. Dujardin, by the way, looks somewhat like a dapper Gene Kelly with a trim mustache and mischievous grin, in the sort of role Kelly played with much gusto in ""The Pirate."" To be fair, there are scenes that go on too long and tend to drag and there's the somber side of the tale that has our hero contemplating suicide, but things brighten up considerably before the fadeout which has Dujardin and Bejos strutting their stuff as dancers.<br/><br/>Aside from the sparkling work of the leads and a strong supporting cast of players including John Goodman, James Cromwell and the dog Uggie, the musical background score is lively and a pleasure to listen to. The only jarring note is a sequence where Bernard Herrmann's ""Vertigo"" love theme seemed out of place.<br/><br/>Faults aside, it's easy to see why the Best Actor Oscar winner went to Jean Dujardin. His expressive face registers every emotion easily. Just as fluent at registering all the right emotions is his co-star, Berenice Bejo, who deserved more than just a nomination as Peppy Miller."

I was asked how I could watch these no sound movies and I replied, 'It's better than all the stupid programs that are on TV now', and if you really watch through them, you'll see the silents are better than present day programming. 40 years ago Public Television would have silent movies on every Friday night and when I was a kid I would get really hooked on them."
"dallasryan","5","1","4","23 May 2012"," It's Worth a Look for the Dog
","What I liked about this movie was the dog's performance as well as the performances from the two main leads. The Black and white use was perfect, the sound and music score was dead on, and it was a decent little story. Now, to what I didn't like about this film.<br/><br/>1. The film is mediocre at best for a silent film. There have been much better silent films, I know my silent films very well, this film is a mediocre one. <br/><br/>2. A huge historical inaccuracy is the studio letting Valentin go, the studio firing him. No studio in their right mind would let their cash cow star go just like that. It just wouldn't happen 'Oh you make us tons of money, buh-bye now. We're getting rid of all of our big stars because people want to see unknowns' Not!! The studio would try to make a transition with him(Valentin) into talking films and if not that studio, another one would have tried. Valentin was basically playing a Douglas FairbanksSr. here. That was very inaccurate and quite stupid on the writers part for The Artist. A simple solution to making this part believable is just have Valentin simply refuse to do talking films as the studio keeps begging him to do them, he keeps refusing until the very end. That would have tied in much better to the ending and it wouldn't have been inaccurate either. And so what if Valentin had an accent. Lots of actors transitioned over from Silents to Talkies with accents such as Charlie Chaplin, Maurice Chevalier(who was french by the way), Greta Garbo, just to name a few. 'In with the new, out with the old story' was so ridiculous, but people in this modern day would believe it because they no nothing about silent films, and unfortunately if they actually had seen some much better silent films, they would realize this film isn't really all that great.<br/><br/>3. In Silent films, the actors over do it with everything, expressions, mannerisms, and for the most part this movie hits that on target, but James Cromwell's performance and part of John Goodman's performance can't really ever decide which movie they are in, which is 'are we acting in a silent film or a modern talking film, I just don't know'. The Artist can't seem to decide what it's identity is. Although I really did like both Cromwell and Goodman in this movie, it's just their choices are off and wrong for what The Artist is going for. <br/><br/>4. The young man at the door says 'My dad liked you'. It's been 3 years and Valentin is a Douglas Fairbanks type. This young man would still adore Valentin, not know who he is. It's only been 3 years, not 30.(I also get that it's a metaphor that everyone in Hollywood forgets you quick. But when you're playing a Fairbanks type Idol, they don't forget you that quick, and it's an insulting scene, making this movie more dumb and inaccurate by every minute. That's like Brad Pitt disappearing for 3 years and then some 21 year old girl seeing Pitt 3 years later saying ""Oh my Grandfather liked you""). <br/><br/>In Conclusion, I'm not usually a person who cares about the accuracy as I always see each movie as a metaphor as most are anyway, and most films have countless metaphors within the story, put there on purpose and sometimes just accidentally. <br/><br/>The problem I have with The Artist is it's paying homage to Silent Films and that era, the last silent film was made over 75 years ago, and when a movie is paying homage to such a significant era, an era which is the backbone of films and movie making, it better get the facts straight. The Artist is a movie that clearly wants and intended to get the facts straight but didn't get the facts straight, not one bit, and it played off the ignorance of it's audience and insulting the intelligence of die hard film buffs like myself as well as probably many film historians out there. You have to get everything right with a movie like this.<br/><br/>The politics and the ignorance is what won this movie it's academy award for best picture. I'd like to believe the academy was paying tribute, to the likes of Chaplin, Keaton, D.W. Griffith, Garbo, Fairbanks, for all the awards they never won and also for Singin' in the Rain for not even being nominated for best film, by giving The Artist the best picture Oscar. But the truth is that Harvey Weinstein really backed The Artist and he has the Academy voters so far up his pie hole that they're almost up to the inside of his chest at this point. Weinstein is the current lobbyist with the academy voters. The academy voters play ball and support his constituencies as he then supports theirs as well. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, just as in office politics, just as in the presidency and everything else pretty much. You go with the heavy hitters and Weinstein is one of the heaviest hitters right now. As humans, we'll buy into everything, we don't run the media, the media runs us, and they choose what we like. But for the ones that want to get it right, at least in this case, see all the Charles Chaplin films you can see, do some hands on research about the era in which this movie takes place. <br/><br/>Much better films about a career going sour are Chaplin's Limelight and an accurate film about the Silent films transitioning to Talkies, and much better too is Singin'in the Rain(which really is smart in the Family Guy type humor it brings to the transition of Silents to Talkies and is fun and accurate in the surface topic of the transition at least)."

","More than seldom I can feel that award shows tend to praise the kind of special, small production and unknown films. When one first got news of The Artist when it started winning all these prises one could definitely get the feeling that it was that kind of critically praised film that the generally movie audience would pretty much ignore. I mean a black and white silent film today doesn't sound like the kind that would make many hundred millions on the international arena. But when it after winning those academy awards and getting a cinema release where I live I decided I would give it a chance and it also felt like quite different from anything else I have seen in cinema. Turns out I was more pleasantly surprised than I have been by a movie in years. The film is absolutely brilliant with many successful factors. First and for most the acting is outstanding. Jean Dujardin really deserved that Oscar and the supporting actors are also great. As a silent film it would be essential that the acting is great. Even if there is some subtitles at times it is not very often for most the film relies on the actors managing to make the viewers understand what is going on and what the characters are feeling. They do it brilliantly. There is however background music all the way through the film. It would feel pretty blank if it would be totally soundless for 100 minutes. The music also is used to tell the feeling and tone of what is going on. Like when Valentin is expressing shock the music is high and dramatic. The story is both a homage to the silent era and a great tale. It's a very emotional story that really grips hold of you. But there is quite a lot of humour as well. Still it is greatly considered to not go so far as being silly and taking away focus from the plot. Hearing the description of the film as a silent, black and white, comedy-drama I could easily fear that it would feel slow and overdrawn. It may just be my preconception that unique dramas are like that but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not so in any way. The running length at less than two hours is perfect. Over all the film fits perfectly in the middle, not overdrawn and not rushed. The Artist is a brilliant movie. The opening is kind of slow for a while but one soon gets into it and after it never let's go. While I would not quite praise it as a masterpiece The Artist is a close to perfect movie 9/10."

","It was one man's singular vision: to create a film in 2012 that reflects the look, style and charm evoked in the cinematic world of 1927. If successful, it would surely be the toast of the Academy. If not, it would be doomed to work the art-house circuit, garnering an apostolic fan base but only seeing the light of day for, ironically, an assortment of midnight screenings. Purists take note: director Michel Hazanavicius does take some liberties with the final product, but for a film that hardly utters a single word, the language of cinema oozes out of every scene with an all-ages charm that deserves every accolade it receives.<br/><br/>George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the world's biggest silent movie star. But with the groundbreaking introduction of 'talkies', it becomes increasingly apparent that this is a business for the young, and that he must change with the times to remain relevant. This is easier said than done for the vain Valentin, who has only ever known one way to make art, and he isn't about to give it up just because some Hollywood big-wig says so. The face of this new generation is Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), a former co-star of Valentin's who seems to keep showing up in his collapsing personal life.<br/><br/>Having to work without the help of the spoken word, Hazanavicius finds a myriad of other ways to tell his story. The occasional attention paid in Year Twelve English finally comes in handy, as the well-trained eye can spot visual motifs all over the place. The titles of movie posters in the background of most shots cleverly reflect and foreshadow the story, while a handful of Hamlet-esque films-within-films add depth and personality to the proceedings. Appropriately, though, music is the organic piece of storytelling, deftly enthralling, calming and bolstering audience sympathies whenever necessary, including a suspenseful climax made all the more engaging by some directorial slight-of-hand, in which the film takes advantage of its lack of diegetic sound to exploit the audience's perception of reality.<br/><br/>And yet, on top of its excellent appropriation of outdated techniques, The Artist has the benefit of being made in an era that does not restrict one's imagination. Filmmaking methods considered too sophisticated for their contextual time are used to great effect when the film demands a sudden change of pace, such as during moments of reflection or dream sequences. In a wholly recreated film, these scenes would look as out of place as a drum solo at a Ramones concert, but their inclusion brings a uniqueness and originality that was certainly not expected.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is not a movie about technicalities. Nor is it a comedy, as so many people have hastened to classify it. It's a movie about heart, trying to tell of the rise and fall of a conflicted man struggling to find his place in a burgeoning new world. And where the medium of delivery might be unorthodox, the theme is certainly universal. Dujardin earns his Best Actor award with the creation of a painfully strong headed, yet sympathetic character, while the (quite literally) unspoken chemistry between our lead and Bejo is enough to make most modern actors extremely jealous.<br/><br/>The film might start off as a gimmick of sorts, introducing a sceptical audience to the marvels of ancient movie-making. Over time, the slow cuts, sped-up pacing and deliberate overacting do not so much 'wear off' as they do 'graciously step aside', allowing the plot and its drivers to take centre focus.<br/><br/>In a world where all films are immediately categorised as either 'indie' or 'blockbuster' well before their release, those who disliked The Artist might argue that it was the film's blatant reverence for the past that won it the top prize. Of course, this argument can only exist in its own vacuum, as a love of all things old seemed to be the theme of this year's Oscars, employed by many quality nominees, including personal favourite Hugo. But where Scorsese has crafted a tribute to one man's greatness carefully disguised as a children's film, The Artist is more of a character piece, with a theme so recognisable it could have been just as engaging if set today.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
"sreenyvasn-1","9","1","4","6 March 2012"," The Artist – A Sound(less) Experiment
","Firstly, let us appreciate the guts of its producer, Thomas Langman, who made this experiment possible in the world that is filled with 3-D and CG films. Director Michel Hazanavicius took the audacious of task of making this silent wonder an eminently watchable film. The impeccable lead artistes—Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo— add glory on their part with their charming act. And the screen stealer is Uggie - a small dog, an accomplice of the protagonist. The story is set in the tumultuous years 1927-32 (a very crucial period for both cinema and politics). We are introduced to the world of George Valentin, a larger-than-life hero of Silent movie era. When talkies were talk of the town, Valentin reluctantly avoids (like Charlie Chaplin) the new form of Cinema. But for the unknown girl, Peppy Miller, who bumps into Geroge Valentin's show, gets the chance of acting in films. She even gets a valuable advice from the Superstar George Valentin how to become a star. From that moment a bond develops between these two. Later she uses the opportunity of acting in talkies and emerges as a well-known star. Like ""A Star is Born,"" as the unwilling George is seeing depth of his career primarily due to his reluctance in acting talkies. At the same time, unknown Peppy Miller's fortune touches the sky. When the Geroge Valentin's agonized wife banishes him, he moves away from the house with his soulful companion - Uggie the dog. The shrewd dog also saves his master from the fire accident. When George is about to commit suicide, Peppy Miller enters and changes the course of his life with a novel proposal that Geroge can't refuse. Constructed upon this simple premise, the movie captures our attention. The primary reason is nothing but the lead artistes who alights the screen with their magnetic performances. The music is too good, so do the art work. Each and every scene is crafted with perfection, making this 100-minute movie a one-of-a-kind gem. The lead star Jean Dujardin ( a reputable French comedian) gets the continuous applause throughout the film for his flawless portrayal of the silent movie star. Likewise, the female lead artiste also gives an equally riveting performance. The facts behind the making of this movie are equally amazing. The movie is shot in colour and while post-production changed into black and white. Barring a few dialogues at the end, the entire movie has no spoken word. Like the silent films, captions provided wherever necessary. The scenes are constructed in such a manner there is no need for dialogues. For the final 2-minutes song sequence alone, the lead artistes rehearsed for almost 6-months! Totally there are three dogs enacted the role of Uggie. Like the good old silent films, the filmmaker used plenty of close-ups and humour-inducing scenes to makes the show live and brisk. Eventually the movie got rousing reception wherever it screened and got countless number of awards, including the prestigious Best Picture Academy Award at Oscars. Evoking the memories of bygone era, the filmmaker created a compelling film that is worthy to watch and cherish. Deeply moving, gently heartwarming, the Artist is a standout drama that will transport you to the glorified days of silent era - an immensely gratifying experience. If you have a time, watch this film. Otherwise, make some time to watch this marvel. R. Srinivasan"

","The Artist (2011) was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius. <br/><br/>It's awkward to give a lukewarm review to a film that's received multiple Oscars, and carries a impressive IMDb rating of 8.4. Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie.<br/><br/>It was a stroke of genius to conceive of making a silent film in the 21st Century. All credit to director Hazanavicius for that. However, the manner in which the concept was carried out left me somewhat bored and disappointed.<br/><br/>The Artist touches on a situation that we've seen before--the trajectories of a young woman and an older man cross as she is going up and he is going down. (Think of ""A Star is Born."") So, that's a somewhat tired concept. Hiding it behind the ""great silent star, but couldn't make the transition to talkies"" doesn't cover up the fact that the plot is an old one.<br/><br/>Also, the director has chosen to make the film not just silent, but in the less-than-subtle style of many silent films. It's purposely obvious and melodramatic. I respect the thinking behind the decision, but I don't enjoy watching obvious, melodramatic movies--silent or with spoken dialog.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is 10 or 15 minutes too long in my opinion. Some judicious editing might have improved it.<br/><br/>The two stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are very good. Ms. Bejo is very beautiful by 21st Century standards, but manages to also look beautiful in a way that would have worked 80 years earlier. It's difficult to comment on the acting, because the actors are in a new movie where they have to act like actors in an old movie. That's hard to manage, and hard to evaluate. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie worth seeing because it's unique. Just don't go to it expecting more than the film can provide. We saw it on a large screen, in the restored Star Theatre in Dansville, NY. The Star was built in 1921, and did, indeed screen silent movies. The theater ambiance helped me enjoy the film. However, The Artist will work well in a cineplex or on the small screen.<br/><br/>Addendum in 2013: Figure skating fans already know that The Artist figured prominently in the 2013 World Figure Skating Championship held in March in London, Ontario. Denis Ten, a skater who represents Kazakhstan, won the silver medal when he used the music from this film in both his short and long programs. The brilliant choreographer Lori Nichol created a situation where the short program represented the beginning of the movie, and the long program represented the middle and the end. You would think that someone before Nichol would have thought to create a continual story line between the short and long programs, but no one had ever done this before.<br/><br/>Of course, in the final analysis, it was Ten's superb skating that brought him the silver medal. (I didn't much like the movie, but the use of the music for figure skating really worked!) Red-125"
"seghers","8","1","4","4 March 2012"," The Artist - A difficult movie to review!
","I thought The Artist was: brave, real, unique, daring. This movie is very simple on the surface, but makes many powerful statements in its simplicity. I believe it will stay with me, fresh in my mind, whereas many other movies I've seen recently will fade quickly away. The only somewhat negative is that it was a tiny bit predictable- I wish the plot would have been a bit more complex and surprising. And this is what brings me to the paradox of reviewing this movie. The simplicity is really part of the point of the movie- and in some ways I was happy for the broad emotions and the few straightforward intertwining arcs of the plot. It takes you back to experiencing what it must have been like when movies were new, and it makes you realize both 1) how far we have come, and 2) what we have sadly lost in the evolution of the art. So many movies babble on, little jokes, pointless dialog about things that matter to pointless characters. This movie had very few words in it, if any... but told a story as timeliness and universal as any movie ever made. While it was a silent- style, black and white movie, it felt fresher and more lively than many other color films with millions of dollars spent on visual and sound effects. And the lead actors, such charisma! Such talent! Like the stars of old Hollywood. One more thing; you just gotta love the little dog."
"ceeingred13","8","1","4","3 March 2012"," Low on story, high on charm
","I very much enjoyed this movie. If it was an imperfect movie, it was equally as charming. The pacing never seemed to lag and though the story has been told before it was handled in some imaginative new ways.<br/><br/>Though a silent film, some of the scenes were clearly heavily inspired by Welles (the scene when they are watching the first clips of a movie in sound is very reminiscent of the newsreel scene in Kane and the breakfast sequence was an almost shot for shot copy of the dinner scene). I was very enchanted with the complicated relationship between Peppy and George.<br/><br/>Dujardin is a gift to silent film. His easy smile and somewhat Clark Gable-like charm keep George likable even as he spirals into depression, despair and ego-fueled meltdown. Bejo brings an energy and liveliness that is a credit to her. It's easy to see why he would both admire and resent her.<br/><br/>All that said, the story is actually a short one. With different direction and different actors, it would have been a sluggish movie indeed. There comes a point when it seems like they could have put more effort into the characters than just showing George lose more and more to the changing times.<br/><br/>Still, it is made up for by an inspired dream sequence and one thrilling dance number. These were the moments that truly made the film for me. It won't be for everyone, but I'd encourage anyone to give it a try."
"bock_g","8","1","4","3 March 2012"," Silent nostalgia
","Let me make this one bold statement: ""The Artist"" is not a classic. However, it is probably the most entertaining and nostalgic flick I've watched in a long time (I watched this on a 12 hr. flight btw). I haven't watched many silent films, but I could definitely tell it pays tribute to them. The premise is simple: a silent film actor who struggles through the transition to ""talkies"" in the Depression-era Hollywood (aka Golden Age of Hollywood). He meets a beautiful young woman (whom he kisses in front of the press)who instantly becomes a star and rode on the new wave of ""talkies"". The contrast between the two characters are nothing fancy, but certainly kept me interested. There was the usual slapstick humor, but it wasn't so obligatory and had kept me quite entertained. The film was shot in color, but was then converted in black and white. The cinematography was fairly good, and certainly emulated some of the old affects pretty well. It's a great reflection of how Hollywood used to make films back in it's ""Golden Age"" and is a relaxing film that puts you right into your seat."

She is really good at dancing and decides to dance in films in George's Studio. Slowly and slowly she gets popular and popular and rises to the top by doing talkies which was the new evolution to films.George only wants to do silent films and slowly and slowly get's abandoned and lost and loses popularity.

I was terrified that the script would be just too ""slow and old style"" like a 1930's movie would be. Wrong. Great Script! When you are expecting an obvious situation during the film, there is a twister, which continuous to gasp attention. <br/><br/>Bérénice Bejo isn't of such recognition of this review (although she is Argentine, as me) but still does a fine job, although she is a socialist.

"jonnyfendi","9","1","4","24 February 2012"," Speechless....................................
","Speechless... is one word to describe thiz movie. It has been proved that you don't need expensive Actors or famous Director to make a terrific movie. The movie is presented like an old time silent movie, it is black and white, almost no conversation and even was shot in the 1.33 : 1 aspect ratio. It takes place in 1927, when George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) was the king of silent movies. An unexpected encounter with the young and lovely rising star Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) takes him to the mutual delight adventure in film industry. Every Actor plays its role perfectly, main or supporting. Jean Dujardin performs a superb and flawless acting. His charisma is unquestionable central element. He's got the eye gaze, the eyebrow raise, the eyelash flutter, the dancing, everything that knocks down the game entirely. His opposite love interest, Bérénice Bejo creates an equal presence. Maybe she's not the most of gorgeous blonde girl figures, but she is positively charming in every way. Other roles by John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller and James Cromwell as a loyal butler and even the dog are proportionally fit as they need to be. The plot is perfectly told. Although it is a black and white silent movie, every minute that you spend, it will not make you bored at all. The selection of musical Score is vital. Music is the life of thiz movie. It flows up and down dynamically during the mood changing in every scene. The man behind the curtain is Michel Hazanavicius, the under radar and unknown Director takes the risk to do something completely different and it seems to be perfectly pay off. I have to say that the conflict issue is brilliant! It is a solid winning theme. If you are an Actor or someone who is involved in thiz industry, you will surely appreciate the message behind thiz movie. It is a Golden Gate that bridging the intergenerational gap.

","I don't quite know what to say about this film. Let me start by saying that my parents and I, who all love film, were somewhat unexcited to see this film. We read the reviews and we are always in tune with the Oscar hype and we went to see it, almost out of a sense of duty. Good lord were we wrong. It is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. It's groundbreaking in the sense that it reminds us that you can have a poignant story without words, not to mention special effects. However, groundbreaking implies that it will create a series of films in the same vein. This is not true either. Silent film is not making a comeback. This is just a bright shining gem in filmmaking – one of the best in a long time in my opinion. It's probably going to sweep the Oscars, it certainly deserves to. As many nominations as it has, I actually think that either John Goodman or James Cromwell should have been nominated in the BSA category. Whoever allowed a filmmaker like Michel Hazanavicius to make this film the way he wanted to deserves now all the accolades that this film will receive after the Oscars. It's going to blow up, if it already hasn't – and it deserves to. Make sure you see it in the theater though, won't translate to DVD as well."

I did find, though, that George's decline went on a little too long, just when you thought he'd hit bottom there was a little further to go.

","This is by far the greatest movie of the year. I want to be a film maker and I can say that I felt absolutely jealous of the creator of this feature after watching it. The use of sound is magnificent. Jean Dujardin is a fantastic actor. And the story is so well written I cried through out the hole movie. It is a tribute to film in its purest form. When film language began there wasn't any sound and I've always thought image is the most elegant way to tell a story. Soap operas relate on dialogue to tell you what's going on, and that's why I've always thought their story telling is vulgar. This is the opposite side of the spectrum. I believe you should see this film even if you think that a ""silent"" and black and white film isn't interesting. You won't be disappointed. It's funny, engaging, deep, meaningful and subtle."

","I'm guessing that the world has been screaming out for silent, black and white movies this year in the wake of slow and plodding cinema releases recently like ""Hugo"" and ""Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy"".<br/><br/>This movie deals with the historical transition from silent movies to ""talkies"", in the late 1920s, and the effects that this has on an established star of the silent movie era (George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin).<br/><br/>Even though this movie is in black and white and is, for the most part, silent, it's entertaining enough, in its own way. Dujardin must be a good actor, because in one scene, in front of a mirror with an attractive woman, he is actually looking at the woman's reflection and not himself in the mirror...the narcissistic nature of the acting profession means that that sight is as rare as hen's teeth. He is also amusing in the moments where he readies himself to be filmed for a scene. The cast do tend to recreate the acting styles of the silent era and one could say, perhaps, that Dujardin's eyebrows are more expressive than Laurence Olivier's ever were...that's a joke...not in the sense that Olivier's eyebrows were peerless...never mind...Dujardin's face is quite ye olde expressive, even if his eyebrows may not be...which I don't remember in any case!<br/><br/>I did enjoy the scene where rising star Peppy Miller (played by Bérénice Bejo) has a moment with Valentin's coat. Nice.<br/><br/>The film does lightly touch on some significant moments of the era, like the Other event of 1929.<br/><br/>Some people just seem born for this era of filmmaking...can you imagine how big a star Fran Drescher could have been at that time?<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie has some good physical comedy and ""lines"". Many critics are mentioning the dog as being a star of this movie.<br/><br/>Did manage to predict things in this movie...e.g. the kind of thing to happen when the feather dropped...what was in that locked box in Valentin's house.<br/><br/>If there is actual sound recording of the cast of this movie acting, that might be fun as a DVD extra for this movie...I would definitely give that a burl!"

"badajoz-1","7","1","4","27 January 2012"," Charming Movie
","Really worth seven and a half, but it is a very simple, charming film with an excellent performance from Jean Dujardin and his dog. Yes, it's not quite a silent movie - some other comments will highlight the shortcomings, but would today's audiences accept the mugging all the way through and the more crudely cut scenes and still camera-work. But at least the characters were alive - unlike Gary Oldman's impression of the Walking Dead in 'Tinker,Tailor etc.!' The storyline of the old silent star falling from fame, while the chorus girl (who secretly loves him) climbs to the top, is fairly trite and straightforward, but told with brio and pathos - and, more importantly, with sincerity and entertainment in mind! It is far more acceptable than Spielberg's heart tugging, hankie wiping, part failure with 'War Horse.' The direction is mostly good, especially in recreating the more humdrum, middle brow, actioners of the silent era, while the 'spot the original stars' shown is quite fun, even if there is no time to work out the anagrams of actors' names on the billboards! I must say the redemption of the hero is a little trite - I thought it would come through being the trainer of his dog as a sort of Rin Tin Tin/Lassie after being rescued, but there you go! All round just go and treat yourself to some entertainment - leave your preconceptions of a twelve hour silent epic 'Greed' at the door!"
"zetes","8","1","4","22 January 2012"," Quite enjoyable!
","A highly enjoyable little throwback to the silent film era. It's more or less a slightly altered version of Singin' in the Rain. Its male star, Jean Dujardin, is even a dead ringer for Gene Kelly (and, in a far too brief role, the wonderful character actress Missi Pyle also makes a great stand-in for Jean Hagen). Dujardin plays the great silent film star George Valentin, a Douglas Fairbanks type who makes swashbucklers and spy films, is always aided by his trusty dog (played by Uggie, but strangely never named in the film), and always wins the girl. One day he meets up with an attractive extra, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), who meets his fancy. Unfortunately, he's married, so that romance has to die before it even starts. The film opens in 1927 - a couple of years go by and Valentin is being pushed out by the advent of sound, while Peppy is becoming a major star. The story isn't anything really special, honestly, and the silent filmmaking, while it is well done, is nothing more than a gimmick. The film might not work at all if it weren't for Dujardin and Bejo, both of whom are just charming as all get-out. Bejo in particular is just one of the most gorgeous starlets ever - it was really surprising to find out she's been toiling away in the industry for over a decade now (she co-starred in A Knight's Tale, with Heath Ledger, in 2001). It takes a while to get over Dujardin's resemblance to Gene Kelly (I have to imagine director Michel Hazanavicius, who made the two French spy spoofs in the OSS 117 series with Dujardin, came up with the idea by wondering what it would be like to remake Singin' in the Rain with the star), but I did eventually. I was enjoying the film so much I have to admit I didn't even notice the use of Bernard Herrmann's Vertigo theme."

","Last year I had a hard time coming up with #1 on my Top Ten of 2011 list and even though I ordered the top four, it was pretty much a 4-way tieuntilI finally saw 'The Artist' (5/5 Stars) or a better title: 'The Masterpiece.' I'm not going back to change my list, but this is by far the best of 2011 and one of the best movies I have EVER SEEN. I can't even count the number of attributes to the beauty of this film, but I'll try: Originality, gorgeous cinematography (yes, even for a B&W film), great dialogue (yes, even for a silent film), perfect acting all around, depth, chemistry, hope and just a sincere pleasure to watch. One of my favorites, not listed, was the ability to move the story along without an intertitle card. The acting, gestures, story and fantastic score moved us along so brilliantly, we could just rely on the actors vs. the obvious spoken words. All players, er, artists, were having so much fun recreating a great era of cinema you can see it ooze out of them with each facial expression and body language. This is, indeed, a masterpiece to be enjoyed, studied and watched by all who enjoy true cinematic works. Actually, just make that everyone should see this. My bet, before seeing this, was that it would win the Oscar for best Picture. After seeing it, I feel it should also win best cinematography, actor, actress, screenplay, score, and sound. It would be a crime if it didn't."

","No, you probably don't know the lead actors. Also, the whole movie is in black and white, and there's hardly any dialogue. But I beg you, give this movie a chance, or I just flat out don't want to see you anymore! With early Oscar buzz and highly acclaimed reviews, ""The Artist"" is a black-and-white silent movie about a silent movie star, and his fall from fame. Now, out of all the movies in 2011, ""The Artist"" is one of the most hilarious, enjoying, and breathtaking movie-going experiences of this or any other year. Jean Dujardin totally deserves a Best Actor win, stealing the whole show for his work as George Valentin, a silent movie actor during the 1920s silent era of Hollywood, with his trusted companion, a hilarious puppy. Seriously, that dog has his best laughs in the entire film, and he's one of the best animal actors ever seen on screen. Then, he meets the gorgeous Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, a big fan who soon takes over Hollywood by storm, leaving George on the far sidelines. James Cromwell is also really brilliant as George's ever-loyal valet who is always there for George, even in his tightest situations. John Goodman is awesome as the studio boss, who tells George that ""talkies"" are going to take over the new future of cinema. With the talkies being introduced, and the silent movies are disappearing, George's career disappears as well, and loses all his popularity rapidly. All I need to say is that I've never had this much fun watching a movie in a long, long time. I enjoyed every single moment in this movie, from beginning to end. This is a unique and different movie-going experience, and it felt like watching a film in the 1920s. The casting ensemble is breathtakingly brilliant, and they didn't need to say anything. I was blown away by the sight of this movie. The addition of using the black-and-white detail, and the silent movie style is super unique. The cinematography is amazing, the editing is super, the music is beautiful, and the acting really carries the movie. Written and directed brilliantly by Michel Hazanavicius, ""The Artist"" is a beautifully well-made motion picture that teaches about the age of motion pictures, the changes that new technology will make, and how some fame can go away, just like that! So, bravo to the people that made ""The Artist"". This is one of the best movies ever made, and I hope that this is the Best Picture winner of 2011. ""The Artist"", in my review, ""a visualizing and enchanting motion picture experience""."
"chaz-28","10","1","4","11 January 2012"," A mesmerizing masterpiece; please go enjoy this homage to silent film
","George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) has a dream halfway through The Artist with real sound. He sets a glass down on the table and it makes a noise. The phone rings, the dog barks, and it all sounds so harsh and shrill. Both George and the audience wait for George to wake up and end these horrible noises. Please, take us back to the wonderful world of silent film in black and white whose only sound is the soothing cinematic orchestral score. <br/><br/>Yes, The Artist is silent. The actors are moving their mouths but only every now and then does a dialogue screen pop up for the audience to read. The effect of this throwback is a mesmerizing masterpiece. Just as Hugo was homage to the earliest films and George Melies, The Artist celebrates the late 1920s silent film era and appears so accurate it most likely could have been released in 1927. The giveaway is that everybody in the movie theater on screen is smoking. Nobody in Hugo's Parisian train station was smoking which is good for the kiddies, but kills authenticity.<br/><br/>George is the silver screen's golden boy. His motion pictures make a ton of money, the audience loves his swashbuckling heroes, and his incredibly well-trained Jack Russell Terrier usually stars right along side of him. Through a series of unlikely events, an aspiring actress, a perfectly named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), appears on his studio lot as an extra and they develop a noticeable level of chemistry together, though there is no sign of adultery because this is 1927. George is a married man and while he may be distant from his wife, there will be no vow breaking here.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with Singin' in the Rain, then you know what is coming – the talkies. George takes one look at an early prototype of an actress speaking on screen and laughs at is as a gimmick. Nothing could replace silent film and besides, the audience, ""his audience"", would never stand for it. How wrong he is. Soon enough, studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) fires George choosing to begin the era of sound in film with fresh faces, such as Peppy Miller.<br/><br/>The depression strikes, George blows through his savings on one last ditch attempt to save silent film, and he is done for. He is not alone though, his reliable dog is with him as well as his now unpaid chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell). Peppy is never far either. She remembers who was responsible for her meteoric rise and is perhaps playing some Fairy Godmother role in George's life even though she is much younger. <br/><br/>The plot seems a bit thin and silly as I write this, but it comes across as much deeper than it sounds. George and Peppy are wonderful on screen together and The Artist is just so much fun to sit back and watch. The doubters will naturally stay away from it no matter what anybody writes; the combination of black and white and silence is just too scary to think about sitting through even though this is leagues above the common denominator."

","THE ARTIST had received a lot of buzz before hitting the Chicago International Film Festival and I immediately saw why.  This movie was about the transitioning time of silent movies to ""talkies"" and the stars that came from both eras.  THE ARTIST captured my heart from the beginning.  There is something romantically nostalgic about the depth and spectrum of black and white.  Berenice Bejo plays Peppy Miller who was mesmerizing on the screen and played the aspiring starlet.  She was star stuck in a chance meeting with the leading man George Valentin played by Jean Dujardin.  George was actually just as spellbound by Peppy as she was with him.  With a bit of help from George, Peppy skyrockets in her career.  George refuses to think that ""talkies"" could be a part of the future.  Zimmer, both Peppy and George's agent, played by John Goodman, watched one actor soar and the other crash and burn.  Penelope Ann Miller plays Doris Valentin, the frustrated and bored wife of George.  It was an interesting cast of French and American actors, but when it's a silent film, it's all about facial expressions and body language.  In fact, the actors even make light of the old-school method of over acting when there was no sound.  I found myself laughing, chuckling, and connected to the characters.   Midway through the film, I admired the outfits of the era and felt completely taken aback as I consciously remembered I was watching a black and white film. This was a wonderfully artistic, nostalgic, and sweetly told story...completely entertaining.<br/><br/>I can now see why THE ARTIST was described as ""the darling of Cannes.""   Be sure to see it on the big screen in November, 2011."

","The work of Jean proves that an actor is like water and no matter what role they get they should be able to complete it. We should admire the zeal of the other actors besides him, but we can say this with no doubt that Jean has put them down during the process of his masterpiece. On the other hand the movie itself isn't that bad either with lots of comedy and drama it illustrates that an actor does not need a voice to perform and is an amazing movie. In my opinion one of the greatest and a must watch. While most of the other movies in the same year are better than The Artist, this movie explains a lot of other goods in a movie that can be done by great directors and great I mean absolutely great actors."

","This movie is a masterpiece by itself portraying a very critical time for movies and the American society – The end of silent movies and the market crash of 1929 hence the beginning of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>Silent movies were very big in those days but the arrival of sound posed some complicated challenges to the actors. The film bosses and the public wanted for something new and silent movies were abandoned in a dramatic way.<br/><br/>Silent movie actors didn't have to memorize lines, they ""just"" had to mimic the feelings of the script by gestures and faces. This by itself wasn't easy but sound was another matter. Besides script memorizing they had to use their voices, which in some cases were not the best solutions for the movie.<br/><br/>The image of the actor and its expressions were not enough anymore. This meant that the grand majority of the silent movie actor weren't able to make the transition between silent and sound. And this is the story of George Valentin in a great performance by Jean Dujardin, assisted brilliantly by the always trying to help Peppy Miller – Berenice Bejo.<br/><br/>In a time of sound, image, CGI, green screens, and all the movie trickery that we grow accustomed to, this is a breath of fresh air. It helps us, movie lovers, to appreciate good cinema, the classics. <br/><br/>It is important to look forward in a quest for new and innovative solutions, different ways to tell a story, but in order to do so with a consistent base of knowledge, we should not forget the classics, and this is a perfect and modern representation of a classic.<br/><br/>We should know the past in order to understand the future."

","In 1927, George Valentin is a big Hollywood star, who by chance meets aspiring actress Peppy Miller. But George's career takes a slump when sound comes in and he refuses to talk, while Peppy's fame is on the rise. Can George overcome his artistic block and pull his life together again ?<br/><br/>This terrific movie, like The Purple Rose Of Cairo or Cinema Paradiso, is a film made out of pure love for cinema itself. It's beguiling, charming, beautifully acted, technically dazzling and an artistic triumph. To my knowledge, Jacques Tati and Mel Brooks are the only filmmakers prior to this with the courage to make a silent film in the sound era, and Hazanavicius joins their illustrious ranks. I love the way the movie plays with its theme - it starts with George in a spy movie being tortured and refusing to talk, it's replete with signs requesting silence, and George's creative slump is literally made manifest by noise. This is a beautiful idea - if only the great silent stars like Lon Chaney, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford and Rudolf Valentino could have seen it. The recreation of the period and more importantly the style of the silent era is bang on; it was shot in the 4:3 ratio and at a lower frame-rate, deliberately replicating only camera moves available at the time, and it looks gorgeous. Dujardin and Bejo are excellent in the leads, expressing everything using only their physicality - the purest of acting - and the excellent support cast look perfect, notably the scene-stealing performance from Uggie the Jack Russell Terrier, who won the prestigious Palm Dog award at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The other key aspect of the film is Ludovic Bource's truly inspired score, which uses woodwind and percussion in particular to complement the action, provide emotional gravitas and recreate the period in equal measure with seemingly effortless ease, amusingly comical one moment, romantic and languorous the next. If I have one mild criticism of the movie it's the decision to use Bernard Herrmann's Scene D'Amour theme from Vertigo as the accompaniment to the dramatic penultimate sequence. The music fits perfectly and the scene is beautiful, but the deliberate inclusion of such a classic piece of movie music is perhaps too much of a distraction in a film where the rest of the original score is so strong. I like silent films; I respond to their purity, and I love sound movies like C'era Una Volta Il West or Wall-E which recognise that you can create so much more without dialogue. The Artist is a cool, classy, funny, touching and hugely enjoyable modern silent movie."

","Probably one of the greatest movies of our generation. The music, acting, and culture that tied this movie together were marvelous. The characters have absolute perfect chemistry and play off of each other so well! The effects with the sound brought Hollywood classics 75 years into the future and showed how the use of sound changed Hollywood forever. This movie was truly a classic and should be marveled for years to come. The music brought so much life to the film as well as the characters, settings, and even animal sidekicks. It definitely deserved it's wins at the Oscars as it will teach the younger generation the culture of classic Hollywood film and inspire millions of young film makers worldwide. The only thing I would change is the overall plot and not too much either. I'd just change a few things towards the beginning of the film to make the main characters more honorable. All in all, I think this movie was one of a classic."

","I first saw this movie when I was a senior in high school (about age 17). I never truly appreciated film the way I do today. This movie started my love and appreciation of American Cinema. After seeing this movie I was in complete awe, sure the movie had no conversation or dramatic lines acted out but that's the beauty of it. Every dramatic tone, every funny and quirky moment is perfectly acted out by the extremely talented actors in this movie. <br/><br/>The story is wonderfully told and was wonderfully written. There are so many particular scenes that stand out to me as expertly written and shot (Where George has his nightmare and when George and Peppy meet on the staircase, to name a few). Seeing George having to go through the new transition of film (from silent movies to ""talkies"") is certainly a sight to see. It makes you think ""why is he being so resistant?"". It takes some thinking but the answer could be two possible things (look in the message boards). the ending is something guaranteed to make you smile. I had never been so captivated and sucked to a movie before in my life until I saw this. <br/><br/>The characters, the chemistry between them, and how they act makes this movie phenomenal. The music is fantastic and so are the set pieces. Literally everything about this movie (to me) is perfect. Not many movies that win Best Picture will be remembered, but, The Artist will be remembered as a truly phenomenal movie that bought back black and white to the new age of cinema."

","Or why ""The Artist"" is one of my most favorite movies of all time and the best film in 2011...<br/><br/>This movie is a wonderful reason to prove my point of view that everything in life must be done as an artistic expression. ""The Artist"" is a magnificent piece of cinematic experience, not only because it brings us back to basics (what is a film, how should actors play, how can the sound, the point of view of the camera and the black and white colors express all the detailed aspects of different emotions), but also because it makes us better humans. During the 100 minutes of ""The Artist"" we enjoy not only a warm and lovable film, but we are reminded a very important lesson - that cinema was created to convey natural human feelings and bring people from different places and cultures together. The lack of dialogue and colors don't make this movie more introverted. They serve a very special purpose - to bring forth every gesture, every mimic, every touch and facial expression, which we miss even in our every day life. This is another reason why ""The Artist"" is such a treasure. I must say - the aristocratic crisis of the main character is such a powerful symbol! Every single person has some kind of a talent. And when we develop it, our ego grows with it. But we really recognize our own features only when we meet another gifted person. And this is how the two main characters collide and show us the true virtue of life - love. From this moment on George Valentin and Peppy Miller are entangled into one fate and future. They save each other from the true grayness of life.<br/><br/>So when we see them dance at the end of the film, we are truly and heartily happy for them. And the creme de la creme is the breathless finale of this masterpiece of film making."

","*Possible Spoilers* <br/><br/>Nope. Sorry. I found The Artist's ""silent movie"" concept to be, for the most part, a major misfire and a real test of my patience.<br/><br/>OK. At first I could accept (sort of) this film's ""no talking"" policy because its story was set in the years of silent films (from 1927), but, once its story moved into the talking era, the effect of non-speaking actors and the continued use of dialog cards quickly lost its initial novelty.<br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing new or fresh about what went on in The Artist's story. Like, haven't we all seen this same old scenario all before, ad nauseum? <br/><br/>Since The Artist relied solely on nobody audibly speaking to carry it through to its corny ending, that, from my perspective, just wasn't sufficient enough to keep the picture interesting and hold my undivided attention. I found it was a badly conceived idea for a feature-length picture.<br/><br/>Even though this b&w film was a depiction of the silent-era of film, it, in itself, did not have the proper feel of an authentic silent picture. It had clearly missed the mark.<br/><br/>I have seen plenty of silent films in my days, but The Artist just wasn't able to capture that essential feeling which naturally comes to one while viewing a genuine ""silent"". The look and feel of this film was definitely all wrong.<br/><br/>I really can't believe that The Artist actually won an Oscar for ""Best Picture"". This is one of those movies that (again) I suspect people are afraid to come right out and say that they don't really like it much. Because if you say that then you're considered to be so uncool (or something equally dumb like that).<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that I hated The Artist (there were parts about it that appealed to me), but, it really wasn't deserving of all the praise and admiration that it garnered for itself.<br/><br/>Perhaps if The Artist had been a bit more uplifting like Singin' In The Rain, instead of focusing so intensely in on George Valentin's tedious, self-pitying despair, then I think it would've been worthy of all the acclaim that was heaped upon it. But, as The Artist stood, it wasn't adequate enough to be considered such an all-time winner.<br/><br/>And, to be honest, the only ""character"" in this picture who I thought was deserving of an Oscar for ""Best Actor"" was the cute, little dog who knew about a million clever tricks. Yeah. I think that this smart pup deserved to be at least named, but, sadly enough, he remained nameless throughout this film's 100 minutes of silence which was literally so loud at times that it was almost deafening."
"cultfilmfan","10","1","5","5 March 2012"," The Artist
","The Artist takes place in Hollywood in the late 1920's and focuses on a famous silent movie star named George Valentin. He has made quite a name for himself starring in some very profitable films over the years, but his career could be put on hold, or end permanently with sound and talking movies coming into play. The film also focuses on a young dancer named Peppy Miller, who gets her big break working on the talkie films, but early in her career she did work with George, and has always cared much for him and now will also do what she can to save his career. Because, The Artist is about a silent movie film star and takes place in the late 1920's the film that we are watching is actually a silent film. Most of the characters say what they have to say through expressive facial gestures and when there is an important moment of dialogue it is printed against a black screen in between shots of the characters. I have read online and even with people I am acquainted with, I keep hearing that people do not want to see this film for the simple reason that there is no talking in it. Never mind the fact of all the awards it has won and all the other great reviews and acclaim it has gotten. People can not seem to get over the fact that there is no talking. This did not bother me one bit, but having seen many wonderful silent films from the 1920's, or even earlier, this did not bother me because it does not impact, or take away from the story, it is basically just a different way of presenting it. I think if those skeptics were to see The Artist, their opinion would change quite quickly because this is such a delightful film that I would really find it hard for people not to like it. The film is very entertaining and captivating and the performances by the entire cast are all very good here. Yes, there is no talking, but they convey what they have to say and their feelings that come out of each scene with great posture and body language that once you get used to it, you do not miss the talking at all. The black and white cinematography looks great here as well as the costumes and sets of the era it takes place in. I also quite appreciated the story behind the movie and dealing with silent films drastically coming to a halt when sound is finally available and major studios jump at the chance to make talkie films in order to cash in on what they figure will be a huge success and the way of the future. Watching a film like The Artist, in 2012 we all know that the talkie films did become a huge success and that is how we watch films, or have watched them from that point on throughout the decades. It doesn't focus on this, but later on you have to wonder about what will happen to the characters when Technicolor comes in and films are no longer in black and white. I don't think that is quite as big an issue to people as sound because we still occasionally today have films made in black and white that try to capture a style and time period of long ago. I also wonder if maybe in his own way director, Michel Hazanavicius is also commenting on the current state of film in general these days. With the closure of some major video store chains it is now getting very hard to rent films and everything seems to be going over to digital. If we want to see a film we now have a hard time just going out and renting one, when the now preferred format is downloading off the internet and using streaming services to do so. I think eventually the few remaining stores and chains that even sell videos, DVDs and Blu-Rays will also unfortunately die out and again everything will be made digital. It will be a great convenience to many, but also to many a great inconvenience. People still seem to enjoy actually getting out and watching films at a movie theatre, but who is to say that that will last forever and if it one day soon may be available for people to watch on their own home systems as well. For us with any major hobbies such as film, or even music, the future of this media can be scary. The Artist tells a story with so much feeling and drama, but at the same time with a lot of humour and romance that it is a joy to behold. I absolutely loved this film from it's wonderful and feel good story to the great acting, directing and writing. I did not find that what they tried to do here with making it a silent film was gimmicky, or done to sell more tickets, or be self indulgent. I found it a very ingenious way of capturing the movies of old and bringing a part of them back to life for us. The film is entertaining, charming and great to look at and with great performances. Last year really seemed to pay a lot of tribute to classic cinema with Hugo and now The Artist, and I hope more people will give films like The Artist a chance and older silent films in general. This film was the little film that could. It came out of nowhere and won the attention and acclaim of critics and awards circles and also won my heart over as well. I absolutely loved every minute of The Artist. A classic in the making and one of the best films of 2011."

","Without the need of 3D, its beauty and its power will jump at you. Set in the 1920's and early 1930s, ""The Artist"" shows without unnecessary complications how movies became a part of our lives. George Valentin is one of the icons who rule the world of cinema in silent pictures. He is adored by fans, and he knows it. What he doesn't expect is that times are changing, and he should at least be cognizant of it.<br/><br/>Soon, the world is different, and George must face the hardships the market crash, poor foresight, and the arrival of sound in cinema place on him. The film gives us an entertaining look at Hollywood, as silent films are played inside a silent film, and all the drama surrounding the production of such films, the effects on the personal lives of actors, and most importantly, the powerful cultural forces that films are.<br/><br/>For a century now, they have become part of our lives, and actors like Valentin and Miller are stand-in's for figures like Garfield, Garbo, Swanson, and some of the stars who faded or managed to survive. The personal tragedy of Valentine is a love letter to the joys movies give us. Playing like a silent film, the film and his performance are a joy to watch. Every gesture reminds us that every look resonated on the big screen, and how important a well written screenplay has always been. Yes, the actors might have mugged the camera in more than one occasion, but there was a pure force up there, beyond special effects, and the influence of research and marketing. We have always gone to the films to be entertained, to see our stories up there.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" tells a universal story: the way people live, love, survive, make mistakes, learn, and move on. Valentin has to deal with a series of obstacles, and what's outstanding is that he makes every second of this film rich and touching. Dujardin, the actor, could have been a silent movie star. He proves it with his performance, and he shows what a marvelous actor really is now, as he is able to tell a story with his face, with his eyes, with physical dexterity. All of this is accomplished with the assistance of a great director who respects and loves the films that inspired him. One is able to see the various tributes throughout the film. This film flows and has a strong real heartbeat from its first frame, and its exuberant conclusion is a sweet testament that there is still hope for us, movie lovers. Here is a movie that should be playing in real movie theaters and not be treated as if it belongs in a museum. Ironically, unlike the other tribute released this year, so dependent on the themes of time, I never looked at my watch this time because I didn't want this gem to end.<br/><br/>Forget color, 3D technology, crazy camera moves, get in line and prepare yourself for a rare and truly satisfying experience, a movie that will help you relive and understand what an amazing time one can have at the movie. I wanted to see this film again after it ended, and I'm sure most of us will probably see it over and over."

","The Artist (2011): Dir: Michel Hazanavicius / Cast: Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, James Cromwell, John Goodman, Missi Pyle: A glorious celebration of the expressionistic nature of silent films. Set in 1927 where sound entered films thus threatening silent stars. Among those is George Valentin, a success story until his pride refused to relent to talkies. His attempt to pursue further silent film success is met with failure to the point of bankruptcy and a breakdown. His core supporter is Peppy Miller, an actress who made her debut in his last successful silent film. Now she is a huge success in talkies but feels guilt at the reality of Valentin's descend into the realms of despair. Director Michel Hazanavicius wisely shoots this in black and white and uses sound in two well placed scenes, one being a nightmare where Valentin must face the reality of sound. He also knows how to regulate humour in a reference to the silent comics, in a way to lighten the reality of sound. Jean Dujardin is charming as this celebrated movie star, great in his era but reluctant to delve into change. Berenice Bejo blooms in every scene from her innocent first encounter with Valentin, to her success that never shades her humble nature when remembering her roots. It is interesting how Valentin initially assists Peppy, and how she eventually attempts to return the gesture. James Cromwell plays Valentin's loyal valet who never wanders too far away even when forced to. Some highlighted supporting cameo appearances could have been broader, otherwise this is a triumphant reflection of a different era in film history. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

Much has been said about how certain actors had the wrong look or ""accent"" for the new medium; here, we have something much closer to the truth. Moviegoers accepted Greta Garbo and Maurice Chevalier with their accents. Stars like Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were unsuccessful because they were perceived as too old and/or could not develop their acting skills...<br/><br/>Dujardin as ""The Artist"" looks very much like Mr. Fairbanks. He also mirrors the popular star's manners. Although this story is supposed to take place behind the scenes, we mostly remain in a silent film mode. In total, it is a visual beauty that presents as a nightmare. This is evident in the opening, when ""The Artist"" refuses to talk; his refusal is so adamant, it carries on after the scene ends. Later, Dujardin suffers a nightmare with sound. The sound effects and music, by Ludovic Bource, are brilliant. In the late 1920s, an art form froze in time.

","Great movie. <br/><br/>Filmed entirely without dialogue or sound effects other than the score (well, almost entirely, but I don't want to give anything away). In addition, not all of the dialogue is then sub-titled. Thus, rather than being spoon-fed the plot, you have to use your brain and your imagination. Makes a change from the majority of modern movies where you are walked through the plot, inch by inch, and it mostly consists of things being blown up, in vivid fashion, anyway! <br/><br/>The director's use of symbolism helps the plot along. Admittedly, the plot isn't that complex, so the brain won't be too taxed (hence the 9/10 rather than 10/10). <br/><br/>Great performance from Jean Dujardin in the lead role, well supported by Berenice Bejo, John Goodman and James Cromwell.

","One of the most refreshing movies I've seen has to be the film The Artist (2011) directed by Michel Hazanavicius. In an era where all of the movies have a wide array of special effects and extensive dialogue, The Artist stands out as a movie produced as an old-style black and white silent film. Relying solely on music and plot, the film proves to stand out of the crowd of gaudily produced movies. The film focuses on a successful silent film actor George Valentin who tries to deal with love and the uprising of the new ""talkies"". The film has a surprising psychological twist, as it portrays Valentin's hardships of rejection and attempted suicide. During its opening weekend, the movie only opened in four screens, receiving 204,878, ultimately grossing $44,667,095, compared to the estimated budget of $15,000,000. Although people may already be used to the color, the dialogue, and the effects of current films, watching The Artist is a breath of fresh air.

","The Artist tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star who happens to bump into one of his fans, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), inspiring her to audition for a minor role as a dancer at the studio where he works. However the world of film is changing, moving away from silent films into talking-pictures, and while Peppy rises to fame quickly George is set in his ways and refuses to believe that silent film is dead.<br/><br/>I have never seen a feature film in the silent movie style, and I loved this. Black and white films always look classy and this one had a beautiful authentic 1920's feel that completely disguised the fact that it is a modern film. The musical score set the scenes perfectly, creating atmosphere to replace the words that would normally tell the story, which flowed wonderfully and was consistently entertaining. Dujardin and Bejo brought their characters to life through charming (and not overdone to compensate for the lack of dialogue) acting and sweep you up in their heart-warming tale of forbidden romance. There's also an incredibly well-trained dog that adds to the overall sweet nature of the film. The story is initially fairly simplistic but that really adds to the overall charm, and once the plot has been set up we see the complex nature of George's life and how he struggles to cope in a changing world, something that no doubt many people can relate to. Peppy on the other hand is embracing the new age and all of the opportunities coming her way, which again is very relatable, and the clash of these two character's personalities adds the complexity to the plot. <br/><br/>The Artist is classic and beautifully well-done, with highly relatable characters and an authentic silent movie styling that is captivating and rare nowadays. It's a heart-warming and romantic story guaranteed to make you smile (and a little nostalgic), I highly recommend it!"

","This movie depicts the dawning of the AGE of the Talkies. Big name silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) doesn't like it one bit. <br/><br/>In the beginning, George smiles a lot and so do you. And, when Peppy (Berenice Bejo) comes on the scene there are more smiles. It's a contagious thing like yawning. Then the studio wants to do talkies and the smile is gone from George, who wants to continue to do silent films. Now, the rest of the story is a real downer. What happened? The promos didn't show this. <br/><br/>Yes, the story is sad in too many respects as we don't like to see anyone lose work especially when someone is very good at his job. Poor George just won't get with the program and progress. While it may have been true that many silent film stars had a too high a vocal timbre and wouldn't have been allowed to speak in talkies except to act in non-verbal shots, this was not the case with George. George's problem was George. He was in a comfort zone and nothing would remove him from it. But, wait a minute: there is something you will hear at the end of the movie that was, perhaps, the real reason George wouldn't do talkies. He had a French accent. Could this be the real reason? We'll never know. <br/><br/>We were misled. The promos and all the other hype indicated this would be a fun movie. Not so. For most of the movie we are watching a man down on his luck and barely scraping by and, of course, we kept hoping things would change for him. But, the way this was going I abandoned that hope. This was too sad. The promos misled us again. <br/><br/>The movie won a lot of Oscars and I am not sure why. For my money, the promos should have been awarded the Oscars. They were fun, witty, and the music was toe-tapping good. Okay, to be fair, the music deservedly did win for original score. <br/><br/>The acting, in my opinion, was not Oscar worthy for anyone, but the performances all around were very good and that was not the problem. The problem was the plot. It was too sad, and not very entertaining. Hey, here we are sitting around in silence and this wasn't going the way we thought it would. Sound does come into play at certain parts, and you wished for more, but all we see is George moping around everywheresilently. What would have made this somewhat better (with or without sound) was film critics and Variety reporters chiming in, big studio bosses discussing the situation with and about George not wanting to do talkies and maybe Peppy (whose star was rising in the talkies) trying harder to get through to George. This would have given the film more depth. Didn't happen. <br/><br/>Now, nothing was given away as we all know that talkies were the coming thing. You knew that, right? We just wanted to see the promos again, not the movie. Okay, what we really wanted was a happy ending, but we were taken on a very long, non-scenic, agonizing - are we there yet? - route. This was, indeed, over-hyped and over- rated. We were misled. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, not even in the subtitles.

","If you haven't watched silent films before, or even early musicals, then you will probably like this movie. My review does contain spoilers, so reader beware.<br/><br/>Just finished watching ""The Artist"". Terribly simple movie. It wasn't bad at all, but there was hardly much plot. And certainly not original. Guy is a big film star. Guy gets washed up. Eventually makes a come back after.<br/><br/>The whole ""silent film star becomes irrelevant due to talking pictures"" was the plot line to Singing in the Rain, as well as a few other movies. But thats it. Thats the plot. And then he gets depressed, and an up and coming actress he helped out is now a big star, and eventually helps him make his comeback.<br/><br/>There were also areas in the film where it really, desperately needed a speech frame. I had trouble understanding what was going on, or it took until the end of the scene to figure it out, due to lack of speech frames.<br/><br/>But then there were pointless speech frames. Like a speech frame for a guy saying ""I'll go get my car."" The film makers felt that bit of info was important enough for a speech frame...but then during an argument, had absolutely no speech frames. So you're literally just watching two people argue in complete silence, and you don't know what about.<br/><br/>Another scene in the movie, a cop is talking to him, and it focuses on the cops mouth, and the main character walks away in discomfort, but you don't know why...I wound up thinking he was going deaf for over 5 minutes, until I realized it was an artsy fartsy way to say the main character was feeling the pressure of talking in a movie.<br/><br/>Soooo....this film was so simple, even a retard could understand the plot line, but the lack of speech frames made a handful of scenes frustrating. And the only musical/dance number is at the very end.<br/><br/>But the clips released on the internet and youtube feature this entire end scene of the film. Why would they do that? Why blow your one dance routine/musical performance AND ending of the film, as an internet commercial??? Most of the film, however, is just depressing, and seeing a man sink lower and lower. Which is fine..but because of the released clips and trailer, you are led to believe you were going to see a lot of dance numbers and flash.<br/><br/>Its called ""The Artist""...but there's little to no focus on what exactly he does thats so artistic. The character produces his own film, which flops...soo...he's a failure, not an artist. There wasn't anything about the film that carried you through what about the character is so artistic, other than he's a good mugger.<br/><br/>The car being driven by the female lead is about 6 years older than the year the story is taking place. That was noticeable, and kind of obnoxious, considering its a period piece, and matching the date of a car to the date of the story is the EASIEST thing to get historically correct.<br/><br/>The film quality was just a film digitally made into black and white, so scrap the concept of doing the film as a film of that era would have been done. Then, one of the songs playing over a scene has a vocal track(pennies from heaven)....why? Its a silent movie...you don't have songs with vocal tracks.<br/><br/>I should also add, that the ""pay off"" at the end was not that great. The dance number they do is the only one in the film, and not to boast...I could have done a better job. Like, if they performed that dance number in the early 30's on screen, the audience would have shouted ""Amateurs!"" and walked out.<br/><br/>I mean, it wasn't bad...but it wasn't great either. And as someone who has taught himself only a few tap steps and never taken a class, I shouldn't be able to look at a dance routine in a film/period piece and say ""I could do better."" Maybe I would have enjoyed this film a lot more, had my expectations not been so jerked off by Hollywood and the awards shows. Seriously..if folks in Hollywood are this awestruck by such a simplistic, basic idea, simply because ""it hasn't been done in awhile"", then that just shows how mediocre and talentless our celebrities have gotten, and how lazy Hollywood producers have gotten."
"TheSquiss","7","1","6","16 June 2012"," Not all the hype is true.
","Unless you've been living in hole, you'll be very aware of The Artist. The principal issues that have been widely reported are as follows: It is a black and white silent French film about the silent Hollywood era, a fading star and a rising starlet, there's a cute dog, it is winning just about every award going and is hysterical, absolutely amazing and the must-see movie of the year.<br/><br/>Not all of that is true, however. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is Hollywoodland's biggest heartthrob but the arrival of the talkies ends his career as the starlet he helped launch, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) rises to prominence. He sulks and wallows in his self-pity, the big bad studio boss (John Goodman) sacks him and it becomes entirely predictable there on. Oh, and the dog has two tricks that it repeats ad nauseam.<br/><br/>Yes, it is black and white. Yes, it is largely silent other than the music, a few moments of audio brilliance and the two French students who talked incessantly behind me. Yes, there were a few forced laughs when the Jack Russell did its thing but it felt as though the minority who did laugh felt as though they were supposed to. Yes, it is winning the majority of the awards, it swept the BAFTAs and is likely to do the same at the Oscars. <br/><br/>But, no, it is not brilliant. I don't think it will even rank inside the top ten at the end of the year, bearing in mind we're only in February and it is already ranked lower than Tabloid, Shame, The Woman in Black and The Descendants in my chart. In 1997 Titanic swept the Oscars, taking eleven in total. It wasn't long before reason overtook hype and the world realized LA Confidential and Mrs Brown had been robbed. I'll give it two years before the world realizes the same is true this year of The Descendants and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy.<br/><br/>There are some lovely touches, particularly when sound is introduced, and the stylized look of the film is perfectly crafted. There are some fine actors present, performing in a melodramatic style of the period, and the smiles and music make it thoroughly engaging but nice legs, a good dance and a wink at the camera do not a great film make.<br/><br/>The Artist is good, nice, sweet, light and entertaining but that counts for little when the hype promises excellence, greatness and ground-breaking perfection. <br/><br/>And if you want truly entertaining non-humans, The Muppets is a far better option.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

","I have just seen ""The Artist""what a brilliant film. In fact, one of the best films I have seen so far. The music complemented the film perfectly; it put a smile on my face from the very beginning, and stayed consistently well matched throughout. The acting was perfection. Using gestures, facial expression, music, symbolism (loved the use of the staircases, the shadows), and so on, to convey what was happening was even more potent than speaking the words. The direction was inspired, flowing beautifully from one scene to another. The cute little dog was the sparkler on topwhat a fitting and delightful complement to the film! I cannot fault it at all, and am planning to see it again. I think perhaps that those who pan this film are more used to a movie diet of adrenaline pumping action, simple romantic comedy, or End-Of-The-World-As-We-Know-It disaster films. So of course they will be let down. My taste is eclectic; I enjoy a wide variety of genres, and I am definitely no film snob. However, this is a film of both superb complexity and sublime simplicity. I can recommend it most heartily."

I saw this film in a theater with less than 30 people watching. It's not making a lot of money. People are not very interested because there's very little to relate to here. <br/><br/>The story is about a silent film star who refuses to make ""talkies"" and whose career hits the skids as a result. Um, duh? Get a job? Make an adjustment? Apparently the worst possible fate in the world is to not be able to work as a movie star. <br/><br/>It's a shame because the main characters are likable.

"Tweekums","10","1","7","28 August 2014"," A delightful tribute to the era of silent cinema
","In 1929 George Valentin one of the most celebrated actors of his day; his films plays to cinemas packed with adoring fans. One day, as he is talking to the press, an unknown dancer kisses him on the cheek and the photo makes the front cover; everybody wants to know who she is. In a few short years they will know; she is Peppy Miller and she is on her way from being a dancer trying to get into films to being the leading lady of the time. Meanwhile George, the man who got her her break is on the way out; the talkies are coming in and he doesn't want anything to do with them. He invests much of his own money in a film that proves to be a flop then the stock market crash wipes out the rest of his money; forced to sell everything he hits rock bottom as Peppy is riding high in public popularity; she hasn't forgotten him though and is determined to help him get back into the movies.<br/><br/>This tribute to the era of silent cinema is an utter delight. The idea of making a black and white (almost) silent film in this day and age seems unlikely; a gimmick at best it works though and apart from when a well-known actor appears on screen it is easy to forget this is actually a modern film! Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo put in fine performances as George and Peppy even if they are somewhat upstaged by Uggie who plays 'The Dog'; one of the screen's most delightful canine characters! Silent films aren't really silent of course; they are accompanied by music and this one is no different; the music made the film 'real'; capturing the emotions of the scenes as well as setting in the right time period. The story is fairly simple but that is part of the charm. Overall it is a feel-good movie but that doesn't mean there aren't sad moments; as things get worse and worse for George it is sad even though we can guess that somehow things will be better by the time the credits roll. Overall I thought this was an utter delight and recommend it to anybody looking for something very different from the usual fare which contains nothing which might cause offence."
"jake-law123","7","1","7","5 February 2012"," Not really bad, but against it for best picture.
","Usually, I hate these kinds of movies. The kind that people make, knowing the academy and the critics will go crazy over them. This movie was made because the director knows that the academy jerks off to these types of movies. The academy is so predictable. However, I took a look at this because it is nominated for best picture, and it actually, surprisingly was not as bad as I thought. Though not really my type, it was enjoyable enough.<br/><br/>Has a pretty decent story I guess. In the 1920s, silent movie actor George Valentin becomes a dying star when sound comes into cinema, upsetting him and his career. Meanwhile, young mistress Peppy Miller becomes the top star of the generation.<br/><br/>The movie operates like a 1920s film, by using title cards to display what people say throughout. Gets kind of annoying, but some are into that, (espcially the academy and critics) but whatever. Very good acting performances. Since most of the movie is silent, the actors have to act out really spontaneously so the audience can tell what they're feeling, which works really well. Sound is implied on important occasions, some good, some really weird.<br/><br/>So you might be thinking, ""what are my reasons for not liking this as much after all this good talk about it?""<br/><br/>I do not want this movie to win best picture,just gonna come out and say it. Not because I don't like it as much, or because it's not my type, but because it's so obvious that it's gonna win. The academy eats out these types of movies that represent old cinema. The director probably purposely made this film because he knew the academy. The academy doesn't care what the better movie is. All they need is a typical mello drama, like the King's Speech. Social Network was 10x better than the King's Speech...too bad Social Network isn't a mello drama. Why did Hurt Locker win and not the better movie, Avatar? Because The Hurt Locker was directed by a girl. So obvious. The academy could not be more predictable. The Artist has best picture written all over it, but for the wrong reasons. It's like there's no purpose for it to exist except to win best picture. The academy needs to be less predictable, for real. The minute I saw the Artist, I said, ""best picture winner"" and same for The King's Speech.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not that bad, though I still hope it doesn't win best picture. It plays out well, and it has great performances, but it's just not my type, and it's just so obviously fit to be best picture. :/ Performances: 9/10 Screenplay: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Overall: 7/10"

","i wasn't extremely pleased with this film. it's a very good tribute to silent cinema. the performances are very strong by the whole cast (the leads were a perfect match for each other), including the dog. it's an original and audacious idea to make a silent, black and white film, with the 1.33 format, in this day and age. that's something to admire, but i felt that the film tries too hard to be affable and charming, presenting a pretty schmaltzy and uncreative script; the protagonist predicament completely misses the point of gaining the viewer's sympathy, he rather comes off as a stubborn fool who's not willing to leave his comfort zone without any real reasoning (talking could've probably advanced the story a lot, but oh well).. the separation between George Valentin and his wife is also poorly justified; around that time, the film got a little too bleak without any effect. the jolly moments were pretty, well assisted by the music; but even those were a little excessive, i thought. that's probably not the film's fault, though, because maybe i wasn't really in a jolly mood... i seem to be focusing on the things i didn't like more but still, it managed to draw a smile on my face on quite a few occasions.<br/><br/>it's surprising how quickly the charm and cheerfulness wore off."

","'The Artist (2011)' doesn't necessarily fully capitalise on its stylistic conceit, considering that there are several moments that break the silent film styling and that the plot itself would've been better suited to a hybrid approach (perhaps even an exaggerated one) similar to that seen in some movies made in the tail-end of the silent era. The style of the piece is pretty impressive in general, despite the fact that it certainly isn't as visual as it could've been, and it proves that the silent film is still, to this day, a genuine art-from that should be explored more often, perhaps even from a perspective that doesn't try to ape cinema's earliest pictures (which this feels like it's doing but it often misses the mark) so much as use their restrictions to tell an interesting - and not necessarily 'industry-commenting' - tale. This aesthetic is the only real reason the flick has any 'Oscar-worthy' merit, though. The piece's ending sort of arises from nowhere, even though its seeds are planted earlier, and brushes several serious issues of a central character aside in a way which pretends everything is suddenly okay essentially just because it needs to be for the plot. This makes it feel rushed and slightly unsatisfying. There's some difficulty in understanding a specific character's motives and, therefore, a central struggle of the narrative, too, which mitigates the engagement of the experience and makes for some questionable moments that often tie into the breaking of the established style and world (sometimes, it seems like our hero is surprised that he himself can hear people speak, even though we obviously can't). One of the largest issues actually seems like it would be one if the most incidental. The movie uses an incredibly famous musical score from an incredibly famous film during what it perhaps its most important - or, at least, intense - sequence. This jarringly pulls you right out of the world and totally ruins the impact of said scene, especially considering that the music doesn't fit with its tone at all - even if you don't consider the fact it's supposed to be a romantic track. It also feels extremely lazy and the music is very poorly chosen as the flick it's from isn't even silent and, as I mentioned, is one of the most recognisable in all of cinema, one especially renowned for its soundtrack. Overall, the picture has a charm to it that can't be denied despite its problems. It does seem like most of the praise seems to be levelled at the fact that it looks and sounds (or doesn't sound, if you will) like a silent film, but that isn't really enough to make a film great in my opinion. By that logic, all silent films are great. In reality, silent film has, like anything else, hits and misses. When you compare it to its quiet peers, this flick is middling, to say the least. While it's usually fun and always well-made, it isn't perfect and lacks certain elements that would really make it shine. It doesn't help that it's essentially 'Singin' In The Rain (1952)' without the songs. 7/10"

","The Artist is an almost totally silent film made by Michel Hazanavicious starring Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, James Cromwell & Penelope Ann Miller. Set in 1927 Hollywood as the Talkies are set to replace silent films. It chronicles the troubles of a great silent film star who doesn't want to be in talkies.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is all a movie-goer could want. It has outrageous expressions on the faces of the silent actors in place of dialogue. Quirky & fun camera angles plus cute little comedy scenes & the regulation lovable dog that is as well trained as any other actor on the set. The beginnings of a failed marriage (done in a hilarious manner) & a budding new romance follow suit.<br/><br/>It's the development of these that mystified both me & my wife. You'd figure that there was a concrete reason that our star (the artist) doesn't want to be in talkies as well as a reason that no one offers him a chance later. It takes the whole movie to find out this cannot be true. The motivations & goals of this budding romance are disjointed & unfocused even at the end. Was it romance, was it friendly concern, or was it just a coincidence that stuck like glue. There is a scene early-on that leaves no doubt about what is in the woman's mind but it plays no part later on.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is the man's life on the skids surrounded by people concerned for his welfare. His alcoholism & self destructive behavior, which is agonizingly drawn out to the point of boredom & greatly overacted even for a silent, gives far too much time to see the ending coming, as well as wish you were somewhere else. The second half is as bad as the first half is good. The music, costuming, sets & cinematography are worth seeing though. It's easy to see tie-ins to Singing in the Rain & A Star is Born. Truth be told they probably should have used a better tie-in to A Star is Born but that would have led to a different & hopefully better ending. You never really get inside the guys head beyond mulish pride & you see that 5 mins into the show. It starts with a grin & ends with a grin, they even had a miniature Rin Tin Tin.

","We hardly watch silent films and also black and white films. I have ever watched some monochrome films, and they are so-called masterpieces like Casablanca and Roman Holiday, so I was excited when I watched the opening because it reminded such great films. <br/><br/>The story is simple as the direction. The film does not need any effects to tell the story to us like computer graphics, complicated story unfolds and even the words. The characters' expressive faces and their realistic acting are enough to make us be fascinated into the story. However, actually this film uses sounds efficiently. From the beginning to the end, music is played, and we hear sound effects sometimes. Finally the characters dance to the up-tempo music. They help us to understand the situations.<br/><br/>The silent film was new for me. I usually watch films that are color, and use computer graphics, and I thought that old films were monochrome because of technical problems.

","The Artist? Where do i begin! I remember when this film was first released that i ignored it with the idea it was a restored version of some old film from the early 90's. However i realized my ignorance when this film began to win multiple awards that prompted me to look further in to exactly what this film was all about. Upon discovering the plot i was put of by the movie with the thought of a movie with no sound? Yes it would be bold and clever for the time we are in but no, just not my sort of thing. To arty and to fancy!<br/><br/>Here we are months later on a boring day in the house i decide to finally give in to my ignorance and stubbornness and yes give the artist a go! Firstly i found the dog charming and heartwarming throughout, if anything deserves an award in this film it is certainly the dog! I felt that each tug on the trouser leg of the suicide scene was a tug on my heartstrings as he desperately tried to save his master. Furthermore the suicide scene had me in such a pity as i actually believed George had killed himself and was actually relieved in finding out otherwise. The music was riveting and catchy and is exactly what kept the movie flowing. I was fascinated by the way in which you had to work out for yourself what was happening in certain parts and the stage props and motions were really clever in aiding you. Personally i find the whole era and style of the early ninety's to be cool and sleek and was flattered by the setting and shots. <br/><br/>However i think this film is over credited slightly. There is no denying it has excelled in it's purpose but personally i found without dialogue the film seemed to drag and at certain points the viewer was lost from the path of the story line. At times the movie was slow and dragged, i found that i was watching the movie for the sake of watching it, believing the hype would soon be lived up to. <br/><br/>Yet again i state that this movie is certainly unique and bold for what it has achieved, certainly through the way it portrays a mans fall from the very top to the very bottom, losing everything and almost everyone along the way.

Then it started to dawn on me why they may have gone this route, and it all becomes clear by the end. Sot the silent movie style not only pays tribute to the genre in question, but also provides a clever device/metaphor for describing George's trauma in the face of sudden marginalisation by the ""talkies"".<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin was excellent in the title role. He exuded star quality and charm throughout, while bearing a stunning resemblance to Gene Kelly. Bérénice Bejo was decent enough as his co star but somehow, and this is probably harsh, had a naive/showy aspect that didn't sit right with her character. I didn't care for John Goodman too much - he certainly looks the part but he seemed to lack the subtle range of mannerisms required to pull this off. Penelope Ann Miller and James Cromwell were good as the wife and driver respectively. I was sad Beth Grant didn't get a bigger part but only so many parts to go round here.<br/><br/>You have to admire the research, design, wardrobe, logistics that must've been required to make this. Hard to appreciate when it's all laid out in front of you for milliseconds at a time but I'd bet a hell of a lot of work went into this.<br/><br/>There's nothing too clever or original in terms of story - I suspect it was kept deliberately simple to provide a smooth, no-brainer build up to the denouement.<br/><br/>I avoided seeing this film for a long time because the silent movie angle really put me off - it looked like hard work. However it turned out to be a refreshing, clever story that was more charming and uplifting than hard work.<br/><br/>p.s. IMDb would not let me capitalise the title, displaying the warning ""Please DO NOT SHOUT in your summary"" - how petty and unnecessary?!"

","The Artist – 2011 – Michael Hazanavicius<br/><br/>In 1927, The Jazz Singer became the first film with synchronized dialogue. A few years later, ""talkies"" became popular and silent films died. Not too many actors made a successful transition from silents to talkies, and often those were comedic actors like Laurel and Hardy or Charlie Chaplin. Silent film acting was a different style. With no audible dialogue and no way to convey tone of voice and subtlety, actors had to rely on facial expressions, hand gestures, and overacting. Some actors didn't simply struggle to make the transition, but rather refused to do so. Such is the case of actor George Valentin in The Artist. The film opens, not coincidentally, in 1927. George (Jean Dujardin) is a nice guy, but proud and somewhat egotistical and cocky. He helps out an attractive young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). Peppy's star gradually climbs while George's fame suddenly crashes at the advent of the talkies. Meanwhile, George's unhappy and bored housewife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him and he goes broke. He becomes suicidal, and Peppy tries to save him. There is almost no audible dialogue in this movie and very little sound save the accompanying orchestra music. It is shot perfectly like the silent films of old. There is one wonderful scene in which the music stops and George is attacked by the ordinary sounds of setting a glass on a table, his dog barking, laughter, the wind. He is overwhelmed by this. It's the best scene in the picture. The cast is wonderful and includes character actor James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential, The Green Mile, and dozens of others you've surely seen) and John Goodman (the most underrated actor in Hollywood). Not sure why Malcolm McDowell was put in a 30 second role. There isn't really anything wrong with this movie except for there really is no time and place to enjoy it. It may have been best enjoyed in the theater. If you have a very short attention span, you might have trouble watching it. There are a few humorous moments, but nothing that will make you laugh out loudly. It's a highly original movie and I think that's why it won so many awards. It is so different from anything else that Hollywood is pumping out nowadays. But despite practically no flaws in this movie, it's hard to give it a super high rating and that's mainly due to the pure entertainment factor. It would make a great companion film with Sunset Boulevard (1950), Mel Brook's Silent Movie (1976), or any actual silent movie. I give it 7 out of 10."

Doesn't this duplicate the CLEO awards? Maybe THE ARTIST could sneak into onz top five for the year, but to place it at the very pinnacle of success seems a poke in the eye of the average American movie goer. When they expanded the nominations list for best picture from the five it had been set at since the 1940s to a maximum of 10, they said this would guarantee that at least a few of the movies average Americans actually saw and found entertaining would get nominated, such as Bat Man, Superman, Iron Man, X-Men, James Bond, Star Trek, Star Wars, Die Hard, Harry Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games-type movies. Instead, we get even WORSE nominees than when the limit was five--and the tenth rung movies are MORE LIKELY TO WIN now that they are on the ballot. This just proves that the Hollywood people try to elect the movie they feel will make the American public either 1)the angriest, or 2)the most puzzled. Watch THE ARTIST and decide for yourself which of these goals the millionaires were going for with their votes in 2011."

","It's straightforward, predictable, and not entirely deserving of its Academy commendation, but 'The Artist' is ultimately a delightful piece of escapism. It's a well-made and audacious homage to the first stars of Hollywood. It's a joy to watch, I became aware that I had a smile on my face throughout the first twenty minutes, which was thanks to a combination of the jovial soundtrack, 'Uggie' the talented Jack Russell, and also I think Dujardin's rather infectious smile. <br/><br/>However, it is slightly darker than you may have imagined. The film concerns George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent-movie star whose well-being is jeopardised upon the advent of the 'talkies'. So, as you can imagine, the film is as much a drama as it is a romantic comedy, if not more. <br/><br/>It's remarkable what the cast have achieved with this film. I'm sure many people would have their reservations about this silent film, but I'm certain they'd be engrossed from the start, completely indifferent that it's missing a fundamental dimension. Of course, silent films aren't completely silent, they're scored, and 'The Artist' has a delightfully expressive soundtrack. Its energetic, upbeat tracks are my favourite; they have your torso gently swaying and your head bobbing jovially. <br/><br/>It's ultimately a very nice, corny little film with good performances from everyone, particularly from Dujardin. Though he is great in it, I feel his Oscar wasn't fairly earned; his job was very different to the other contenders that year. However, if there was an Oscar for 'Best Smile', he would've won without a doubt."

Furthermore, the story is significantly advanced by brilliant performances from Dujardin and Bejo. But when one takes away the film's novelty, i.e., the black and white silent format and full screen captions, the only thing remaining is a dry and simplistic love story. The production should be applauded for endeavoring into a risky product. However, the risk alone does not justify a positive review."

The novelty of making a silent film about the silent film industry of the late 1920s is novel, but the story itself is ordinary. It borrows heavily from ideas in the superb ""Singing In The Rain"", which also was about the transition from silent films to ""talkies"" and how those who resisted got left behind.<br/><br/>The movie is very well made, and the characters and dancing numbers evoked stars of old, like Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Debbie Reynolds, and others. Jean Dujardin is the silent film star, George Valentin (Shades of Rudolph Valentino?). When ""talkies"" start to become popular he figures fans come to see him so he continues to make silent films. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Bérénice Bejo as Peppy Miller (shades of Ann Miller?), given her big break by Valentin, goes on to make ""talkies"" and soon becomes a star.

","Many other reviewers have provided a synopsis of the film, so I won't re-do that.<br/><br/>Silent movies are very different from talkies: to paraphrase Norma Desmond, ""we didn't need sound because we had faces."" As you watch the great silent stars such as Clara Bow or Lillian Gish or Louise Brooks you will notice how much of the time the frame is filled by their faces. These great actors could communicate their thoughts by their incredibly expressive faces. Pantomime was a major part of silent film acting, and a repertoire of effects was developed. In the movie ""The Artist"", this style was disdained as ""mugging"" by the newer talkie stars, but it was a legitimate cinematic language distinct from that used in sound cinema.<br/><br/>The Artist reproduces the look of the old films as well, perhaps by using vintage lenses or special film stocks. I believe it was originally filmed in color and then reduced to black and white. However it was done, the high-key low contrast look seems very convincing. Other reviewers have objected to this, but along with the static camera work it seems to me to be a very successful rendition of the vintage look and feel.<br/><br/>Although the plot was also a homage to the old plot devices, it was executed with great energy and conviction. There were many clever uses of unexpected sounds. I can't imagine how anyone could find ""The Artist"" boring."
"jdkraus","9","0","2","23 July 2012"," A pleasure to watch
","""The Artist"" is most likely the first silent film for many Americans. I have seen the works of Charlie Chaplin as well as Mel Brooks's ""Silent Movie,"" and they are very entertaining films. What helps ""The Artist"" excel so well is its nostalgic look of old movies. The sets, costumes, cinematography, music, opening titles, special effects, and even visual humor takes me back to Chaplin's ""City Lights."" The magic that director Michel Hazanvicius creates for this movie is not limited to its visual style. The plot is very original—a silent film star reaches the top of his game only to be replaced by talkies and new faces. Many silent actors faced this and fell into oblivion. In Hazanvicius's world, George Valentine is such a person. His downward spiral is filmed in such a unique way that it is both dark and mystical. In one particular scene, George sits in a bar, in a drunken stupor. He begins to hallucinate and sees a miniature version of himself on the bar table, jeering at him for his failures. Other grim scenes like these are mesmerizing to watch.<br/><br/>Though there are dark moments in this film, it is generally a light-hearted flick—I had a smile on my face for the majority of the movie. The performances by Jean Dujardin as George Valentine and Bernice Bejo as Peppy Miller range from over the top to subtle. Whenever they are on-screen together, it is easy to tell that they adore one another. As the audience, we too enjoy their presence. It is particularly interesting that there is a romance between the two, yet they never kiss or make love—Hazanvicius avoids this typical plot device that is seen in almost every romance flick, and it is a nice break. Dujardin and Bejo aren't the only ones who steal the show. The great supporting cast is made up of John Goodman, James Cromwell, and Uggio, as Valentine's dog. Uggio, in particular, has his comic moments.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest advantage for ""The Artist"" is the music. It is such a great soundtrack that it emphasizes the mood on the screen to perfection. When George Valentine is at the top of his game, the music is uplifting with a kind of ""doinky-doinky"" sound. As Valentine deteriorates, it grows bombastic and ominous.<br/><br/>Though a very well-crafted film, ""The Artist"" has problems. Some subplots involving the characters are not resolved or further explained. There is also the tendency that there are lengthy discussions between characters without any title cards. This became very annoying, for I began to focus on trying to read the lips of the actors rather than view the movie. It would have been more appropriate for the editors to either cut these scenes down or add more cards. To say that ""The Artist"" is a better film than any of Chaplin's works is sacrilegious. But to say that this film is overrated and uneventful is far from true. Winning five Academy Awards and earning over $45 million in limited release alone is a well-earned achievement."

","A silent movie star (Jean Dujardin) meets a young dancer, but the arrival of talking pictures sends their careers in opposite directions.<br/><br/>By itself, this picture is pretty great. It is a tale of love, of pride and the tragedy of a man's stubbornness to keep up with the times. Whether you are an actor or in any other profession, shunning the latest advancements will leave you in the dust.<br/><br/>The lead character, George Valentin, is an interesting man. We cannot fully feel sorry for him -- his troubles are largely his own fault. Yet, he is so lovable that we have to side with him to some degree, even if we know his efforts are in vain. He is not cruel or spiteful, just proud. Too proud.<br/><br/>And yet, beyond the great story is a beautiful film. They took the idea of a silent film and brought it in a new direction. I love silent films, but have to admit many of them can be tedious for today's audience. This movie knows its audience and never allows the silence to be a hindrance -- thus being ironic, promoting the story of silent movies' demise in a successful silent movie! It is the better half of ""Singing in the Rain"" in this regard.<br/><br/>And the film is not only a love letter to the silent film era but to silent film directors in particular. Using only the styles they had in their day (this film has no zoom shots, for example) we see Murnau's direction accentuated -- particularly his classic ""Sunrise"". Will this movie cause kids to go out and rent films from the 1920s? Probably not, but it should -- Murnau's genius stands tall even today, as this modern homage proves.<br/><br/>2011 was an interesting year for film. Many great films had a connection to France and Paris, with three in particular -- this film features a French cast, both ""Hugo"" and ""Midnight in Paris"" take place in Paris. All three films also bring us back to the early days, with ""Midnight in Paris"" showcasing great writers and artists and ""Hugo"" actually involving Georges Meliere -- the inventor of cinema -- as a character! But ""The Artist"" really nails it. It transcends the history of film, the ""now"" of time and the barrier of language. It truly is the best film of 2011."

Yes it does know that is working in a medium of film that had long since been dead, but the comedy and story of The Artist almost makes you forget that you are watching a silent film. And the great musical score also helps with that of course. The film is about how films got rid of the silence and began to talk as seen through the eyes of one of the great actors of that time, the fictional actor of George Valentin, who resembles a great actor of that time like Douglas Fairbanks, Valentin makes similar films. The film starts in 1927 as Valentin is at the top of his game it seems and as he helps out a young up and coming actress named Peppy Miller break in. Peppy slowly builds from an extra to a maid into a being good supporting actress. And as she is slowly climbing the Hollywood ladder, this new thing called talkies is being introduced that may jeopardize his career. He vows not to make the transition. As he declines, young Peppy accepts the opportunity. Peppy, with the invent of the talkies, becomes the talk of the town as Valentin slowly loses his audience and as the Great Depression hits, he loses everything forcing him to sell his belongings and fire one of his only other humans companions, his driver played by James Cromwell. James Cromwell, the farmer from the film Babe, John Goodman, and Malcolm McDowell really were the only people in the film that i recognized. Most of the people in the film, the writer/director and the two main actors are all french, interesting to note that the french are making a film about the early Hollywood scene. Overall I think that this was a great film and if you have never seen a silent film before or are a great lover of the medium, i think you will enjoy it just for its comedy and story alone."

","There's always a risk with a movie like ""The Artist"" that it will become all about the gimmick and nothing more. But Michel Hazanavicius's modern-day re-creation of a black-and-white silent film is so adroitly executed and artistically wrought that it transcends the gimmick and becomes an impressive work in its own right.<br/><br/>Set in the late '20s and early '30s, the period when movie-making was transitioning from silents to talkies, the movie focuses on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a dapper matinée-idol who 's more devoted to his dog - the scene-stealing Uggie - than to his acting partner/wife (Penelope Ann Miller). The problem is that Valentin seems more suited to the silent screen than the sound one - we learn why at the end - so we watch as his career and his personal life take a turn for the worse throughout the course of the story. If that sounds a bit like the premise of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" you're right, but the movie also has a touch of ""A Star is Born"" about it, for as Valentin's career goes into an ever-increasing death-spiral, the beautiful young ingenue (Berenice Bejo) he helped to discover has taken to the talkies like gang-busters and is becoming a major star of the silver screen. (One can also find a couple of homages to ""Citizen Kane,"" but they're a little less obvious).<br/><br/>""The Artist"" is obviously of most interest to those with a love of cinema and movie history, as it re-creates in breathtakingly beautiful terms the look and sound of silent movies (the tinkling-piano score is by Ludovic Bource). The movie is pure joy to look at, thanks to the eye-popping cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman, which captures the otherworldly elegance of a world framed in black-and-white images. The story may strike some as facile and simplistic to say the least, but that's clearly in keeping with the temper of the times and the era of motion picture history in which it is set. I could have done with a little more of the behind-the-camera glimpses into old-time movie-making and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels. One of those is the acting, with Dujardin and Bejo managing to create effective characters with only a minimum of mugging, and John Goodman and James Cromwell doing the same in supporting roles. And little Uggie, who also appeared in ""Mr. Fix-it"" and ""Water for Elephants,"" puts Toto and Rin Tin Tin to shame in the canine-acting division.<br/><br/>With movies like ""Moneyball,"" ""The Descendents"" and ""The Tree of Life"" hanging around, I wouldn't have voted for ""The Artist"" as the Best Picture of 2011, but I wouldn't have missed the one-of-a-kind visual experience it affords for anything in the world."

","Silent cinema has been out of style since about 1930 (except for ""City Lights"", ""Modern Times"" and ""Silent Movie"") and only one silent movie - ""Wings"" - had ever won Best Picture. Therefore, it was naturally a surprise to me that a silent movie won in the 21st century. I finally decided to see ""The Artist"", although I didn't expect much. The movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Partly about the love affair between two stars in 1920s-1930s Hollywood, the movie is moreover about lost dreams. As ""Singin' in the Rain"" showed, large numbers of silent stars simply could not make the transition to sound. It's a truly mystifying film.<br/><br/>A year ago, I had never heard of Michel Hazanavicius, Jean Dujardin or Bérénice Bejo. Now, all three have shown themselves to be quite competent. But most importantly, the Oscar wins by ""The Artist"" and ""Hugo"" (also worth seeing) have hopefully buried the whole ""freedom fries"" routine from nine years ago (and the icing on the cake is that ""A Separation"" from Iran won Best Foreign Language Film).<br/><br/>Anyway, definitely one that I recommend."

","I am not a silent movie fan but this movie was great! The Artist was done really well and because of that I didn't mind the fact that it was silent.<br/><br/>The lead actor really did look like an old Hollywood star with his hair and mustache. He reminded me a lot of Gene Kelly, not only how he looked but in his mannerisms as well. In fact all of the cast was great and looked the part.<br/><br/>I liked the selective use of sound in the movie. This isn't really anything groundbreaking but it did work well.<br/><br/>The dog was a nice touch. Not only did it help to lighten the mood in certain parts but also gave the actor something to play off of.<br/><br/>I was drawn in to the story and it was emotionally very powerful. I don't give a lot of movies 10 out of 10 but this one deserves it.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect however. There were a few scenes that didn't quite work such as the last scene with the wife before she left him the letter.<br/><br/>Anyway very few & minor flaws but very satisfying in the end."

","Though it was a silent, the drama was brilliant. The ""Bang!"" made me jump out of my skin. The two French leads deserve all the awards given to them. Tired of ""end of the world"" movies? See this one. An absolute must see. This hands down the best ""feel good"" movie I have ever seen. My only regret is the rating. I thought it was unjustified. Any cognitive child, adult or dog should be allowed to see this film. If you told me they were going to make one of the greatest silent films ever made in 2011, I would have called you crazy. It was not only great romance and comedy(Uggy deserves an Oscar.); it is a great history of the cinema film. In that department, I rank it with Citizen Kane, one of the greatest films of all time and one of the greatest about cinema ever made."

","I was very angry when The Artist went home with Best Picture, even though I hadn't even seen it. To me, it felt like another one of those films that just sweeps up everything. But now I have seen it, and even though it wouldn't have been my top choice, I can honestly say that I understand why it won, and that it would have been my second choice.<br/><br/>The Artist is a silent film, which sounds off-putting to some. The film revolves around a silent film star named George(Jean Dujardin, who went home with the award). As silent films are starting to die out, an up-and-coming actress named Peppy(Bernice Bejo) is becoming more and more famous as George dives into madness.<br/><br/>The Artist, which is magnificently directed by Michel Hanzavachius, might also not appeal because it's two leads are French, but they are marvelous. There hasn't been a silent film in God knows how long, and for these actors, which also include John Goodman, Missy Pyle, Penelope Ann Miller, and James Cromwell, to be acting the way they do is magical. The Artist is movie magic.<br/><br/>It's unique, funny, original, very entertaining, and very charming, and almost too well acted. Do I think it deserved Best Picture? No, I would choose The Descendants before this. Best Actor? Also, The Descendants, even though Dujardin is magnificent. Directing? Yes, I will give it that, because it takes a gifted man to bring out the characters the way he does. The Artist is a wonderful film, and will someday become a classic.<br/><br/>A+"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","14 June 2012"," Nostalgic remembrance
","It's funny how within the same year we had Hugo, a Hollywood film that glorified the early French cinema, and The Artist, a French film that glorified the early Hollywood cinema. Yet both are very different as independent movies. Perhaps these two films shouldn't be compared like this, but I can't help it. To me Hugo feels more familiar. It tried to portray how movies were made during that time, but it still feels much more recent, the films aesthetics play to the norms of the modern day. All the colours, all the visuals. The setting is historical, but it's still a film that has clearly been done during the 21th century.<br/><br/>Not so much with The Artist, which genuinely feels and looks like a silent film of the early 20th century. And I love it because of it. The 1.33:1 screen ratio, the complete lack of dialogue or even environmental sounds (with one very haunting and effective exception), the use of music to tell a story, the constant mugging that still manages to look somewhat genuine, the black-and-white visuals - they all feel real and only the quality of the picture separates this from a genuine silent film. Well, that, and some singular scenes where the movie actually has some sound effects to create certain effects. Which is a point to the movie's favour, mind you, because even though this movie tries to imitate a silent film as much as possible, it still recognizes the fact that it's a modern film and can use certain effects that were not available during the time of its role models. Furthermore, the subject of the film is the coming of the so called talkies, so the occasional use of sound is easily called for.<br/><br/>So it really is a rather good film. Its very idea is easily the best part of it, but the individual aspects of the film easily keep up. The actors are very talented at what they do with Jean Dujardin's performance being every bit Oscar-worthy, though I personally think that Bérénice Bejo does equally good job as his counterpart. There's just this genuine joy to her and her dancing. And of course the music is fantastic. It has to be or the film just wouldn't work, because the score is the only thing that we will hear most of the time.<br/><br/>The movie has no obvious flaws, though the story is both intriguing and a bit predictable at the same time. But that's me nitpicking. It's a good movie and easily worth your time. And most importantly: it made me interested in silent films. And to this film that is the highest compliment that anyone can assign."

","If you want to create something different, irrespective of good or bad you need to experiment. In world of cinema Experiment has been a perennial process thus cinema lovers witness beyond monotonousness of typicality. Hopefully Indian audience will be accepting more such attempts so that young intelligent directors and can experiment and surprise us like their foreign counterparts. Coming to the main topic, ""The Artist"" is one such exceptionally captivating experiment where by director Michel Hazanavicius recreated the silent era of Hollywood almost successfully. Story-wise it's a simple and linear tale of fall & rise with an overtly positive ending. It tells the story of George Valentin (brilliantly played by Jean Dujardin) ,a fictional reigning star of silent era of Hollywood. The film begins at the genesis of talking era with artist involving the silent era on verge of creative destruction. In such a scenario the pride of George led him to further downfall thus leaving him with his loyal pet (played by now famous dog Uggy) and a chauffeur. While in his peak days he found a talent in form of Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) who later became a superstar of early talkie cinema. Though Miller tries to help George for a grand comeback it is the ego and self destructing reflection of inner self that protest unnecessarily thus heading to a chaotic dissolution. Michel Hazanavicius story and screenplay is fairly linear and had it's share of cliché parts. The ending is forcefully optimistic which doesn't gel with the mood of the protagonist. Being French himself it is expected that he would avoid the complexities of Hollywood silent films and simply concentrate more on the lead than the surroundings. But Michel Hazanavicius' direction is better than his screenplay with an eye for technical details of the by-gone era from aspect ratio of the picture to the costume of each actor. Schiffman's cinematography is captivating with an elevating musical score by Ludovic Bource. Teaming up with Anne-Sophie Bon, the director did a splendid job in the editing department keeping the film crisp and concise. Mark Bridges' costume and set design set the mood for the period film. When talking about ""The artist"" one cannot give a full stop until they talk about Durajin and Uggy. In an era of talkies Durjardin gave a superlative performance with his expressions telling thousand words. He has the capability to play with eyes as well as the whole face same time and thus generating basket full of expressions. And there is Uggie- the wonder dog whose expressions were as brilliant as the human actors. The sequence were George plays with the pistol to shoot himself and the way ""Uggie"" reacts to it biting the trousers of George and helplessly staring to hold him from pulling the trigger, deserves special mention. Bejo as Miller has the charm and aura to be a superstar and she portrayed that with perfection. Her vulnerability in the later reels are well established. John Goodman (one of Coen Brothers favorites) is in full form expectantly as Al Zimmer, the producer of Kinograph Studios. Cromwell as chauffeur Clifton is efficient. During the initial credits I saw Malcom McDowell and was expecting a meaty role but was surprised to see him in a blink-and-you miss appearance. Overall The Artist is an extraordinary experiment with flaws. It could be a path breaking film if director had written the script with reduced clichés and less consciousness on making the juries of award(s) contended. But still it deserves the required applause for the technically effusive attempt. In fact the symbiotic relationship between George and his dog reminded me of another classic Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D."
"intern-88","9","0","2","6 June 2012"," The Artist: giving film fans the silent treatment
","In this week's Monday edition of the famed entertainment trade-magazine Variety, Kim Novak - the now 78-year-old star of Hitchcock's Vertigo - paid for a full-page ad bearing the title 'I want to report a rape'. The piece lambasted Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist for its use of film composer Bernard Herrmann's 'Love Theme', which was originally written for Hitchcock's 1958 detective classic. Novak insisted that this was 'morally wrong' and that it was using the 'emotions it engenders as if it were their own'.<br/><br/>Given that this piece of music has been used in countless films since Vertigo, this fierce tirade feels more than a little unwarranted. Nevertheless, The Artist does seem to be an inescapably derivative project.<br/><br/>Hazanavicius' film is a black-and-white silent film about a black-and-white silent-film star, complete with a jazzy soundtrack and intertitles to spell out the dialogue. Not only does this feel a little gimmicky, but Hazanavicius also appears to have more or less lifted the plot from A Star is Born: George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the height of his fame when he decides to take aspiring starlet, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), under his wing. Unfortunately, with the invention of the talkies, the two trade places, for as George finds himself outdated and out of a job, Peppy becomes a star of the new medium.<br/><br/>On the surface, The Artist seems like little more than a nostalgic exercise, its makers plundering the history of early Hollywood and using its imagery 'as if it were their own'. However, this really isn't the case. Deftly manipulating the conventions of the silent film, The Artist is, contrary to Novak's barbed comments, a piece of movie magic in its own right.<br/><br/>The film begins with the premiere of one of George's hammy adventure flicks. Standing behind the screen as the end credits roll and the film's theme fades away, he waits to hear the audience's response. As we are deprived of diegetic sound, all we see is an elated George clench his fist and smile in triumph, until the camera cuts to the adoring audience standing and clapping to confirm that all has gone well. Despite going into The Artist fully aware it was a silent film, this initial moment still seemed bizarre and it was incredibly funny.<br/><br/>With scenes like this, Hazanavicius plays with the audience to great effect, yet much of the humour also emanates from the way the characters themselves seem to know they are in a silent film. When George is first invited to see the early sound test for talking pictures, he dismisses them as a fad. Of course, he soon realises that his refusal to embrace this new form will destroy his career. In a hilarious dream sequence which follows, George ransacks his dressing room, terrorised by the sound the clattering items produce.<br/><br/>Although this kind of self-aware schtick recurs throughout the film, Hazanavicius still manages to carve a moving story about the fickleness of showbusiness within his cartoonish world. George's whiskey-slicked slide into obscurity is truly heartbreaking and Jardin's performance - which earned him Best Actor award at Cannes last year - straddles parody and pathos with incredible dexterity.<br/><br/>Due to its universal acclaim and considerable box-office success, The Artist has already been tipped as a serious Oscar contender this year. It has been invariably celebrated as a love letter to a bygone age of Hollywood. But more than merely indulging silent-film cliché, Hazanavicius has revitalised a lost art in commercial filmmaking: he has produced an irresistible and entertaining family feature that demands to be experienced in the cinema."

The acting between Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo is extremely well done. <br/><br/>The mannerisms all the actors make in this film make it funny, sad, serious, you are relying on their facial expressions throughout the entire film. The music gives a great feeling to the film and has been made to suit the time it is set in (1925-30's). Uggie the dog does steal the show however, his presence provides a lot of comic effect in the film but he also makes scenes a lot more heart-warming. <br/><br/>The scarce use of real sounds is used very cleverly, in dream sequences and towards the end showing the transition in cinema from silent films to 'talkies'.<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserved the hype it received.

","Before I had even thought about going to see The Artist, I had already heard every possible form of opinion. There were the people who hated it for being black and white and silent, and those who loved it and considered it to be a great tribute to the silent era. Then, of course, the people who loved it called the people that hated it simple and unappreciative of cinema history, and those that hated it saying the people that loved it were snobs only pretending to like it.<br/><br/>I myself was still in awe that the film was actually being made: Who would be mad enough to pitch the idea of a silent, black and white tribute film to an era of cinema many people are wholly unaware even existed - and more importantly, who would be mad enough to invest in the idea? But somehow, The Artist fell into existence, and even more phenomenally, become an international success.<br/><br/>Therefore, when I finally saw the film, I was not, as many others were, settling down with unrealistic expectations almost dripping out my ears. Rather, simply wondering how on earth it had even come to, not only to my own but most of the world's, attention. <br/><br/>The plot line of the film is, to say the least, underdeveloped. The whole one hundred minutes of it tells of George's downwards spiral and Peppy's rise to fame. That's it. However, the way the film was executed (with some spectacular use of sound and some spectacular use of no sound) and the imagination that director Michel Hazanavicius brings to the shots – particularly one scene holding only George, his reflection and a growing look of disgust through his whiskey spills – makes you wonder whether it truly was the same man who wrote the story.<br/><br/>The actors, as you would expect from the Oscar nomination and wins, were absolutely superb. Bérénice Bejo was entirely captivating in her role of Peppy and I felt myself positively glowing whenever she would come onto the screen, while Jean Dujardin's portrayal of George so quickly tugged at the audience's heartstrings that when his life begins to spiral out of control the audience holds a breath that they don't release until the very end of the film. <br/><br/>All in all, The Artist is the perfect film for some self-congratulatory enjoyment. It's still a simple enough concept for the modern audience to relate to and understand but still gives the blockbuster cinema-goer that small, little kick of being able to say ""I saw a french, black and white, silent film and enjoyed it.""

","Its nearly impossible to write a review that describes the pure genius of this film. The Artist comes with it all: great acting, great cinematography, great art direction, great design, great music, and a great plot. From the first scene the audience is captivated, and while watching it, you forget its a movie, because your character connection is so strong. Jean Dujardin is at his best here, portraying a great amount of motion, comedy, and talent all in one confusing individual. This movie definitely makes you feel good throughout its reviewing. It makes you laugh, cry, and clap throughout its many touching scenes. This is a film that will become a classic, and I absolutely recommend it for people that love movies not just for their popularity. It says so much without saying a word, and is a very unique way of conveying the history of film. Bravo"
"mikes-movie-review-onlin","8","0","2","15 April 2012"," ""A visionary film unlike anything modern audiences have seen before""
","Michel Hazanavicius' visionary film The Artist is unlike anything modern audiences have ever seen before. It is exceptional on many levels, but unfortunately will not attract the mass attention it deserves. Hazanavicius presents the film in black and white, displacing it from reality and creating its own absorbing characters and world. The film also has next to no dialogue, being for the most part, a silent film with nothing but a musical accompaniment. This works brilliantly, and a unique story with strong performances lift this film to make it one of the most entertaining motion pictures in years. <br/><br/>Jean Dujardin stars as George Valentin, a silent film star living large in 1927 Hollywood. He lives in a large house with a painting of himself in the foyer, reporters can't get enough of him, and many women eagerly chase him around. However, everything changes for George when the studio head (John Goodman) informs him about sound being recorded to accompany 'talkies'. George soon falls from grace as audiences don't want to see silent films anymore. He ends up moving into a small apartment and pawing off his tuxedos and possessions to get over the debt of funding his own failed attempt at writing, directing, and starring in a movie.<br/><br/>When George was a big star, he was photographed kissing a stranger after a premiere on the red carpet. He helps her get a job in one of his movies, and gives her advice that aids her career. Her name is Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), originally an unknown dancer, with George's push she becomes a huge star. While she becomes one of the fresh new faces for talking pictures in Hollywood, George's situation is simultaneously getting worse and worse. These two characters have a complicated relationship, as it seems they both have loved each other from the beginning, but it becomes hard to love each other when George overhears Peppy in an interview saying ""out with the old, in with the new"". Despite any problems, Peppy tries to help George right up until the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Jean Dujardin has the appropriate emotionality for a silent film star; we feel his sentiment and dilemma without the effort of overacting. Dujardin plays George Valentin very well, sometimes subtly and sometimes broadly- but never too far over the top. The audience develops a connection to his lovable character and his plight as the world changes around him. Bérénice Bejo plays the supporting character with spirit and skill, and the presence of actors like James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and Ed Lauter serve their parts well. Part of the beauty of silent films is that it can be both made by and enjoyed by a wide range of people, regardless of their mother tongue. <br/><br/>Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius brilliantly incorporates aspects of the silent era. When the characters speak, we see their mouths move and dialogue is shown on screen afterwards. The Artist is a film that not only requires the silent film era to have come, and films like Singing in the Rain were obvious inspirations, but the silent era also had to come to an end for The Artist to be made. It deals with the themes of changing times, being forgotten, and attempted return to mainstream success. These concepts are highly relevant today, and help the audience associate with the characters. Hazanavicius also knows that he's made a silent film in a time when they are practically extinct, and he brilliantly plays with the audiences. There is one memorable scene after George first watches a talkie in which he begins to notice the sounds of the world around him as he knocks over things in his dressing room. We hear the sounds like George, almost for the first time. Never before has the sound of make-up quietly toppling on a table drawn me in to such a degree.<br/><br/>The Artist is a tremendous film that stands out against all other modern works. With a marvelous story and compelling characters, The Artist tells a wonderful tale without the overuse of dialogue or sound effects. While many modern viewers will dismiss it for being silent and black and white, The Artist should not be missed. This film may go over the heads of some audience members, but those who fall into its trance will connect with the characters and be dazzled by the absorbing and timeless qualities The Artist has to offer."

","As I watched the Oscars unfolding through the small hours back in February on Sky, I was both flabbergasted and then rather irritated at the regularity of ""the Academy Award goes to....The Artist"", mainly because I knew of the real talent that was being consequently going away empty-handed.<br/><br/>Afterwards, finally seeing The Artist with friends in a multiplex, we were all a bit underwhelmed by the whole thing. The Oscar's hype had elevated it way and above that was mortally possible and whilst good, it couldn't weave its golden magic on us.<br/><br/>Out of my friends, I'm the only one who watches Silent movies in any shape or form. Therefore, that novelty was not going to overwhelm me. We all agreed on three positive things, though. 1 - The undeniable charm, charisma and dash of lead actor Jean Dujardin. 2 - The story toward the end and 3- The Dog. The dog, each and every time, every scene he's in were amazing and some really had to have been painstakingly choreographed.<br/><br/>As I said, the story picked up about a third way in and after George Valentin's (Dujardin) fall from fame and his nightmare flashed his situation to us, I could see where this movie was going and it finally 'clicked'. That the story was going to be similar to the essence of 'Singin' in the Rain', charting the dilemma that film-makers and actors of the silent era faced, which, of course, hailed the end for many huge stars, such as Charlie Chaplin.<br/><br/>The thrust is - and a clever one - is that here, with The Artist, we have a French production, with an actor with a heavy and perhaps difficult to follow accent, who by being ""silent"", could make a surprise Hollywood hit. In every sense, it looks and feels old Hollywood, because you can't hear it. And that's what happened to many silent stars, who couldn't sing or speak eloquently. With the advent of the microphone, they were immediately assigned to the scrapheap. Once we ascertain that Valentin needs to find a new way of making a living and understand how the chorus girl he helped out is now a star, the film, for me, opened up and moved on nicely.<br/><br/>Yes, the production values are impeccable and its relative novelty raise it above the ordinary. As for the Academy and their generosity, well, the previous year they lauded the British 'The King's Speech', which was different and well made enough for them to take it to their hearts. And, of course and maybe above all, Hollywood loves Hollywood!"

","It's kind of ironic that in 21st. century in which the movie industry has saturated the cinema with technologies such as 3D and complex visual effects, a silent, black and white movie happens to be the one that won the Oscar for best picture in 2011. Many think that complies with the criteria and the age of most members of the Academy and although The Artist indeed appeals to nostalgia is an Oscar-worthy work.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of classics like A star is born and Singin' in the rain, The Artist goes back to 1927, when George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the most important stars of silent films and nothing seems to stop his splendor. On the other hand Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) is an aspiring young actress who, thanks to a series of coincidences starts a film career with the support of George. However, the situation of both will give a 360 ° turn with the advent of talkies, as the rejection of George to make talkies seems to condemn him into oblivion, while Peppy becomes a star. As if this were not enough, the financial crisis of 1929 hits George's interests severely, although Peppy will try to help him in one way or another.<br/><br/>Although there have been approaches to storytelling without using dialogs in recent years (eg WALL*E or The Triplets of Belleville), no one had taken the risk of shooting a film in the same way they were made in the early years of cinema. The credit belongs to french director Michel Hazanavicius who takes such a risk by telling a story that has been told more than once in a risky format with the possibility of feeling outdated for the new generations, but the result is extremely fresh and charming. Although much of the charm (and the success of the film) has a name: Jean Dujardin: an actor with an overwhelming charisma who surpasses the challenge of conveying all the emotions being experienced by George without saying a single word (not in vain his performance earned him an Oscar). Along him Berenice Bejo also delivers a remarkable performance and devoid of artifice in which both could easily have fallen, plus their on-screen chemistry is remarkable and possibly the impact of the film with other actors would have been different.<br/><br/>A noteworthy aspect is the recreation of the decade of the 20's and early 30's, including the Oscar-winning music written by Ludovic Bource, which contributes to creating the atmosphere that the film aims to create by sticking to the way music was added to silent films.<br/><br/>However, the only ""but"" to this movie is Uggie, George's faithful pet and if it is a crucial part in history, feels like a forced element to cause empathy in the audience and looks too trained and that takes away spontaneity.<br/><br/>In short, the artist turns out to be a return to an extinct type of film that is both innovative and endearing and works as a perfect way to bring silent movies to new generations."

","We've seen things like this before, haven't we? Films that are not about films, but instead a love letter to other films. <br/><br/>I'm not nearly as fascinated about such incursions as i am for anything really new that comes out. As far as i know, the most fascinating referenced cinema is the one that captures the lessons of great previous films, and extends its notions a little bit. Or break them. You have people, like the Coens or de Palma, who made a career twisting the ideas of people before them. If we talk about silent films, than Guy Maddin is someone who really picked up what we stopped caring about with The Jazz singer, and twisted every notion to create something new. That's the kind of reference that i'm looking at with passion.<br/><br/>This one enters the Cinema Paradiso drawer: expansive genuine passion for a certain type or moment of cinema history, poured into a vessel of nostalgia. You will understand these films if you understand that nostalgia, not necessarily the films that it addresses. Unashamed sweetness tops these attitude. You decide to play in that world or not. I've entered it several times. But i don't stay there more than a few moments without feeling that i'm bypassing something really important, in other films being made.<br/><br/>That said, this one is a pretty good homage, in that flat sense. Some elements work amazingly well here, and one is even interesting from a cinematic point of view:<br/><br/>the one thing that works incredibly well is the main male actor: Whoever chose him understood his potential, he understood what it took for a silent actor to live on screen, and the director definitely understood his face, every angle of it. He smiles in a way that i've seen very few times. That smile carries the film, when he doesn't smile, we easily enter the depressive mood of the character represented by the absence of its actor's smile. Actors representing actors is something always interesting. To do it pretty much with a smile alone, makes him worthy of the Oscar. By the way, he is always an actor on the film. When he is acting for the silent films in the film, he has a similarly camera aware attitude as when he is in the real world of the film.<br/><br/>The narrative unfolds around and is finished with films, of course. That's why our on screen lovers get together making a film, and his love for her is reaffirmed by the scenes of another film they made together. It's the necessary self-reference, required for films like this to work.<br/><br/>And there is one remarkable scene. The ""sound"" dream. Our silent character dreams the world gains sound, objects, everything starts to produce sounds, except his own voice. This is remarkable because nothing is explained, everything is in the eye. The mere editing of simple sounds in an other than that silent scene makes us understand the drama of this character on verge of extinction. That was a cinematic moment.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5"

","Loved this movie. In a world where flashy special effects, shallow characters, non-existent plots and unbridled sex and violence rule the silver screen, it's so refreshing to see a movie that goes back to basics - literally! At first I thought the whole concept of a modern-day movie filmed like a silent movie would be pretentious and self-righteous, but it proved to be highly original. The characters have a lot of heart and you really do care about them; especially George's dog, who - in my humble opinion - really steals the show. The silent part doesn't detract from the storytelling at all as I thought it might, but with actors as good as these, you can tell exactly what they're conveying to each other just by the facial expressions, the look of their eyes and the score - which is magnificent by the way, and absolutely spot on."

","No big box office American stars (respected actors, yes, but no one who can open a movie), no explosions, no blood, no heads getting cut off, no high dives, NOT EVEN ANY DIALOGUE and perhaps the best movie of the year. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with the lead girl and was on board with the lead guys journey. What a rare and interesting movie. My nephews and niece watched it with me and complained because no one talked, so they were texting and doing their Facebook stuff the whole time and kept asking me when it was going to be over and they were bored. They wanted to watch two reality TV shows, so we taped them and watched those after. Now that was horrible! I felt old after watching the movie with teenagers, and I'm not that old (I'm 29), but seeing how much they couldn't relate scared me. Now I finally understand what older people mean when they say young people have no attention span. I was embarrassed for my nephews and nieces, 16 and 17 (twins). I thought it was a real cool movie. I want to start watching old movies now. It made me feel like maybe I've been missing something all this time. I just thought of something funny, who said they don't make movies like they used to, they just did. Were movies all this cool back in the day? I think my generation, and the ones after are getting ""jibbed"" (my grandpa use to say that), the movies suck nowadays compared to The Artist. I realize how much detail matters now."

","Went in to watch this movie with a skeptical mind, but came out really impressed!! <br/><br/>The movie is set in the early 1900s - pre talkies era and brings out the dilemma and internal conflict of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) when the world moves on to talkies and fresh faces are introduced in cinemas. First off i have to say that the creators have done an incredible job creating the 1900s atmosphere. It is very complete in every detail - from the fat-ass cars to the way the actors act and this was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I have to take a moment to comment on Jean Dujardin's acting. Seldom have I seen an actor portray so many emotions with such ease and comfort as he has and he truly is ""The Artist"" and carries the movie with him throughout. Bérénice Bejo has done well as Peppy Miller; but Jean Dujardin's performance just overshadows everyone and everything else in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a demonstration of George Valentin's talent and fame and how much the crowd loves him. But then the world is ready with the technology for the talkies but George Valentin isn't. The directors take a bold stand and make a movie without George instead starring Peppy Miller(Bérénice Bejo) while George makes a movie of his own. This is when his world topples upside down and he loses everything. The stock market crashes, his movie flops, Peppy Miller's movie is a hit and his wife leaves him. He has now to face his dilemma: whether to overcome his pride and embrace the talkies like the rest of the world or to embrace his pride and neglect the world. (To know what happens next you have to watch the movie of course :) )<br/><br/>Jean's genius has been woven in every minute of his dilemma and his expressions alone are worth watching the movie for.<br/><br/>A special mention the background music that is beautiful, simple and yet effective and adequately makes up for the absence of dialogues.<br/><br/>Summary: Story: 8/10 Acting: 10/10 Direction: 8/10 Camera work: 9/10 Background score: 9/10 Entertainment: 8/10<br/><br/>A final word: This movie is not for everyone.

","Some reviewers have called this movie pretentious. I, however, never got the impression that it tried to convey any deep meaning, or make the protagonist some tragic hero. It was ""artsy"" in its use of black and white photography, old movie clichés, dialog panels, etc. to convey the era. But I got the idea that this was meant to show that the protagonist was only able to work in that medium and was unable to do things the new way (as indicated by the dream sequence where suddenly the world makes noise but he still cannot vocalize.) The protagonist is somewhat sympathetic, but is it any fault other than his own he cannot make the transition to sound movies? Does his wife get the blame for his failed marriage? He ends up relying on others (including his dog) to save him from his problems.<br/><br/>The story could have been told as a conventional movie with color and sound. But the idea was to deliberately produce it as it was, more as a novelty than a great story, and the movie's novelty value was undoubtedly the reason it has garnered acclaim. It was certainly better than Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie""."

","It's always telling when the cinema audience bursts into applause at the end of a film, as they did when I saw The Artist. It was a joy to watch, a lot of fun, and the time passed really quickly. Laugh out loud funny and with pathos, with strong likable characters, it was surprisingly more complex than I expected given the silence. I really liked the clever touches of the old style of the credits and the filming dimensions of the screen. The wardrobe/costumes were great too. I'm glad the actor who played George Valentin got an Oscar - he deserved it, I think.<br/><br/>The story is of a movie star of silent films who feels he has nothing to contribute as talkies become popular as new technology is developed, and younger stars are becoming famous in Hollywood. The film is interesting as a look at Hollywood in the 1920s when the Studios ruled in the ""Golden Years"". Whilst the two leading players were awesome, with a strong supporting cast (John Goodman was great), the star of the piece was most certainly the incredible little dog! <br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone. Not only is it a great film, it's also interesting as a different cinematic experience, for novelty. I don't think it's trying to be comparable to the silent films of yesteryear, this is clearly just something different, but it is reminiscent of the innocence and simplicity of plots back then without gratuitous violence language or sexuality where a man just fell in love with a woman and danced around a bit - like in old Debbie Reynolds films or Fred and Ginger where the only ""naughty bits"" were the Butler seeing a lady in her negligee! This is just a really nice, fun, entertaining film. No subtext other than a hearty hello and well done to ol' Hollywoodland."

","A Masterpiece of Silent Monologue.<br/><br/>The Artist is an excellent film, especially a silent film in 2011 which is directed by French director Michel Hazanavicius, and this film brings us back to the early 1920's silent era of motion picture making in Hollywood, which tells the story of a former silent film star who got trapped in silent films when a new fashion of talkies arise and take over the silent films. It is one of the notable improvement occurred in the film making with the synchronized dialogue and songs. The Artist resembles painting, music and literature in a celluloid format and holds the attention of an audience for 1 hour 40 minutes without flagging. <br/><br/>The story is set in the early 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) was a famous silent movie star and he was a dedicated actor who apparently meets a young woman named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) an ambitious actress from the town who dreams of becomes a famous actress. When the talking picture is being introduced into the film industry, most of the director and producers were ready to invest in making talkies. Al Zimmer (John Goodman) the noted producer who offers George Valentin for a lead role in his upcoming talkie film, but George denied. However on the contrary Peppy Miller getting a chance for some small roles as a background artist in the films, later she becomes a remarkable star in talkies. Simultaneously George Valentin was broke and become weaker day by day and his fame starts fading away. The remaining story discloses how George Valentin wins back his fame and the conflicts between George Valentin and Peppy Miller. Further the movie reveals other conflicts such as, Pride vs. Fame, Film Stars vs. Studio, Silent vs. Talkies, Fame vs. Money, Fame vs. Society, Love vs. Loss, Personal life vs. Career life, etc. <br/><br/>A Journey of Pride ""With Pleasure"" <br/><br/>The Artist is a journey of one's own pride and dignity. The pivotal role George Valentin played by Jean Dujardin who was portrayed as a 1920's movie star with a thin mustache, with his partner and actor Jack Russell terrier dog named Uggie. Jean Dujardin great performance is given a solid support to the script. He won Best Actor in 2011 Cannes Film Festival and 2012 Academy Awards, etc. However at the same time Bérénice Bejo appears as an innocent, fun-loving young woman who is an aspiring actress & dancer with interest and her performance is unforgettable. Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) who was portrayed as an unhappy wife of George Valentin. From the beginning this script leaving the viewer wondering, why George Valentin doesn't want to commit on talkies rather than silent films and finally at the end its putting forward the reason for his denial. The core subject of the film was dealing with ones's individual pride and plays around the star image and the fame which is something illusion, and it appears as well as it can fade. The Screenplay and film narrative is delightfully fun with tragedy and also aesthetically done. Particularly the comic depiction of characterization made the film quite more interesting. This film reminds us the 1952 film 'Singin' in the Rain' and also the characters such as Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). <br/><br/>Director Michel Hazanavicius expertly conveys the life of an actor who lived in the silent film era and this film proved extremely popular and received 10 nominations for the 84th Academy Award and won 5 out of 10 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Actor and Best Costume. The Artist was filmed in colour and converted into the black/white and also presented in 4:3 aspect ratio which is commonly used format in the silent era in order to recreate the look and feel of 1920's silent film. The absence of the dialogue concentrates the viewer's attention more closely on the visuals and gestures thus the whole film crew who had done a great job, especially in the lighting and camera works, the very ordinary shots are often so impressive. The crew team who has rendered the peculiar possibilities of lighting and cinematographic techniques and to apply them towards the creation of artistic production in order to achieve an artistic result. <br/><br/>Result: The Artist is a romantic comedy melodrama with pride, fame, mute, success, romance, love, loss, desire, emotional conflicts, tragedy, fun, entertainment, brilliant performance and it's worth watching on the screen. <br/><br/>The Artist : An artist's stroke on celluloid. <br/><br/>Related Movies: Singin' in the Rain 1952, A Star is Born 1937 & 1954, Thin Man 1934, etc. <br/><br/>Sunday, March 4, 2012"

Poppy isn't nearly so true to the art form (I was disappointed to see that no woman bit the back of her hand, the standard indication of horror, surprise, or shock in the silents!) but is still winning as George's true love. <br/><br/>The picture is primarily delightfully comic, with even a terrier-like dog reminiscent of Asta from the ""Thin Man"" movies, but has elements of pathos borrowed from ""A Star is Born."" The story bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through, but quickly got back on track with driving energy reaching a wonderful finale.<br/><br/>My last point is merely a comment on what a treat it was to go to the movies and not be jolted in my seat by the sound of explosions or experience sensory overload with special effects.

The artist is really an exemplary experiment. A charming dashing silent hero whose smile warms the cockles of ones heart is slowly rendered obsolete by the talking movies. Who knew so much can be conveyed with not ...one word being said.The charm of silent movies where a live orchestra was played while the film rolled and theaters had these charming glamorous round balconies with people dressed to the nines is brought out really well. Will the pride of the dwindling star send him to oblivion or will he reinvent himself and change with the times with the helping hand of a guardian angel Peppy Miller the new star of talking movies. Watch to find out. I thought that ""The Artist"" was an original thought but it seems to by super-heavily inspired from the movie ""Singin' in the Rain"" a 1952 musical.It has the cheerfull-ness of the 1920's in Gene Kelly's smile and easy nature and in the high pitch of the actress's voice. SITR also talks about the transformation of movies from silent to talkies but in comparison unlike Jean Dujardin in Artist which is self destructive and gloomy, the transition for the actor Gene Kelly is much at ease probably due to his constant companion Cosmos who provides comedy and support to Gene's character and the actress Kathy his love interest. In ""the artist"" tap dancing is shown to come to their rescue at the end of the movie. In ""singin in the rain "" it is a part of the narrative in the middle of the movie which helps them transition from silent to talkies.It's an enjoyable watch."

","IMDb Top 250: 116<br/><br/>I shouldn't have liked The Artist. Back in September I was thinking of concepts for films, and one of the ideas I came up with was for a black and white silent film, a homage to that era. This was before I had heard of this film; months later it came out, and has been hailed as brilliant and showered with awards. So I was a bit grumpy. Anyway, grumbles aside, I saw it today.<br/><br/>The Artist is charming. Showing the other perspective of the Singin' in the Rain story, the silent side, The Artist is clever. It follows George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) fade as talkies become prevalent, with Peppy Miller's (Berenice Bejo) rise for the same reasons. The synopsis is the same as 'Singin', but the plot is different. The Artist is fun.<br/><br/>I've seen a few silent films, and quite recently too. However my position on them is different from many reviewers: I don't have a feeling of nostalgia from my parents liking them, and certainly wasn't around to see them soon after they first came out. Most my age haven't seen a silent film voluntarily, or at all.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Artist nails the feeling of the times, and feels completely natural. This is its biggest draw: a major motion picture in the new millennium, black and white with only music to accompany (mostly). There's lots of touches big and small that add to the atmosphere: the film is presented with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, meaning it isn't widescreen. The opening credits are right out of the era, with several cards saying the major people behind the film. Also, the music is fantastic, and has a much larger responsibility than films created today. The sets and costumes are remarkable: everything is authentic, or at least looks like it. Fittingly for a film called The Artist, the art direction is brilliant.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin carries the show. The film isn't just about the Silent Era- it's about George Valentin's fantasy Silent era, with one exceptional break. He is perfect for the role like Jon Hamm is to Don Draper- you can't see anyone else doing it. This unique role that will define him would seem to have doomed his career- in America anyway. But the future can't damper this present. He's fantastic. Peppy is bright and cheery, like her name, and is also excellent. One of my first thoughts was, ""there's no way she's a supporting cast member"". She has a lot of screen time and presence. Maybe the Oscar nod was to keep her away from Streep's chokehold? The acting is fine all around, but there are only two starts in this show. Everyone convincingly acts silent, just a tad over the top. The dog is great.<br/><br/>One note to those who have seen silent films and not liked them: The Artist avoids the pitfall of excess speech. Many silent films have talking but few intertitles, so much plot is missed or poorly conveyed. The Artist doesn't have this problem- the script- and therefore the plot- is clear and concise, and the words chosen have great weight, like my favourite: ""Why won't you talk?""<br/><br/>While generally lighthearted, there are a few dips into serious drama, and they lead to out of place comic relief that removes the weight of the scene, which some may like, not having to feel negative emotions, but I did not. Another small quip is that the grip on my attention was (very) slightly lost in the middle, for a short time.<br/><br/>It's no secret that the movie is a period film about filmmaking, but it also deals with pride, change, and the relation between those too which is quite relatable. But don't watch the Artist for a thematic lesson, enjoy it for the fun, history and film heritage.<br/><br/>The team behind this picked a great time to make it: it's been a long enough time that most would find a silent film interesting, but not too long that they are completely outdated. One should prepare by seeing an old film, like a Chaplin or a Keaton comedy and see just how far (or not) film has come. The Artist is a great film that doesn't rely on its gimmick (because its not a gimmick) to succeed. I believe that Best Picture should go to an achievement in film that can be widely enjoyed, but also has a certain amount of originality and creativity that people in 50 years will remember that the picture was special. Therefore The Artist is a very deserving winner. The Academy picked a great film this year. 8.5/10"

","In 1927, big film star George Valentin has an accidental encounter with Peppy Miller, as a result of which he starts her on a film career. She rises from extra through bit parts to featured parts, supporting parts and, finally, star. The camera and the public love her. On the arrival of sound, Peppy embraces it but George rejects it on artistic grounds. George's self-financed silent film fails and he loses everything in the stock market crash, while Peppy's star continues to rise.<br/><br/>What idiot thought that a black and white, 4:3 ratio, dialogue-free film, about (and filmed in the style of) 1920s movies, starring two unknowns, would have a chance of success? Whoever it was, it turns out they backed a winner. But does The Artist merit the Oscars it has won? I think, yes, it does. This film is a masterclass on how to tell a story using images not words. Yes, there are some caption cards, but they are few and mainly used to clarify: the story is told through performance. And while the story itself is not wildly original, the telling of it is clever and witty, using a style of storytelling which manages to be both old fashioned and fresh at the same time.<br/><br/>And the performances, especially Jean Dujardin's Best Actor Oscar winning performance, are simply terrific. Through the first section of the film Dujardin conveys an insouciant charm which makes his physical presence amazingly reminiscent of Gene Kelly (is it a coincidence that this story, about the birth of sound in cinema, bears comparison to Singin' In The Rain?). His descent into despair is equally well conveyed and, like his chauffeur, you just want to shout at him that he should swallow his pride.<br/><br/>The direction is first rate, playing with cinematic conventions when it suits the film to do so. And the music, which takes the place of a conventional soundtrack, is just right, always complementing the visuals.<br/><br/>The reason why this film has enjoyed its success is that it is a first rate piece of cinema."

","Jean Dujardin, man, take a bow, for you were out of this world!! (He now joins the list of my all time favorite actors)<br/><br/>The moment you know that it's a black and white silent movie, you have this notion in your head, a notion you cannot describe. But having enjoyed the all time Indian silent classic Pushpak years ago, I kinda was motivated to watch this film (even before it won the Oscars). I am glad I did.<br/><br/>The Artist is a movie which you can connect with. It's very predictable at times, but brilliant, moving yet humorous performances by Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and every other cast member, not to forget the dog, Uggy, make you fall in love with them. Every character is so well written that you can emotionally connect with them. The cinematography, though in black and white is absolutely mind-blowing, and the direction perfect. The background musical score adds so much life to the film. The screenplay was good, though, pardon my ignorance if that's how it's supposed to be in b&w classics, was kinda slow at times.<br/><br/>Overall, a fabulous film, one of the best I've seen so far.

"greatelcid","8","0","2","4 March 2012"," It's wonderful and reminds me of something great!!
","It's a wonderful movie, of course, but I wonder if it has an original screenplay. Initially, watching this movie, I said to myself: ""hey, it's somehow like the Singing in the Rain"", but now, after I watched it. I think it's more of a Chaplin's Limelight thing. The storyline is the same, but somehow with less creativity and more fun. By ""less creativity"", I don't mean ""any creativity"" at all. There are wonderful original and innovative scenes in the movie (i.e. the scene were the artist tries to make her wife smile); but there are more wonderful creative scenes in the Limelight. Nevertheless, it's bold and also Oscar worthy to make a silent-black-and-white movie in the 21st century as great and wonderful as The Artist. But the Oscar may be better dedicated to great Chaplin himself, if I may say so."

","Well silent films they said, it was a thing of the past.. but this film truly proved otherwise... the film which is actually a romantic comedy drama was packed with powerful performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo who played the characters George valentin and Peppy Miller. Well one cannot forget the adorable dog Uggie as well...<br/><br/>The film revolves around George Valentin and Peppy miller. Peppy accidentally bumps into him while he was posing for pictures after release of his film outside the theatre.. George reacts kindly and poses with her for the camera... She is then the talk of the town everyone wanting to know the mystery girl...Peppy full of fun as she is, manages to get a role for a dance scene in George's movie.. but when the director comes to know that this was the same girl whose pics were all over the papers with George, reacts rather angrily and asks her to leave immediately.. However George once again comes to the rescue and keeps her back for the shoot.. <br/><br/>Peppy slowly gains fame in the industry and is loved by everyone for her her bubbly and sweet personality.. <br/><br/>Things take an ugly turn suddenly when The studio announces the end of silent films which does not go very well with George.. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film.. the film is completed with george financing the entire movie himself and the release date is fixed.. Coincidentally Peppy's sound film also is set for release the same day...things go even worse for George when the stock market crashes and George is headed for Bankruptcy..Now only the film can save him from his financial crisis. But the audience is not interested in silent films anymore and with the new flame Peppy all rush to watch the premier of her film.<br/><br/>But Peppy who had always a liking for George and grateful for him attends his premier and is saddened on seeing the very low turnout for the premier..<br/><br/>Dejected George heads home from the theatre only to find a note from his wife.. she had left him and informed him to clear his belongings from the house...<br/><br/>George moves into an apartment with his valet.. Out of money, George has all his personal belongings auctioned off.. . He bumps into Peppy at a restaurant one day who was being interviewed. She mentions that people are looking for a change now and that silent films was a thing of the past.. On hearing this George who was seated next to her does not take it well and leaves after congratulating her.<br/><br/>George then forces his valet clifton to leave and find another job as george had not paid him for a year. <br/><br/>Dejected and drunk he burns all his collections of films but holds onto one of the films...the fire spreads and he is trapped inside.. his dog uggie runs out and manages to get help from a policeman nearby. <br/><br/>Peppy on hearing the news of the accident rushes to the hospital to see him .. she notices the film which george had held on to tight during the accident.. it was the take's of the scenes he had with her in the movie..She then takes him to her house and looks after him...George wakes up and is happy to see Peppy and also finds his valet who now works with Peppy.. She then proceeds to the studio for her shoot.. over there she manages to convince her director to cast George in her movie.. Meanwhile George enters one of her rooms in the house and finds all his personal belongings that were auctioned off.. he is upset and leaves her house to his apartment... Peppy panics when she finds out about this when she reaches home and she rushes to his apartment.. George attempts to commit suicide by shooting himself but stops when he see's Peppy. They then embrace and Peppy mentions that they could try one thing together.. <br/><br/>Both manage to put up a musical dance act together to persuade the director to put a film for them together.. The film ends with the sound finally coming in...<br/><br/>Credit to Jean Dujardin for his excellent silent performance.. Berenice also put up a splendid performance and was quite bubbly and peppy in her way...<br/><br/>Overall the movie was not a classic but definitely a worth watch movie for this year... A definite score of 8 from me!!!!"

","I'm a SAG Actor and follow the Academy Awards yearly, and comment here about ""The Artist"" (2011) winning the Best Picture award recently (Feb. 2012).<br/><br/>This is not an American movie, as neither Hamlet (1948) nor SlumDog Millionaire (c. 2008) were, either. That is worthy of comment, and perhaps protest.<br/><br/>I doubt that either of the two main actors, or the director speak fluent English, or English without a thick foreign accent. Yet the main actors portrayed Americans in a movie where their voices are (almost) never heard....it's a ""silent movie"" with a music and sound effects sound track, but almost no dialog.<br/><br/>Several older USA actors (John Goodman and James Cromwell) are included as supporting actors, neither in major or key parts.<br/><br/>This movie is a clever movie, very well done with set decoration, costuming, and camera work, but not at all ideal regarding it's story and screenplay. It's important to like the main actors (even the villains) from the start of the movie, and, at least for me, this didn't happen. The main male character....he got a Best Actor Award from the Academy....didn't ""fetch me,"" and I always think that is mandatory if one is to rate the movie top drawer.<br/><br/>THE ARTIST (2012) is this year's big deal movie......not my choice, but I don't control things. Based on A STAR IS BORN movies and story, done 3 times....1937 starring Janet Gaynor and Frederick March (I screened it last night......sappy...Fred commits suicide at the end of the movie....Janet carries on bravely by not leaving Hollywood, stays on as a movie star!), 1954 starring Judy Garland and James Mason (Judy got a Best Actress Academy Award for that movie, which I've never seen), and finally Barbra Streisand in the 1970's with Kris Kristofferson, I think. Never saw that, either.<br/><br/>Same story in all three movies.....old time older actor getting dissed and not hired any more marries an unknown young, up and coming girl who becomes a bigger star than he was and isn't any more....she stays loyal to her older husband to the end!<br/><br/>THE ARTIST (2012) has a happy ending, different from at least the 1937 movie....don't know how the other two 1954 and 1970's STAR IS BORN movies ended...maybe happy, too.<br/><br/>Well........<br/><br/>The Academy Awards voters gave us SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE as ""Best Picture"" recently and it shows how capricious the whole thing is. <br/><br/>I own a great retrospective book analyzing the history of the awards, and the politics part of it all.....book is titled THE REAL Oscar (1981 or so)....which is good to page through....the history of the whole thing up to 1981 (it started in 1929).<br/><br/>It's all about glitz and jazzy outfits and celebrities quipping, etc. etc. Show biz putting on a night of show biz.<br/><br/>I also own a pretty good documentary about it all titled OSCAR'S GREATEST MOMENTS (1991) which shows the history of the show from 1970 through 1990. <br/><br/>It's a big institution over the years.....83 years by now! Liz Taylor, now passed away at age 79, wasn't even born when the first Oscars were awarded.<br/><br/>I find that usually the choices are OK....I haven't paid attention to movies in recent times produced recently, except movies I act in (FYI, I've acted in more than 40 SAG Signatory feature movie and national TV drama projects since 2004.....almost never Oscar contenders except for George Clooney winning an actor award in 2005 for SYRIANA, and the WEDDING CRASHERS which was a big money earner in 2005 and I think won a technical award that year).<br/><br/>----------------------<br/><br/>Tex Allen is a SAG actor based in Columbia PA USA.

"cherold","8","0","3","29 February 2012"," Joyful valentine to the Silent Era
","When I heard there was a new, silent movie called ""The Artist,"" I figured it would be one of these super-arty concept movies of the sort Guy Maddin makes, but it turned out to be pretty much the opposite, a fun, clever, sprightly valentine to the silent days.<br/><br/>The filmmakers are clearly in love with those old movies, and this is a joyfully movie-obsessed movie, with a story about movie makers and a lot of clever ideas that toy with or extend the tricks of the silent film. The movie is full of wonderfully ingenious scenes; a starlet making love to a coat, an audience reacting to an unseen film scene, a sound-driven dream sequence.<br/><br/>This is also a movie that simple wants to be a fun old-fashioned movie, hokey plot at all. The movie is French, and it's hard to imagine an American filmmaker creating something as un-ironic as this.<br/><br/>The stars are wonderful. The male lead has a Douglas Fairbanks meets William Powell quality. The female lead completely captures the quality of stars like ""It girl"" Clara Bow, although she's too skinny for the period. <br/><br/>The score is fantastic. The movie starts well and gets better and better as it progresses. Well worth seeing."
"MarcusJ13","9","0","5","29 February 2012"," Different and brilliant
","The Artist came as a film that I had pretty neutral expectations going into, despite it's positive reception I still wondered simply from a personal point of view how it could sustain itself. I was pleased with how it played out. It plays out in quite a quick fashion and certainly isn't slowly paced, this was perhaps recognised by the film makers as a silent film perhaps may be bemoaned if its pacing wasn't up to scratch. When I say this I mean once I knew the plot I was surprised as to how quickly the pace got going. This was a genius move as it made for a film which didn't lag. In this we see George Valentin wonder if the arrival of talking films will cause his downfall. There is a great sense of his attitudes and as the film continues we really feel for him, while at the same time becoming immersed in Peppy Miller's story. We of course see much of hers in the form of montages which I didn't mind as despite the overall brisk running time she along with our other lead was developed, at the same time enjoying seeing her rise to fame. The two leads were a joy to watch, from Valentin's point of view we see his willing ignorance to the threat of 'talkies' without the aid of audible dialogue we see him kidding himself and the inevitable decline. On the other hand it could be said it made for a predictable outcome, once you know the plot you know how much is going to play out. However the film had a great amount of heart and was brilliantly acted without despite predictability wasn't too clichéd, hammy or melodramatic. I always think once the audience is routing for the characters the film makers are at least somewhat succeeding and it was more than the case here. Personally I thought they would fill it with a larger cast but was pleased when it was kept to a premium as well as the run time. It made the pacing stronger and kept my great interest in the story itself. To summarise it is a treat, something different and well worth watching for if nothing else great performances."

","Of course I am french and am also proud of what that film made worldwide. I won't add many things to what the other users have already done. I am amazed that for the 86th Academy Award Ceremony, 85 years after the first one, in 1927, the ending of the silent movie era and the very beginning of the talkies one, that is a silent movie and a black and white too that wins again. Who would have guessed, in 1927, that 85 years later...<br/><br/>No one. Now, the movie industry is dying, and when you see all these films in 3D that are made, I think it's because the film makers and producers are in front of a big problem, they don't know what to discover any more. The 3D and other technology only try to mask the emptiness of...<br/><br/>So THE ARTIST success explains many things. That's an UFO. <br/><br/>And if the American people love this film is because there is no subtitles problem or dubbing one, and also because this films talks about the movie industry genesis.

","I read an interesting take on The Artist here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/<br/><br/>When I first saw ""The Artist,"" I couldn't quite make out whether this film was a gimmicky effort made to appeal to a niche segment of cinephiles or a finely crafted homage to the silent era.<br/><br/>Directed by the relatively unknown Michel Hazanavicius, ""Artist"" (2011) has garnered glowing critical review including three Oscar nominations for Hazanavicius: best director, best original screenplay and best editing.<br/><br/>Despite that, ""Artist"" is still not in the same league as its cinematic ancestors: ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1928), ""The Battleship Potemkin"" (Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1925), ""Greed"" (Erich Von Stroheim, 1924), ""The General"" (Buster Keaton, 1926) and ""Metropolis"" (Fritz Lang, 1927) are just a handful of films from that era that should, at the very least, receive a special screening by the academy prior to handing out any statuette for ""Artist."""
"chemingineer","7","0","1","25 February 2012"," The Silence of Love
","On the surface 'The Artist' is a simple love story; a period love story set during the times of turbulent transition when cinema broke its silence and acquired a voice. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) the swashbuckling star of silent films is unable to make the transition to talking films and finds himself upstaged by his upstart costar, the effervescent Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). How Peppy's love for him, ably aided by a totally adorable canine, helps Valentin redeem himself is the essence of the film. The challenge before the director Michel Hazanavicius, who has also written the screenplay, is to get all the emotions - pride, anger, jealousy etc – typical of a love story, across to us in a silent film.<br/><br/>Yes, 'The Artist' is a silent film in black and white. It is this painstakingly constructed retro format that gives a classic texture to the film. Unusually for a silent film, the inter-titles are very sparse and the director relies heavily on the music to convey the emotions of a scene. And the musical score of composer Ludovic Bource, ranging from sombre symphonies to lilting melodies majestically rises to the occasion. Since music is the only sound of the film, it leaves a lasting impression on the mind Sound does make a stunning entry, twice in fact, during the film and catches us totally by surprise. The first is a cleverly disguised dream sequence about 30 minutes into the film. Valentin dreams that he has lost his voice, and how better to convey this than introducing sound to the inanimate objects! The second appearance of sound is in the very last minute of the film, when the director shouts CUT! And you are left with a disconcerting feeling of having watched a film within a film within a film.<br/><br/>'The Artist' is anything but a hackneyed love story and there are layers to be peeled away, if you like, to get under the skin of George Valentin. Why he does what he does is a mystery and more mysterious is the transformation wrought by the silent words of a cop, whose mouth is shown in an astonishing close-up. There are several uncomfortable questions to be asked and answered, without in anyway diminishing the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>But, 'The Artist' ends sweetly and gives you a feel good factor of love having triumphed over everything. It is also about the magic of moving images, the magic so lovingly captured in the numerous shots of anxious faces glued to the screen. Hazanavicius pays tributes to hoary legends of cinema by making references to their works. I caught the reference to Citizen Kane, and if you get this, it will be an icing on a most delicious cake of cinema."

I was invested in the story, I enjoyed the characters, it was funny at times, truly heart breaking at times, and had me interested throughout it's running time.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","23 February 2012"," The sound of silence
","By now, virtually the eve of Oscar, the movie audience market has generally taken in the impact of having this challenging production thrown at them. People are no longer asking why a silent movie, not only thrown into the market, but collecting award after award before you can blink twice, including major ones from prestigious festivals such as Cannes, Golden Globe and BAFTA. It's no longer a question of whether a silent movie can win an Oscar in 2012, but how many, out of its staggering 10 nominations.<br/><br/>The smart thing about ""The artist"" is that it is a silent movie about the ending of era of silent movies. With this clever premise, the film is almost guaranteed success, so long as the quarterback does not fumble, so to speak. And fumbling is what director Michel Hazanavicius cannot be any further away from. Just look at how brilliantly he handles the sequence that portrayed the inner world of the protagonist who stubbornly resists the threatening onslaught if ""talkies"". There are several layers. This is just a normal day in the studio and although WE the audience are supposed to be watching a movie with no sound (except for background music, which in the authentic case is provided by a live orchestra), HE the silent movie star hears normally. And yet, what we are shown is his experience an inner world of silent movies that does not have any sound, until the silence is broken by random sounds (a pencil dropping, for example) that WE the audience now also here! It becomes somewhat surreal to see the panic on his face as he finds that he can (and so we can) hear a group of approaching people chattering and laughing. Think about it. This brilliant montage of multi-layering is about as clever as a director can get.<br/><br/>But other than not having any audible dialogue (you can sometime lip-read and there are occasional, tastefully minimized, use of intertitles) this film mesmerizes you like any other good film does, with engaging story, skillful narrative and superb acting. The plot line is delightfully simple yet genuinely affecting. It tells the story of the downfall of a superstar when he refuses to ride with the tide of time to allow the audience hear him on screen (""all they need is to see my face""). A young woman who receives his generous encouragement and help ironically becomes his curse, as her immense success in the new era of talking movies hastened the demise of his silent era. And yet, the two have such a depth of feeling for each other that their destinies are entwined.<br/><br/>This movie is also familiar in terms of various artistic styles used, some paying tribute to iconic movies, such as the famous ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) breakfast scene, and some just naturally. One scene I find particularly interesting is the two protagonist casually exchanging dance steps, which reminds me of the duelling banjos (actually a banjo and a guitar) scene in ""Deliverance"" (1972). While the media of the art shared are different, they are about two kindred spirits who happen to stumble across a mutual language of art. In ""The artist"", this scene also underscores a very important plot element at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>In three days' time, I'll be watching, live, to see how well this film does in Oscar. A very interesting thing is that while the leads Jean Dujardine and Berenice Bejo are French (Bejo actually from Argentina but relocated at 3), the language of this silent movie (yes!) is English, as explained by IMDb ""English (intertitles) English (a few words)"". In addition to the nominated pair (lead and support), this film boast of two of the best known and best loved character actors today – John Goodman and James Cromwell."

A darned shame. For starters, more emotional range than Emily Proctor and Jim Belushi, and he probably required fewer biscuits during rehearsals, and fewer takes to get the scene.<br/><br/>3) Let's face the cold hard facts, folks.

","well i was reluctant of seeing this movie although i knew the trio stars from the oss movies.with trio i mean the two stars jean and berenice and the director michel.i heard it was good but a silent AND black and white?..let me tell you from the very first seconds that you start watching it grabs you and actually after a couple of minutes that the movie has pulled you in its magic,you re glad it is without sound because it adds to the magic.it is basically a romance story,but has other themes playing on the side.themes like success does not last long,people or dogs..that are faithful no matter what,and maybe the biggest theme of them all possibly it explains the title of the movie also,that silent movies or silence in general has more power than anything,and the minute that sound comes in,or it can traslate this to dialogue,to people speaking with excuses ,lies,then the magic disappears.this has a very deep meaning that i do not wish to analyze in full but i think you got the general idea.all the cast is simply extraordinary.you have never seen a similar movie of this kind.well..maybe the old masterpieces with charles chaplin like ""modern times"".i have to say though that the director whether has thought about tit the way i did or not,had a brilliant idea that audiences think he has succeeded the impossible,making a silent movie so successful nowadays,and propably he did but one has to wonder if people are not used to watch images with music in our everyday entertainment life already.look at mtv videos or movies in general that you hear music in the background playing all the time through out the movie.yes..people today are more accustomed in the silent movie technique than they realise.having said that i still think this movie should not be missed by anyone.it is simply to good.the visual side of the movie is beautiful,the music is great,varying from romantic to tragic to funny back and forth.it is a movie watched from the heart.and to add one silly mistake i noticed.here comes the spoiler..after george is rescued and brought to peppy's house to get better we see him in pajamas and everything.we assume he stayed at least a day resting.but when he leaves the next day,for instance,his clothes are dirty.with the servants that we see in peppy's house,one would assume that they would have taken the clothes ,that got so dirty during the fire,and washed them.i think it is kind of a mistake.but this adds to the tragic when he wears these dirty clothes and goes back to his burned apartment.great great movie.don't be cynical and miss it."

","Of course I resisted seeing this movie for an unreasonable, an unconscionable amount of time: popular, critical smashes, particularly those redolent of ""feel-goodiness"", have that effect on me. It took a rare rainy San Francisco night (and the fact that there appears to be f***-all else watchable playing in movie theaters at the moment) to get me in to see this. And of course it was just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure that I was watching the same film as the gentleman seated two rows behind me, who spent the entire movie laughing like a hyena. To me, the laughter was of a more subtle and restrained order, and manifested itself in minor, off-key touches, such as Valentin's ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" clock (in fact, all of his furniture was quite fairly risible), and Peppy's ""I want to be alone"" moment of Garbo-ism. I am fairly certain that I was grinning throughout at the sheer cleverness of the camera work and production, and the staging of Valentin's dreams and delirium tremens. And of course it goes without saying that Uggy the Dog deserves a Canine Oscar."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","8","0","1","7 February 2012"," A little bit shallow and simplistic, but still a very enjoyable experience
","The Artist looks ready to sweep the Oscars this year, and in many ways it deserves to. It has a unique (some may say gimmicky) style, can easily make an audience laugh and cry almost simultaneously, and has a certain likability and charm that is nearly impossible to deny. Despite perhaps seeming initially off-putting to some casual cinema-goers, The Artist is actually deceptively simple; it is a film that can be enjoyed by almost any individual, despite being silent, French-made, and in black and white. That is most likely its greatest strength- appealing to a wide audience of people who may feel as though they have just greatly expanded their boundaries of cinematic appreciation, when as a matter of fact, they have watched a relatively simple romance/character study/brief history lesson on the transition from silent films to talkies.<br/><br/>However, the film's simplicity is not a huge negative. It allows the film to be both likable and crowd-pleasing, and appeal to essentially anyone. That being said, I personally would've liked a little more complexity to the film- perhaps it could have fleshed out the main character some more, or provided more insight into just how dramatic the change from silent films to talkies was. Still, I respect the fact that this film is indeed a homage to a simpler time in cinema, so therefore its simplicity can be fairly easily excused. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see something that is in many ways unique, yet in many ways familiar...<br/><br/>VERDICT= 8/10 (Great)"

","Another movie that leaves me torn and divided. I will say right off that I very much liked this film. Loved the performers and the characters they played (Uggie the dogif there isn't an Academy Award for him, there certainly should be!) However, in having said that, I will say there was nothing original here. At all. There were echoes and pieces of various and sundry old movies, many of them silent. You could easily see Gene Kelley, who was handsome and could dance, but couldn't act his way out of a paper bagand yet you loved him. I did. The lead character, George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin was that character. There is no way you could not like him - immensely. Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the ingénue with a heart of gold who makes it big, was perfect and John Goodman's Al Zimmer was one of Goodmans's best. You actually like him in this role. But movie of the year? Not likely. The novelty of making a mostly silent film was different for this day and age, but certainly nothing new. The plot was old and well-used, predictable, even while it was being enjoyed. And again, I will say I liked this movie, in spite of it all, probably will see it again. Do see this, by all means. if for no other reason than to see what old, silent movies were like. Because this is nothing more than a compilation of a great many of them only with better actors and better film."
"agniva_pro","9","0","1","1 February 2012"," A classic homage to classics.
","The Artist is a true and lasting homage to the movies from the yesteryear. From the opening shot till the end credits, everything is a tribute to the endless series of classics produced during the silent era. That, however, is quite obvious!<br/><br/>What isn't obvious is this: if you forget the fact that you're watching a B&W silent movie in 1.33:1 aspect ratio with intertitles to represent conversations... irrespective of that, the movie is a real marvel! The technique that Michel Hazanavicius chose to craft this film is only half the story. The beauty lies in the screenplay... one of the best this year or maybe in the last 5 - 6 years. And... obviously, the actors. <br/><br/>George Valentin is a famous movie star from the silent era who brings an unknown woman named Peppy Miller into lime light by sharing a light moment with her during a movie premier. Within years, Peppy Miller turns into a big star herself while the advent of talkies throws Valentin out of business since he so adamantly holds on to the notion that he is an 'artist' and refuses to talk. The impoverished Valentin runs into many personal troubles while Peppy Miller secretly plays the 'Guardian Angel' and watches over him to the best of her capabilities. And there comes the inevitable conflict between love, pride and an artist's love for his own craft. <br/><br/>The screenplay flows like magic... it surprises you, sometimes it is delightfully predictable, sometimes it builds up to an edgy showdown interspersed only by witty humor. The comedy oscillates between slap stick, goofy fun to thoughtful and ironic satires! Almost all intertitles used are a metaphor. You're reminded of Charlie Chaplin, Sunset Boulevard, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Holiday, and many other great movies and film personalities in one go. And the climax is a show stopper, quite unpredictable and very moving.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin lives his character, breathes life into every move of George Valentin like a true prodigy. Same goes for Bérénice Bejo. Both weaved magic in the movie. The brilliant script of The Artist couldn't have seen the light of the day without these 'artists' in the cast. The acting styles used in this movie borrow heavily from pantomime and theatrical histrionics. But occasionally you get to see glimpses of very modern 21st century acting with muted emotions and stoic expression reminding you that this is not just homage, it is a cult classic in its own right and the director is ready to break all rules whenever the story calls for it. This carves out a new genre out of film noir. The lead pair truly deserve every award and accolade that comes their way. (And they both are a damn good dancer as well) James Cromwell plays a very brief but admirable part in this movie. John Goodman is appropriate.<br/><br/>There's just one thing which seemed a little out of place. The footage of George Valentin's successful movies shows some scene which contained certain special effects which were not usually possible in the 20s. I got the same feeling while watching the Nazi propaganda film in Inglorious Basterds. There are certain elements which couldn't have been that photo realistic back in the B&W era... at least, it usually didn't.<br/><br/>That apart, The Artist is a gem that deserves the Oscar buzz. Director - Michel Hazanavicius, take a bow. Cheers!"
"MyrPraune","8","0","1","1 February 2012"," Beautiful, entertaining, but missing on the story
","I wanted to see this movie so bad, because I really liked Dujardin in previous movies I've seen, because of the idea of seeing a silent movie, and the trailer really conquered me. When I sat in the theatre watching the first minutes, I was immediately taken in; the way Hazanavicius plays with the fact that this is a silent movie might be its most interesting and fun aspect. It is well-done, beautifully acted, and superb to watch. My only complaint, but it's still a rather serious one, is that after you've seen the trailer, there's really not a whole not more to learn from the movie. You've seen the whole story, or pretty much. That disappointed me; I was hoping to be more surprised by it. It did not happen. However, I would definitely see it again just to enjoy the cinematography, the acting, the subtle humour, and the whole ambiance of the silent, black and white movie. It's worth seeing, even if at the end the story felt a little thin and cliché."

But he's a dinosaur, claiming that the talking movie is just a fad, and will not catch on.<br/><br/>Much like 3D in present day.<br/><br/>The late twenties and early thirties are captured excellently, and the use of natural sound at two points in the film is stunning and a healthy inclusion.<br/><br/>It's a story about finding love, but losing everything, and finally coming back with a vengeance. It's also a love-in to a by gone era in cinema, and films many will unfortunately never see, or would have never heard of the stars of yesteryear.<br/><br/>A great movie to watch with this would be Scorceses Hugo."

The entire Journey of it's Protagonist's ups & downs, doesn't offer any novelty. I truly feel, that the Screenplay could've been stronger in the second-hour.<br/><br/>Michel Hazanavicius's Direction, on the other-hand, is beautiful. Here's a storyteller who had the guts to make a Silent film, in an era where Silent films are extinct. His vision, though clichéd after a point, deserves brownie points nonetheless.<br/><br/>Cinematogrpahy by Guillaume Schiffman, is stunning.

","A one point in the movie, where the cliché is for music to swell, there is silence instead. It was that silence that made the movie for me.<br/><br/>Though this does follow the norms of a silent movie, it's very much like Modern Times (Chaplin, 1936), in that sound is being played with. There is music throughout, and occasional humorous deviations.<br/><br/>I thought the first half of the movie was okay, but I started seeing where certain scenes were going. Contrast that with Modern Times, where I hardly ever knew exactly where Chaplin was going, and he frequently did things that amaze me every time I see them. Jean Dujardin will not be replacing Buster Keaton. In a few spots, the movie even used CGI effects. For being true to the original spirit, I thought Shadow of the Vampire did a better job.<br/><br/>For discussing flammability of film, Inglorious Basterds does a better job, as does Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage (which cameos in I. B.). The dog Uggie is top notch, though I liked Milo the Dog better in The Mask.<br/><br/>I was comparing The Artist to all these other films, but then a moment of silence happened at the right spot, and the film won me over.

"FSfilmblog","10","0","1","28 January 2012"," A Silent Treat
","The Artist has garnered a lot of rave reviews based on it's simplicity and charming tale. The story revolves around a successful silent movie star George Valentin (played with such delightfulness and glee by Jean Dujardin) who struggles to adapt to the advent of talking pictures. For those of you who don't know, this film is in black and white and is a (mainly) silent feature.<br/><br/>The film opens up in a movie theatre which is playing Valentin's latest hit film. When the film finishes, Valentin and his co-star come onto stage to accept their applauds and from this point onwards you'll understand the tone and mechanics of the plot. As Valentin laps up the cheers, through exaggerated physical and comedic movement, you understand what is clearly going on. It's never at all difficult to follow the action on screen. When he leaves the auditorium a chance encounter with a young girl changes both their lives. The young girl Peppy Miller (an aspiring actress) causes a bit of commotion and catches the eye of our silent film star.<br/><br/>With the chance encounter comes the coincidental casting of Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) as an extra in Valentin's next feature film, sparks fly as chemistry forms between the two. As their individual careers take off, the advent of talking movies come of age but with only one of them embracing the new technology, the other is left behind and becomes last weeks news.<br/><br/>What you probably notice straightaway is that it's immensely easy to follow. With the lack of dialogue (only the occasional title cards pop up) the acting is at the highest calibre as every emotion, feeling and thought is conveyed with effortless beguile and subtly. A mention should go to the dog as the animal plays an important part in the film and adds certain extra magic to the whole proceedings. It feels light with many nice comic touches (many come from the performance by the four legged friend) and even if the film has a predictable arc, it's still very watchable<br/><br/>A film shot in 1:33 ratio with a simplistic direction (which does not mean poor!) it revels in it's influences which made cinema what it was all those years ago. Simple track and pan, close ups and minimal edits which allows for a masterclass in acting by both leads. There's no room here for flash in the pan jerky camera movements and fast cut edits (which has hampered modern film efforts of late), the camera simply focuses on the actors faces and we as the audience are asked to interpret the emotion and feelings. It's the uncomplicated, plain and simple narrative which is accompanied by it's charm and witty rapport.<br/><br/>It's a joy to behold and a far cry from majority of today's modern blockbusters, where all the skill and craftsmanship from yesteryear's grace our screens. The era is capture with an eye for detail as costumes, dance moves and mannerisms reflect the period so well (just wait until you see Peppy's audition as an extra!). It's a great tribute to cinema and celebrates a time and era where entertainment was the main aim and this picture undoubtedly engrosses, enthrals and of course entertains."

But there's a lot more.<br/><br/>Tapping into the world zeitgeist, ""The Artist"" tips its Top Hat to the toughest economic times since the Depression - the era in which it's set. This film says (or doesn't) enough talk-talk-talk: in our darkest hour, heart and hope matter most, pride the least.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" adds a smidge of warning: the world's people are more precious than the maniacal pursuits of governments hellbent on rushing us all toward oblivion. While quite entertaining solely as a film, subtext elevates ""The Artist"" into a masterpiece<br/><br/>Brilliantly referencing the smile-inducing films devoured by Thirties' moviegoers, ""The Artist"" is a rags-to-riches and riches-to-rags tale of a wildly popular Silent star and a hoofing extra whose paths and fortunes cross. Ms. Bejo sparkles as Peppy Miller. She's a swell gal and eternal optimist who owes her skyrocketing career to a no-strings-attached boost from Mr. Dujardin, George Valentin. He and 'The Dog' (Uggy) are swept aside by fickle audiences seeking a younger, fresher face - and new tricks. George's heart (and ours) is broken as scores pass by his self-financed, every-$-I-have, African-Adventure, silent Oater to line up for the new Peppy Talkie.<br/><br/>Peppy and George are neither romantically involved nor lovers. Their love is spiritual: pure, free, unbound from the physical. And their love story is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>There's a lot here derived from many Silent sources. Sure George and Peppy are composites of Silent icons, but it doesn't matter. ""The Artist"" is an irresistible film plumbing the past for a solution to our present. And there's a cute dog! And an uplifting George/Peppy dance number finale that's a WOW!<br/><br/>Don't say a word. Just see ""The Artist."""
"Colyn1006","7","0","5","23 January 2012"," I went into ""The Artist"" with high expectations; sadly, I was left empty and wanting more.
","""The Artist"" has received an abundance of praise and awards since it's limited release back in late November. Knowing that, I saw the film with high expectations. Sadly, I was left empty and wanting more. <br/><br/>""The Artist"" follows the life of a silent film actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). George is the ""it guy"" in the 1920's vision of Hollywood; he's good looking, charming, and has a bad-ass mustache. The opening scene sets you right into this silent world with the premiere of George's new film, ""A Russian Affair"". As George's film, ""A Russian Affair"" ends, George comes on stage and entertains the audience by saying a few words and doing a little dance; The audience loves it. Later that same evening, George is outside the theater posing for pictures for the press when a young woman, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), drops her purse. As she goes to retrieve it, she gets bumped and is pushed right into George. George laughs it off and poses for pictures alongside the young woman. Peppy wants to be an actress; the next day she goes to an audition at Kinograph Studios and coincidentally has another encounter with George. Al Zimmer (John Goodman), the Studio's boss, isn't to intrigued by Ms. Miller, but with George's help she becomes the next big thing in Hollywood. From that point on, George's life is in a downward spiral. As she rises, he falls. With ""Talkies"" starting to become the new form of cinema, George loses his job, his house, and his wife. Given that ""The Artist"" is a silent film, it's a pretty dark and intriguing tale of a washed up actor.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" -to put it bluntly- is a piece of art. It's beautiful, funny, and suspenseful without even trying too hard; It's a true achievement in filmmaking. Another thing that is worth mentioning is how natural everything feels. Whether it be the acting, the music, the black and white film alongside the four by three aspect ratio, it never feels like an anachronism.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo and John Goodman give beautiful performances. There is no spoken dialogue that can be heard, so you might want to learn to read lips (only with image captions that pop-up occasionally is when you can understand what the characters are saying). Otherwise, you only know what's going on by watching the actors' facial expressions and movements. There were more than a couple times in this film where I felt great sympathy for Jean Dujardin's charismatic character, George. You feel sad when George is sad and you feel happy when he's happy; he's that kind of character. James Cromwell plays Clifton, George's faithful butler, and he's great as well. There's a scene with George and Clifton, I'm not going to spoil it, but it's just pitiful. Bérénice Bejo doesn't get as much screen time as Jean Dujardin, but believe me, she does leave her mark.<br/><br/>Even though The film uses the four by three aspect ratio with no color, the cinematography is a delight to look at. Like I said, there is no sound, except for the score that composer Ludovic Bource provides. To be honest, It's not exactly my kind of music, but it replicates the era perfectly (The same goes for the costume designs).<br/><br/>I've done nothing but praise this film, so what's the problem? Well...I really don't have one. I'm willing to admit something that no one ever seems to want to own up to: maybe it's just me. Maybe it was the lack of dialogue that threw me off, maybe it was the music. Regardless, ""The Artist"" deserves the praise it has gotten and will receive. Michel Hazanavicius made a bold move for making a film of this style, and it pays off. <br/><br/>""The Artist"" is a film I respect way more than I like.

The sets are excellent, and the whole atmosphere really captures the era. They could have made it in color, with dialogs, and it could have been a very good film, but not an extraordinary one. It took great creativity and skills to make this a success. It also took great courage to make it in this format, in today's technology driven movie market.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch by the main characters and the little dog was adorable. There was humor and sadness. I could not help feeling nervous for the actor who had lost everything and was in such despair as to try to kill himself. 'The artist' and 'Hugo' both deal with the old era of movie making, and the old actors having to deal with a fall from grace. What a great coincidence that they both came out in the same year! Ironically Hugo used today's technology (3D) and 'The artist' went all the way back to the 1920's. They were both excellent in their own way, which tells us that a movie can be excellent regardless of what technology (or lack of) is used to make it. The most important thing is the story and how it is told.<br/><br/>Jean Dujardin and Berenice are brilliant in their roles that require them to use their faces and bodies, without the help of dialogs, to portray the characters. That is so hard to do! The music is wonderful and without it, the movie might not have been successful. The final dance number is outstanding. This movie has so many subtleties and details that I may have missed some, so I will have to see it again.<br/><br/>The artist is definitely worth seeing. I am not convinced it is the best movie of this year, but it is one of the best, and most certainly the bravest one."

","Like I've seen written in so many reviews already, this movie is a declaration of love to the movies and, in particular, the silent movie era. It shows an incredible dedication to this lost art that is still part of the imaginary of so many film lovers.<br/><br/>The actors perfectly mimic the acting of the era, the music is extraordinary and the storyline is moving and funny enough to keep you interested and entertained for the whole one and a half hour. It never makes in feel bored and it can, at times, even make want to cry of joy.<br/><br/>I haven't seen many silent movies in my life but I am very interested in that period of time and, after watching this movie, I felt a huge urge to start watching all those classics from the past and get to know more about the art of silent movies.<br/><br/>It definitely deserves all the credit it's been receiving."
"dharmendrasingh","7","0","3","9 January 2012"," The Black and White Sound of Silence
","What's amazing to me – something I would never have guessed – is how positive the reception is for 'The Artist'. It isn't just a black and white film. It's also a silent film. Those are two of its achievements. A third one is there's nothing to tell this apart from any of the films from the dawn of the last Century. It is a perfect simulacrum of the films it aspires to imitate. <br/><br/>Truthfully, I wasn't blown away, just as I wasn't blown away by the other films I've seen from the 1920s ('Metropolis', 'Battleship Potemkin', 'Nosferatu'), the age into which 'The Artist' could easily camouflage itself. But I did enjoy myself and I did feel for the central character. <br/><br/>The story is this. George Valentin (no doubt a play on Rudolph Valentino, the real-life silent film star), played by Jean Dujardin, is Hollywood's ace actor. Audiences love him, though not quite as much as he loves himself. While promoting a film, Valentin falls for a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). He embraces her and they pose for photographs and she revels in the attention. She goes on to audition for a bit-part, wins it, and becomes a sensation – not an overnight one, but her name gradually appears higher up credit lists. <br/><br/>Valentin is shown what his studio believes is a breakthrough: 'talkies'. He laughs wryly when he hears the sound of words in film for the first time. He genuinely regards it as a gimmick. People come to the movies for him and nothing else, he says. Little does he realise that sound would signal the end of silence. <br/><br/>The manipulation of sound is the single most impressive aspect of 'The Artist'. After witnessing his first 'talkie', Valentin has a revelation. He has lived in a world where sound was redundant, and when he hears the world, it's loud. Director Michel Hazanavicius makes this point by not allowing us to hear Valentin's voice. <br/><br/>Hazanavicius is clever in another way. He uses visual metaphors to convey the points in the story. The one I loved comes when Miller has confirmed herself as star and Valentin a fading one. They meet on a stairwell in their studio. The camera pans back to a long shot, allowing the whole stairwell to fill the screen, making it look like a sort of dollhouse. Miller ascends the stairs, Valentin descends them; one goes up, one goes down; one rises, one falls. <br/><br/>Further in the story, Valentin's continued refusal to acknowledge sound causes him to fall out with the suits (led by John Goodman, who is very good as a mute considering he is famous for his voice), highlighting the message that stars have and will always be the studios' playthings. Valentin decides to use what pull he has left to become a director and a producer. <br/><br/>But he does so in vain. Talkies didn't only signal the end of silent films, they also heralded the demise of the old stars associated with them. New blood, crucially new young blood, would introduce the sound revolution. Valentin loses everything: his wife (a lovelorn Penelope Ann Miller), his fame, his bankability. As if that wasn't enough, the stock market crash swipes his wealth, too. All Valentin can do is drink and rue his situation. He becomes a living relic.<br/><br/>Miller provides succour to Valentin, not because she owes him her career, but because she sees a helpless soul who needs the touch of angel to be reborn. Miller offers a solution, which is delightfully ironic: the musical. Valentin regains all that he lost, but now stars in a genre which was itself a new movement in motion pictures. And so we have a wonderful riches to rags – and back to riches again – story. <br/><br/>I saw the film with what I perceived to be an audience with an average age of fifty. I mention that for a reason. The critics are going nuts for this because many of them will be old enough to remember watching nothing but B&W as children. Roger Ebert, the best-known – and I think best – film critic wrote lovingly and with erudition about B&W. <br/><br/>I'm of the view, however, that the question of a film's value isn't one concerning the head, but the heart. So I think Ebert's intellectualisation of the merits of B&W versus colour, although compelling, is redundant. It's a childhood thing. What your eyes laid upon for the very first time, what one grows up with, is the thing one will most love. <br/><br/>'The Artist' isn't the start (or re-start) of a silent or B&W renaissance. We've moved on from those styles. 'The people are never wrong' says John Goodman's character. 'The Artist' is like its lead character: nostalgic for a bygone age.<br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"

","I never excuse film-makers for failing to get right the world of either newspapers or television. A little research is all it takes.<br/><br/>But for film-makers to get wrong their own industry!? Which is what they did in The Artist. They completely mixed up the roles of producer and director. John Goodman was obviously the 'producer' but he also seemed to be the 'director' as well.It's possible in real life to have a producer/director/even star in the form of one person. But that would have been rare in the time period portrayed. (I'm standing by for a deluge of examples proving me wrong).<br/><br/>None of that was enough to stop me liking - and recommending - this film. People with a bit of experience of the industry (and life in general)will realize that some things have been left out of the screenplay.<br/><br/>But the remaining message - that there are decent, nice people in the world of movie-making - is a heartening one."

","""The Artist"" is a must-see for film fans. General audiences looking for a charming, unconventional film with a charismatic star, deeply romantic moments, and perhaps the cutest movie dog ever will enjoy it as well. <br/><br/>""The Artist"" is a black-and-white, silent film about George Valentin, a star whose career sinks when talking pictures arrive. It's an homage to Hollywood movies, but it's also a good movie in its own right. Film fans will pick up references to other films: plot points from ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""A Star is Born,"" snips of music from ""Vertigo,"" a reference or two to ""Citizen Kane."" <br/><br/>Jean Dujardin gives one of the most charismatic film performances ever as Valentin. He is accompanied by Uggie, an utterly adorable Jack Russell terrier. Fans are now campaigning for Uggie to receive a special Academy Award. <br/><br/>The love story between Valentin and up-and-coming starlet Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) is told without words or sound, and yet the silent telling is masterful, poignant, and articulate. ""The coat scene"" will become a classic. The scene where Valentin and Peppy must dance with each other on the set of a film called ""A German Affair"" tells the viewer everything you need to know about this love story without speaking a single word. Bejo is a beautifully quiet counterpart to Dujardin's more showy performance. <br/><br/>The movie has fun with signs. When Miller does something kind for Valentin, there is a movie poster in the background. The name of the film: ""Guardian Angel."" Ludovic Bource's score is lush and diverse. He quotes from classic film scores and is inspired by a variety of early twentieth century popular music. <br/><br/>The plot is a bit thin. The film hammers home how low Valentin sinks after talking pictures push him out of the spotlight. At least one of these many scenes could have been edited out (I vote for the scene where Valentin fights with a miniature version of himself.) More backstory could have been introduced for other characters. What on earth happened to Valentin's marriage? How did he and his wife ever end up together? How did the introduction of sound affect John Goodman and Malcolm McDowell, who are woefully underused? Otherwise, though, this film is delightful, and it will be much loved."

","I was originally going to see THE MUPPETS today with my brother, but it wasn't playing due to changes with the digital projection. He wanted to see SHERLOCK HOLMES 2, but I wanted to see THE ARTIST. In the end he agreed and my brother watched SHERLOCK HOLMES 2 and I watched THE ARTIST.<br/><br/>In a time where we are bombarded with movies that exploit subjects like 9-11, the war on terror or the financial crisis. Or sequels, remakes, reboots, re-imaginings or adaptations of cartoons, TV Shows, and comic books (ad nauseum). This one is original and is a throwback to the classic movies of the 1920's and 30's. It is one of those movies that takes you back to the good old days when there was fun and originality. It is good clean fun (except for one scene where there's an obscene finger gesture that was shown briefly). It is about George Valentin, a silent movie actor, who has now been washed up because of sound and the woman who admired him named Peppy Miller. We see him in the peak of his fame to his downfall and comeback.<br/><br/>It is a feel good movie. I highly recommend it. If you enjoy that film, then I recommend another movie, CALL OF THE CTHULHU (2005). Because it is made in the style of a silent movie and the special effects are done with stop-motion animation.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images and one obscene finger gesture. But it is worth watching.<br/><br/>Twas Charlton Heston in THE OMEGA MAN who said, ""They don't make pictures the way they used to."" Guess again. If you think Hollywood is the only one that is cooking up retro-style movies, so are independent filmmakers."

","As the movie started and the projected picture shortened to half the screen, became black and white, and did away with dialog, my biggest concern was if this is just a gimmick that would wear really really thin over the one and half hour movie runtime. Modern audiences are used to widescreen pictures, vibrant colors and booming sounds; could a hundred year old movie experience still captivate modern audiences? In short, yes.<br/><br/>We are transported to the 20s Hollywood, pretty girls and dashing leading men filming stories of adventure and action. But, without sound and dialog, the actors use elaborate facial and physical cues to inform the audience of what's going on. And, throughout the movie that is all the actors use. With great skill, the actors take use through the gamut of emotions, happiness to personal hell, triumph to despair, love to heartbreak. Valentin, a star in the silent movie era, laughs at the advancement of technology of talkies at his own peril. His pride, his fall, his despair and his love are all communicated poignantly through this medium.<br/><br/>The only major criticism that I have for the movie is the soundtrack. Rather than ebbing and flowing with the movie, the orchestral soundtrack feels somewhat robotic and dull.<br/><br/>If you're intrigued by the idea of the movie, then I highly recommend you see the movie."
"DJRMewzique","9","0","3","14 December 2011"," Cineatic Perfection...without a doubt...without a word.
","This film has got to be the absolute best silent film I have ever seen. Pay no regard to the fact that it is the ONLY silent film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>""The Artist"" is truly something to behold. In 2011, one would think it would be implausible for anyone to have the guts to produce, direct or star in a silent black and white film, never mind that film garnering as much attention and buzz as this film has. But, here it is. And it is a must-see film.<br/><br/>Being silent, it is almost unnecessary to note that the story is incredibly simple: the fall of silent film great George Valentin at the onset of ""talkies"" over a four-year period beginning in 1928. But one is not in the cinema for the plot line. if you see this movie, you are most certainly there to witness the execution of this anomaly. I assure you, you will be bewildered.<br/><br/>Written and directed by the virtually unknown French director Michel Hazanavicius with absolute pristine perfection, there is no threat that the silent genre is going to make any sort of a comeback, but this man's eye for detail is beyond explanation, and may just lead him to a coveted Academy Award nomination. One of the most visually captivating films of the year, the subtle nuances and imagery set forth goes far beyond any film in recent memory. These nuances, however, would mean nothing if no for the actors, and Hazanavicius struck gold with the casting. Jean Dujardin is guaranteed an Oscar nomination for his lead role of George Valentin. And I would even go so far as to say that, even at this early stage, my money will be on him to win. Not bad for a man who was also virtually unknown to this continent five minutes ago. With no dialogue, it takes one hell of a talent to get across what Dujardin accomplishes merely by body language and facial expression. He is so good that he needs no dialogue for you to almost understand every word. I have a hard time imagining any other performance this year showing such true acting strength as one who carries an entire film without saying a word.<br/><br/>The same thing can be said about his co-star Berenice Bejo. Having flirted with American audiences in ""A Knight's Tale"" with Heath Ledger ten years ago, Bejo returns to North American soil like a thunderous cloud playing Peppy Miller, one-time-Valentin-super-fan-cum-Hollywood starlet. The absolutely stunning actress will make you fall in love with her merely by the wink of her eye and the air kiss she will throw. Going up against a performance as extraordinary as Dujardin's is no easy feat, and Bejo not only holds her own with ease, but manages to steal a scene here and there merely with her beauty and charm. There has been no Oscar buzz around this name and I am hereby beginning it.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some well-known American actors seemingly chosen out of left-field for this French production who also give excellent performances, including the incredibly visual John Goodman, the always solid James Cromwell and even a surprisingly sweet turn for Penelope Ann Miller along with a cameo by Malcolm McDowell. However, the character that most deserves the biggest mention after Dujardin and Bejo is that which was created by Ludovic Bource. Bource created the score. In a film with no dialogue, the driving force behind what you're watching is the music that you hear, and Bource's inventive soundtrack is both inventive, original and serves as practically a supporting character on its own. I smell another guaranteed Oscar nomination here, too.<br/><br/>And when the music isn't playing? There are still moments of absolute brilliance, as Hazanavicius uses both silence as a device and, in one scene of extraordinary editing, the use of nightmarish sounds as Valentin dreams of the end of silence.<br/><br/>Brilliant? Have I used the word brilliant yet? Brilliant.<br/><br/>While this film may not be everyone's cup of tea in terms of entertainment, anyone who does experience it with have a brush with greatness for just under two hours and will certainly get a leg up on next year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>With films like this, who needs dialogue? Certainly not Michel Hazanavicius."

","I think that I should start off this review by saying saw this movie at the telluride film festival, and I loved it. not only that but I can safely that it was the fan fav. everyone I talked to said it was the best film they'd seen in a long time. So it not only me but everyone their liked it. it was a great movie.It was great for me who is a fan of both black and white movies. I am 14 and a movie nut so to see so many little nods, to great movies in there. and I have to say I loved the way that the film covered things like what it would have been like to have sound in movies as any actor. and I like how he is the artist, even if he just the actor. I feel that out of all of the films I saw at the film festival this one is going to win best picture. and why I think that is 1) it have very thing in it a good movies needs, it has heart, and it has a soul, it was made for the love of movies, it was was done and mixed the past and the golden days of film with the now not so golden days. 2) it makes making movies look easy, like anyone could make an Oscar winning film. and I feel that this film is makes movies look easy 3) it shows us what a movie really is. so if you are thinking about seeing it, just do it. it will be the best money you ever spend. and if not, you still saw it so you will not feel left out at the next dinner party because everyone else saw it and is talking about!"
