"littlemartinarocena","8","214","323","24 September 2008"," James Franco Is The Real Thing
","I laughed more in this movie than in any other of its ilk. Mostly thanks to James Franco. Yes, the James Dean Franco. His comedic timing is startling and his sympathy is all consuming. I think the secret is that we can (Franco allows us) see the human being behind this irresistible caricature. I was totally taken by the strange kind of innocence he exudes. We sense a loyal buddy who is capable of extraordinary generosity. His smile is already an iconic movie landmark. Seth Rogen is also very funny but you can guess that this is actually his character. Nothing wrong with that but James Franco's range is infinite. David Gordon Green makes his ""commercial debut"" very successfully. The showdown at the end takes a bit too long but all in all this movie is throughly worth it."

","I was not interested in seeing this movie as I thought it would be a stupid teen story. My daughter went with her older cousins, she is only 16 and since the theater had strict security I was forced to go in as her guardian. I am 46 years old and I laughed the whole entire movie. By the end I was laughing SO hard that I could not take it anymore. I think I laughed more than the kids. There were so many laugh out loud scenes and the interaction between the characters was pure gold.It really took me back to my younger days-so for you older people this is really one movie you do not want to miss. Be sure to go to the bathroom before because this is definitely one of those pee in your pants movies."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","195","342","6 August 2008"," Vibrant, hilarious mesh of genres, and a different sort of film for David Gordon Green
","There will be many who will dismiss ""Pineapple Express"" as immature, overly silly, disjointed, and scatter-shot. There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful, playful, loose genre-bending comedy with some outstanding performances, an inspired comedy script, and some great work from director David Gordon Green, certainly one of the finest young directors around.<br/><br/>The latter group is correct. ""Pineapple Express"" is, as a whole, the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies, but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes, or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate, but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and well-directed as this film.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's much-anticipated follow-up to ""Superbad"" is an excellent screenplay, but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film; ""Pineapple Express"" is all about the laughs, and the laughs are certainly here, and they are practically non-stop, with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue, acting, or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. <br/><br/>In addition to David Gordon Green's excellent work as director, the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant, and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr's cinematography is consistently great. <br/><br/>""Pineapple Express"" will be an inherently divisive film. It didn't get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did, and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed, there's little of the critic-pleasing dramatic scenes Apatow's comedies have been praised for, and even when they do pop up they're usually deflated instantly with a joke, and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film's tone, which never becomes schmaltzy, thank the heavens. Really, the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film, which contains one of the film's best jokes, but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in, and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully, quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don't, and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie, before the big, long action scene happens, and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film, but so what? There are also some nice little tongue-in-cheek references to the film's influences (""they messed with the wrong melon farmers""). <br/><br/>The cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role, and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual, Gary Cole is a perfect villain, and it's nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film (and get one of the film's funniest scenes as her character's final scene). The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.<br/><br/>There are a lot of reasons why ""Pineapple Express"" won't work for many people, and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film's plot is inherently silly to an extent (although this is nowhere near the ""Anchorman"" style of comedy), and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of ""Knocked Up"". ""Pineapple Express"" may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners, but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.<br/><br/>9/10"
"pauljraab","4","70","121","2 September 2008"," Derails in the second half
","This started out as funny & clever and completely fell apart in the second half of the movie. For the first half, I'd give it close to an 8 and for the second a zero, so we'll average out at a solid 4. The second half ceased to be funny or clever and turned into one long, idiotic clich√©. Honestly, it really felt like we lost our original set of writers & directors after an hour and they had to find a replacement set from some cheesy action movie. It totally came off the tracks when our light-hearted stoners picked up machine guns along with the rest of the thugs. Did the writers quit smoking weed and start doing meth or something? How could this have started so good and ended up such crap? I don't think I could be more disappointed after all the hype this movie has received."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","125","232","6 August 2008"," Definitely my favorite Apatow-brand product, and one of the funniest of the year. A comedy with real heart
","It's been a year since the glorious Superbad hit theaters, and here we go again: Pineapple Express is the best comedy of the year, at least in this man's opinion. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time, nor have I enjoyed myself more while doing so. It's got everything! Fire, weed, guns, car chases, explosions, a beautiful lady, Ed Begley Jr., and of course, blood and guts. Yes, I'm reviewing Pineapple Express, and not some twisted horror movie.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so great and accessible (to the viewer that is allowed to see it, mind you) is that it's got something for every kind of comedy fan: ridiculous action gags, the witty and snappy Apatow-brand dialog, funny cops, hilarious pot jokes, and James Franco playing the most lovable stoner of all time. What I really enjoyed most about this movie is that it has real heart and is not afraid to make the audience know it. It's a great buddy movie to see with all your friends. It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl, you'll love Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>James Franco (yes, THAT James Franco), taking a break from the latest intense drama or Spider-Man film, delivers the funniest performance since Sacha Baron Cohen in Borat. His Saul is quite the character, and many people in my audience were hopelessly in love with and rooting for him. Though he's a supporting role, the movie belongs to Franco in every way. His honest, sweet, and hilariously charming performance will have you dying of laughter. Seth Rogen is no slouch on the jokes as well, though his character is somewhat similar to his character in Knocked Up (I really hope he doesn't begin replicating his performances like some other comedians do). Danny McBride of The Heartbreak Kid is a scene stealer as well. I found him absolutely hilarious and great even if his character was a total ass. Gary Cole (who has become like, a cult favorite of mine) is nothing but a bonus as the ""villain"".<br/><br/>I think a lot of credit needs to be given to director David Gordon Green, who had to have noticed how excellent the first act of the film is, because the film was in serious danger of pulling a ""Hancock"" and falling flat on its face after the first act because of a somewhat serious second act (I say somewhat, because this is when our characters realize the danger they're in). However, instead of that happening, Green turns the action packed third act into one of the most ridiculously hilarious scenes of recent memory. Of course, what happens is absurd, but because you've had the time of your life up to that point, you really don't care. Featuring one of the greatest lines of all time (in slow motion, uttered by Franco of course), Pineapple has one of the strongest third acts of any comedy out there.<br/><br/>Another very strong thing about this movie is that it never drags, and is almost a complete opposite of Superbad. The style of the jokes is different as well. In Superbad, we had the hard hitting, gut wrenching laughs, and in Pineapple Express, we have a steady flow of crack ups that leave the viewer in stitches and hurting by the end of the movie. It really is an experience to behold. It's one of the funniest movies of the decade, and one of the best theater experiences of this year. My theater clapped several times throughout the film, including at the end (and at the iconic slow motion line)."
"Turfseer","1","103","192","28 August 2008"," I'd rather watch Beavis & Butthead!
","Seth Rogen is the type of actor who simply plays himself. In ""Knocked Up"", there was a positive arc to the story where he plays a loser who must take on adult responsibilities and eventually grow up. In ""Pineapple Express"", he remains a loser and we can never believe in his journey since he's pitted against a bunch of unlikeable, unsavory comic book characters. <br/><br/>Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server, who witnesses a murder by a drug dealer and then must elude the drug dealer's hired killers who are out to get him. His buddy marijuana dealer, Saul Silver, joins him as they elude the hit men. Right away you see how dumb the movie is when Denton is able to witness a murder which occurs inside a house in full view of anyone walking on the street. Another ridiculous moment occurs when Saul's marijuana supplier is shot point blank in the stomach but manages to survive and then is strong enough to drive Denton to the drug dealer's lair. <br/><br/>Of course those who wrote the movie undoubtedly will argue that the situations are supposed to be over the top and that's the humor of it. But there comes a point where there are so many scenes that are so ridiculous that one simply doesn't care about the characters anymore. Rogen and Franco do their Beavis and Butthead impersonations but their humor has no subtlety and relies mainly on slapstick to get by. There's a romantic subplot involving Denton's relationship with a girl who's a high school student but that fizzles completely especially at the end when the screenwriters forgot to tell us what happened between the two. <br/><br/>While this is supposed to be a somewhat good-natured farce about two guys who share a mutual love for marijuana, there's a lot of unnecessary violence with drug dealers killing one another during the finale. The ending undercuts the more good-natured scenes between the film's two protagonists. <br/><br/>If you check out the IMDb graph as to the age groups who liked this film, you will see that the older you are, you are less likely to like it. I feel certain that within five years, Seth Rogen will be a forgotten name within the movie industry unless he stops writing and acting in films such as this."
"braindead-and-happy","10","140","267","8 August 2008"," Made me Inhale my popcorn!
","Yep, this movie made me laugh so hard at one stage I inhaled a piece of popcorn.<br/><br/>This movie is excellent, It has so many funny moments you'll be laughing through the whole thing. I'd even go as far as to say that it's funnier than superbad.<br/><br/>James Franco gives a spectacular performance as a lazy stoner, at times I believed he was actually under the influence...hmmm.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen once again proves he can put on as good a comedic performance as the veteran comics such as Jim Carrey and Will Farrel, His career will definitely go a long way.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was great and made me laugh a lot which is good since usually you'd be relying on the main actors for a laugh.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie mainly for Young adults and teens but if your looking for a silly movie good for a lot of laughs, this is it. 10/10"
"Greasemonkey201","1","126","239","9 August 2008"," Not what you think
","I really didn't expect much from this film,and I got less than expected.The film starts out a with a few used moments from Super Bad, maybe from the cutting room floor, then it turns into this bad pot action movie with all the crude humor you can squeeze in. The plot seemed basic and then it became too eccentric. You have a process server who witnesses a murder done by the guy he needs to serve papers to played by Gary Cole, who is wasted by little screen time and bad writing, and by a dirty cop played by Rosie Perez, who is always in uniform, which is kind of dumb that even at the final shoot out, she shows up in uniform. James Franco completely ripped off his character from Brad Pitt's portrayal as a pothead in True Romance, which he stole the scene in the three he was in. We then are introduced to James Franco's supplier ""RED"" who is trying to be like Nick Swardson and doing a bad job at it. The scene with him is long, out played and just goes in every direction except moving the movie forward. Finally Seth Rogen who seems to have phoned in his performance or just played the same guy from Knocked up and Super Bad just gives a performance that irritates you with the best friend lines. Now the movie made me chuckle a few times but the long dragged out scenes and then switching to a fast paced action movie not only confused me, but made me bored. So I give this movie 1 star out of 10 for a few quick funny moments."
"kenkoller","1","95","179","20 August 2008"," Probably one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen.
","Seriously, who thinks anything in this movie is funny? ""Your car committed suicide"" was the only line to illicit even a chuckle out of me. The rest is just people running around like morons and yelling a lot. This is what the American Comedy genre has de-evovled to? I just don't get it. <br/><br/>And like someone else mentioned, so much of the story is just ludicrious. So, a guy bleeding to death, another in his underwear and his ear shot off, sitting in a diner eating breakfast, and no one notices or cares? And folks, Daylight savings always happens on a weekend, not a Tuesday. That's all I needed to pretty much check out right there. <br/><br/>Go watch paint dry instead."
"rebecca_t-2","1","42","74","20 September 2008"," wtf???
","I went to watch this film with my friend after seeing it had got a good review, and yes it made us laugh but not because it was funny because it was pointless and made no sense whatsoever. i mean most of the film there either taking drugs or involved in a car chase. then at the end when the barn blows up and because he jumped in what i think was a laundry basket he doesn't die?? then after the building does explode and is still on fire red crawls out alive?? not to mention the fact he was shot twice in his stomach at the start of the film, then 5 times at the end why doesn't he just bleed to death?? then he survives an explosion what is he the bionic man?? i actually considered walking out of the cinema, no wonder there was only 4 of us watching it in the whole cinema. the thing that made me laugh the most though were death scenes, but only because they were so un real and the acting for them was incredibly bad. Who thought this was entertaining?? Then at the end they still aren't at the hospital, i just wished that they had all died as the were insanely annoying, and being shot didn't seem to kill them. This film made me want to fall asleep with its unreal story line, i mean what happens to his girl friend at the end she just seemed to have been cut out of the rest of the film. Then at the start when he sees the murder if he'd have just sat there he wouldn't have been noticed. But no he had to crash in to two cars really loudly so that he could be found out. Then the whole thing with him getting found out because of his drugs?? I'm surprised he even threw it out if he was such an addict he would have kept it. Worst film i have ever seen. A waste of seven pounds!"
"Ryanb747","4","75","141","22 August 2008"," Why in the world?
","Bummer, The one great word to describe this movie. I Really expected this movie to be a lot better. It was a major disappointment. The movie was way too long, it had a lot of failed comedy in it, and it really over exaggerated Pot smokers. Ill admit some stuff was funny in it but it was definitely a let down. Im not quite sure how this movie managed to make it into theaters, and also I do not get why James Franco would even agree to such a stupid movie and part. If I could I would love to get my $7USD back and go see the dark knight again. At least that movie wasn't a let down like this one. My overall rating for this film is a 4/10"
"rock_rishab","2","35","61","29 January 2009"," Major Ass Wipe
","Well Some of my closest pals told me to watch this movie, they said that it was good and they have seen it, and recommend it to me. I know this guys so well, so I saw this movie. And I have to tell you, always listening to closest friends can be such a PAIN.<br/><br/>This movie constantly reminded me that, how bored one can get. Seth Rogen is bad, and I mean really bad. Even in ""Knocked up"" the only good thing was Catherine Heigal. Seth has no comic timing, he's not funny and no being fat and goofy doesn't give you an instant ticket to Laughsville, but surely gets you a ""Kick my ass"" poster, right on your butt in High School. <br/><br/>The only reason why I kept watching this was because I wanted to see more of ""Amber Heard"" (not cuz she did a great job or something, only cuz she was looking cute), and she had only 3-4 small scenes. <br/><br/>That sucks.<br/><br/>James Franco I had some hope from him, and he was still believable as a weed seller, who is almost drowning in his own weed, all day long. The only thing that could have saved the movie would have been a really good ending. <br/><br/>Surprise surprise none here. Even the ending disappointed me. It was like the crew was torn between making a comedy and an epic. Most scenes were out of place and put on. It did have a few laughs, like the leg through the wind-shield, during car chase. <br/><br/>And every time Danny R. McBride kept on living, like an irritating little pimple which keeps on sprouting back up, every time you pop it.<br/><br/>Danny R. McBride as Red.... humm he was looking more like ""Tom Hanks"" on a very very very very bad hair day. So as I was saying, I've lost all my trust in those friends of mine, I'll think twice before doing something they say....<br/><br/>Hope this will save someone from 01 hour 52 mins of boredom.....<br/><br/>I would have given a '1' to this movie, but the '2' is just for Amber"
"mbgawron-1","2","59","109","19 August 2008"," Complete waste of time & money
","Wow, was I disappointed in this movie! It missed on so many points that I really can't think of anything that was good about it. Maybe I'm just getting tired of Seth Rogen- his acting skills are very limited, usually him yelling and getting frantic- and that is supposed to make us laugh, I guess. <br/><br/>Actually, thinking back to it, the co-star pot dealer was good, I liked his efforts.<br/><br/>The misses now- where to begin? Movies can suspend reality to advance plot if they want, but that has to be known upfront- then you can accept the shootings that don't kill people, or the fact that the hottest girl in high school is in love with a much older pothead loser, and similar implausibilities. Hit men that can't catch, let alone kill, these guys? <br/><br/>Wasn't this billed as being funny? What was funny? Yelling and getting manic only works if used sparingly, but the entire movie was Seth flipping out and screaming, and other people doing the same thing. Lots of people running into trees or walls and lots of people getting hurt but not getting hurt- enough already, I need more to laugh.<br/><br/>It isn't worth the effort to think of anything more to say- but this was a piece of trash, not funny, and I would be embarrassed to be director of something this bad."
"RagingSunset","5","61","114","17 August 2008"," An unfortunate reflection of our culture.
","Having gone to the midnight showing with a friend, I was as excited as the rest of the country in witnessing what should have been the greatest comedy of the year to every young adult in the audience. Suffice it to say I was very disappointed. The movie turned out to be one big running ""Bro"" gag after another.<br/><br/>That being said, let's evaluate the plot of the movie. The basic idea of the film is based around a pothead Dale Denton ( Seth Rogen ) who serves court orders and his dealer Saul Silver ( James Franco). Denton, while finding one of his court orders targets Ted Jones ( Gary Cole ) witnesses the shooting of an Asian drug dealer at Jones's very residence! Panicking, he backs into a corrupt cop's car, into another car and then speeds off in a very amusing scene. From this point on, Denton and the man whose home he returns to, Silver, are forced to go on the run from an insanely persistent drug lord and his thugs who want nothing more than to kill Dale Denton for witnessing the crime. NONE of that is bad whatsoever. It is a simplistic plot that fits a frame perfectly for an action/comedy flick.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that one of the main reasons I mark this film down is for Seth Rogan's performance. Granted, he has always been a popular actor for ""Bro"" crowds, but this is a new low. NONE of his material was amusing. His character was virtually the same as his character in Knocked Up, with the only difference being that he stays in his life of pot smoking in the conclusion of this film whereas in Knocked Up he changes his lifestyle. Most of the jokes that Dale Denton is privy too are idiotic even for an Apatow film. His slapstick and mannerisms did more to degrade this film's quality than even the sad fact that this movie will probably convince the American public that marijuana is the way to go in life. And no, I am not anti-weed.<br/><br/>As for how the plot is actually carried out, here is another mark down. It progresses in a linear fashion ( trying to find the man responsible for ratting them out to Ted Jones ) and then suddenly flops into a barrage of stupid scenes involving Denton's underage girlfriend and her absurd father. To make matters worse, the comedy that is used throughout the majority of the film to progress the story is as stale as Seth Rogan's performance.<br/><br/>All of that out in the open, I should mention I have NEVER been a fan of James Franco. I will not deny, he was Phenomenal in this film. Every poor line from Seth Rogan and Danny McBride ( actor who played Red ) was redeemed by his performance as Saul Silver. His character, his portrayal and the comedy that ensues was a riot. Most of his lines made me want to wet myself laughing. If any award should be given out for lead actor, it should be given to James Franco.<br/><br/>Gary Cole gave a great performance as a whack bad guy in this film as well, and I would be lying if I said he in any way took away from this film. It is unfortunate that his talents, as well as the talents of James Franco, had to be wasted on this production.<br/><br/>The third character meant to be a protagonist in a certain sense is Red (Danny Mcbride). Unfortunately, I would argue that his character was as worthless as Denton. Every line from his mouth was one bad comedy clich√©' after another that we've all heard over and over again from different films. The pathetic white wanna be thug acting like his life is greater than it is can be seen in films like Waiting ( Andy Milonakes ). Granted, it was amusing when Red in all rights should have died early in the movie and kept returning, but eventually you have to wonder why he's allowed to keep living.<br/><br/>What the film lacked in value to the comedy world it also failed to make up for in substance. There was no great lesson or revelation that the viewer was to experience at the end of the film as in more contemporary modern films, nor was there a moment when the protagonist learned his mistakes and made up for them in years to come (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Waiting). Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to be different in this regard, but unfortunately it did not redeem the movie. I had heard Olivia Thirlby ( Juno, The Whackness) was to be in the film.. maybe the extras on the DVD will have her and perhaps offer more substance into the film, who knows.<br/><br/>This was a long critique and for that I apologize. If you must walk away with anything from this review, then let it be this: If you want to see James Franco give a memorable performance, this film is for you. But I caution that his acting aside, this is one of those films that makes me weep for how idiotic and simplistic our culture is becoming-- that, and every ""Bro"" in your town will be there, so be ready for that hell when you get there.<br/><br/>5/10 ONLY for James Franco and Gary Cole."
"somf","10","84","162","18 July 2008"," Pineapple smokes all other stoner films
","Ever since Cheech and Chong appeared in ""Up In Smoke"" the stoner film has become a staple of American Cinema. I have enjoyed them since day one. Last night, I was privileged to see an advance screening of Apatow's funniest film to date by far, and I really enjoyed all his other films. The audience and I were laughing so hard that I need to see it again to pick up on the jokes that I missed. It has been a long time since I have seen a stoner film stoned, but I may have to make an exception the second time around.<br/><br/>I believe that when Apatow, Rogen, and Goldberg decided to write Pineapple Express they wanted to create the Lawrence of Arabia of stoner flicks,and they succeeded. Pineapple Express is the stoner film that has reset the bar for stoner films, just like The Dark Knight has reset the bar for comic book films. <br/><br/>James Franco's Saul Silver who just deals drugs to pay for his Boobie's nursing home (He plans to become a civil engineer and be able to build toilets for kids in public parks.) is the greatest stoner character of all time. He has dethroned Sean Penn's Spicoli character after over 25 years of holding the honor of Celluloid stoner king.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin any of the jokes for you, but I am pretty sure every teen and college male in America will be quoting dozens of lines from the film within weeks and spoiling it for the main intended demographic, so I say go opening weekend before your buddy who saw it the day before starts spouting some of the films best lines.<br/><br/>I had one minor quibble with the story in that at one point Saul sells pot to some pretty young kids and there is a funny bit built around that, but I wish they had at least chosen seniors in high school or something for that scene. I believe pot is less harmful than alcohol, tobacco, and of course all other illegal drugs, but that was just a bit too young for me.<br/><br/>Anyway minor quibbles aside, Pineapple Express is one of the funniest comedies ever made, and undisputed king of the stoner flicks."
"Glen-O","4","40","72","9 August 2008"," I Wanted So Much to Enjoy This Movie...
","Maybe I screwed up by going into ""Pineapple Express"" with such high expectations. I mean, last week I saw ""Step Brothers"". The trailer was funny enough, but I didn't know if the one-note joke of seeing Will Farrell and John C. Reilly stuck in ""failure to launch"" mode would hold up for a whole movie. Still I wanted to see it, so I went in with low expectations. I laughed out loud through parts of the movie but never really felt fully entertained. By the end of the movie the few moments I had laughed at weren't nearly enough to make the film feel like a satisfying comedic whole. I was disappointed, but not too worried because I knew ""Pineapple Express"" was only a few days away. Surely it would be the laugh-out-loud comedy of the year. I was mistaken. <br/><br/>I've seen a ton of movies this year and few have really stood out. ""Indiana Jones"" was okay, ""Hancock"" was a pleasant surprise, and ""Iron-Man"" was ten times better than it had any right to be thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. ""The Dark Knight"" was hands down the best movie so far this year, surpassing even my highest expectations. But what has been missing this year is a standout comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Juno"", but it was light and sweet. Where is this year's ""Superbad"" (absolutely one of my favorite comedies of the past 10 years)? ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is probably way funnier than I thought it was, but I had been through a break-up the day I saw it and went into it looking for relief. I chuckled, but was never able to really get into it. <br/><br/>So today I went into ""Pineapple Express"" ready to be entertained. Unfortunately the movie fell flat on almost every level. I knew something was amiss when I checked my watch thinking an hour or so had passed, only to find out that the movie had only been running for 35 minutes. Surely the pace will pick up, I thought, but the movie just droned on until the end credits. Nothing overly hilarious or exciting happens in the movie. There are jokes and a few funny bits, but sadly I laughed more during the first 20 minutes of ""Step Brothers"" than I did during the entire runtime of ""Pineapple Express"". There are explosions and a car chase, but they offer about as much punch and tension as you might get watching a group of 5 year olds in a cap-gun fight. Probably even less. <br/><br/>It's hard to say exactly where the movie went wrong. At times I thought maybe it was the slow pace, but there was much more going wrong than bad editing. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez were beyond uninteresting or even threatening as the film's villains. They seem much more interested in drinking beer and eating fried chicken than catching the film's protagonists. At no point do you ever feel that Seth Rogen (great as always, but even he couldn't save this picture) and James Franco are truly in any real danger. Franco's performance is a real treat, but after 15 minutes you wish it was being utilized in a better movie. His chemistry with Rogen is electric, but this simply isn't the buddy film it could have been. And then there is the carnage. That's right. One character is beaten to a bloody pulp and even shot twice (maybe even more times before the movie ends) but somehow manages to live through to the end of the movie. This could have been hilarious, but it loses it's humor entirely when death and injury seem so real throughout the rest of the movie. Imagine seeing a battered, bruised and bandaged Wiley Coyote walking amongst the corpses of the D-Day invasion scene from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and you get an idea of what I mean. Seeing the all too realistically damaged dead bodies of a man smashed by a car and another killed by an explosion are shocking and completely unnerving since this movie is supposed to be funny. Dead bodies can be funny (look at ""Weekend at Bernie's"" or even the morbidly humorous morgue van scene in ""Bad Boy's II""), but not when they look like the sort of thing you would see at rotten.com. <br/><br/>To some degree I think ""Superbad"" has ruined the comedy genre for me. I knew going into it that it was going to be funny, but nothing could have prepared me for just how outrageously funny it ended up being. I honestly don't think there is a false note in that movie. Then you have ""Pineapple Express"". This should have been a great comedy, but even the greatest musicians can't make beautiful music with instruments that are atrociously out of tune. So what was my favorite part of the movie? Probably the last 30 minutes. Why? Certainly not because of what was going on on screen. The girl I went with (ironically the same girl I went through a break-up with the day I saw ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") snuck in a gigantic bag of Reese's Pieces. Apparently just as bored and let down by the movie as I was she tossed one of them at me to amuse herself. I tossed a couple back, and before you knew it we were having a full blown Reese's Pieces battle right there in the middle of the cinema. And the fact that no one in the audience told us to settle down or shut up tells you just how into the movie they were. <br/><br/>""Pineapple Express"" was a disappointment and an easily forgettable movie, but the experience of going to see it will always be a fond one thanks to a gigantic bag of Reese's Pieces."

","I watched this based on the 7 or so out of 10 it seemed to be getting.... 2 wasted hours later I'm confused as to how this actually came to be released. It smacks of equally stoned and spaced out individuals making it up as they went along.<br/><br/>Besides a virtually non-existent plot, poor character development and a film that's entirely based around an over-rated drug, what I found most disturbing was the callous and gratuitous portrayal of violence. People were shown killing and seriously wounding each other within the atmosphere of a pillow fight. Violence in film these days is commonplace and we have to live with it one way or another (or not if you don't want to watch 90% of films). But violence in most films makes me go ouch, that's got to hurt, or even go off into imagining how people can endure such pain - case in point: the new bond film - strapped down on chair scene, now that was realistic. One could almost feel it. Now juxtapose that with just about any scene of violence in Pineapple express - are you getting the idea?<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen P-EX and fails to understand what I'm on about must be so dumbed down as to be in an advanced state of general human amnesia.<br/><br/>Let's keep it real, we can have fun and enjoy a good flick, but be aware of money grabbers like P-EX - because that's all they are."
"maestro7PL","2","34","62","8 August 2008"," THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE! Don't believe the IMDb rating. You have to be stoned to enjoy this.
","I left the theater feeling unclean and also ripped off for paying to see this drivel. 1) It is not funny--there was only sporadic laughter in the packed audience, in contrast to Judd Apatow's much better films. 2) It has a disgusting message--that it is great to be stoned all the time. Despite Seth Rogen's character saying midway through the film that it is a waste to be stoned every day, the final scene in the diner totally contradicts this earlier scene as the three friends are happily stoned again, and loving it! 3) People who get shot up multiple times do not die. Several of the main characters get shot up repeatedly, yet they remain healthy and alive and do not seek out medical assistance. In contrast, the ""bad"" guys all die from their wounds. 4) There is a ""lovely"" scene in which Saul sells pot to underage children--and they are seen enjoying their trips as well. Isn't this a great message to be sending the teenagers who sneak into this R-rated film? 5) The foul language that pervades this film makes ""Step Brothers"" look like a Disney release. When will the writers learn that bad language should be made to make a point, and it loses all shock value when used for no reason and all the time. 6) Seth Rogen again has a gorgeous girlfriend--that he dumps! What beautiful girl with an IQ above 60 would be with the type of person Seth Rogen plays? Is this really plausible? Does anybody really believe that someone like Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up"" would ever want to be with someone like Seth Rogen? <br/><br/>I am not a prude at all. It is just that this film had no logic to it, no point to it, was unfunny, and highly glamorizes drug use more than any film I have ever seen. Why is it that some people get ""up in arms"" to see a character smoke a cigarette in a film, but doing drugs and loving it and pushing it to minors is perceived as OK? As to the IMDb overall rating above an 8, obviously the studio has been busy corrupting the website with their votes, and the timing was curious--the movie opened just yesterday and all of these high votes already! I think if you were stoned and found ANYTHING funny -- as people do when they are stoned -- you would be the ones enjoying this film. For anyone else, you'd best save your money and not waste your time. Remember, you vote with your ticket-buying. Do you really want to see more stoner comedies like this being made? The only ones who will be laughing the next day after the drugs wear off are the filmmakers and actors who have raked in all the dough. For the rest of us, we are all the poorer for films like ""Pineapple Express."""

"Otoboke","Null","28","50","10 September 2008"," Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh.
","There's no doubt about it, Pineapple Express is a relentlessly funny stoner movie, start to finish with little in the way of compromise; telling the story of two stoners, who end up entangled within a drug conspiracy plot that threatens their lives while smoking plenty of pot along the way, this year's latest instalment to the genre is the finest example of dumb -but well delivered- comedy yet. One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.<br/><br/>So far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold & Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of ""saving the best 'till last"" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.<br/><br/>Main characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.<br/><br/>This is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.<br/><br/>Coming from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.<br/><br/>And that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.<br/><br/><ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

First we can all wash out the bad taste that was left in our mouths by Drillbit Taylor. This was by far the best of the Apatow Productions. THANK YOU. The boys have not lost it. Seth Rogen and james Franco were funny as hell. This was not just a stoner movie. Like its predecessors the theme of friendship was prevalent throughout. However the boys added something different to the mix this time, besides weed. Pure OVER the top action, i'm talking explosions, car chases, Ak 47's, guns galore. It was a solid R rated movie, with comedy always there to overshadow the badass action and violence. In an effort to keep this a spoiler free review , All i can leave you with is, go watch this film. I haven't laughed this hard at the movies for quite a while. I was seated next to an old lady who was laughing her brains out, she was like 75 years old.<br/><br/>The poster has earned the space on my bedroom door, need i say more? --- The film was followed by a Q and A by Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Ken Jeong, Danny Mc Bride, Craig Ferguson and Evan Goldberg.

"mekk","9","69","144","20 June 2008"," Another great comedy from the Apatow group.
","I was lucky enough to see this movie at an advance screening last night, and it was hilarious. Franco's first project with Apatow (in a major role) since ""Freaks and Geeks"" is another hit in the string of adult comedies from Apatow and co. ""Guy humor"" dominates the film (crude, rude, and ""immature""), but everyone can appreciate the brilliant little quips that come out at the most random times, the great little names the characters call each other, and over the top stupidity from the entire cast which you can tell is generally having a good time with the film. After the bust that ""Harold and Kumar 2"" turned out to be, this film will be the stoner-comedy of the year and become an instant DVD classic.<br/><br/>Rogen is great in his element again, and Franco is fantastic as the out of whack pot dealer who you just have to love. Even if one does not recreationally ride the ""Pineapple Express"", this film will still be a complete hit, the film isn't situated around the marijuana element but uses it as a intro to a much grander story and plot that allows for some fantastic action scenes, chases, and plenty of gun fights. Overall, yes this movie is completely silly, immature, and the story is completely illogical, but it doesn't even try to take itself seriously and if it did it would just ruin the magic. I can't wait for the next Apatow/Rogen project and I hope Franco becomes a repeat performer with the group. If you liked my review of this movie, check out my reviews of other movies at ""mosmovies"".""blogspot"".""com"". It's been awhile since I went to a movie that had a standing ovation at the end."

This really took a step away from the everyday new generation comedy and did something a little different. This movie just felt like an action all the way, if that's what they were going for then bravo. Of course it had more drug use than most movies, but hey it's Seth Rogan, what did you expect.<br/><br/>The actions scenes were not only original, funny, and different, they were entertainingly brutal. This movie does have a lot of gore, but it is used in the best sense. As far as James Franco, I have never been a fan. I thought he was kind of over the top in Spiderman, I haven't really liked him in any other movies, but I loved him in this, in my own opinion he should stick to comedy.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this a 7 out of 10 is because as I was writing this I more and more felt like it was one of those movies that will get old if you watch it too much.

","Pineapple Express (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A pothead (Seth Rogan) and his dimwitted dealer (James Franco) hit the road after witnessing a cop (Rosie Perez) murder a man. Pretty soon the two are trying to get away from the cop as well as two drug lords in the middle of a war. As far as pot comedies goes this one here is nearly the best the small genre has to offer. I'm sure Cheech and Chong would give this thing two bongs up as it does contain plenty of laughs but I couldn't help but feel it had the same shortcomings as other Judd Apatow movies. That one issue with this film, as well as the others, is that it runs too long for its own good. Clocking in a nearly two-hours I couldn't help but feel that the film could have lost thirty-minutes and not much would have been missed. This is especially true during the ending shoot out, which just keeps going and going. Outside of that issue this film contains some great big laughs with most of them coming in the form of pot jokes and stuff dealing with stoners. Seth Rogan turns in another winning performance as he gains plenty of laughs from his older guy. James Franco is the real jewel in the film as he's dead-on perfect as the drug dealing loser who just sits around his house getting high, selling pot and watching reruns on television. Franco gets the look down just right but his facial gestures and voice tone perfectly capture that pot head many of us have met in our lives. I thought Perez was pretty much wasted in a thankless role that didn't offer her too much to do. Ed Begley, Jr. has a funny bit as Rogan's girlfriend's father. The screenplay really doesn't offer us any jokes we haven't seen countless times before and in many ways there's not an original idea here but that doesn't really matter because the performances are what makes the movie funny."

","Midnight showing, everyone's stoked to see what may be the biggest comedy of the summer, there are way too many high school kids, and the guy to girl ratio is way out of whack. Not really important because we were all having a good time.<br/><br/>There is no doubt Pineapple Express is highly entertaining; the film is filled with chase scenes, fire, weed, vomit, and even a nice dose of blood and gore. However, the laughs in Pineapple Express aren't so much a waterfall as they are a stream, moving slowly and steadily, never very fast and hard hitting. <br/><br/>You will definitely laugh though, the whole cast put on a great performance. James Franco really shines, and his depiction of a stoner/drug dealer is almost worth the price of admission. I don't think this film hits all the right buttons to make the audience laugh as well as some of Judd Apatow's more recent productions, I remember opening night at SuperBad it was impossible to hear a lot of the jokes through the laughter, and maybe even some crying, this wasn't so much the case with Pineapple Express, but it was still definitely worth watching."

However, I don't want to knock the film because some people have gone overboard in hyping it. First off, it is not a ""stoner"" film, it is a film that centers around two stoner characters. It is not completely a comedy, because there is a lot of violence and maybe one serious scene. I thought the two main characters worked well off one another. Danny McBride is funny as hell, again. This guy is going to be a major comedic star. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez are totally wasted and I am not even sure why they were cast for such bland roles.

","The Brian Gordon Green directed ""Pineapple Express"" tells the story of Dale Denton (Rogen) and Saul Silver (Franco), two pot-smoking friends who end up becoming deeply involved with a gang ruthless drug dealers. Now, I had always heard ""Pineapple Express"" was a brilliant blend of genres, and that's what it is - a great stoner comedy that successfully blends buddy-action elements into it's story. The script was hilarious, as it's written by Seth Rogen himself and fellow successful screenwriter Evan Goldberg. The comedic elements written into said script ,although low-brow and often dark, came off as very breezy and ended up being one of the key factors of appeal for the film. Though the best part about the film, for me, was the really believable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen. The two have worked together before on the cult television series ""Freaks And Geeks"", and their real-life friendship transfers very beautifully on film. Surprisingly enough, the movie also featured a sufficient amount of thrills and action - especially towards the end. Overall, I found ""Pineapple Express"" to be a delightfully funny buddy-stoner-action-comedy that brought the laughs and surprises in shovelfuls."

The main character, who was so terrible I won't even waste my time attempting to learn his name, took comedic overacting to a level even the late Chris Farley was incapable of. Every time someone is injured they go into a lengthy screaming and stumbling around session. It's funny seeing people hurt in bizarre and creative ways but this film had neither. It wasn't funny the first time so the other dozen times grew *sarcasm* slightly *sarcasm* repetitive.

Duct tape can be used for many things but not even duct tape could help this movie.<br/><br/>Someone did their homework and put together all the elements of a successful movie: A fat guy, a thin guy, a black-haired guy, a blonde-guy, love interest, a few minorities, drugs, awkward scene where the leads kind of get a little gay (subconsciously,) car chases, violence, the mob. However, this film should be on the unemployment line as it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Very predictable plot, what there is of it. A few one-liners that are funny and crooks that are just too namby-pamby to be taken seriously. It's a comedy but the villains should have watched a movie or taken an acting lesson on how to be the bad guys. It's billed as a comedy but it's more of a disaster film.<br/><br/>This is like one of Jim Carrey's movies where all the funny moments can be packaged into the trailer. The only bright spot in this film is that Jim Carrey and his badly capped teeth isn't in this picture. <br/><br/>I don't smoke so maybe it would have been better watching if one is high but I don't even think being wasted is going to help this film.

No, I wasn't laughing here, at all, and I was in a good mood when I started watching.<br/><br/>Are there good points? Well, I guess some of the characters, with little screen time, actually did do well. They did provide some comic relief, and were at least consistent in their actions. The fat cop and the two bullies come to mind. Also, the camera-work didn't fail.<br/><br/>This didn't save the experience.

The only people in the half-empty theatre I saw it in who were laughing (and they were laughing their asses off, even when there weren't any jokes) were three pothead idiots who were obviously baked out of their minds. They probably would have laughed if they were across the hall watching The Dark Knight. Actually they probably thought they were watching the Dark Knight. Anyway this movie sucks, the Dark Knight is worth seeing for a third time instead of watching this, which I realized regretfully after fifteen minutes into this movie which I should have demanded a refund for and then paid for a Dark Knight ticket even though it was already full just to help the box office of a movie that is good and NOT help the box office of a horrible movie for stoners. 3 out of 10 but I'm giving it a 1 to help make up for all the potheads out there who are obviously giving it all these 10s that it doesn't deserve."

","Easily the weakest of the movies from the Apatow gang. Seth Rogen and James Franco both do fine jobs at portraying their characters, but this one just fails in the writing. The movie is actually quite dull, and all but the two main characters are fairly lame. The story is simply not engaging and individual scenes aren't even funny on their own. And what is the deal with Danny McBride?!? He's not the slightest bit funny, but suddenly he's getting all these featured roles. Let's hope he disappears as fast he appeared on the scene. <br/><br/>Maybe it's funny if you watch it while high yourself. But for the rest of us, it's just humorless and boring."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","18","38","28 July 2008"," Apatow's group's ""stoner action comedy"" hybrid is fun, but not their best
","You can check off ""stoner comedy"" and ""action/crime spoof"" on Judd Apatow's list of concepts for comedies. ""Pineapple Express"" basically takes the very best of stoner comedy (a genre that has a small but faithful following) and mixes it with clever, over-the-top action and violence. <br/><br/>It's basically another notch on the idea belt for Apatow Productions who have hit very few bumps on the way to comedy fame and fortune since 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin. ""The result is a lot of fun, ridiculous, but quality laughs, though without that down-to-earth humanity that made Apatow's previous hits lovable and have a broad appeal. This one is strictly about being funny and while it definitely is, it's not up to par with earlier films like ""Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad.""<br/><br/>I was privileged enough to attend an advanced screening in Chicago and was delighted to get an early glance at how this one compared to previous Apatow films. The raw, improvised, awkward humor that is the group's trademark was definitely there, but I have to admit it was stale at first. Seth Rogen, who plays a pot-loving mid-20s process server (tells people they're sued) named Dale has sat too long in the lovable loser protagonist chair. He's not a whole lot different than his ""Knocked Up"" role. He's too funny to do that and it's time he experiment or go back to a supporting role like in ""Virgin."" Truthfully, this film could not survive relying on the same style dialogue as previous Apatow movies alone and gladly it doesn't.<br/><br/>One reason is because the other stars have not had too much Apatow exposure. James Franco as the dealer Saul is a much welcomed change of pace. He's not a show-stealer, but he's the more interesting and likable of the two main roles. His character is naive and funny in a more subtle way. In his first major comedic role, I have to say I was very pleased with the results.<br/><br/>In general, the relationship dynamic of a pot smoker and his dealer is not as compelling and real as let's say two best high school friends like in ""Superbad,"" which was written by the same writers, Rogen and Evan Goldberg. While they recognize this and try to tell the story of Dale and Saul creating a friendship, it doesn't really work. You'd rather Dale and Saul just do stupid stuff and laugh at them than listen to them argue and other pointless subplot friendship stuff.<br/><br/>So what sets this film apart as a comedy instead of it being just okay is the action comedy aspect. The final scene in this film is unbelievably funny and redeeming of any apathy you have toward it, especially if you get what it's doing. It spoofs every typical action film sequence and in terrific stoner fashion. All the film's action is clever and way over-the-top with people over- shooting each other, slamming each other into walls and other things that in real life one would never survive, but these guys do. It's not believable, but it's really funny. <br/><br/>Honorable mentions in the violence regard goes to Danny McBride who plays Red, the guy above Saul on the pot ladder who is sort of a self-proclaimed Chuck Norris figure mixed with a closet homosexual. His humor is right out of the Apatow vein but was definitely fresh. Also Craig Robinson (""The Office"") is beginning to get his name out there as a comedian with this bad guy hit-man role. Several other lesser roles are also pretty hysterical. The only characters that didn't work for me were Gary Cole's (as much as he's a good actor, the part is just weak) and Rosie Perez's, who even if they chose her because she's a weird fit, is just a weird fit.<br/><br/>In its truest form, this is a stoner comedy and that's important to know. While Apatow's past films might have been for a diverse crowd, this is definitely not something that older adults with no hippie background will enjoy all that much. It's not as stupid as other stoner films that draw on dumb things like naked women to draw interest (sex is virtually never brought up in this film), but it doesn't shy away from ridiculousness either. If any part of you likes stoner comedy, this film will instantly become your favorite of the genre. If not, you should still find things to like about ""Pineapple,"" but don't come in expecting bigger and better than other Apatow films previously mentioned."

","Some scenes in Pineapple Express seem to send out a warning to the viewer that smoking marijuana is bad - I mean consider all the things Dale and Saul get into - car chases, shootout out with gangsters. Of course that is just an exaggeration. I guess there is no a message like that. The message of this film is similar to other Rogen/Goldberg/Franco films. It is about the importance of friendship. Mainly in Pineapple Express the message is that you can find friends at unlikeliest place in the unlikeliest circumstances.<br/><br/>I have seen this film six times already since the first time I have seen it. It is a film that always gets me out of a bad mood. It is an incredible comedy that works its way into an incredible crazy action climax. Number of jokes is just the characters just stating the obvious or doing something incredibly stupid and I rarely like that. But here it fits my liking and I roll with laughter throughout the whole film. The funniest ones for me are the whole sequence in the woods and the car chase.<br/><br/>This was the film that kick started Rogen's career and people started to be aware of this guy. Though he usually plays the straight man to Franco's wacko maniac, Rogen does pull some crazy stuff in this film that is worth your watch. James Franco can pull off a great dramatic role and a great comedic one. His constantly high drug dealer Saul is the high point of the film and every single thing he says or does is laugh-out-loud funny. Danny McBride as Saul's friend Red is an amazing both sides playing scoundrel. Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan as the constantly bickering duo of killers are just mesmerizing. Ken Jeong is also in this film in somewhat limited screen time, so look out for him.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is for me one of the best comedies of the last few years and it is the film that properly introduced me to Rogen's kind of humor. Watch it if you want to have a great time with your friends and prepare for one of the best comedic experiences ever."

","I consider having a decent sense of humour and usually like those kind of pothead movies (How High etc) but this one was just not funny or nearly interesting. The acting is pretty bad, we don't really feel the ""friendship"" sense they're trying to communicate in their 10 year old dialog (""Best F Friend Forever yayayay""). Who talks like this today? Who's stopping to ask the other if he's your best friend while you're chased by police and drug dealers. I'm trying to be objective here but can't find any argument that make this movie worth watching. I even thought at one point that we'd get the usual message ""don't touch drugs, it gets you into trouble"" but not even that. How can this get 7.5/10?"
"dfranzen70","7","16","34","24 February 2009"," Bud Movie
","As far as adult comedies go, Pineapple Express is a barrel of laughs. Even though it steeps itself in profane drug humor, it has several hysterical moments that, when viewed through a prism of credulity, will have you rolling on the floor with mirth.<br/><br/>First off, this is a buddy film. Guys become friends, one guy does something bad to the other guy, they go their separate ways, they get back together, they save the day. This kind of plot is something you see in most other Judd Apatow films (he produced), not to mention most Kevin Smith films. But certainly we're not tuning in for meaningful, deep dialog between two stoners, are we? No, we're here for the gags and the undeniable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen (who co-wrote the movie).<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that if you've liked previous Apatow movies - The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up - and/or previous Rogen-written movies - Superbad - you'll appreciate Pineapple Express all the more. Seems to me that Apatow is trying to restore a long-lost genre, that of the R-rated drug comedy; aside from the American Pie films, most comedies are generic, lame PG-13 films that don't even nudge the envelope. With Apatow and his extended crew, we don't have to sit through another faceless farce if we don't want to.<br/><br/>Here's the threadbare plot. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server who inadvertently witnesses a murder while outside the home of an oily bad guy (played well by Gary Cole). In his haste to get the bejeezus out of there, Dale hits two cars, one of which belongs to a cop in on the murder. And now Dale has bad guys on his tail. He rushes to the closest compadre he has - Saul Silver (Franco), his dope dealer. This is not a movie, you might guess, where you'll hear moralizing about how drugs are bad, mmkay? Watch this enough times and you'll think pot's the greatest thing since Oreos. Anyway, that's how the shenanigans begin, as both Dale and Saul find themselves on the run.<br/><br/>As with most movies, though, this one's probably better appreciated while blitzed out of one's mind. You know how in olden days people would drop acid and then go see 2001: A Space Odyssey? It's sort of like that. Without chemical enhancement, the jokes are hit or miss (but when they hit, they pack a wallop); with it, you'd be giggling through the credits.<br/><br/>But regardless, it's not the jokes themselves that make this a fun movie to watch, it's the appeal that Franco and Rogen bring to the screen, not only individually but also as a frantic comic team. In fact, ""frantic"" describes the film rather well, as Things Happen to our duo as if shot from a Gatling gun. Rushing from absurd situation to absurder situation is part of what makes something funny, after all, and as long as you don't expect actual logic or adherence to the laws of physics, you'll find this a scream.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is, in fact, senseless hilarity, the very textbook example of a dumb comedy that defiantly wraps itself in wacky banter and incorrigible characters."

Seth Rogen is also very funny, But not very different from his other movies, but still, i think he's great. Dany Mcbride is also very funny, the guy is just naturally funny. The story is simple, but the success of the movie lies in the complicity between the two main characters played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, two hilarious stoners running for their lives. I was maybe hoping a little bit more from indepedant film director David Gordon Green who did a decent job directing the movie. After the presentation the crew ( Seth Rogen, Judd Appatow, Dany Mcbride, Bill Hader, Craig Robinson) hosted an Q&A session, which really completed the movie, it was hilarious.

"diac228","8","13","27","28 January 2009"," Different, but oh so much fun.
","Most of the problems in the United States can definitely be solved with drugs. With drugs in our system, we wouldn't care about the lack of jobs, lack of morality, warfare, and all that jazz. Okay, so this method of thinking will drive certain political parties up the wall, however, the druggie effect seems to work more with movies. This decade we've seen an influx of films featuring the controversial herbs and spices¬óranging from good to just plain awful. Cheech and Chong would be absolutely proud of this bucking trend. Now we have the Apatow gang throwing in their ideas into the mix. While before they loosely toyed with drug jokes (40-Year-Old Virgin's random scenes, Knocked Up's infamous mushrooms sequence) they went all out with their next production.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is not just a drug film; its one that meshes comedy with a heavy dosage of action. Then, unlike most genre-twisting films; this one separates the action from the comedy into two different acts. While the first half does have its action, it's totally infused with hilarity. In the second half, the movie takes a more somber tone; the comedy is there, but it's much more subtle as shootouts, fights, and absolute carnage spews all over the area. Not everyone likes the whole lets-change-the-entire-pace-of-the-movie ideal; which is what makes films like Moulin Rouge, From Dusk Till' Dawn, and Kill Bill Vol. 2 hit-and-miss flicks for the general audience. Pineapple Express isn't as funny as one would hope, but its definitely entertaining enough to keep your interest until the end, and let's not forget the wonderful performances and quirky one-liners.<br/><br/>The movie follows a court-process clerk that wears disguises and hands out subpoenas (Seth Rogen as Dale) that takes his drug dealer Saul (James Franco) into hiding after he witnesses a cop (Rosie Perez) commit a murder alongside the next subpoena victim (Gary Cole).They have to hide because both of them are involved with a very rare drug, and the cops could easily trace the drug back to them. With all the hiding, they run into a double-crossing buddy, assassins questioning their job, and more complications than you can imagine. Written by Evan Goldberg and Rogen himself, it's easily one of the most original action films written within the past couple of years. The premise was very interesting, and definitely frays away from the typical drug-addict film.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen doesn't just provide a grand script, but his performance is pretty good as well. He's never over-the-top yet believable and lovable enough for you to root for him; even when he is at his worst. James Franco's Golden Globe nomination was no fluke, he perfectly fit the role of the irresponsible, not-too-bright, yet reliable druggie. Rosie Perez and Gary Cole could have been more sinister as villains if they had more to say besides what's going on and what their next plan is going to be. Last but not least, we have the awesome Danny McBride providing even more comic relief as one of Saul's partners. While the protagonist side had many good performances and screen time, the antagonist side had a lot of short, small, and underused performances (Craig Robinson, ugh.) <br/><br/>The directing role went to someone very few expected; a well-known, low-key indie filmmaker by the name of David Gordon Green. Directing mostly dramas and low-budget simple tales about growing up and all the jazz; he pretty much abandons his roots by going with this kind of movie. Sort of like what Green Day and Metallica did to their music, this total shift of film-making must have alienated some hardcore fans. Despite some questionable moments, Green does a decent job in maintaining the tone and pacing of the movie; until the third act when it looks like a totally different movie altogether. This was a very hit-and-miss decision and while it was entertaining the final 20 minutes; it wasn't up to par with the improvisation and mayhem of the first 80 minutes.<br/><br/>While Pineapple Express does contain the writers and actors of the Apatow gang, its definitely a different sort of Apatow picture. Usually, we have raunchy and adult comedy with sentimental value and plenty of heart underneath. Not here. Here there's total carnage, insanity, and an ever-moving plot that seeks no common road. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you are willing to expand your horizons a bit, then you'll have a blast.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Two genres in one, two movies in one, and one heck of a crazy time. Pineapple Express mixes classic stoner comedy material that would make Cheech proud with action that would make younger Michael Bay proud (before he decided to blow up anything that can be built). Rogen and Franco are perfect as buddies on the run from corruption; hopefully we'll see more of Franco now that the Spider-Man days are behind him. While the directing and pacing becomes very uneven in the third act, it's just what gives this stoner flick its personality. Don't expect an entire thread of just comedy, but multiple threads of multiple different genres woven together to create an experience you won't see often. It's not frequent that one year can deliver two great stoner movies (Harold and Kumar sequel was funny as well), but 2008 was full of surprises.<br/><br/>Bust out the ""herbs and spices"" and ""cook up"" a hilarious evening with this ""special recipe."" Wait. Now I'm hungry. I want¬ÖWhite Castle.<br/><br/>Back to the movie review. Recommend. Thumbs up for approval.<br/><br/>P.S. The munchie ordeal continues¬Ö."

","I'm pretty sure my mother always told me that smoking pot was bad for you. She's my mother so, naturally, I always believed her. Now, I'm not so sure though. She couldn't possibly have seen PINEAPPLE EXPRESS before making this assertion. If she had, then she would know that smoking only leads to hilarity and kinship. At least that is one of the many valuable life lessons I learned while watching the latest Seth Rogen vehicle to come off the Judd Apatow assembly line. I also learned that paranoia can be a very good thing, that friends who smoke together stay together and that James Franco actually has a drastically different side to his usual stoic, dry presence. I think most importantly though, I learned that stoner movies, when they're done right like this one, don't require the audience to smoke up heavily beforehand in order to have a good time. Albeit, I'm sure a whole other kind of good time would be had if you did.<br/><br/>You could see this movie as an opportunity for Rogen to push his pot smoking agenda onto unsuspecting youths that think of his as some sort of demi-God after last year's one-two punch, KNOCKED UP and SUPERBAD, or you could just drop the act and enjoy the trip. Besides, smoking is hardly over glorified in this film. Every time Rogen, as Dale Denton, a crafty process server, lights up, he finds himself in a whole heap of trouble. He makes stupid mistakes that lead to his deeper and deeper into despair. And while watching Rogen alone is certainly entertaining, watching him get goofy with a buddy is even better. The buddy here is the unexpected Franco. Franco plays Saul Silver, the drug dealer to Dale's drug doer. Get these two in a forest and give them a little herbal amusement and there is no telling how stupid they will get and how far out in space their minds will go. There is one sure thing though, weed brings these two together and their lives are better for it.<br/><br/>Thank goodness these two have each other because they could never endure what they need to go through all alone. Saul sells Dale some of his highest-grade bud, called pineapple express. It's so rare, so exclusive, that after Dale witness a homicide and dumps his roach at the scene, he believes that it can be tracked back to him. Saul must then get involved as he is the sole distributor of pineapple express and therefore the whole thing can be traced back to him. In order to get out of their unfortunate bind, the two must go to the source and get the bad guys, including a feisty Rosie Perez as a crooked cop, before the bad guys, and gals, get them. Many a stoner has inhaled and embarked on zany adventures before these two but how many find themselves in high speed car chases or live-or-die bang-up's or even fleeing scenes of explosive proportions? Well, I can't say actually but I can say that none have been this funny in what feels like a very long time (what feels even longer if you actually are stoned).<br/><br/>Dale and Saul are the new stoner buddies, the new Harold & Kumar, if you will. They are accidental action heroes whose pot smoking both gets them in and out of trouble. Unlike the punks responsible for the most recent Harold & Kumar disaster, the people behind PINEAPPLE EXPRESS are actually interested in making a solid film, one with an engaging story and consistent character development. Director David Gordon Green (SNOW ANGELS) knows that just because his characters are stoned out of their heads 99% of the time does not mean his audience will be necessarily. The audience might want to shut off and have a great time, either naturally or enhanced naturally, and that does not mean that you don't actually have to try. When I want to shut off, I like to be around good people and let the laughs roll.

","From producer Judd Apatow and director David Gordon Green comes a stoner comedy for guys to enjoy. Starring and written by Seth Rogen, Rogen plays Dale, a process server who hands out subpoenas to people who don't want them. On an ordinary night, Dale is supposed to serve papers to a rich drug lord, played by Gary Cole. dale witnesses a murder and goes to his drug dealer's (played by James Franco, trying to break away from being famous for the Spider-Man franchise) apartment.<br/><br/>Franco steals the show in this role as he is believable as a lazy, slacker drug dealer. Franco takes this character that seems like can be played by anyone and makes it his own. Danny McBride gives a breakthrough performance as Red, who is also caught in this mess thanks to Dale and Saul (Franco).<br/><br/>It is a good mix of action and comedy. It is as much funny as it is action packed. It fits in with other Frat Pack movies such as Talladega Nights and Superbad. It is a must see for fans of the Frat Pack."

","I remember watching this maybe a year or so after it came out. i finally got around to watching it and i remember thinking it was really good! so tonight I decided to watch it again... and i turned it of after about 40 minutes. Right at the dinner with Seth's girlfriend's parents... I realized how awful this film actually is. <br/><br/>The way Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) explained to the family what he had seen. how he arrives and stumbles his way through lying about forgetting the dinner he was invited to. so unbelievably annoying. ""Right the dinner! yes of course im here because of the dinner. The dinner I was invited to. Yes thats why Im here."" thats the gist of it. ""why are you all dirty"" ""Im not. I was in the woods."" Jesus how stupid. Its not funny and its a total clich√©. Characters that try to explain something clearly and coherently never can, ever. After Dale witnesses the murder he runs to Saul's house and does the same thing! ""They killed him! They killed him!"" Ummm yeah thats exactly how I would start telling a person that has no idea what's going on. My god so annoying! <br/><br/>The movie really isn't funny at all except for a few scenes. I also love how, just like every movie, Seth Rogen's girlfriend is a total smokeshow and he is a fat loser... thats pretty much every movie. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm just tired of Seth Rogen and James Franco. I mean sometimes they do good things but mostly its just them and all of their friends doing friend things. ""This Is The End"" is the perfect example. That movie is actually funny but everything they do has to be all of their friends included. ""The Roast of James Franco""... which I have no idea He earned a roast (I was under the impression that you got roasted for being an icon or something of that sort).... was basically a stage filled with all of his friends and a few real comedians. Its just terrible.<br/><br/>So anyways yeah go ahead and watch it ans tell me you don't want to rip your ears off as Stehg Rogen explains that he witnessed a murder. 2/10"

This movie was so bad that, while I was working, at the drive-in movie theater, I actually fell asleep, while walking across the field, and whacked my head on a slab of concrete that used to be some kind of heater thing. I don't actually know what it is, but it's filled with wasps and when I hit it they stung me several times. This movie was terrible, it wasn't funny, it wasn't cool, it was like watching other people smoke pot and that's never all that funny. If I wanted to see that I could have gone to work and then yelled at them. Oh, wait, I was at work, and I did yell at them, all twenty five of them. And what do you know, the ones on pot were also the only ones laughing, the rest of the people who made it through the terrible plot were also asleep; and guess who had to wake them?

"Quinoa1984","10","12","26","7 August 2008"," truly, insanely and shamelessly entertaining pot-movie spoof on action movies
","It's a given that when you go to a Judd Apatow movie now (and he's only directed two, but they're still 'movies' anyway, despite the growing stable of directors) you'll know what to expect more or less. After 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and to a lesser extent Forgetting Sarah Marshall, there's an expectation- if you're tuned into the sensibility of off-the-wall, filthy but improvisational comedy- for it to be good, or even awesome in whatever 'fold' of comedy its in. Pineapple Express, for the Apatow fan, is as awesome and dumb and illogical and purely enjoyable as comedies get this year, let alone for its 'fold', which in this case is the pot comedy cross-pollinated with ridiculous 80s action flick.<br/><br/>It's awesome, for one thing, because the screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (also responsible for Superbad) don't give a crap about making anything too, um... should I say realistic? Maybe plausible is more the word in this case, as realism implies that there isn't spoof going on here, which there is, in the kind of subtle AND over the top craziness that one loves to see done right. In this case the movie starts out with an amazing opening scene set in ""1937 - The United States"", where a secret government test is being done on the effects of marijuana on a soldier (which, oddly enough, make the soldier act and talk like someone in the 21st century, which makes it funnier), and there's a slight reefer madness tint to it.<br/><br/>Then, after the initial set-up- where Dale (Rogen), a subpoena deliverer and frequent pot smoker, gets in hot water for seeing a murder take place by a villainous drug dealer caught in a war with 'Asians', and then implicates his drug dealer Saul (very uncharacteristic James Franco) by leaving 'evidence' behind of the film's title- the writers kick things off into a sly, really insane take off on 80s action thrillers. Make no mistake, they're true to the sources: this might be one of the most violent comedies ever made, a hard, capital R where the least violent bit was shown in the trailer with Franco badly, uproariously kicking his foot through the windshield during a high-speed chase.<br/><br/>But one might ask, is the cartoonish violence enough to make it awesome? Not quite - what really clicks for a viewer who wouldn't touch pot with a ten foot mouthpiece are the actors and how much serious fun they take the material. Rogen and Franco, the latter of which giving his best performance yet (yes, best performance, see it and see what I mean compared to his so-so Spiderman parts), click instantly and work off one another in that great, somewhat predictable buddy-comedy mold. They bond, they argue, they separate for a bit, and then finally come back together for that show-stopping finale. To reveal what happens there, of course, would ruin all the fun, but everyone involved in the cast (Danny McBride, Rosie Perez, Gary Cole, Ed Begley Jr, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson, and all those Japanese or Chinese or Vietcong I can't remember) pitch in for scene after scene that never fails to rise some laughs.<br/><br/>In fact Pineapple Express is so funny, so relentlessly action packed and loaded with the kind of dialog that's brilliant for being so natural in its crude and stupidity (again, an Apatow trademark), that it's incredible to think the director is David Gordon Green. This is almost akin to, though not to make a complete comparison, Terence Mallick or Darren Aronofsky helming a Mel Brooks production. What compelled him to take on a raucous pot-action comedy that continuously tops itself I can't totally say (save for just wanting a change of pace in genre and control over material). But it's equally incredible that he manages to get in some moments of his own sensibility into the film in those little moments when Rogen and Goldberg don't have a lot going on, when the visual aspect can be emphasized. Not to mention, on top of this, he's able and ready to direct ""genre"" material without making it too serious.<br/><br/>It's an artistic statement AND one of the most memorably brutal climaxes in recent movie history, and I loved nearly every ""what-the-hell"" minute of it. Where else will I get to see bullet-strewn drug dealers and ears partly chopped off treated with the reverence of the Daily Show?"
"jbacks3","1","13","29","15 August 2008"," Worst movie of 2008
","Pineapple Express is an excellent argument against smoking dope. The movie is amateurishly made, poorly plotted and the acting never rises to the point beyond where you're amazed everyone managed to memorize their lines (at one point Rosie Perez nearly breaks out laughing inappropriately in a scene). The violence is horrible. One drug dealer is shot twice and doesn't seem to have a pain threshold. Ed Begley Jr. is (no pun intended) wasted. While I can't accuse this piece of crap as glamorizing drug use, it amounts to 2 hours you'll regret. At the theater I was in, 8 people walked out--- and it was raining buckets outside--- and I saw one guy demanding a refund. P.E. is absolutely the worst movie I've seen this year!!!! Rating this one star is one too many. I can still smell it."
"Adam_P_L","8","13","29","12 June 2008"," Hilarious and action-packed
","I saw this at a preview screening last night and had a blast. Pineapple Express is about a dope dealer (James Franco) and a 25-year-old weed-smoking process server (Seth Rogen) who has an 18-year-old girlfriend who's still in high school. The two buddies are forced to go on the run when one of them witnesses a murder, and hilarity and wild action ensue. All I knew going into this was that it was a stoner action comedy, which seemed like a strange mix, but I thought it ended up working beautifully. Rogen and Franco have an easy chemistry (they first worked together almost ten years ago when they were on Freaks & Geeks) and even though this movie makes you constantly want to yell at them to stop being such idiots, they're likable and charming, and their constant screw-ups are all part of the humor. Also, I was surprised at how bloody and violent Pineapple Express occasionally was. Despite that, however, it's pretty hilarious throughout, even during the action scenes. If the idea of two stoners, armed to the teeth, heading off to a warehouse shootout in a yellow Daewoo while blasting Public Enemy's ""Lost at Birth"" sounds funny to you, then you'll probably enjoy this movie."
"ctomvelu1","6","8","16","18 July 2009"," Striclty for potheads
","I'm not sure why films like this continue to be made in the new century, but so be it. PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is a very thin comedy about two loser potheads (Rogen and Franco, looking like River Phoenix) who get cross paths with killer cops, numerous gangsters -- and murder. They keep trying to escape but never manage to get completely away. In the end, they turn into a LETHAL WEAPON-style team, and not always for laughs. Some really violent deaths occur, but they are mostly over-the-top deaths. This would have been a Cheech and Chong film back in the 1970s. Not my cup of tea, but a best bet for all the stoners out there. Rogen, who I have heard of but am not familiar with, has a voice identical to Penn Gillette and looks like a young John Goodman. Franco is virtually unrecognizable with hippie hair and a scraggly beard."

","I enjoyed 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up and thought Superbad was super great.<br/><br/>I decided to give Pineapple Express a try. What was great about the previous three was the realism. Pineapple Express was a far fetched tale without any insight or interest. I laughed once during the film (near the end) and thought the acting was atrocious.<br/><br/>Pot based films can be phenomenal (Half Baked, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc...) but this was one of the worst films I have seen. The plot was uninteresting (which I could have lived with if it were funny), the characters were flat (which I could have lived with if it were funny), the jokes were tasteless (which I could have lived with if it were funny) - Do you see a trend here?

"relish666","6","11","25","8 August 2008"," The beginning is funny, but it morphs into a lame, gross-out action movie
","This movie was a disappointment. I am a fan of most Apatow movies, and a huge fan of Superbad, which was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. So I naturally had high expectations. <br/><br/>At first I found the movie very funny. Similar humor to other Apatow comedies, but a little more drug-related than usual. Then, out of nowhere, the movie becomes a full-on action movie, without humor.<br/><br/>Like many of the the Apatow pictures, the movie is too long. The action seems to go on and on, but all humor is lost. The only laughter in the theater is the nervous kind, because people are shrieking and ""ew""ing at the grotesque action.<br/><br/>If you like marijuana and really love gross-out action movies, this is probably the movie for you.

"jordanhunt1990","8","5","9","18 January 2012"," A theatrical high.
","In the opening lines of the movie, it is said that 'weed makes bad movies better', or something to that effect. While 'Pineapple Express' is far from a bad movie, it's interesting to ponder this line and then consider the film sans any drug references whatsoever; without the weed, there would be little else left.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with recreational drug use, drug culture or drugs in general will appreciate 'Pineapple Express'. If you've never been near a doobie in your life, then you may find yourself scratching your head. Not because the plot is overly complex, but simply due to the fact that drugs are the closest we get to a prevalent theme; at its core the plot is a case of wrong place, wrong time as the central character unwittingly witnesses a drug tycoon commit murder.<br/><br/>Rogen performs to a high standard in a role that perhaps is his best suited yet; his character, stoner Dale Denton, reflects Rogen's most endearing traits perfectly as opposed to some of the more shoehorned personaes he's adopted in recent years. While many critics may suggest that Franco's mind-numbingly funny turn as drug dealer Saul is the standout (and it is most definitely deserving of the accolade), Rogen's seemingly effortless portrayal just manages to steals the show.<br/><br/>The success of 'Pineapple Express' definitely lies in its 'Superbad' style dialogue, a kind of back-and-forth banter that could potentially occur spontaneously, but is more clearly the sign of clever writing and a trained sense of humour. This is fast becoming a trademark of the Judd Apatow machine. Even when the film is not revelling in its drugs esoteric, the screenplay remains ever sharp; a sudden transition from comedy to action fails to halt its momentum, despite the unexpected contrast. It does, however, maintain the hilarity by spoofing blockbuster convention. For all the genres it touches on - from comedy to action to crime thriller to buddy movie - 'Pineapple Express' has such confidence in its nature that no lack of agenda can't prevent it from delivering pure entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10"

They have fun roles, and they were obviously allowed to improvise. I love the fact that it was directed by David Gordon Green, who was credited by many as having giving us one of the most authentic portraits of young love in All The Real Girls. The movie is structured more along the lines of a big budget buddy pick, but the dialog is strong enough to lift it above 99% of comedies I've ever seen.

"bob the moo","Null","12","28","9 November 2008"," A basic comedy with little for the casual viewer
","Dale is a simple man who is dating a high school senior and enjoying his job serving court summons and spending the rest of his time getting stoned on that good weed that dealer Saul keeps him supplied with. After one more visit to Saul, Dale leaves with a couple of joints of brand new Pineapples Express and carries on to his next job. Coincidentally his next job is at the house of Ted Jones ¬ñ the main drug dealer in the area ¬ñ and he arrives just in time to witness Ted and a female police officer killing somebody. Dale chucks his joint and flees the scene but the distinctive aroma of Pineapple Express is unmistakable to Ted and it means the witness was a customer of Saul's. Realising this, Dale and Saul go on the run but Ted's men and corrupt cops are hot on their heels.<br/><br/>It has been many years since I last smoked but I do know that it is not a great feat to make a stoner laugh and, as such, Pineapple Express is hardly going after a tough target audience. Much like all goofy comedies, this plays well to people who are high (I think I have watched the South Park movie and Spaced loads of time in that condition) but in a more sober state of mind it is not actually that remarkable. Marketed as an action/comedy, the film plays a lot more like the many Rogan/Appatow films that have come out over the last few years (in a rush before the taste for them wares off?) and it isn't as smart or as funny as it would like to think it is. It does manage to create a tangible air of a stoner comedy but the writers seem to have forgotten the substance, because it does all feel very basic ¬ñ like most of it was the first thing they had thought of.<br/><br/>It has a few laughs here and there but way too few to make the comedy work. Meanwhile, as an action film, it relies too heavily on the comedic tone to carry it and it is not that ""exciting"" or engaging. Indeed, with the comedy not really working, the body count and graphic violence are quite excessive and unpleasant because, in order to work, the audience either needed to be enjoying it as a silly affair (like Shoot 'Em Up) or as engaging action. I never really have either of these and, while it was reasonably amusing, it was never more than that. Rogen and Franco make likable enough stoners but there is not enough here to make them really engaging characters more than simple stoners. The support cast feature plenty of solid turns with Cole, Perez, Corrigan, Robinson, McBride and a few others doing good work with their material.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is aimed at stoners and this is pretty much the only audience that will find it a lot of fun. To the casual viewer, the humour and stoner air is the whole story as there is not a lot else to the film ¬ñ not comedy, nor action. What there is is basic and lacking in imagination and invention. Ignore the hype ¬ñ this is just a very basic comedy that needed a lot more criticism while it was being made and a lot less freedom to the makers."

"yankeesrock9821","6","17","43","7 August 2008"," Apatow Magic Not Evident In This One
","Let me begin by saying: I have loved Apatow Productions, and consider myself a huge fan of Superbad, Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and the like. They were funny comedies with great directing, solid acting, and usually a good moral to go with it.<br/><br/>However, this movie is not in a class with those. What made those movies special was that while they were hilariously funny while having substance. This one slipped, and while it was funny enough to not completely be a stinker, it was not what I was expecting from an Apatow produced comedy.<br/><br/>The movie starts out strong, and the chemistry between the two main characters, Dale Denton (Rogen) a stoner, and Saul Silver (Franco) a dealer, is almost flawless. As they slip deeper and deeper into a drug war between two local kingpins, Ted Jones (Gary Cole in an uninspiring role) and the ""Asian"" family, they become fugitives from both the law and the dealers.<br/><br/>While we're on the topic of the Asian family: the depiction of stereotyping can funny (if tasteless), but when your characters cease to be people and are only a stereotype, it can insult the intelligence of the viewers. In the case of those in my theater, no one thought that the stereotyping was funny at all, and most thought it thoroughly dumb.<br/><br/>As Saul and Dale run, trying to save their lives, we see Dale's 18 year old girlfriend, Angie (Amber Heard), and Saul's middleman, Red (Danny McBride) enter the picture. The viewer also sees the two hit-men sent by Ted to hunt down Saul and Dale, a presumably homosexual Budlofsky (Craig Robinson) and a very serious, ""family-oriented"" Matheson (Kevin Corrigan). Once again, the stereotype of homosexuals presented in the movie was just dumb, and I felt that as soon as the movie moved away from Saul and Dale, it stagnated and never really held my attention like the beginning.<br/><br/>In terms of acting performances, I absolutely loved Franco's portrayal of Saul Silver. He was absolutely hilarious, and everything he said elicited lots of laughs from the audience. Rogen's Dale Denton seemed a little uninspired, and his act as ""an everyday loser"" really ran thin on me in this one much more than it did in his other movies.<br/><br/>I thought the direction was unspectacular, and at many times it seemed like an amateur movie, not fit for the mainstream. While this has worked in the past with David Gordon Green's independent movies, it did not work here.<br/><br/>The movie was fine, but once again, not amazing in any sense of the word. It tried to make the ""stoner-flick"" acceptable for people who would not typically see a marijuana-themed movie by adding action and a very underdeveloped ""buddy-theme."" 6/10 Stars"

But Cheech and Chong were never this violent. The jokes and drug humor here were funny, and I thought the idea of Dale using various guises in his job as a process server was entertaining. But this was overshadowed by the violence. To me, and for many people violence is just not funny. That cancelled out what might have been humorous. Sometimes violence is needed to tell a story, and in a quality movie, can be acceptable. This is Cheech and Chong crossed with Pulp Fiction, but Pulp Fiction is a far better film. The violence there is surreal and makes a statement just by how casual and yet extreme it is. There are some laughs in that movie, but it does not push ""isn't this violence funny"" on you. This did, and it became a turn-off that kind of made all of it less funny.

The only crime is that investors and ticket-buyers waste their money on this film.<br/><br/>The tag-line, ""put this in your pipe and smoke it,"" should tell you what the filmmakers are really promoting (illegal street drugs).

","Do not waste your time on this garbage. I was able to sit through about 40 minutes of it, but then I started to fast forward through the movie to see if anything funny or interesting was ever going to happen......but it never did! And another burning question to ask is 'Why did some 'good' actors waste their time showing up in this movie? I know there were many better places and movies for them to be in. And as for the genre: sure, I like the stoner movies IF they are funny. This one is the lamest stoner movie (or any type of movie for that matter) to come out in a long time. Seth did good in Superbad, but he's still nowhere close to the comedians before him. He looks to old to be acting like a stoner kid, unlike Franco who still looks younger. This movie should be burned and forgotten."

","If you thought ""Super Bad"" was insanely funny, then you haven't seen anything yet!! From that film's producer, Judd Apatow, and the director David Green Wood, comes a comedy that practically equals or even goes beyond ""Super Bad"". I know some who haven't seen it are probably thinking:"" Is that even possible?"" Indeed it is, indeed it is. This is first off accomplished by the very nicely done story which Seth Rogen himself helped to right. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez are perfect together as the ""bad guys"", serving up well done performances.<br/><br/>Besides the villains, the screenplay introduces some very interesting characters. It presents the usual buddy film but it's done so well. Seth Rogen and Danny McBride are laugh out loud hilarious no doubt, but to me the real star is James Franco. It's like he was born to play this role and people like myself fall in love with the character. The ""buddy"" scenario is just so damn enjoyable in this flick. Some have criticized the film's violence which admittedly at first view had me thinking i was watching some sort of Quentin Tarantino film. But now I've come to realize that despite the fact that it is rather realistic and in the case of the 'ear' situation (lol) pretty gross, it all blends in well with the comedy is really a necessary part of it. In a movie filled with drug lords and hit men, there would naturally be some unfortunate yet funny as hell deaths. Therefore, I can honestly say ''Pineapple Express"" is one of my all time favorite comedies.<br/><br/>And Oh yeah, before I forget, ""F*ck the police!!"". lmfao!! My favorite line in the film no doubt."

If one is earnest about the film then it might come as a disappointment; but if one views it for what it is, i.e. a spoof of action films taken from a stoner angle, then the movie works terrifically well. The satire was much edgier than in other Apatow films, as it blended two entirely different genres. Perhaps you guys just weren't stoned enough when you watched it..<br/><br/>The one thing that did bother me about the film was the same thing that bothers me about most action films; that is, the bad guys can never shoot...they're always shooting off rounds at their targets and never hit anything!

Cinematography is OK - of course, photography is not on par with ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but it still much better than ""Fast and Furious"" or the kind. Acting - you feel that Seth and Franco knows how to impersonate a drug smoker, so no actor studio or improvisation class was needed.<br/><br/>But the script is so slow and unproductive, it is amazing that it did not even try to fill the holes by mild funniness.

In this day and age when comic performances largely consist of being able to deliver a snarky one liner or mug a camera, he gives us a fully developed comic turn as delightful to listen to as it is to watch and nearly Chaplinesque in scope because he let's us see the sadness that this not so simple little pot dealer uses weed to keep at bay. There's a huge hole in Saul's soul that for whatever reason, only big fat Dale can fill. It wasn't until I movie for the fourth time that I saw the connection between that weird conversation about euthanasia he has with Dale earlier and their big argument later in which he vows to become a a civil engineer as soon as soon as his grandmother dies. In other words, as much as he loves his bubbe, he can foresee a time when he might just have to nudge her along so that he can get on with his life. There's a mind at work there, and if you place him in the context of his book, art and collection filled apartment, you can see it's not a dim one.<br/><br/>Slapped, spat on, beaten, stabbed, kicked, shot at, run over, knocked out, blown up, he goes through more physical abuse than Rambo and what with being sold out by one friend and having his heart broken by another, more emotional abuse than Mildred Pierce, yet like the Little Tramp, he is never diminished, never becomes bitter or accusing. And at the end of the film, there he is in that diner, shining like, well silver.<br/><br/>I can't forget the scene where they're in the tree. Dale finally at long last says something nice to Saul and Saul sees this slit of an opportunity to jump in with this little declaration of friendship and when it doesn't elicit the response he'd hoped for, he's just gutshot. Yet he hides it and by the end of the scene, he's pulled himself together. ""It's what I do!"" Wrenching and funny, it's as delicately directed and perfectly acted piece of film-making as I've ever seen. Here is a character you just take to your heart.

","American film humor in this day and age is rife with stoner sensibility. Most film comedies with contemporary settings feature it's ubiquitous presence visually or in the writing. Still federally illegal, marijuana is treated with a wink and a nod and don't ask don't tell policy by most of society while a powerful elite (the liquor lobby?, the last remnants of Puritanism?) man the barricades to prevent it from destroying Western Civilization and their profit margin. Presidents, Vice Presidents, senators and congressmen all readily admit to it's usage at one time or another and beginning in the late sixties it replaced 3D glasses as an enhancement to the film experience transforming lame films (Plan 9 from Outer Space, Dragnet) into unintentional comedies. Many a Friday night my friends an I would pass a joint (along with a quart of a cheap vodka and orange juice concoction called Tango) back and forth in the balcony at the Palace theater in Providence, RI laughing and cheering Harpo, Groucho and Chico (we booed Zeppo)as comrades in arms mocking an uptight society. In the film Pineapple Express the stoners have been removed from the balcony and put on the screen. They should have stayed in their seats.<br/><br/>The film's title gets it's name from a super weed that is so potent and rare it gets one incessant toker to liken it to ""killing a unicorn"" when put to flame. It's rarity however gets our two dazed and confused protagonists Dale (Seth Rogen) and Saul (James Franco) in a fix when Dale witnesses a murder by a drug kingpin and a cop accomplice. The boys have a real reason to be paranoid now as they are being hunted by some radically violent dudes. For the final 90 minutes of this Cheech and Chong, action film hybrid the boys alternate between high chatter and graphic violence making for one incoherent mess. It quickly becomes a victim of it's own smugness and excess with it's one note repetitive theme that quickly loses potency after ten minutes.<br/><br/>Express has a patronising air and it's characters lack the charm and ""wit"" of weed icons Cheech and Chong who more clearly defined the stoner mentality and spirit. Rogen and Franco's indecipherable whining most of the film is a very poor substitute for the ideal high guy inflection exhibited by Tommy Chong in film and record and the movie itself going in circles gets tired very fast.

","PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is Judd Apatow's first real foray away from the romantic comedy (if you can call his offerings by that dreadful moniker) and into the more 'male-appreciated' buddy/stoner comedy. Helmed by David Gordon Green, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS achieves what so many recent buddy/stoner comedies fail to do: make the audience laugh genuinely while not giving in to the temptation of cheap laughter.<br/><br/>PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is full of laugh-out-loud moments and memorable one-liners, and is worthy of multiple viewings. This film is not a typical comedy; it is full of violence and crime, and has its 'dark' moments, even though almost all of these end in laughter. The bottom line is that PINEAPPLE EXPRESS never takes itself too seriously, and that is why it works so well.<br/><br/>The Seth Rogen/James Franco duo is quite hilarious and it is refreshing to see Franco in a comedic lead role, as he does brilliantly well. My only real problem with PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is its run-time which exceeds the optimal length for a comedy by about 20 minutes; a more ruthless editor would have probably cut out large portions of the over-the-top action sequences.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid 7/10. 2.5 stars (out of 4).

And, when I say 'good,' I basically mean funny. I laughed about once (out loud) throughout the whole hour and forty minutes (which us unusual when I watch a Rogen/Apatow collaboration). No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't 'get' it. It's about two pot-smoking stoners who end up getting chased by killers/drug dealers. However, the 'chase' largely involves Seth Rogen and James Franco screaming a lot and then running round in circles (occasionally slapping each other/someone else).<br/><br/>Again, my verdict is simply that it's not funny. The two central characters are annoying and not that relatable to, therefore I don't really care that much if the mob catches up with them and kills them, or they just get away.<br/><br/>So, that's my verdict ‚Äì Pineapple Express is an average 'comedy' at best. However, it's worth noting that the majority of people must have seen something in it that I've missed, as it's (currently) rated a pretty impressive 7.0 out of 10 on the Internet Movie Database.

","This movie had a lot of good raunchy humor that gives people a laugh in almost every scene. Definitely, a good movie to watch with your friends and will make the day of even the most depressed of peoples. However, what prevented this movie with a lot of potential from being great was the weak story and weak acting from certain characters.<br/><br/>On the story, there were not any real moments when you feel that the characters learn something. There is one moment when one character seems to realize the bad direction this person's life is taking. However, this epitome comes so rushed and had little built on it. The character just snaps. However, even after this realization the character, and the others, have eventually, they don't seem to be truly acting upon it and whether or not they changed is left hanging in the air. This weakness was what make raunchy humored movies like ""40 year-old virgin"" and ""Knocked up"" great. In the first one we had an Andy who is so shy about women and how slowly his friends begin breaking his fear. Then, when he begins a relationship, you have good build up were he fights his insecurities until finally he falls in love and marries the woman. In ""Knocked Up"", the guy transitions throughout the entire movie from a pot smoking bum, to a responsible and sensible husband and father. We see this transition and build up in both of these movies. But we don't see that in ""Pineapple Express"". They simply wake up to that for a few seconds and they seem to go back. A good comedy is not just having a lot of laughs. It needs to have a strong plot and key dramatic moments that this movie did not have. It was a joke from start to finish.<br/><br/>On the acting, the only good acting came from Seth Rogen. He seemed believable and worked. I was disappointed in James Franco. He was just to cartoonish. The antagonist were even worse, especially the two gangsters. They were too ridiculous and cartoonish. In the mentioned movies, even the secondary and tertiary and most ridiculous characters, did not go that far. Many even had their dramatic moments and had some depth and reasoning to their way of being. But in this movie, none of that existed.<br/><br/>So, I recommend the movie because it is very funny. However, don't expect it to be great or as in-depth as comedies of similar manner like the mentioned movies."

It kept the general atmosphere throughout and it never felt like there was an inappropriate break in the mood. It's a silly comedy with some sharp writing and some fighting scenes that manage to be funny and awesome all in one. It seemed reminiscent of Shaun of the Dead in that the main characters are normal guys who are thrown into an action movie. It's silly, but few of the characters seem very disconnected from reality.<br/><br/>I know Judd Apatow is gonna steal the credit for this one (he produced and helped write the story), but his director friend David Gordon Green did a good job. Seth Rogen keeps playing his funny character (It's nice in the 2000s that the leading man can be funny in comedies now) from Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin and that's a-OK for me. James Franco is great in a role that could have been terribly terribly annoying in someone else's shoes.<br/><br/>So all in all, a funny movie about weed and...funny things you do and say under the influence of it. It's refreshing to see a comedy without a ""grow up"" moral tied on. Because I don't know about you, but I go to comedies to laugh, not learn morals from them. The last 25 minutes have some violence (the movie was not looking for that 21-50 female demographic), but none of it disrupted the feel of the movie. I liked Pineapple Express better than Knocked Up and will probably buy the DVD.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Pineapple Express gets a B+"
"DonFishies","7","4","8","6 August 2008"," A great throwback to the 1980's buddy action flick
","After an impromptu, albeit hilarious, history lesson, Pineapple Express jumps into telling us the story of Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), a process server who loves to smoke marijuana at any time of day. His dealer, Saul (James Franco), is only happy to further provide him with his drug habit. On a routine call for his job, Dale witnesses a murder at the home of Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Having nowhere else to run, he turns to Saul, open to end up on the run from Jones' men.<br/><br/>After being disappointed with Step Brothers, I was not sure if I should really getting excited for Pineapple Express. It was from the master of comedy himself, Judd Apatow, and starred and was co-written by his golden boy, Rogen. It sounded like more of a sure thing, and for the most part, it turned out to be.<br/><br/>I was a little surprised, but for all the film is made out to be a stoner comedy, it is actually more in vein with a buddy action flick from the 1980's. There are explosions, gratuitous violence (a lot more than I ever could have expected), a car chase, fight scenes and plenty of one-liners. Some may write it off as a spoof of these flicks, but unlike the recent Apatow-driven Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Pineapple Express is its own near original idea. It embraces the conventions of the genre, and turns them on their head by making the two main characters potheads who are high off and on for most of the movie.<br/><br/>The sheer silliness of that idea is what makes the film work. The characters Rogen and Franco play are the complete opposite of any character we have seen in similar situations before. They talk and act frantic, and when it comes down to business, they look terrified taking part in any thing that happens. While the script does not seem to be as improvised as past Apatowian films, it seems to allow these two the freedom to make complete goofs of themselves but still seem serious enough to lead this kind of movie.<br/><br/>The script itself is not perfect by any means. It leaves a lot of loose ends, and packs itself down, leaving some supporting characters very little to do. Rather surprisingly, it does not offer the same amount of laughs as Step Brothers had either. Whether this is because some of the action set pieces are more thrilling than they are funny, or that the lines are not as ridiculously improvised left the film missing out is unclear. But fortunately, it does include an intriguing storyline that works as a cohesive whole, and ties together some key drug related themes, and even manages to include some morality too. It runs a little lengthy (as expected), and much of the added weight seems to be in the form of Rogen's scenes alongside his character's high school-aged girlfriend, Angie (Amber Heard). As good an idea as it is to include a love interest, she weighs the film down with exposition it did not need, and unfortunately underwrites the entire relationship. It affords the film some large laughs, but not at the same frequency as the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Relatively new director David Gordon Green has created a unique film for the growing canon of Apatowian films. On one hand, it feels like it could belong to the same family as Superbad, Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. But unlike those movies, it looks much different. Green gives the film a gritty look for its majority, and even at its brightest times, seems to make everything look washed out. He also has a habit of focusing on one character at a time, giving them the time to say what they need to, and moving on to the next person. It is never distracting, but it is obvious from the very beginning that someone with a different look and feel for things is behind the camera, as opposed to just an Apatow regular.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film is fairly solid.<br/><br/>Rogen and Franco are near perfect in their roles. Their chemistry is outstanding, and their franticness helps make the movie truly believable, even as it descends into being fairly random. While I knew that Rogen would be able to portray the role well, I was surprised by just how good Franco was. This is nothing I would have ever expected him in, and I doubt anyone else ever thought they would see him here. But he delivers an even better performance than he did in any Spider-Man film, and easily may be some of his best work to date. He gets the most laughs in the film, and going on sheer looks, it is not any wonder why.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, including Cole, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson and Rosie Perez are all great additions to the cast. While I would have liked a bit more exposition from Cole and Perez, the scenes they do have allow the film to have perfect 80's style villains, and fit right into the film's mould. Corrigan and Robinson, both having worked in Apatow films before, do very well for themselves here in extended roles. Their chemistry, while not as good as Rogen and Franco's, give the film another angle for viewing, and offer some pretty hilarious moments.<br/><br/>The real marvel here is Danny McBride. I was not a big fan of his, but he is downright hysterical here. He steals scenes from just about everyone, and actually makes his distinct brand of angered humour funny. I guess he just needed the right role, and this was it.<br/><br/>While it was not exactly what I was expecting, I can say that I did genuinely enjoy Pineapple Express. Its unique style sets it apart, and who could say no to a film with a theme song by Huey Lewis and the News? <br/><br/>7.5/10."
"akkoziol","9","6","14","6 October 2008"," Pot...I mean plot? What pot?
","It seems the toilet humor of the 80s and 90s is making a resounding comeback with guys like Seth Rogen at the helm. Certain no deep philosophical piece here folks but if you like the same dumb arse humor of Knocked Up and 40 Year Old virgin and his usual cadre of actor friends, you'll be happily rewarded by this one as well. It does seem that the stuff Rogen is in is only getting funnier and more over the top with each film so I do hope he keeps up his onslaught of dumb-guy meets serendipity at the corner of idiot friends street and insane situations avenue. It works just fine for me. Oh yeah, and the jokes and writing are over the top as well. Be careful not to be drinking your pop while watching as it may shoot out your nose."

","Of course ""Pineapple Express"" was an entertaining movie. How could it not have been? You take talented comic actors, one of whom has a fairly decent knack for writing dialog, throw in a seasoned producer and top it all off with a big budget, and voil√°! Mission accomplished. But honestly...I'm beginning to get a little tired of movies that aren't about anything more than their creators' love for the movies that preceded them. And you have to admit that's exactly what ""Pineapple Express"" is.<br/><br/>Imagine Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg sitting on Judd Apatow's couch watching action flicks for about eight or nine hours straight. Imagine the jokes they would tell each other while watching the movies, describing events that would make the scenes funnier and speaking in the voice of the characters. Take about an hour of jokes out of those eight or nine hours and tack them on to a boiler plate flick. Bingo, you've got the screenplay for ""Pineapple Express."" And I guess that's fine. But it's not special. ""Kill Bill"" was infinitely more inter-textual. ""The Big Lebowski""'s protagonist was even more hilariously ill-suited to the cinematic situation at hand. Kevin Smith's New Jersey chronicles re-contextualized classic mise en scenes in a much more sophisticated and often ironic way. ""Pineapple Express"" is a late arrival to the tired trend of movies idolizing and gently mocking other movies. And maybe that's a little unfair, given that Rogen wrote the script years earlier, but that's just how it goes.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I'm just sour. But I honestly think that we've hit the point where worshiping movies is, well, lame. It goes without saying that filmmakers are going to love other people's movies and that those movies will influence them both consciously and unconsciously, But we're making these kind of movies too quickly and too plentifully. Is this really the contribution we want to make? Where are the Charlie Kaufman? Where are the Hal Hartley's? Why can't we ""make it new?"" as Ezra Pound would say?"

","If your thinking that ""Pineapple Express"" is like ""Superbad or ""Knocked Up"" think again!. Even thought that the movie had some funny moments it doesn't live up to Seth Rogen's previous work. The script is poor and it sometimes it looks like it was rushed. Even the directing is poor and the editing looks like it was done on a laptop.<br/><br/>The characters are also poor, Seth Rogan should had cast himself for a different part instead of the main role. James Franco was average but not his best and Gary Cole should be shot for accepting a role like this. You get confused very quickly and not sure who's who.<br/><br/>The movie has got a lot of drug use and swearing it also has some very violent scenes with lots of blood. The movie loses stars for poor script, poor acting, poor directing and poor editing. It gets 5 stars for some of the funny moments in the film. Go and see this movie for yourself and make your own mind up about it. I thought the movie was very poor and only average. It doesn't share the same passion of Superbad or Knocked Up."
"serafinogm","9","2","3","21 January 2018"," An absurdist movie that is absurdly funny!
","You can't view this movie from a critical perspective, dissecting it for realism and walking away disappointed because it fell short in some way, it's nothing more than a adult cartoon. This movie is just pure unadulterated entertainment where characters are injured in ways that would have terminated their existence yet somehow, like Wile E Coyote, they survive (Danny McBride's character sustains multiple potentially fatal injuries)! A movie made to entertain and that is just good clean fun and which happily (from my perspective) showcases Amber Heard. Seth Rogan involves himself in movies that I want to watch simply because of his involvement and if James Franco, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride are in it then all the 
better. You need or want some light hearted fun sprinkled with barrel laughs then this is your vehicle!"

Amber Heard is much too beautiful for the part. That said, the only point in favor of this dumb movie is Amber Heard. Whenever she appears on the screen, there is hope for some story. Without her, just a bunch of fools scuttling about. Unfunny. These stoner guys, I'm sorry to tell the audience, look at it again, lead actor Seth Rogen isn't even convincing in his part.<br/><br/>Amber gets a high score from me, but the movie fares badly because of the down-class, mostly boring first half. And then the character with the most potential gets dropped from the script? I have only this to say: DRIVE ANGRY. Look at Amber.

","This film is just like other comedies from this crew but just like those this film is really solid and everything they touch is decent. This film sees a drug user Seth Rogen and his dealer James Franco attempting to escape from the powers above. Now Rogen and Franco are fantastic and their chemistry is great, Everything they touch turns to gold and they keep producing solid film after solid film. The Side characters are all solid Danny McBride as Red was funny when he was there and was a really funny supporting character. Rogen's girlfriend and the bad guys are all funny and solid and really bring something to the film. Now a real negative to the film is that of the story, there isn't really a coherent plot and side characters leave and arrive out of nowhere and it makes the film feel disjointed. The script is really good just like the other comedies by this group and each character seems to get their moment to shine. The style was decent but sometimes a bit ridiculous and over bloody which can be a critic on these films. Overall I enjoyed this film and I think this crew are doing some great work recently."
"stephen-scott83","8","2","3","20 February 2013"," cult classic that derails at the end
","Pineapple Express is one of my favorite cult comedies of all time. I would have given it a 10 rating if not for the terrible 2nd half gun battle which in my opinion took away the humor and light hearted approach that is simply amazing in the 1st half. I still love watching PE once or twice a month and probably will for a very long time. I think Danny McBride stole the show - his delivery and facial expressions is comic genius! The cast is amazing. The small parts like the jock in the school who say's ""time to suck today's dick"" to Dale is so outrageously funny, I fell off my chair when i heard that for the first time. My favorite scene is when Dale and Saul break the bathroom door down and Red slams his head on the porcelain sink that breaks off the wall with a simply slapstick ala Three Stooges sound effect - BRILLIANTLY FUNNY! I laughed and laughed and laughed at that scene for a long time. The scene were Dale shows up late, stoned, bloody and dirty to his girlfriends dinner with her parents is legendary. Ed Begley and Nora Dunn, who play the parents deliver 2 of the most memorable and side splitting lines, ""ARE YOU HIGH!!"" and ""YOUR HIGH AS A F**KING KITE!"" This scene will demand multiple viewings - it's that funny and jarring. I believe most first time viewers will view many scenes multiple times because of the pure genius in the delivery and vibe many scenes bring to the screen. The 2nd half of the film at the underground grow house seems as though a different person(s) wrote the rest of the script. The flow of the movie loses much of it's humor. I don't see much humor in people engaging in a automatic weapons gun battle. It's a shame the script should have been reworked and included more humor. Watch PE once and you will want to watch it again and again for the ridiculous funny scenes in the 1st half of this cult comedy classic."

","Pineapple express is a marijuana-based comedy starring Seth Rogan. The comedy follows Dale Denton(Seth Rogan), a pothead. Denton works as a process server and subpoenas people so he sometimes has to wear disguises to get people to admit that they are themselves. Denton is dating a high school girl and when a routine smoke/work session takes a turn for the worst he finds himself in a bit of trouble. The movie follows the adventure after this event and exposes the audience to numerous scenes in which Denton's and his drug dealer Saul's antics are hilarious! The production values of this movie seem pretty good especially since i watched it in blu ray 1080p and 5.1 surround sound. I think the camera angles the director uses are pretty good since there was never a point in the movie where I questioned why they were showing me something on camera. The movie is directed toward a younger audience that appreciates comedy. The movie is based on marijuana so one that is anti-marijuana may not appreciate it as much as one who enjoys or has a neutral position on marijuana. In conclusion the movie kept me laughing and on the edge of my seat. I've seen it over 20 times I will continue to watch it and I would definitely recommend this title to a friend."

However it's not just the story the comedy moments are poor, and I certainly wasn't laughing. It starts okay, if a bit slow, but the jokes just get more tedious as the film continues. Gary Cole is completely unconvincing as Ted Jones, and Rosie Perez is wasted in this role.<br/><br/>James Franco should stick to 'Spiderman' where he was excellent, here he overacts his part as the drug dealer/something pal of Seth Rogan's character.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","28 February 2018"," An above average stoner/crime comedy
","""Pineapple Express"" is one of those comedies where a regular guy gets swept up into a situation he can't handle simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Here, the regular guy is Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), a lowly process server who witnesses a murder. Soon, he finds himself on the run with his weed dealer (James Franco), who is also connected to the murder by association. Fleeing hitmen & corrupt police officers, the pair naturally proceed to get into various comedic situations throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>An important part of any comedy is the cast and this one's pretty good. Seth Rogen contributes a performance that's typical for him, which is all that's really needed here since he's a quintessential 'regular guy'. James Franco's performance is more idiosyncratic and resulted in a Golden Globe nomination. Personally, I give the edge to Franco but, most importantly, the two have good chemistry together. The supporting cast is nicely assembled as well, featuring very funny individuals like Danny McBride & Craig Robinson alongside seasoned vets like Gary Cole & Ed Begley Jr.<br/><br/>The story's an entertaining one, blending elements of stoner & crime comedies in a pretty novel way. The script was written by Rogen & Evan Goldberg, who'd previously collaborated a year earlier on the standout comedy ""Superbad"". They did a good job of blending action & comedy here, so that the movie feels loose at times but still has momentum. I'm not sure that it's really all that memorable of a plot in the end but it does consistently hold your attention once it gets going.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, ""Pineapple Express"" is well executed but not particularly exceptional. David Gordon Green's direction seems to be more focused on performance rather than crafting clever visuals, which is an approach that works well for the movie. The music generally doesn't stand out, either, though it was kind of cool for them to get Huey Lewis & the News to perform the theme song.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Pineapple Express"" may not be a comedy for the ages but it is a worthwhile comedy that doesn't just recycle cliches and situations from other, better movies. Given the premise, you might expect a lowbrow stoner comedy but the movie actually has a keen sense of humour that goes beyond mere silliness. While this brand of comedy still may not suit all tastes, I think that the movie will certainly appeal to fans of Rogen & Franco at the very least."

There are interesting ideas, but it's still mostly gags, many of which don't work very well.<br/><br/>The dynamics between the two main characters don't feel genuine. Sure, they're stoned all the time, but that shouldn't effect how they feel and you seeing it - it should only affect how they express their feelings. It's not enough for them to just say what they feel, because that's in the script, they should act like it.<br/><br/>Also, the end doesn't really tie loose ends, which is strange for a movie this long."

","Absurdly violent marijuana drug comedy about two dope-head losers (a process server and his goofy, easy-going dealer) who are on the run after Dale (Seth Rogan) sees cheeky drug-lord, Ted (Gary Cole) murder a rival drug dealer and heads to the abode of Saul (James Franco) wondering what to do considering what he seen. Ted has a cop girlfriend, Carol (Rose Perez), in with him, and they send out two gunmen (Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan) to take both Dale and Saul out. The film follows the duo's resistance to dying at the command of Ted and avoiding Carol (a dirty cop her peers are unaware of). Soon Dale and Saul meet up with fellow drug middle man, Red (Danny McBride, with a character that just won't die no manner how many times he's shot), and even Dale's own teenage girlfriend, Angie (hottie, Amber Heard, a joke the film plays to the hilt when she is compared to anti-hunk Rogen) and her family are endangered. You have two rival drug gangs (Cole and Koreans) getting involved in a blood feud, with Red finding himself unwittingly dragged into the misfortunes of Dale and Saul. Pot jokes abound and the violence is often so funny because it happens so clumsily and hap-hazardly. Rogen and Franco's chemistry has never been questioned and this film here seems to be their gold standard. A cast of great names turn up in small parts including Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn as Heard's bewildered and angered parents, puzzled at why their daughter would have anything to with Rogen. Cole, at this point, was having quite a career resurgence, adding this to his resume of comedy surprises like Office Space. This film is obscenely violent as drug wars have a tendency to be with the Rogen/Franco/McBride house-destroying slugfest and the climactic pot-underground decimation both prime examples using over-the-top displays of the damage that guns can do to the human body (what the characters don't do to themselves with whatever tools of violence can't be utilized such as a dirt devil, commode top, bong, fire extinguisher, and coffee pot). Startling still is the director of this film being David Gordon Green, known for his superior indie dramas like George Washington and All the Real Girls (and the underrated Undertow). The profanity, so consistent here, is very much a staple of Apatow comedies. The way the actors hurl themselves into their parts and letting it all go in the action is quite eyebrow-raising. Franco easily takes the film, though, I think, as I have always felt Rogen goes too overboard too often...Franco is the balance as McBride also is very much a Rogen comedy actor. How everyday characters find themselves in the crux of a bad situation produces the comedy results that makes this film work."

","A grown-up comedy disguised as an idiotic stoner teen vehicle, Judd Apatow's has struck cinematic gold once again with the hilarious, action-packed and surprisingly violent Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>Marijuana, a subject Apatow was not gun-shy about in Knocked Up and Superbad, has replaced sex as the catalyst for male shenanigans this time. Seasoned Apatow-ites James Franco, who previously helmed the brilliant ""Freaks and Geeks"" on the short-lived NBC show, and Seth Rogen play two stoner dudes on the run from the alpha-dog drug dealer (Gary Cole) in town, whom Rogen has just witnessed disposing of his competition. Rosie Perez plays his crooked cop with whom he shares a strange sexual tension- and some hilarious one-lines.<br/><br/>Like previous Apatows, there is more than meets the eye to this one. The man-child growth formula has been done to death, but the question Pineapple Express is interested in isn't what it means to be a man, but rather what it means to be a friend. Like Superbad, there is thinly veiled homo-erotic references and glances. In the end, these innuendos and implications a refreshing foil to the homo-phobic crap Hollywood usually serves up. As opposed to disguising a sort of perverted gay male fantasy, Pineapple Express secures its sexuality in these moments. It disputes the bottled-male assumption and instead isn't afraid to lovingly explore a blossoming friendship.<br/><br/>What makes a movie like Pineapple Express or Knocked Up grossly superior to contemporary, more formulaic studio comedies is more than a few funny lines and a good story. The risks in these movies simply would not have been taken in, say, The Love Guru or Meet Dave. How many comedies have you seen that feature a incredible five-minute fight scene, without soundtrack? For a moment, when Rogen's Dale and Franco's Saul meet their middle-man small-time drug procurer, you'll think you are watching something out of John Carpentar's They Live, the fighting is so brutal. The violence is surprising, and only slightly comedic. Feet are blown off, heads are smashed, people are defenselessly shot, and in one sequence, an ear is mangled so thoroughly that you'll find yourself humming ""Stuck in the Middle"" by Steeler's Wheels.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to have a talent like Judd Apatow who does not insult the intelligence of his audience. He knows they can go from action to drama to two guys smoking a bong and laughing at All in the Family without missing a beat. There are scenes in Apatow productions which exceed 5 minutes, unheard of in major comedies. Further, Pineapple Express thrives because there is a feeling of selflessness. The last scene is surely improvised, with the protagonists Rogen and Franco sitting with their drug-running friend in a diner, recapping and simply BSing the way people do. In most films, something like this would be left on the cutting floor; what's the use of re-hashing what we spent the last two hours watching? Ahhh but therein lies the rub. Pineapple Express isn't interested in Lessons Being Learned or Men Finally Growing Up. In the end, what it comes down to is two guys genuinely willing to do what it takes for the other, and I for one feel lucky to revel in their homo-erotic drug-induced homicidal escapades."

A running time of 85 or 90 minutes would have been perfectly sufficient for this subject matter, and would have kept the pace chugging along smoothly, and sustained the viewers' attention.

","Watch an overweight egomaniac shouting and quivering his way through a ridiculous stoner script that makes the Marx Brothers look light-handed and almost elegant! The Three Stooges used to make trash like Pineapple Express, but their pictures mercifully averaged about ten minutes. This horror lasts nearly two hours --- have Americans got nothing better to do? Why doesn't someone puncture the inflated reputations of Seth Rogan, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Judd Aparow and their ilk? Where on earth does the money come from for these kitsch celluloid monstrosities? Are they all financed by Ponzi schemes or drug racketeers? Pineapple Express is interstitial by-the-yard, made to fill up the space between commercials. It's the movie equivalent of junk food. All the ""laughs"" and ""jokes"" are imitations of the real thing and serve to validate the claim that Americans do not have a sense of humour, or at least one that reaches beyond the kindergarten. The giveaway in this picture is the obnoxious handling of the girl-friend role. She is casually cast aside and forgotten in a way that even the sexist movies of the 1950s would never have done. At least Cheech & Chong never had girl-friends, and Tommy Chong paid for his excesses with jail time --- something Seth Rogan will not be doing, I think."

","Pineapple Express is a funny stoner comedy with plenty of laughs thanks to the admirable performances of Seth Rogen (from Knocked Up and Superbad) and especially James Franco (from Spider-man and Flyboys). For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't say anything else about the movie except that I was impressed with Pineapple Express. I thought I wasn't going to like it but I thought it was a well made stoner buddy action comedy. It may not be no masterpiece but the movie does offer plenty of laughs with some action and chases thrown in for guilty pleasure. The scenes with Rogen and Franco together provide much of the comic relief as their two characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another while trying to avoid a dangerous drug dealer. No offense to Franco who I think is a good actor like Rogen. Some of his films may not have been that great but I never thought Franco could be some funny. Major props to him for playing Saul Silver who is one hilarious stoner/dealer. Well done. Rogen is funny too but Franco was a big surprise considering some of the movies he's been in like Spider-man, Flyboys, and the Great Raid to name few. The rest of the supporting cast turn in solid performances including Gary Cole, Danny McBride, Rosie Perez, Kevin Corrigan, and Amber Heard. The action in the movie can go over the top occasionally but is pretty well choreographed. The chase scene involving Rogen and Franco in a police car is hilarious. The strong language can be a bit much at times but overall Pineapple Express is a funny stoner comedy with some action thrown in that make for a good film to watch. If you're a fan of the genre or any of the actors then chances are you'll enjoy Pinapple Express. Better than expected."

To save him and get a moment of redemption, there is local dealer who provides him with daily dosage of weed, middle man who provides the local dealer.<br/><br/>As the time progresses, there are other elements in the movie, and killing of a character or person, is one hilarious job ¬ñ Cohen Brothers' movie. Just to describe you insanity a particular scene in the movie where Saw (James Franco) tries to kick the windshield of the police car while he is being chased and the car is in motion and to the astonishment of the character (and me) his leg gets stuck in the windshield and for quiet sometime, he is driving the car ¬ñ this was the most unusual car chase sequence.<br/><br/>The other scene where Seth (really high, on weed) goes meets girlfriends' parents for the first time only to announce that the side kick of the drug lord will be there any moment to capture her.<br/><br/>But I loved in the movie is spontaneity to surprise the audience like in the car chase sequence the guy actually stops the car, later realizing that the chasing car has stopped too, and starts shooting at them."

"GethinVanH","Null","4","9","24 October 2008"," Not smooth and mellow but angsty, angry and trippy.
","The first half hour of ""Pineapple Express"" was pretty good but then it turns into something completely different -- an action caper. At this point you could swear it was directed by Tarantino or something. Shooting people up and violence on top of violence isn't funny. This was more of a trippy comic caper than a laid back mellow stoner film. I will say the best part of the movie was James Franco playing a stoned drug dealer. He played the part beautifully. The excellent chemistry was thrown out the window once the characters picked up guns and started shooting people. Yes, it's very obvious that Rogen wrote this when he was a stoned teenager. It's not surprising then that those are the people who will most enjoy this film."

","I wasn't sure what this was going to be like at all before seeing it. I'd seen the clip with Franco's foot stuck through the car windscreen of course (it's about the only trailer bit I could remember) but that wasn't much preparation. I've not really seen a stoner movie before (not and ""understood"" what was going on, so to speak) so this was a revelation of sorts. I'm from England, yet I have no doubt that this film is dripping 80s (and possibly even 70s) US TV nostalgia, in a similar sort of way to Son of Rambow over here.<br/><br/>The characters are all slightly deranged, but the observation on their little idiosyncrasies are quite delightfully done. In the end, the film is mostly about the eternal friendship that seems to pervade the stone-head's ""psyche"" (such as it is) and its presentation is hilarious. For some reason I found the bit where ""Red"" shoots off one of the dead guys' feet with a shotgun, for no apparent reason of course.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of stoner's, obviously, stay away; if on the other hand you are, or you're not sure, this will probably amuse you a great deal!"
"Red_Flag","6","4","9","19 September 2008"," James Franco and Seth Rogan get the munchies.
","This, quite fortunately, just happens to be one of the lesser funny Appatow comedies. No I say that as a compliments rather than a criticism because there is so much more to this movie than you would first expect. There's so much more going on than you would expect in this film, the characters more complex and likable. Now that's not to say you won't get some hard laughs from it. But, honestly, there far and few between. The action is what sets it apart. It's done better and with a hell of a lot more substance than ""Hot Fuzz"" Though in all this is still an Appatow comedy so expect some pet hates to pop up. The crude nature, the hit and miss jokes and one of two out of place characters. None of which really makes an impact since the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is near perfect. They complement each other in the way that if one comedian is lagging the other will provide. And whilst director may overuse one them on several occasions usually it works a charm.<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed director David Gordon Green takes a break from the brooding drama that defined such early efforts as George Washington and Undertow for this action-flavored buddy comedy concerning two pot-smoking friends (Seth Rogen and James Franco) who unwittingly become involved with a vicious gang of drug dealers.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow and Shauna Robertson produce a script co-penned by star Rogen and Evan Goldberg. But as many critics have said, story is not Pineapple Expresses strongest point. It often zones out leaving gaps longing to be filled with absent humour. But when it gets into full swing it might just blow you mind. And while the humour seems somewhat sacrificed to make way for the (stunning) final action set piece it doesn't seem forced unlike ""Get Smart"" witch merely when for effect over substance. Here you get plenty of both.<br/><br/>Anybody who remembers Seth Rogan from ""Knocked Up"" will know how good this guy is at making us laugh, and yet still keeping his likability and charm at the top of the scale and while that's all good and well it's France (who looked genuinely stone) who really blows your mind. If you though this guy was good Good as the Green Goblin you really haven't seen anything yet. Before this I considered him a better than average actor who isn't given enough screen time to an actor who rivals Shia LaBeouf in likability.<br/><br/>VERDICT: It might not fall into anybody's top 100 comedies ever made but hell it falls into the top 10 Apatow comedy. It's great to see them get back on track what with the god-awful Step Brothers just beginning in to fade from memory. Here we have a hit and miss comedy, the hits come from the undoubtable chemistry, action and an end set piece that will blow your mind. The miss is in that I never laughed as much as I hoped. I was entertained and was smiling but the laughs are far and few between. These complaints won't stop the film inevitably entertaining you from start till end."
"kevin_crighton","4","4","9","14 September 2008"," Disappointing and surprisingly unfunny movie
","Superbad was one of the funniest movies in the last year. It was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It was also produced by Judd Apatow, who made Knocked Up, another funny comedy. So why is it that Pineapple Express is such a disappointment? Dale Denton is a process server. He also likes to smoke weed. After visiting his dealer Saul, he goes to serve a guy called Ted Jones. As he gets there however, he witnesses Jones and a female cop kill a man. Getting away he is spotted and due to smoking a joint at the scene, Jones (also a supplier of drugs) discovers what kind it is (the Pineapple Express of the title), and knowing who supplies it begins a hunt for Denton. Meanwhile Denton has gone on the run, taking Saul with him, and a friendship grows between them.....<br/><br/>The actors in the movie are fine, but this is a movie dominated by two performances. Rogen as Denton gives a performance very much like the one he gave in Knocked Up. But the real star here is James Franco as Saul. Almost unrecognizable, and looking very similar to the way Brad Pitt looked in True Romance, it's a very good performance, and the standout here. The relationship that grows between the two men as the story plays out is well handled.<br/><br/>But what lets the movie down is the script. It's simply not that funny. And there are a couple of story points that just seem wrong somehow. First up Denton and his high school girlfriend. Where in Knocked Up the idea of an unattractive man having a drunken night of passion with a beautiful woman worked, and was funny, here it just seems wrong.<br/><br/>The other idea that doesn't quite work is that we are meant to root for these guys through-out the movie, but as characters, they aren't really that likable. Had the writing been funnier that might have been different, but as it is you simply don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>There is a black and white sequence at the beginning of the movie, that serves no purpose, except to set up a location for the climatic shoot-out. If there was another purpose for it, I certainly missed it.<br/><br/>The director of the movie David Gordon Green, does well with the material, allowing the cast to give good performances, and he stages the action pretty well.<br/><br/>As a comedy it's unfunny, as an action movie it's not exciting enough, and all you are left with are a bunch of good performance needing a better story and script.<br/><br/>As I said, Rogen and Goldberg wrote Superbad, which was very funny. Based on this however, I'm hoping that it wasn't a one off."

The third dope fiend called Red can't & doesn't act at all. I wanted to like this movie - I liked Superbad & Knocked Up but this was too cartoonish - the action sequences were too unrealistic. Red gets shot several times & he is still alive at the end of the movie. I loved seeing Rosie Perez & Gary Cole as the bad guys but they didn't have much to do. As I said the only socially redeeming quality of this movie is James Franco's acting. This might be one of those movies where the DVD with all it's extra features might be better than the movie itself."

Like any other fantastic weed flick, like Up In Smoke, Next Movie, or Half Baked, these are films you want to be high when watching. It's a movie like Pineapple Express that can make an ex-smoker become a smoker again.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen's character accidentally witnesses a murder. He seeks shelter with his dealer, who is James Franco's character. They're on the run, paranoid to extreme levels and completely high the entire time. So obviously funny sh!t is going down almost nonstop. Throw in some action (tons at the end), memorable supporting cast (the black dude from the Office is very good here), loads of smoking and a top heavy Rosie Perez (and if she showed her boobs, this would have been an INSTANT classic), you have yourself a very entertaining flick.<br/><br/>I do have to say though, there is one star in this movie that completely shines brighter than the rest. James Franco was friggin great in this flick. It was by far one of the most likable characters I've ever seen on film. Just a silly, genuine performance. I'm not sure how good this flick would have been if he wasn't casted in it. Nevertheless he was and he made it awesome.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express, if you don't know is the name of the weed they smoke in the flick.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","4","9","12 August 2008"," Funny, but Apatow's most memorable film? Not really
","I work at a movie theater and we got Pineapple Express, to be honest with it's R rating, I was expecting as big of a turn out as we had, one thing that I noticed was the crowd though, how similar they looked, also their behavior was the same as well. It was kind of disturbing, but they came out of the movie theater screaming in laughter, now I'm assuming they are pot heads, no offense to those who are, but I was still curious if this movie was seriously funny to those who were either stoned or not stoned. I saw this movie, of course I'm not a pot head, so I saw it sober, thought this was a very funny movie, but I wasn't too impressed. I know I'm going to get a lot of haters for this comment, but seriously, there wasn't anything too special about this movie that would make it stand out as a stoner comedy, not to mention a production of the Apatow group, the story has no likable characters and is pretty predictable.<br/><br/>Dale Denton is a process server, he is 25 years old, has an 18 year old girlfriend in high school, and is a pot head. After witnessing a murder, Dale runs to his pot dealer, Saul, who unknowingly is connected to the murder in some way. But Saul helps Dale try to escape the murderers who are after him, discovering how they have already gotten to his drug dealer and are easily getting closer to him and Dale. Together they try to out run and figure a way to get out of this situation with good old fashioned Commando style action.<br/><br/>Now I don't want people to get me wrong, this is still a very funny comedy, has some really great moments like any other Apatow production. I seriously could not stop laughing when Saul was driving with Dale trying to escape the police and he can't see through the windshield, so Dale suggests to be like the action movie scenario where they normally push out the window like it's nothing, and instead Saul gets his foot caught in the window while driving. There are some other really good moments, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. Pineapple Express is worth the look for sure, but it didn't really stand out for me like other comedies. I just think the hype is giving this movie too much credit, I'd say pay for the matin√©e.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Chris Knipp","7","4","9","7 August 2008"," Not just another stoner movie; just another stoner movie
","You could say this is not just another stoner movie but lately none of them are. Gregg Araki's recent Smiley Face had a fresh indie angle with its keen observations from a girl stoner's point of view. The new Harold and Kumar went political and ever more limits-pushing-ly gross. Well, for Pineapple Express, the Apatow group has hired regional indie director David Gordon Green, raring to try new genres. They've taken stoner action not to Guantanamo but rival criminal gangs, high above local pot dealer and customer--the story's starting point--into mayhem and violence.<br/><br/>But starting point is ending point and the violence seems incongruous. It's still not clear anything matters but dealer and customer. Pineapple is first and foremost a good-natured buddy picture, with those two the bud-buds. If the action reflects how a high might go terribly wrong, the guys seem to show good and bad, laid-back and uptight, responses to a cannabis high, both leading well away from material success, yet confirming friendship. To the two Freaks and Geeks alumni, Seth Rogen and James Franco (Rogen was a leading Geek and Franco was the number one Freak), is added the amiable Danny R. McBride, who started out as an actor in Green's All the Real Girls but transitioned to Apatow-world via the down-market school comedy, Drillbit Taylor. The proceedings are enriched by Green's knack for developing character in depth and lingering on good offbeat dialog. As always in the Apatow productions, best buddies are front and center, but after trying musical satire in Walk Hard last year, Apatow has directed things--paradoxically for stoners, who tend to sit around and then sit around some more--toward violent (if bumbling and offbeat) action.<br/><br/>The climax is a shootout in a gang's ganja factory. Seeking revenge, a malevolent team of ninja-clad Asians battles it out with the boys and local drug lord Ted Jones's mob with automatic weapons. Prior to that, more homely weaponry has been adopted, including vacuum cleaners and coffee pots. The m√™l√©e causes the torching of masses of primo bud plants--a moment that should bring tears to any cannabis fancier's eyes--and wipes out the set in a very pretty explosion. But the d√©nouement mellows out again with breakfast at a diner where the three main guys declare undying friendship.<br/><br/>Freaks and Geeks, which was about high school misfits, died after a season; so did the Apatow first-year college TV series, Undeclared. At that time, asked how his series on the next stage of life might be entitled, Apatow suggested: ""Unemployed?"" Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process-server--not much of a job. He has one foot in high school; his girlfriend is still a student. When he goes there and sees her male friends, they're incredibly handsome, muscular guys who're funny and he feels like a loser. He wears a shlubby suit, but changes into costumes to sneak up on the people he subpoenas. Dale is a pothead, and so he has a close relationship with his current dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco)--a classic X-ed-out-eyed, smiley-faced, hippie-clad, greasy charmer whose greetings are ""Peace out,"" and ""One world,"" and who is his own best customer.<br/><br/>Nothing quite equals Rogen and Franco's ad-libbing conversation in their first on-screen meeting, before the troubles start, at Saul's ornately shabby apartment, whose ""security"" consists of a buzzer and voice speaker such as flats all had in the Thirties. This is when Saul introduces Dale to the new strain of weed called Pineapple Express. The name refers to some kind of Hawaiian tropical storm that allegedly blends plant and dirt in some magical way producing super-bud. It's a new item on the menu, and Dale is the first to get it. So when he sees a gang wipe-out of what turns out to be an Asian rival at the house of Saul's distributor Ted Jones (TV vet Gary Cole) and flees leaving a Pineapple Express roach on the ground while trashing two cars with his rent-a-heap, he's drawn attention to himself and left a lethal calling card.<br/><br/>Franco's blissed-out charm as Saul, an understated blend of goofy and sexy, is a triumph. His droll performance, never failing to serve the action and the other cast members, anchors events and is the best thing in the movie. He and Rogen play off each other nicely, and for five golden minutes or so in their first scene together, the action is blissful and spells out in miniature all that is wonderful and all that is useless about stoner buddy-hood. Not long after, in contrasting Dale's nervousness with Saul's laid-back-ness, Rogen begins to ramp things up more than necessary, and the whole stoner vibe gets submerged in insane panic.<br/><br/>Don't ask me why after he sees the killing Dale has to rush back to Saul; stoner logic maybe. Buddy picture logic certainly. From then on they're on the lam together, with on-and-off meetings with Red (Danny R. McBride), Saul's middle man with whom the two fugitives, buddies now, develop a love-hate relationship that winds up ultimately in love.<br/><br/>What's wrong with all this, obviously, is that gunfights aren't actually very funny, though the filmmakers soften the intensity by having Red appear invulnerable. He gets shot twice in the torso and some time later is still sitting up, bloody but unbowed, at the breakfast table. That helps convey a sense that stuff isn't too serious. But those flying ninjas, even if funny, are from a different picture. Ted Jones's conspiratorial bond with a crooked lady cop (Rosie Perez) is strange and unappetizing. But on the other hand, if anybody can handle all this, it may be David Gordon Green. Still, as stoner movies go, this is a mixed success. Only the buddy moments and Franco's wacked-out charisma make it worthwhile. But Saul is a keeper. Primo."

It's was vulgar, violent, and nasty in every way - but I didn't hold a straight face for more than 20 seconds straight. It was a feel good movie in a a way you've never, ever felt before. Seth Rogan will entertain more than just punch-drunk high school Superbad fans with this one. And James Franco - WOW! He should seriously consider more comedy roles. His timing and expressions are beyond perfect (wonder how into his character he got?! Lol). Definitely the BEST ten bucks I've ever spent. If you go see it, I promise we'll be B.F.F.F.'s (Best f**king friends forever!)"
"fattehboi","9","4","9","6 August 2008"," Pineapple Express Smokes Away The Competition - A Truly Classic Stoner Flick
","First off, Seth Rogen and James Franco do an unbelievable job as two immature stoner's on a journey to fend for their lives. This movie had all the potheads in the theater cracking up from start to finish, and I must say, not going stoned, I kind of regret it.<br/><br/>The highschool girlfriend, the fight scenes, the snarky remarks from the people who just blatantly murder anyone who their boss says to pop, and all the other scenes are just priceless. ( Ex: The cell phone scene)<br/><br/>It has the usually Superbad, Knocked, 40 Year Old Virgin humor that we all love to watch, and it has a few recycled actors from the previous films in it, so that was a definite plus.<br/><br/>This movie starts off right away as a comedy and has you guessing what Dale does for a living, but through one mind-boggling incident a very compelling action thriller develops that redfines cinema. This is a definite recommendation for anyone who enjoyed the previous films I listed AND/OR anyone who has an occasional joint here and there.<br/><br/>""FUCK THE POLICE!"""
"unscripted1","8","4","9","5 August 2008"," Apatow's Humor Grows Up
","Going into this film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. What I got was something much closer to a traditional Apatow production than I had expected. Not to say that this newest installment, which is the absolute epitome of ""bromance"", isn't good; in fact it's the most mature form of the Apatow crew's comedy to date.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively basic, and since the plot isn't the highlight of this movie, it really plays a back-burner to the two main characters. Seth Rogen returns to play just about every character he always plays, but with even more of a loser-esquire edge. What I appreciated most about his character is that he's basically content with his station in life. He's middle-aged, he serves legal documents for a living, and he has (trying to avoid spoilers) a ""unique"" girlfriend. For once, we get a guy who has a bad life, but instead of changing all that, he instead accepts it and tries to make the most of it. The key to this character's acceptance is pot.<br/><br/>While weed could arguably be a character in and of itself, this movie still lingers away from your traditional stoner comedy and instead lends itself more to the likes of Cheech and Chong. Sure, this movie involves pot smoking and is probably enjoyable while high, but non-stoners (like myself) take just as much (if not more) from the developing relationships and quick-wit humor.<br/><br/>James Franco rejoins his Freaks & Geeks crew and really stands out for me as the best performance of this film. We no longer see the clean-cut , rich character he so often is type-cast into and we get to see a mellow drug dealer with a heart. I think that's what Franco was able to give to this role that made me enjoy it so much: that no matter what he does, in the core of his character he's trying to be a genuinely nice and caring person.<br/><br/>From all the directions this review has gone, it's hard to figure out how this could all be wound together into a good movie, and a comedy no less! To my surprise, it does. The film develops without a lack of pacing and you are always laughing out loud. My only complaint is that this focuses just a little too much (dare I say ""overkill"") on ""bros"". Apatow is always known for ""bromances"", but he almost takes it too far in this installment with such terms as ""bromosexual"", obvious double meanings for sexual behavior, and I think the term ""bros before hoes"" is used nearly five times. Knowing how the traditional ""bromance"" works with Apatow helps explain some of the more interesting circumstances with female love interests. At times I almost wondered why a character would be doing what he's doing for a girl when in the next scene he's completely standoffish with her over a much less important issue.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a fun and enjoyable film that will be the perfect summer comedy to finish off a strong season. I really enjoyed it, even though I feel it went a little over the top with ""bros"" (in fact, I'm getting tired of using the term as we speak). If you like Apatow or smart comedies (ie: Snatch), this is the movie for you."

","Well, it in't MIDNIGHT EXPRESS.<br/><br/>Welcome to the new edge of comedy. <br/><br/>There's something very brave about Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films - how they eschew Hollywood protocol and make their leading men (their male leads) each other's love interest! Not gay. Love, you prurient, fundamentalist bigots. Two men who can swear eternal love for each other and not come off homo. But bromo.<br/><br/>Is PINEAPPLE EXPRESS just another ""bromance"": two immature boy-stoners who can't forge a ""real"" relationship with a female, so run around holding hands, on the lam from drug dealers? Well, the ""bromosexual"" tag (although hilarious) doesn't do this film justice; like many Apatow films, EXPRESS takes the brave stance of relegating what is considered the driving force in most movies - female approbation - to the sidelines. <br/><br/>Amber Heard plays Seth Rogen's nominal girlfriend, a smokin' female ""lead,"" but when she disappears during the second act and we never hear from her again - we don't miss her!<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is stoner action hero, Dale, with James Franco as Saul, his airheaded dealer. Dale is process serving one day, smoking a Pineapple Express (which he just bought from Saul, who describes it as ""almost a shame to smoke it. It's like killing a unicorn""), when he witnesses a murder. Freaked out, Dale loses the joint in front of the murderer's house and lams it back to Saul's place. The murderer (Gary Cole, in cahoots with Rosie Perez, who seems kinda old to be here) happens to know Pineapple Express and who deals it - Plot Convenience Community Theater, here we come! So begins the pursuit of Dale and Saul by the murderer's henchman, Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson. <br/><br/>They are joined by an Eastern-philosophizing mindless loser named Red (Danny ""thug life!"" McBride, who may actually be the first to coin ""bromosexual"" in the film itself). <br/><br/>Another feature of Apatow films is their simple dialog, which avoids the tired comedic punchliner mode and turns up at our door dressed in street cred and drinking a beer, burping in our faces: Saul exclaims at one point, ""Holy cock!""; and as he is dragged towards a manhole, ""What's down there? A rancor?"" (RETURN OF THE JEDI, of course); when Dale is confronted by his girlfriend's screaming father (Ed Begley Jr.), ""You assholes do exactly as I say, or I will take you outside and f*** you in the street!"" he pleads, ""No! Don't f*** us anywhere!""; Dale describes reincarnation to Red, ""If you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach or a worm or a f***in' anal bead, okay? If you're a man and you act heroic, you'll come back as an eagle; you'll come back as a dragon; you'll come back as Jude Law, okay? Which would you rather be?"" to which Red replies, ""Maybe the anal bead, depending on who it belongs to."" There's much more - but that's why the movie is made...<br/><br/>Rogen does well to hold his own against the ""serious actor,"" Franco, and Franco holds his own as a comedy force against the improv gung-ho of Rogen. <br/><br/>Judd Apatow's advice on writing comedy: ""Don't worry about making the first draft funny. The movie is going to be funny regardless because we'll cast it with the funniest people around. But for people to stick with it for an hour and a half, it's a drama. A story people can relate to and are interested in following through."" <br/><br/>I think that's why Apatow is so successful with his formula - because audiences have had enough of the ""Women Be Everything"" mode of storytelling. However, pondering Apatow's formula, we realize it isn't so new and unique - just updated. <br/><br/>Remember Laurel and Hardy? Or Martin and Lewis? Two-man teams (or should that be two ""Man-Teams""?) where it didn't matter if they got the girls or not - their arcs involved the dissolution of their partnership and subsequent reconciliation. Women were simply props to acquire, not the central point of existence; the comedy was never centered on how pussy-whipped the men could possibly make themselves before movie's end...<br/><br/>And what about the New Bromantics?: Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan...<br/><br/>Apatow and Rogen.<br/><br/>---Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","I can't keep track of who leads what trends in humor. It is too centered on the notion of celebrity for me, and has the negative of separating humor from who provides it. If I focus on Apatow or whoever, I drift from what matters.<br/><br/>Laughter has to be the most puzzling dimension of being human, the most human and the strangest. Almost everything else, you can both experience and talk about, but humor has to simply be experienced. Other than notions of small surprise, one can't did much deeper. <br/><br/>I found this very funny. In terms laughing out loud it ranks the highest in recent memory. <br/><br/>The spine is ordinary, and I believe that is necessary: it is a buddy movie ‚Äî a guy thing. The story is ordinary: chased by determined bad guys because of ""what they know."" The advertisement of the kind of humor to expect is also familiar: stoner humor, dumb guys. Other ordinary stereotypes are distributed throughout. Because we know these things so well, there is a ready warehouse of concepts to be easily pulled up as props for jokes.<br/><br/>I think the humor has nothing at all to do with any of these things though. In fact, I'll say that none of the appeal in other dimensions does either. Its all in the writing. The writers could depend on the formula to move the thing from beginning to end and simply focus on the small ‚Äî chunks of about two or three minutes. <br/><br/>If all you have to worry about is being funny; if you are a talented writer who doesn't have to worry about whether the garment will serve a lifetime, you can focus on each button. Watching this a second time, one can see the texture in the words. This is like early Woody Allen where it would have been just as funny as a book, or a radio show. Its the words. Its the structure of the phrases. Its the pattern of knots in each phrase, one after another.<br/><br/>Consider even the name of the thing. The name is applied to a gourmet pot with care. The chief dope dealer has as his only skill the ability to name the different brands. The consumers (our buddies) talk about the ancestry of the name in a this-begat-that way, of multiple inheritance and reference. See, I've already exceeded the threshold of useful talking about why things are funny. So let's back up: this is stoner movie with no boobs, no sex at all. The only woman in the thing is loved because she ""talks funny.""<br/><br/>See it. Good, tight writing, all of it locally scoped.<br/><br/>Oh, there is one structural element. It starts with a preface, a historical piece: Army experiments with pot. <br/><br/>This actually happened. Inspired by legends of hashish creating effective ""assassins"" military leaders thought doped up GIs would become killing machines. A Sgt Rock type general is disgusted by the results and has the experiments closed down. The location is a secret underground laboratory accessible by a disguised hatch in a field.<br/><br/>This same location features in the main story. It is now an underground lab where new strains of pot are developed and grown.

"brendon-kenny","7","4","10","11 November 2008"," 'Pineapple Express' aims to do for stoner movies what 'Superbad' did for the gross-out coming of age comedy...
","*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***<br/><br/>The latest comedy from Judd Apatow's crowd, 'Pineapple Express' aims to do for stoner movies what 'Superbad' did for the gross-out coming of age comedy, what 'Knocked-up' did for the Rom-Com and what 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' did for um¬Övirgins? <br/><br/>Seth Rogen once again adopts the likable loser persona that made him so endearing in 'Knocked-Up' and 'the 40 Year Old Virgin', only here he's taking great pleasure in using a variety of disguises to serve legal writs to evasive lawbreakers. Overall, he's pretty content with his lot, fuelled by a genuine pride in his work and copious quantities of marijuana. After partaking in an extremely rare, potent form of the drug, (the Pineapple Express of the title) he witnesses a murder by a notorious drug dealer (Gary Cole) and crooked policewoman (Rosie Perez). He panics and runs to the nearest place of refuge ¬ñ the apartment of his dealer, a greasy pothead played by James Franco. Cue increasingly silly stoner adventures as the two are pursued by machine gun-wielding dope dealers. <br/><br/>If it all sounds rather daft, then that's because it is. Though rather than the mindless 'Dude, Where's my Car?' approach to stoner humour, writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have worked hard to ensure that the film has madcap set-pieces, emotion, intelligence, and of course, plenty of witty banter, though the context of their conversations are considerably more far-fetched than their previous collaborations. There's also a surprising amount of crunching violence, a telltale sign that director David Gordon Green ('Undertow', 'Snow Angels') may have a hankering for a big budget action movie. He turns many a traditional action convention on its head, but based on the execution his wish is likely to come true. <br/><br/>The film manages to traverse several genres whilst maintaining a consistent tone and escalating the laughs as the plot progresses. The blossoming friendship between Rogen's cuddly honey monster and Franco's dewy-eyed dealer (who only sells drugs to pay for his Grandmother's plush retirement home), form the heart and soul of the movie and this makes for a much more wholesome experience than other films of the stoner genre, and as such, it should appeal to a much broader audience. Their ""bro's not hoes"" mantra, reckless loyalty and shared love for weed form a love story arc of male bonding which is sweet¬Ö but verging on homo-eroticism. In 'Superbad' the age of the characters accounted for a degree of vulnerability, and whilst the same level of empathy is difficult to elicit when the character's emotional states are largely drug induced, it's impossible not to root for the hapless heroes. <br/><br/>There aren't many films that can boast that 'Ha! You've just been killed by a Daewoo Lanos!', and this original flavour may, in time, help the film to achieve cult classic status. Until then, Pineapple Express is a potent blend of giggle inducing lightweight entertainment that has enough of a kick to appeal to more than just stoners and Apatow addicts."
"kovalchukyou","5","24","100","25 July 2008"," Same tired gag
","I have to disagree with the posters who commented on this movie so far. Seth Rogen simply can not handle the lead role in a movie with his limited acting ability. It worked with Knocked up because no one was too familiar with him. His single role persona his perfect for supporting roles such as in 40 year old virgin or Superbad, but not this time. His screen writing has been consistently above average over the years and it continues in Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are only so many pot jokes and the rest of the humor in this movie, along with the plot, is predictable. Of course the plot is going to be predictable--I did not expect too much there, but the immaturity of some jokes does not make me smile.<br/><br/>James Franco tries to resurrect his career after sinking in Annapolis. He does a pretty decent job, but I do not find him to be funny. For example, I do not think sticking your thumb out of your fly is humorous. The predictable plot makes the 1 hour 50 minute running time see superfluous. This flaw was also apparent in Knocked Up.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan seems to be headed for the same path as fellow funny men Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler. Make a few good movies and then just repeat the same gags and jokes to score at the box office."

All the elements might seem to be there to have a great time, but it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes are used several times in the movie. When you see it the first time, you might smile inside if you're stoned or have an IQ of 70, but the following times, you tend to see the joke coming.<br/><br/>Some of the characters are believable and well thought out, but some of the characters like the criminals, have sides to them, that are out of character. The problem is that they aren't wacky enough to be funny, so they end up just being out of character instead.<br/><br/>The movie seems like something a group of teens decided to make for fun and not something you would expect from professional movie makers.<br/><br/>I usually like Seth Rogens work, but when you pair him with a group of actors, that never seem to make a decent movie, they cast a shadow of incompetence and amateurism over him, that he can't get out off.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie unless you like the equally crappy scary movie series. If you do, you might giggle a few times, but I didn't."

","Apologies to all who thought this movie was at all funny. I can usually rely on my fellow movie freaks here at IMDb but this time they really let me down. The only way this film could have worked would be to jump in the old time machine, jump back 25 years, recast this movie with Cheech and Chong and start over. In its current incarnation there is nothing particularly funny here. Some action? Yes. Humor? Didn't happen for me or anyone in the group I watched this waste of celluloid with. Seth, please stick to the romantic comedies, Zack and Miri make a Porno: very funny. Forgetting Sarah Marshal? Hilarious. Getting back to to this piece of garbage if it was honestly described it probably wouldn't have captured much of an audience at all, sorry but this stoner humor isn't funny unless you are more tanked than the guys on the screen. Hummmmm, maybe that is the demographic and they just forgot to mention that in the commercials! So to all who thought this was funny, please be sober next time you refer something here or at least fully describe your altered stated as a warning to others reading your comments, so we may use the proper filters for your thoughts."
"chubbs_peterson","4","8","27","10 August 2008"," Pineapple Express Kills the Buzz
","I enjoyed the trailers and went into this movie expecting to laugh. I've seen a couple other Seth Rogen movies and thought they were pretty good. But for Pineapple Express, the thirteen year old kids a few rows in front of us were the perfect audience. I don't know if it's because I'm out of college and in my mid-twenties, but the buzz wore off fast for me.<br/><br/>This movie has to be the longest stoner flick ever made. It gets boring. Basically they get high and into stoner movie situations, such as getting paranoid in the woods, into impossible cop chases, smoking pot with a bunch of grade school kids, smoking ""tripod"" joints, shooting ninjas, and ha, even making dick jokes. Get ready for two hours of this type of stuff.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays the same lovable loser from any other film he's in. He is a likable guy with cute little sayings (B.F.F.F) and references to gross things like poop or sex toys which are forced and intended to shock people into laughing. He plays a guy who dates a high schooler, smokes pot before going to his job of serving warrants, but I did feel some compassion for his character and liked him.<br/><br/>James Franco plays one of the least believable drug dealers. Get this, he even has the stoner dipsh*t ""dialect,"" the kind a tie-dye shirt wearing suburban kid who has never seen pot outside of a computer screen may use. I was immediately turned off to the movie because because Franco acts like a stoner is supposed to act, and ends up not looking like a stoner. Franco effectively kills the buzz.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film is Danny McBride. He's an overweight ""middleman"" between Rogan and Franco who wears kimonos and bakes cakes for his dead cats. He promises to not tell the drug dealers where you are, but when they show up he tells them before they even ask. He drives a tiny Daewoo. The movie would've been funnier with this guy as the dealer and cutting Franco out of the movie altogether. But with the high-fiving victory over drug-dealing murderers and ninjas, I suppose it would have seemed weird to only have two good guys.<br/><br/>I know it's intentionally exaggerated, but only the best jokes are about as funny as a home video clip of a dad getting hit in the genitals by his son swinging a baseball bat. Some might consider Seth Rogan and the actors with whom he often works into becoming the next Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, or Steve Martin, but they've got a lot of work to do before that happens. In the meantime between now and when Pineapple Express is released on DVD, save your money and re-watch Half Baked."

","Pineapple Express is the kind of movie you show students to make sure they never do drugs. Its frequency with the popular green plant seems to overtake the entirety of the film. You may get a few cheap laughs throughout the film, but it's never in good taste. I've seen this film once, and I promise that will be the last. While Seth Rogan and James Fraco are admirable actors, they must have been hurting for screen time when they signed the contract to do Pineapple Express. I could never find the main focus point of the film. Surely no one would direct a film solely on smoking pot and expect to receive positive feedback. If you're a stoner you will most definitely enjoy this film, but who am I kidding. No one that uses marijuana will probably even read this."

"theskulI42","9","3","7","11 August 2008"," Giggly Ganja Glory
","2008 as a cinematic entity for this cinema viewer has been a been of a wash: a tidal wave of heavy sighs, restless shifts and paragraph after paragraph of vitriolic, disappointed criticism. My film partners and providers, my father and stepmother usually leave the theater feeling pleasant and entertained, while I emerge walking a bit more briskly because it was way too long, it was way too obvious, and I wanted to like it but, damnit, it just wasn't any good!! Pineapple Express opens with a dumb, obvious and unnecessary flashback starring Bill Hader, about the initial reasoning behind criminalizing marijuana, and those fears, that it would be just like the rest began to bubble up.<br/><br/>Then, the opening credits began to roll.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that there is anything genuinely funny in the entirety of Pineapple Express, and yet...for the life of me, I could not stop giggling. From the opening server montage up until about the necessary break-up scene, there were some concerns that I wasn't going to get enough oxygen to my brain, because I just didn't have TIME to breathe. The film follows a stoner process server (Seth Rogen) who, after witnessing a murder committed by a cop (Rosie Perez) and his dealer's dealer's dealer (Gary Cole), flees with his dealer (James Franco). Well, sort of. There are, of course, a flurry of unseen complications, almost wholly because they're completely baked. (The only reason they are tracked down is because they are literally the only men in town with a certain insanely potent strand of the sticky called ""Pineapple Express"".) My first question is, how the hell did David Gordon Green get involved in this? The director of ornate, somber and critically respected dramas like George Washington, All the Real Girls, Undertow and Snow Angels is the man that lensed this modern day stoner opus. I have to believe he's a partaker, that can be the only explanation, and I'd gladly welcome him to that brotherhood (of which I am but an honorary member; I smoked a few times in 7th grade, it had no effect on me, so I never did it again, yet people think I'm stoned all the time anyway, so I've deduced that it comes naturally to me. ) As for his direction, the film's more action-based aspirations makes this an absolutely essential addition to the squad; his hand is sure and makes scenes that could have been laughably inept, into believable and brutally hilarious bits of fight choreography.<br/><br/>This is not to say that these are tight, concise action sequences that will thrill and amaze you. Much of the film after the first hour is rambling, halfway incoherent and goes on way too long, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Considering the accomplished nature of its director, I have to believe this was deliberate. A buzz doesn't last forever, and you can feel the film coming down. Sometimes reality can come in and blow your buzz, especially if it comes with automatic weaponry, and the film reflects that to a 'T'. Every scene comes with an improvisational, wandering, incoherent and above all utterly BLOWN vibe to it, which impressed me with its accuracy and realism.<br/><br/>Of course, considering its star, the film should have no trouble with inebriated realism. While John Cho or Kal Penn may very well enjoy puffing on the cheeba, the Harold & Kumar series very much feels like the studio IDEA of what a stoner film should like like. As for PE, Seth Rogen is THC's most prominent cheerleader, and the substance's influence colors every frame of the film. I assume they saved money on an acting coach for James Franco, as he presumably had everything he needed right in front of him. For the rest of the cast, this looked like a fun set, filled with friends, buddies, That Guys and That Girls. I have a feeling Danny McBride just plays himself in every movie. Gary Cole gives his all despite his underdeveloped character, as the entire cast, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson, Rosie Perez, Ed Begley Jr., Nora Dunn, from top to bottom, a set I just would love to be on. I saw the adorable Amber Heard in the plodding crapfest Never Back Down earlier this week, and it's refreshing to see this charming little lady in a good film, even if her role resembles nothing more than a plot prop.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm just relishing the opportunity to not be the party-pooper in the theater, as I have seemingly disagreed with Everybody on Everything this year, with me always in the negative. It's my birthday on Monday, let my dad be the hater for once. I realize this review is rambling, halfway incoherent and goes on way too long, so I'm just gonna go ahead and claim that its structure is as deliberately ragged as the film's. I had a blast, I'm rockin' out, and...oh dear...I appear to have gotten my foot stuck in the windshield.<br/><br/>{Grade: 8.5/10 (B+) / #2 (of 63) of 2008}"
"jvial","9","3","7","9 August 2008"," The stoner flick the world has been waiting for.
","Judd Apatow is by no means a master of cinema, but with Pineapple Express he has mastered a genre. The latest of Apatow's notoriously silly story lines is brought to life by excellent writing and acting -- excellent for a stoner flick, that is. Seth Rogen and James Franco interact beautifully and believably in a relationship whose full hilarity can only be understood by those who have experienced the unique quirks of the cannabis community. Throughout the film, the writers poke fun at the various niceties observed when using and dealing pot. The script is full of examples of the hysterical things that come out of people's mouths when they're stoned, giving the film a stupid humor that lasts the whole time (Rogen and Franco's characters are high for most of the movie).<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of the entire thing; Apatow's style still often rubs me the wrong way. But the good thing is that this film never takes itself too seriously, allowing the awesome humor of pot smoking to dominate, as it should. Anyone seeking a good number of laughs and a friendly reflection on the comical world of marijuana will be satisfied. This film is not one for the ages, nor is it one to be taken seriously, but you'll laugh yourself silly and appreciate the stupidity of the thing itself. Much like pot itself."
"C-Younkin","6","3","7","6 August 2008"," Expected more from them
","Seth Rogen is on a roll (p.s I'm dismissing his Drillbit Taylor screenplay, as did most people). ""Knocked Up"", last summers surprise hit, turned the doughy, curly headed actor into a surprise leading man and ""Superbad"", a movie he wrote along with Evan Goldberg and co-starred in, was what I still believe to be the best film of last year. He has been in a number of supporting roles since, most recently in ""Step Brothers"", but with ""Pineapple Express"" he, along with partner Evan Goldberg, get to prove two more things. One is that Rogen can solidify himself as the next comedic breakout star and the other is that he and Goldberg are two of the best comedy writers working in movies today. And then on the other side of the camera you have director David Gordon Green, whose done most of his work in drama (Snow Angels) and even darker drama (Undertow) and making his first leap into mainstream comedy. So the questions are: Can Rogen be the next Will Ferrell? Can he and Goldberg write another great, hilarious movie or was ""Superbad"" just a fluke? And finally, can Green make the jump to mainstream film and is he the right choice for comedy? <br/><br/>Rogen playsDale, a process server dating a High School senior who spends most ofhis days getting high off the weed he gets from Saul (James Franco), a dealer who spends most of his days getting high and watching old sitcoms. When Dale witnesses a murder at the home of Ted Jones (Gary Cole), both he and Saul are forced to run for their lives. While theyare figuring out what they can do and who they can trust, as even the cops seem to be in on the hit, Ted Jones is preparing for drug war with an Asian crime family.<br/><br/>This movie is a pretty minor entry in the summer season, so minor in fact that I really can't even muster much to say about it. I'm not saying it's a terrible movie nor am I saying that it doesn't make you laugh on occasion but it's a fairly minimal one-joke comedy that swaps clever humor for cheap laughs usually. At its center is a love for the Cheech and Chong bits, two ridiculously high guys trying to understand each through the haze of marijuana. Your love for this stuff will pretty much depend on how hilarious you think stoners are. Me? I thought it was amusing but kept hoping that the movie would sprout some clever ideas around the stoner jokes. Sadly, the rest of the movie is based around easy penis gags and four letter words but nothing all that hilarious or memorable. The few action scenes work a little better, with a car chase and a bloody ending shoot-out to liven things up a bit.<br/><br/>Rogen and Franco are two likable guys in this movie but that's about all I can say for them. They seem to have a good grasp on the material but the movie isn't really trying and neither are they. The rest of the cast is also fairly undefinable, all playing their roles but being called upon to do very little. Danny McBride comes off the best as Saul's lying idiot of a best friend and its good to see Rosie Perez and Gary Cole in a movie, even though neither one can do much with this material.<br/><br/>""Pineapple Express"" isn't a bad movie and most likely it's the stoner movie most stoners want but I'm just saying from the people who made ""Superbad"" and who seem to have a good grasp on what's funny, ""Express"" is kind of a lazy and minor entry in the world of comedy. In other words, I expected better."
"ohsnaprecords","5","7","23","7 August 2008"," An occasionally successful yet fundamentally flawed genre hybrid
","While there are plenty of enjoyable moments in Pineapple Express, it is most consistent in, well... its inconsistencies. It seems clear that this bumpy ride is the product of a confused piece of screen writing. This is no secret, but to understand why this has happened one has to realize that these same handicaps show their faces in the Judd Apatow crew's most defining and celebrated movies. <br/><br/>Yes, most of the improv-heavy movies by Apatow and his like-minded collaborators all have some of these same weird screen writing issues with pacing and story (we're talking Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Superbad). They sometimes feel oddly structured and very amateur in their frequent avoidance of the screen writing 101 trope of ""upping the stakes."" Chances to heighten the urgency of story-driving plot points are frequently side-stepped, dampening the forward motion of the film and making the audience wonder what they're supposed to be caring about in the long run.<br/><br/>Now, why has this not been such a problem until this movie? Sometimes those decisions make Apatow and company's films feels fresh, realistic, unpredictable, and interesting. Since a comedy's main goal is to be funny and develop the characters rather than plot, it's easier to get away with less satisfying resolutions and story pacing. With Pineapple Express, we no longer have a straight-up comedy on our hands, and the genre deviation is what really hurts this one. <br/><br/>In making the film an action-comedy hybrid, these guys should have realized that their typical decisions would feel more sloppy than quirky when applied outside their favored genre. Unlike with Hot Fuzz (a movie which has been oddly compared to Pineapple Express when it really begs contrasting), the script here is loose and underwritten. The action lacks the parody factor that held Hot Fuzz together and is often awkwardly inserted into scenes, feeling out-of-place amidst the improvisational comedy bits, many of which simply weren't that that funny when compared to this crew's past output.<br/><br/>If the jokes had been more consistent and frequent, maybe all the other inconsistencies would have been easier to let slide, but the decision to try to make the action-adventure plot such a strong focus and then construct it so poorly made for a film difficult to digest."

Cheap sex jokes, cheap joke drugs, over-the-top action that is never particularly exciting, are things you crave desperately, because that's pretty much all you'll get.<br/><br/>By the halfway point I was tempted to give up on this, but I did watch it all the way through.

His dealer, Saul Silver, gives him a sneak peek at a new brand of weed called ""pineapple express."" We get a good look in the lives of Dale and Saul. They chill out and deliver killer dialogue that always make my sides ache. When Dale accidentally witnesses a drug lord (Gary Cole) and crooked cop (Perez) murder Asian competition, he tosses his roach and takes Saul on the run with him because the drug could easily be linked to them. That is when the movie starts taking off and becomes its own. Before this, it is almost like any other Judd Apatow movie or late night comedy. Difference is, the beginning of this is much funnier. The drug lord and cop think that Dale and Saul are working for the Asians and try to destroy them. Meanwhile, Dale and Saul go on the run and take the middle man, Red (Danny McBride), with them. As the movie progresses, the elements of danger and drama rise, with the laughs subsiding. There's lots of action and seriousness that helps this stand apart from other adult comedies.

But ultimately, if you wanna see how loose and out of control the writing of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen can get, ""Pineapple Express"" (So far) has some pretty crazy scenario's that I couldn't help but find myself laughing.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Pure fun with comical violence. 7/10."

","How much you enjoy ""Pineapple Express"" may depend largely on how funny you think Seth Rogen is and/or how high you happen to be when you watch it. I wasn't high, and I think Seth Rogen has eked about as much mileage as he can out of his doofus schlub routine, so needless to say I didn't find this film to be an instant comedy classic.<br/><br/>There were plenty of moments that made me laugh, but usually they were the result of some minor and silly throw-away line of dialogue that felt improvised, making me want more of that. Which is why I was frustrated and rather depressed that most of the film consisted of hard-sell, aggressive gun/fistfights, car chases and other stock material normally found in buddy action movies. There's a hilarious and potentially classic addition to the stoner comedy buried somewhere within this bloated film that occasionally makes its appearance. But only occasionally.<br/><br/>And I wasn't prepared for how graphically violent the film was going to be. It tries to play all of this awful violence for laughs but doesn't succeed.

","Endlessly entertaining, hilarious, and quite fun- Pineapple Express makes the best out of its outrageous script, ridiculous characters, and wonderful cast to provide for one of the greatest comedies of the year- if not the decade. The film does have its fair share of flaws, with a beginning that seems to only serve as a starting point rather than proving to be of any true value, and a few generic characters throughout. That being said, though the film's script is at times flawed and even thin, it is a massively fun time that nails every joke, punch, and moment of dialogue it has to say. Seth Rogen and James Franco make for a great duo, and though they did star in a couple more films together after this one, I would love to see the two of them and their great chemistry again on screen sometime soon. Danny McBride also gives a great performance as always, as well as a fine performance from Amber Heard, but unfortunately her character goes pretty much nowhere. The music in the film is a surprisingly fun touch, and the direction in the film is what truly feels like it is tied together. Without David Gordon Green, I feel like the film would be a lot messier than it is today, and thank god for having him on board, and making the film such a blast to watch.

","""Pineapple Express"" is a 2008 action comedy directed by David Gordon Green starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. The moment I read the names Apatow, Rogen and Goldberg in the opening credits I knew that the upcoming flick is gonna be pure comedy gold. It's always remarkable to see how Seth Rogen manages to play himself in every film he appears in. He always plays the sympathic and clumsy stoner, but it's not even a bad thing. It will probably never happen that he wins an Oscar, but it always fills me with joy to watch his on screen shenanigans. In this film it's not different. In the beginning, it was somewhat boring because it seemed like the rest of the film is gonna be only about the philosophy of super stoners, but as the first shot was fired I knew I was in for an amusing genre mix. As usual, the chemistry between Rogen and Franco (obviously) made the characters extremely sympathic. The plot itself offers some surprising twists and well written action scenes, decorated with unexpected brutal effects and extraordinary twists. I mean, how is it possible that two potheads that smoke one joint per scene end up in a war between American and Chinese drug mafia? At times it's just ridiculous nonsense, at times it's extremely sophisticated comedy. Of course it's strange to see the two lead actors carrying guns and Gary Cole as merciless mobster, but in this case it works out, because the film doesn't take itself too seriously and knows what it actually is. Also the appearances of other members of the Apatow bunch make it a lot more funnier. In conclusion, this stoner feature delivers decent fun with a weird combination of action and comedy, a usual great cast and hilarious writing that doesn't go into a infantile direction. Behind all the (gun-)smoke there's heart and that's all it needs. Entertaining and surprisingly good comedy."

","Started with no expectation for the movie, ended up surprised about how laughable the movie was. The plot is thin and nothing new of sort but the movie stands tall in delivering the tag of Comedy genre.<br/><br/>Comedy I feel can be of two types, one completely set in realistic environment and the other in a complete fictional. Mixture of these two in a single drama/movie never binds me. I consider this movie as great as it fits the latter well. Bullets, blasts, fire don't kill people at all, just are a synonym of a fork pricked into the skin. This illogicality in most of the scenes hit me hard and forced me to laugh on the questions of what? how?? Still alive??!?<br/><br/>Some scenes are really very funny and you would go mad at them. Not spoiling the fun, but a man gets shot 7 times in and around the chest area, crashes his speedy car on a man and another truck, gets caught in massive bomb explosion and the resulting fires with a huge burning compound falling over, but still this guy comes out alive, leaving you to laugh out hard on the question of how? Seriously, immortality personified!"

","David Gordon Green has proven his ability to direct an array of films in different genres such as drama, horror and comedy. The latter applies here. Green helms an exceptional comedy. It certainly helps to have Rogen and Goldberg pen the screenplay. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and acting. I don't recall hearing Eddy Grant's, ""Electric Avenue"" being played on the radio as much as it did in the early 80's after this film was released. This film has a plethora of comedic artists as cast members who all deliver splendid performances. In particular Rogen, Franco, Robinson, Heard, Cole, Hader, McBride and Corrigan stand out. As a matter of fact the entire cast is spot on in their timing, delivery and portrayals. The plot revolves around a stoner process servicer, Dale and his weed dealing stoner best friend, Saul. Dale has to serve papers to Saul's dealer and witnesses the dealer murder his competitor. Dale leaves behind evidence that the dealer immediately recognizes as Pineapple Express. This ignites Dale and Saul running for their lives while being pursued by assassins and corrupt police. The plot is hysterical, violent, riotous, action packed, boisterous, vivacious and has a rib-tickling ending. There are many hilarious scenes in this film. Some of the scenes are when underground military secret testing on marijuana with Private Miller takes place; when Saul explains the evolution of Pineapple Express and the engineering of the cross-joint; the fight at Red's apartment; Saul's chase with the police in hot pursuit; the bombastic fully loaded explosive showdown and the breakfast at the diner. There are also many side-splitting quotes in the film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote Dale saying, ""You've been served"" or General Bratt screaming, ""We have a final decision on Item 9. ILLEGAL!"". The film is like an embodiment of the peaceful counterculture meets the violent underworld. This is a loveable, memorable and sublime comedy that is a treat to view stoned or not."

","It's been awhile since I watched this movie so I figured it was time to revisit it! It doesn't matter how old you are, weed jokes are always funny! And this cast just seems to get along so well together that it seems so plausible and they have so much fun working together you can tell that you just get immersed and can't help but laugh and it can make any bad day better! James Franco, Seth Rogen, and so many more big stars are in this movie and some of them only for a moment or two, and it all just meshes so well that even now that I know that they improvised quite a few lines it even goes to show that the script was written so well that it allowed for the creative nature of the actors to shine through and make it even that much more believable! And enjoyable!<br/><br/>So this is where I go into the positives and negatives before I spouted off too much and gave away any spoilers LOL! So for the positives, the cast was amazing! They could not have chosen a better cast! When Rosie Perez was a crooked cop, she was so completely believable but if you had told me that she was going to play a crooked cop, I would have told you you are nuts! And that's just the starters, the script that was written was just so perfect that it allowed these people to be able to step out of their comfort zone of the types of characters they normally played and become something different and make it their own! The cinematography was great, especially at the end and I'm not going to say any more about that. The writing and the script as I've already said many multiple times was completely amazeballs! I very seldom give anything over 6-7 Stars, the movie has to work hard to earn a good rating because there are very good movies out here that deserve good ratings and I don't want a mediocre movie to be given the same rating as something that was so great that it actually deserved the good rating! So for negatives, the only thing that I have is that about in the middle for about a half an hour things kind of dragged where was like come on let's get to the point. You as the viewer kind of knew what the deal was already and you are wondering why the characters were making the moves they were making because they should know what the next move should be, and you kind of get frustrated because they were acting like idiots. But eventually the movie catches up and gets back on track. And I figure if that's the only issue with the movie, they still deserve a 9 out of 10 because the rest of the movie even at the worst blows away almost every other single movie I've been watching lately! I love this movie it's always been one of my favorites, I'm sure in about another year I will probably watch it again, I just like to let a little time go in between viewing of my favorite movies because then there's a little bit of that forgetting and enjoying remembering when you see it!<br/><br/>So to summarize, everything about this movie is incredible the only thing that's bad is a slight section for about a half an hour where it drags its feet just a little bit, but I can say with absolute certainty that Dark Angel endorses and approves of this movie! \m/√∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ñ¢\m/"

","'Pineapple Express (2008)' is essentially a stoner-comedy that isn't shy, at all, about its stoner aspects, often coming across more as a commercial for its pot products than anything else - especially in its first act. Still, when it gets going it's a fast-paced, frantically entertaining buddy-on-the-run piece that's made all the more enjoyable by the inclusion of some unexpectedly crunchy fight-choreography and several rather confident action set-pieces, all of which culminate in a balls-out absurd but undeniably fun finale. The flick's constantly propelled by likeable, sporadically funny and surprisingly realistic performances on the part of pretty much every one involved. 6/10"

"tubbytom","10","7","24","6 August 2008"," Rogen and Goldberg redefine stoner flick genre.
","There are many reasons I am rating this movie for being a 10.<br/><br/>Morals of the movie: 10 First off without even smoking about anyone can relate to this movie. For the fact that the movie is only drug influenced. It deals with issues people have in their friendships and relationships like trustworthiness, jealousy, self doubt and judging others.<br/><br/>Comedy: 10 None of the jokes in the movie are overplayed and just passed the line to make it self inappropriate, this movie was trying to be as Naughty as Superbad or Scary Movie. The way the friends act towards each other and deal with situations make the movie what it is. Also the movie can surprise you at times when you start thinking predictable thoughts.<br/><br/>Action: 10 This goes in the same category as comedy for the fact that its there but it never goes to far. Most situations that would happen in the movie could happen in real life, most have. The movie never goes Rambo and the 2 protagonist never instantly become trained killers instantly. <br/><br/>Romance: 10<br/><br/>Many can connect to the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend. Refer to above. This is definitely a movie your girl friend would love, its like a compromise of a chick flick and a movie for men.<br/><br/>Intellectual Level: 8<br/><br/>This movie would not make you dumber from watching it. Which is hard to say about this genre. Almost all the characters in the movie have a stoner mentality. But there not full blown idiots. They better them selves in the movie and learn lesson they've made. Most of the time movies have 1 main lesson this has many.<br/><br/>Final Word about the movie:<br/><br/>This movie is a unique movie that is meant for adults. This can actually put a meaning to adult humor now because most of the movie is loved through reflecting which Rogen and Goldberg have put in all there movies. This movie filled me it never has me thinking they could of done more. A must see."

","It was very pleasant to get stoned in the sixties. The ritual of rolling a joint, the Michelangelo's of joint rolling whose joints did not deserve to be smoked they were so beautiful, the frisson of Narc danger, the towels under dorm room doors, the perfect music. Could Inagadadavida be recorded today? One joint and the Allman Brothers at Fillmore East could get you from Satellite Beach to Santa Monica in one dazed trip with gas at 29 cents a gallon and three deuces and a four speed growling out the state lines in pre ethanol days. Dashikis and Afros, candles and light shows, multiple attendances at any showing of Fantasia.<br/><br/>Of course the preceding is mere reportage and inference from what others told me, and some reading on the subject.<br/><br/>Indeed, a book I am reading at present, 'My Name is Will', does a good job of bringing the druggy sixties into the similarly druggy mid-eighties. The eighties: ground zero of Nancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' campaign and the criminalization of of anything that would get you higher than a kite can fly. Except, of course, alcohol. An aside: I was once in the company of the main lobbyist of the 7-11 Corporation in Florida, during the late eighties and he, high one night on Miller and Marlboro Lites, told me he was in the drug business: you know, he said, alcohol, nicotine, and sugar. Hmmm, Nancy never said 'no' to those drugs.<br/><br/>A long preamble to why I disliked 'Pineapple Express' so much.<br/><br/>There is a proud, admittedly liberal in structure, history of extremely funny stoner movies in these United States. Ambling, discordant, self indulgent, silly, and freaking funny...their central plot device: the cool, laid back stoners and the Man. The humor arising from making the Man look silly and in shared common moments of stoner-dom. Like in California eating nine tacos at two in the morning. Or in Chicago, talking the Greek guy through every thin slice from the spit, like a surgeon teaching a gall bladder operation to interns, to make a perfect gyros sandwich in the wee hours. I am told that connoisseurs of the best bud are connoisseurs of the best gyros stands. Eaten, standing at the window, as the hawk makes hungry stoners long for the soft January Siberian night rather than a typical mid-January Chicago: weak sunlight seldom penetrating the clouds of snow hovering two stories above the city. Late night micturation against a greystone an exercise in imaginative ice sculpture. Or, to get back to a more universal gustatory experience brought on by evil weed, the purchase and consumption of an entire package of double chocolate Milanos whilst watching Cops wherever you live.<br/><br/>This movie barely honors classic stonerdom but, when it does, it is very funny. But, for most of the movie, Pineapple lobs a grenade into those hazy fond memories of experience or fondly remembered movies. According to this movie, we no longer live in the mellow pot sixties. Forty years of chemical refinement seems to have created Frankenstein pot, stem cell pot, giga byte pot, pot which takes gentle 'screw the Man' plot devices and substitutes automatic weapons, massive fire power, gut wrenching wounds, severed ears, gallons of blood and a body count that 'Saving Private Ryan' would envy to support a ponderous plot that pot can not handle.<br/><br/>Turgid New Age psycho babble. No stoned word associations from alpha to omega, Disney to Marx, time travel to space travel, buttons? who invented them...really...what chocolate really tastes like. No, in a 21st Century power pot movie, we get awkward social situations verbalized as cute not anarchic. A god-awful complicated who did what to who murder rampage story line that would ruin anyone's high.<br/><br/>The plot: God knows...a murder most foul witnessed, friendship found and tested, a Sino-Corrupt Cop-Stoner conflict, Rosie Perez reminding us that time marches on, continuous doobie doing, an add on, for no reason, scene of selling dope to foul mouthed school kids, two corpulent African Americans with roles that are so demeaning that I hope they skipped the premier, a waste of two funny leads, who must be embarrassed at the power pot plot they had to inhabit.<br/><br/>Worse, not even enough of a contact buzz to make me veer into World Market for a Ritter Bar with almonds afterwards.<br/><br/>Hey! Even stoner movies need someone, as this script began transmogrifying from stoner to stupid, to say 'don't Bogart that script, my friend, pass it over to someone else to make it funny and funnier.'"
"PWNYCNY","4","4","12","2 September 2008"," Where's the humor?
","With the exception of an automobile chase scene this movie offers nothing that is particularly funny. The movie's preoccupation of with drug abuse and it's treatment of various subjects, including drug dealing, gang violence, police corruption, corrupting the morals of a minor, are not funny. They are subjects that do not inspire humor. Two guys behaving stupidly can be funny. Anyone ever heard of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello? And what about the two guys in Clerks II? And what the two guys in Sideways? Or in Weekend at Bernie's? Great movies and fun too. But this movie just doesn't do it. Drug dealing and drug using dudes just does not provoke laughter. There is nothing funny about that, not even as a goof. The acting is good with James Franco giving an impressive performance in a challenging role. Substance abuse is a serious problem which destroys people. If you find humor in drug trafficking and police corruption then this movie is for you. Otherwise, if you want some laughs, go rent Get Smart."

I can picture Rogen reading a bad review like this and snickering to himself, ""hey, well at least I made umpteen million off of it.

His habit is so strong that he's developed a relationship--indeed,possibly his best friendship--with Saul(JAmes Franco,unrecognizable in his 'Spicoli,the Next Generation'),the affable and perpetually high supplier. That might explain why he B-lines his way to Saul's when he witnesses a seedy pot supplier whacking a rival's hit man and gets spotted in the process.<br/><br/>A movie that has to be seen to believed, I gotta say right off the top that you don't really NEED to be a pot user to enjoy this movie,but it probably wouldn't hurt. One part buddy comedy,one part action movie and one part anthemic stoner film(rivaling anything that Cheech and Chong cranked out over their illustrious career),this movie's greatest strength is the fact that the actions and dialog REALLY SOUNDS like stoners: easygoing and intuitive one minute,confused and discombobulated the next. Among the tough to swallow inconsistencies in this film(most of which are easy to ignore given the pacing,likable characters and otherwise smart plotting)is the fact that while Dale and Saul are both heavy hashish users,DAle seems to be A LOT less affected by the ganja than Saul. Another might be the fact that DAle's love life comes in the form of seemingly normal and well-scrubbed teen(Amber Heard,well-scrubbed and sexy and,I'm guessing NOT a teen anymore)whose parents don't seem to have ANY misgivings about an older guy(or the movie is not very clear if they know or not). Nevertheless,the movie roars along in only the way a stoner buddy pic could,and does it without seeming too much in a cloud of its own chronic.<br/><br/>Credit director David Gordon Green and the writers for all of this accomplishment. Having GAry Cole(as the chief baddie,aforementioned),Rosie Perez(more one-note as the police arm of Cole's operation,but still effective)and DAnny Roberts(as a rival dealer who is more friend than foe to DAle and Saul)added into the cast rounds the players out well. It's a very cool movie,and maybe I got a little too enthralled by this film while watching,but I could swear that this movie about gave me a contact high. HAving lived next to tokers(but not having done much of the stuff myself),I think I know what that feels like.

","If last year's hits, ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad,"" were the movie-comedy equivalent of grand slam homeruns, then the latest concoction by producer Judd Apatow - this one entitled ""Pineapple Express"" after some killer weed - is at the very least a solid triple. More contrived in its storyline than those two earlier films, but no less hilarious on that account, ""Pineapple Express"" is the tale of two certified potheads, Dale and Saul, who are forced to go on the lam after Dale accidentally witnesses a murder by a big-time drug dealer.<br/><br/>As both a producer and a writer, Apatow's distinctive trademark is lowbrow slapstick crossed with highbrow wit. In ""Pineapple Express,"" Apatow and his co-scenarists Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg are not afraid to let their scenes run on a bit, resulting in a natural comic rhythm that allows the humor to grow organically out of the dialogue, characters and situations. This has been billed in some quarters as the ""pot comedy,"" and while there are indeed many jokes that revolve around being stoned, the drug aspect is often incidental to what is really going on in the movie. Directed by David Gordon Green, ""Pineapple Express"" joins a long list of recent comedies about men who refuse to grow up and accept the responsibility of being adults. Yet, unlike, say, ""Step Brothers,"" ""Pineapple Express"" never talks down to its audience. Even the slapstick is performed at a surprisingly high level of sophistication, and the movie features one of the most gut-bustingly hilarious car chase sequences we've encountered in quite some time. The movie stumbles only in its closing stretches when it abandons its character-driven humor in favor of action-comedy hijinks.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen duplicates his comical Everyman triumph from ""Knocked Up,"" while James Franco emerges as the most endearing stoner since Sean Penn first burst upon the scene in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" all those years ago.<br/><br/>Add yet another one to the Apatow ""win"" column."

","First of movies matter, the values depicted in movies matter. There has to be some sort of standard of what is right and what is wrong. Its OK to have the protagonist have morals that deviate from the norm, and of course we all respect Robin Hood and his mantra that he ""steals from the rich . . ."" But here the protagonists witness a murder and because they need some cash decide to sell some drugs down at the school yard. We have a movie absolutely devoid of any morals whatsoever. This movies is just a step, a baby step above child pornography. We expected to approve of their decision to sell drugs to kids! I don't have kids, but I was still appalled.<br/><br/>Secondly our protagonists, a bunch of drug using slacker losers, end up in a gun battle with the bad guys that is worthy of Rambo.

"TOMNEL","5","3","9","30 August 2008"," Muddled plot and annoying characters. Truly a movie only a stoner could love (and they do).
","Seth Rogen who has become a famous name attached the the Judd Appatow line of movies, has written another movie since Superbad (and the horrible Drillbit Taylor). As filthy and profane as Superbad is, this movie is rife with drug humor and stoner references, that everyone may understand, but only those who have experimented (most likely right before the movie started) in that area will belt out the most laughs. For me, the drug humor really wasn't that funny, and was just kind of dumb, the plot was all over the place, and the characters were obnoxious. Of course, amongst all these negatives, this was an enjoyable movie at times, but the good and the bad evened each other out to make nothing more than a dumb, average stoner comedy.<br/><br/>Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a normal working man, serving sepenas with a sense of humor. His two loves in life are his high school aged girlfriend, and pot. One night after buying a new, rare type of pot from his dealer Saul (James Franco), Dale is off to serve another sepena, and while at the house, he witnesses a murder. He drops his joint at the sight and drives off, hitting the murderers' cars. The first murderer is the head drug lord, and the second is Rosie Perez who for some reason is in this movie as a love interest (God knows why) and a corrupt cop. Dale and Saul end up going on a stoner trip to stop the drug lord and survive in the process.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is quite good, and fitting for the stupid characters. Seth Rogen and James Franco know how to act like stoners. Perhaps they both are, for Rogen to write this and Franco to write the Ape. But nonetheless, they are the correct choices to play these bad characters. The fight scenes are shot well, so the camera direction is fine. It's the writing and characters that truly lack.<br/><br/>Like a child who has just drunk way too much caffeine, this movie is all over the place. The plot jumps from here to here to here, by the end it was as though I had just sat through an anthology of stoner stories, none of which were particularly enthralling. Many critics say the buddy comedy portion of the film is less enjoyable than the action. I partially agree. The buddy comedy parts, with Rogen, Franco and Danny McBride who plays Saul's dealer Red, were sometimes funny and sometimes irritating. The action scenes were more fast paced and fun to watch, but they always came on too quick and ended too soon. The movie's funniest moments come from the action scenes, including one scene where James Franco drives a car with his foot stuck in the glass of the front window. However, everything for this movie was a mixed bag and nothing ever fully worked.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie will appeal to stoners, because of how relateable it is, and some teenagers will enjoy the raunchy material, but to anyone else, this is just your dumb, average movie. Let me emphasize dumb.<br/><br/>My rating: ** out of ****. 110 mins. R for drug content, language and violence."
"dee.reid","10","3","9","18 August 2008"," An action-comedy about the best of buds
","I just saw the excellent and laugh-out-loud hilarious action-comedy ""Pineapple Express"" for a 7:50 showing at the local theater. I'm not even a stoner, yet I still found the ""high as a kite"" humor and pot-smoking to be down-right hilarious; my ribs are still hurting, I was laughing so hard. As with most comedies of late in which Judd Apatow is involved, ""Pineapple Express"" is indeed funny - with plenty of laughs and late in the film, blood + guts ""Die Hard-/John Woo""-style action shoot-'em-up - but somewhere in there is a subtext on male-bonding and friendship that proves that these new Apatow comedies are certainly more than they appear on the surface. ""Pineapple Express"" involves Dale Denton (the lovable new face of Hollywood slacker-dom, Seth Rogen, also the film's co-writer along with Evan Goldberg), a process server (he hands out subpoenas and other legal documents to truant folks due in court) and out-and-out pothead who's also dating Angie (Amber Heard), an 18-year-old high school girl. Anyway, Dale witnesses a murder one night that was committed by a local drug kingpin (Gary Cole) and his corrupt-cop girlfriend (Rosie Perez). Fleeing the scene of the crime in terror, Dale goes to his only (and unlikely) source of refuge, his dealer Saul (James Franco, the film's most valuable and unlikely asset). It turns out that Saul is in possession of a new and extremely rare kind of marijuana, the ""pineapple express"" of the title - he's one of two dealers known to be in possession of it, in fact - and so when they learn that the drug kingpin's assassins are gunning for them, they take the contraband and go on the run. As it turns out, their time on the run proves to be a perfect bonding experience: Saul likes Dale (in a perfectly heterosexual way) and during their deals is always trying to warm up to him so that they can be friends, not just dealer and client. And there are plenty of moments in this buddy comedy where the two get a chance to shine. Franco, as I stated earlier, is the film's most valuable and unlikely asset. Frankly, he steals the show and he's the guy in the movie that you feel the most for. As the perpetually stoned Saul, you see it in him his yearning for friendship and desire to move beyond the increasingly boring day-to-day routine of pot-dealing and into greener pastures, like caring for his grandmother and nurturing his knack for industrial design (he invents a joint shaped like a cross). In other words, he's lonely. So in a way, if they survive their time on the run, Dale and Saul will without question become the best of buds. ""Pineapple Express"" is a wonderful and action-packed comedy, smartly written by Rogen and Goldberg, and directed by David Gordon Green. Of their comedies of late (""The 40-Year-old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" ""Superbad""), Apatow and friends' ""Pineapple Express"" is the best one I've seen yet. The laughs are a mile-a-minute, and while some may be turned off in the film's third act by an ultra-bloody shootout in a warehouse involving the drug kingpin and his rivals - unnamed Asian gangsters, who also deliver some hardy laughs themselves - I guarantee that even there, there's a little something for everyone: blood, guts, guns, cheesy one-liners (""You've been served!""), and explosions - which shows that director Green and his co-writers were in perfect control of this well-executed film. In an age where so few comedies are actually funny, ""Pineapple Express"" proves that you can go to the movies with your friends, and come out after the show's over - The Best of Buds.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie is the perfect combination of action, romance, comedy, and stoner comedy.<br/><br/>i thought the violence in this movie would be lame but i was wrong. the action scenes were awesome and still funny in their own way.<br/><br/>the whole room was laughing through the entire movie. the best thing is that there are funny jokes for smokers of the green and non-smokers. <br/><br/>the romance part is great because there's not too much so the guys don't have to worry about crying in public. most of the emotional moments are between friends and everyone can relate to these issues in a way. <br/><br/>this would be a good movie to take your kid to if you have just found out that they are smoking pot or if you suspect that they are. it would definitely open the door to conversation.<br/><br/>This is definitely the funniest movie I've seen this year!!! a must see for 16 and up."

","The Pineapple Express is another Apatow Company produced film Starring Seth Rogen as Dale Denton and James Franco as Saul Silver. I really thought that this would be a great comedy from Apatow when I made it to the advanced screening, but I got all that and much much more. This movie isn't just a straight up comedy, it is also an action/crime movie. That to me really helped the movie out a lot. Instead of it being just another stoner comedy, it turned out to be a stoner comedy with an actual action theme to it. Rogen and Franco had great chemistry on screen and that really made the movie. For all the fans of the Judd Apatow, this is a must see."

","I saw Pineapple Express at an advanced screening last night. I wasn't sure I would want to see it, as the last movies I have seen with Seth Rogan weren't his best. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I was laughing almost the entire time. There were a lot of drug references (Go figure), but most of them were common enough for a non-smoker to get and appreciate. The least funny part of the movie was the action portion when there was little dialog. James Franco as the drug dealer was a very good choice in casting. The banter between James and Seth was dead-on and his imitation of a pothead was perfect. Seth's character Dale was such a screw-up but oh-so lovable all the same. This movie was definitely worth seeing and I can't wait to see it again when it comes out in theaters and on DVD."

","As a writer Seth Rogen has a formula. A couple of stoner's/losers getting over their heads with some bad guys and trying to extract themselves from a perilous position in a comedic way.<br/><br/>Even Mike Myers knew to make Austin Powers work he needed to break down a James Bond film in a clinical fashion. I am not convinced Rogen is sure like Myers what he is parodying and that the formula is screwed down tightly.<br/><br/>As an actor Seth Rogen plays a slacker where he meets stoner's, losers and undesirable types. He has not stretched himself even when he plays a superhero such as The Green Hornet.<br/><br/>In Pineapple Express Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server, who sees a killing by a drug dealer and then must evade his gang. He teams up with his friend, marijuana dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) as they elude the gang, a bent policewoman and get stoned.<br/><br/>The humour is broad and while some of its knockabout fun the comic book violence is jarring. Danny McBride gets shot point blank and survives, rather a few people get shot or stabbed and survive before being finished off properly.<br/><br/>The film is an uneasy mix, it is mildly amusing like the car chase with a foot through its windscreen, but runs out of steam. Maybe the script looked fun when the writers and actors were stoned."
"jcbutthead86","10","2","5","18 June 2013"," A Brilliant,Hilarious,Over The Top Action-Comedy. An Instant Stoner Film Classic FromThe Judd Apatow Gang.
","Pineapple Express is an brilliant,hilarious Comedy that masterfully mixes laughs,Action and stoner Comedy. Filled with amazing direction,a great cast,intense,over the top Action and a memorable script,Pineapple Express is instant classic stoner Comedy and the Judd Apatow gang at their best.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express tells the story Dale Denton(Seth Rogan),a process server who loves his job and loves to smoke marijuana. While he's out on the job,Dale accidentally witnesses a gang related murder and with no one to turn to,Dale goes to his drug dealer Saul Silver(James Franco)and the two decide to run. Now on the run,Dale and Saul have to outrun and outsmart murderous criminals,corrupt cops and dangerous hit-man and also smoke some marijuana and laughs and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>What do you get when you combine Comedy,Action,a buddy movie and a Stoner film? You get the hilarious and excellent Action-Comedy stoner film Pineapple Express one of the smartest and funniest stoner films of all time that is my second favorite Judd Apatow film right behind Superbad and Pineapple Express is a funny and wonderful companion piece to Superbad. Why is Pineapple Express such a great movie is because director David Gordan Green,producer Judd Apatow and co-writer Seth Rogan have taken the stoner film genre and raised it to another level giving viewers a film that is funny and thrilling mixing great laughs and wonderful Action that is done in a surrealistic way to the point of going completely over the top. The Comedy and laughs in the film come right from the first frame and the laughs never stop until the very and the Humor isn't just based on the main characters getting high but the crazy and bizarre situations that happen throughout and viewers are not sure if the characters Dale and Saul are imagining all this or is it really happening. This film is a crazy Adventure in the highest(no pun intended)and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I don't think I have ever seen a stoner Comedy mixed with an Action film before and the way that the two genres meet and come together is fresh and original mixing funny drug induced insanity with gunfights,car chases,fights and explosions. It is as if Cheech and Chong met up with Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer and decided to make an Action-Comedy. Is PE the start of a new sub genre of Stoner Action-Comedy? If it is then the roots of the sub genre started here start here. PE is also a great and fun Buddy movie because like any great buddy movie you see two great characters who can not only relate to each other but relate to the audience as well and the two great buddies in the film are Dale and Saul. Dale and Saul are great characters and a classic duo because while they are on their adventure they not only try to survive the criminals but get to know each other while they're on the run and the relationship and banter between the two is hilarious and real. What also makes them great characters is their ambitions:Dale wants to be a Radio Talk show host while Saul wants to design and build buildings. Never in a film about getting high have two stoner's been so ambitious. The screenplay by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg is fantastic,great,hilarious and truly memorable,with Rogan and Goldberg giving the main characters amazing well-written and quotable dialog which is smarter than most films about getting stoned. At 112 minutes PE moves at a great pace and fantastic energy and the film goes by fast you will not know what in the heck happened. The Action scenes in the film are wonderful with lots of great gunfights and fistfights and combing them with Comedy makes the Action scenes much more wild and chaotic. The ending or final 20-30 minutes of PE is Action-filled and have tons of laughs throughout and the ending is something you will never forget and add to PE's greatness and brilliance.<br/><br/>The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Seth Rogan is brilliant and funny as Dale,with Rogan bringing great laughs and dialog. James Franco is excellent and hilarious as Saul,with Franco being very believable in his performance and having amazing chemistry with Rogan. Danny McBride is amazing and is a funny scene stealer as Red,Saul's friend and fellow drug dealer. Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson are funny and memorable as Budlofsky and Matheson,two killers chasing Dale and Saul. Gary Cole is great as Ted Jones,a gangster and drug lord. Rosie Perez is truly wonderful as Carol,a corrupt cop who is also Ted's lover. Amber Heard is funny and beautiful as Angie,Dale's high school girlfriend. Ed Begley Jr.(Robert)and Nora Dunn(Shannon)are funny and over the top as Angie's parents. Bill Hader(Private Miller),James Remar(General Bratt),Cleo King(Police Liaision Officer) and Joe Lo Truglio(Mr. Edwards)give funny performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by David Gordon Green is wonderful,with Green always moving the camera,with close-ups,angles and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction,Green.<br/><br/>The score by Graeme Revell is great,light,effective and matches the tone of the film. A good,memorable score by Revell. The film's soundtrack also has great songs from Huey Lewis& The News(Pineapple Express Theme song),Public Ememy(Lost At Birth),Bel Biv DeVoe(Poison),Bob Marley(Time Will Tell),Robert Palmer(Woke Up Laughing),Eddy Grant(Electric Avenue),Peter Toss(Wanted Dread or Alive),Cypress Hill(Dr. Greenthumb),Brother Noland(Coconut Girl)and more. A great soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Judd Apatow,Comedies,Action films or Stoner films,you will love Pineapple Express,an hilarious,Action-packed Stoner Comedy that you won't forget and is the Judd Apatow gang at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"andypoek","6","2","5","21 January 2011"," It's not a waste of time....but...
","The biggest problem with Pineapple Express is that you sit there and experience one missed joke after another. In addition to that, the majority of the storyline segments feel like a complete waste of time. The storyline ITSELF feels like filler. That's a sign of a bad movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps yet another problem is that, on a personal note, I'm not too crazy about Seth Rogen as an actor. He never really does anything particularly funny- it's more like the characters around him provide the laughs, so the humor is supposed to come from how Seth responds to said characters. Someone completely different from him would be Jim Carrey- Carrey provides the humor himself.<br/><br/>Anyway, Pineapple Express is mediocre for the majority of its running time. It's about Seth's character who witnesses a murder while sitting in a parked car. The murderers spot Seth Rogen before he drives away in a hurry, and eventually Seth and the murderers come into contact with each other. It's a comedy film though. Not a particularly funny one, but hey, that's the category it falls under.<br/><br/>Despite being a comedy, it's interesting how the film has its share of graphic scenes pertaining to blood and shootings, and yet, the violent scenes aren't treated as comedy. So the film has an extremely small portion of suspense as well.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is *definitely* the one where Seth Rogen walks into his girlfriends parents home while the family is sitting at the dinner table. He's covered in sweat and blood and tries to explain to them that a murderer is following him and that they must leave right away.<br/><br/>This is apparently Seth's first time meeting the parents of his girlfriend. What an introduction! There's quite a bit of humor involved during this part, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Proof that even a mediocre movie can make me laugh at times.<br/><br/>Also the friend who bakes cakes for his dead cat provided a few solid laughs as well. The entire conclusion of the storyline where all the bad guys and Seth's friends are battling each other is really exciting to watch as well.<br/><br/>It's just amazing how pointless the majority of the storytelling is though. A good portion of it focuses on nothing but Seth's friends sitting around and smoking weed and saying the worst jokes imaginable. This isn't entertaining not even a *little* bit.<br/><br/>Overall, an average film. You've been warned what to expect, but hey, you've probably seen Seth Rogen before so I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know here."
"MOSSBIE","Null","2","5","6 April 2010"," GENUINE laugh out loud success
","This is probably the funniest film from the ""new generation"" mentality and pisses off every film school student here because it succeeds as a non stop, side splitting ""goofing"" comedy. I had never heard of the star, Seth Rogan and avoided the film for weeks on my satellite movie listings. Quite simply,well written (hilarious dialogue and interplay by a really well cast group of fantastic actors. James Franco does the best pot head and is totally different from Brad Pitt's wonderful portrayal. This is real comedic timing done with a straight face by Franco, who also manages to exude a lovable hippie maintaining his Jimmy Dean charisma. Rosie Perez is a natural comedienne and good actress and a great bad girl.I never have liked Ed Begley Jr. so much because he is strong and authoritative with great timing. The writing is really non TV and the whole thing moves with outrageous situations, and all this with masses of gun play for a comedy. It is the best comedy I have seen this year."

There's no use in a vegetarian reviewing Mcdonald's new cheeseburger or a listening to a hippy review a bomb. So why read what these people thought of the film? read the reviews of those who enjoy films like these, and you will see that it is awesome!<br/><br/>It's a stoner film, and that's what it wanted to be.

"fwomp","7","2","5","20 February 2009"," Cheech And Chong Redux...
","After hearing just about everyone I know gush about PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, I finally got around to watching it. Perhaps I waited too long, or perhaps I've seen another movie that leaves it in the dust. But, for whatever reason, there just wasn't much appeal for me.<br/><br/>The film I'm referring to that left Pineapple Express in the dust is none other than TROPIC THUNDER. Some might find the comparison unfair, but it really isn't. Both have that Jerry Bruckheimer-esquire action quality to them. Both bill themselves as heavy comedies. And both have plenty of star power. But Pineapple Express started out slow, building up steam before finally getting several guffaws out of me, while Tropic Thunder did it from the first moment the screen lit up.<br/><br/>More like a modernization of a Cheech and Chong flick, Pineapple Express shows the imbecility of the marijuana culture but does so by placing it within the vehicle of friendship. Seth Rogen (KNOCKED UP) stars as a 30-something-year-old loser Dale Denton who's job is that of a process server. And he's good at it. He could serve a summons on the pope if he had to. But he's also heavily into pot and gets it from his dealer-turned-buddy Saul Silver (James Franco, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH). Everything is going along fine (including Dale hooking up with an 18-year-old high school hottie) until he witnesses the murder of a Chinese man at the hands of drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole, TALLADEGA NIGHTS) and a female police officer (Rosie Perez). Troubles deepen as Dale becomes paranoid after smoking some of the new bud he'd purchased called Pineapple Express. Saul, his dealer, is the only one in the city who has the stuff, and when Dale panicked and left behind a roach after fleeing the scene of the murder, Ted figures out who the witness might be and sends a couple of thugs out to find him.<br/><br/>Dale and Saul flee for their lives, not that they were initially in danger, and into the woods, where they continue tokin' and eventually fall into a deep comatose state. When they awaken many hours later, they formulate a plan to find out if anyone is looking for them. They head out to Saul's distributor, a guy named Red (Danny R. McBride, TROPIC THUNDER) who initially tries to turn them in but later changes his karma and becomes practically immune to bullet holes.<br/><br/>Although there are some laugh-out-loud funny moments, they don't come until later in the film. One particularly funny scene involves Red crashing through a burning barn in a car, instantly killing a thug, and then jumping from the car and shooting the dead guys foot off. Both crude and grossly hysterical.<br/><br/>The ending is fairly anticlimactic with the stoned-out, burned-out, beat-up, and shot-up trio (Dale, Saul, and Red) sitting in a caf√© waiting for a ride and sucking down food in a post-smoking haze. Not much to laugh about there. Perhaps I wasn't toked-up enough myself...."

","I like Seth Rogan and Judd Apatow movies but i am getting a little bit concerned about how much longer that will last. It seems like every month there is a new movie involving either or both of them and they are in danger of overkill . At the moment their movies are making lots of money and i understand why they are making hay while the sun is shining but at what cost?<br/><br/>Process server Dale Denton has a grudging business relationship with the laconic Saul Silver , deigning to visit only to purchase Saul's primo product -- a rare new strain of pot called Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord , he panics and dumps the Pineapple Express at the scene. When it's traced back to him, Dale and Saul run for their lives... and they quickly discover that they're not just suffering from weed-fueled paranoia. <br/><br/>If they survive, these two just might become real friends. All aboard the Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>There have been many drug related comedies most of which i didn't care too much for . Not because I'm anti drugs but just because they have not been very funny. Pineapple express bucks that trend a little but i couldn't help feeling that this film didn't quite work.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments in Pineapple Express . Some laugh out loud ones in fact but the last half an hour turned more into a farcical romp and the clever stuff went out of the window. I'm not sure why they felt they had to crank up the level of violence like they did but it didn't feel right in the context of the movie. <br/><br/>Also some things just didn't ring true like ' what was a beautiful 18 year old girl doing with a loser like Dale ?<br/><br/>One plus point is the performance of James Franco . He worked well alongside Seth Rogan . <br/><br/>There is no denying that the combination of Rogan and apatow can produce some very funny dialogue and Pineapple express is no exception. <br/><br/>Lines such as "" War is upon you! Prepare to suck the cock of karma! "" <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>Saul: This is like if that Blue Oyster s**t met that African Kush I had - and they had a baby. And then, meanwhile, that crazy Northern Light stuff I had and the Super Red Espresso Snowflake met and had a baby.

These guys can write funny, we've seen it before, but this script has a handful of good laughs and in a feature length film, that just isn't enough. Sure there are chuckles along the way but so much of it falls flat that it stands out head and shoulders above the good stuff. No-one really has anything to do, even the two main characters don't really appeal, and there was never a point where i felt like i wanted these guys to succeed. And i was promised action, and instead got made-for-TV action highlighted with bad language, which is the other films is funny, but the profanities are used way way too much here, and it just feels awkward.<br/><br/>I may watch this film again, but not until i'm older and reliving past experiences.

","This is not the sort of movie that I go to see very often, or even rent on DVD for that matter. My expectation was that the humor would be mostly slob, raunchy humor, but still funny enough that I would not find myself wanting to walk out of the theater. It met those expectations adequately. There was a point around the middle of the movie when I was thinking that I would enjoy a walk around the outside of the theater more, but I hung in there to the end.<br/><br/>No matter how well scripted and produced, there is no way that any movie of this genre could ever deserve more than a 5/10 rating.

The mere fact that the people who like this movie think that it deserves a 10/10 rating, tells you everything that you need to know about them, and this in turn tells you everything that you need to know about this movie. As far as movies of this genre go, it was a decent movie. But it ain't no ""Animal House"", nor even a ""Caddy Shack"", and it sure as hell doesn't deserve a rating any higher than 5/10.

"EUyeshima","6","4","14","11 August 2008"," Loopy Stoner Comedy Hijinks and Quentin Tarantino-Level Action Make for a Guy-Friendly Free-for-All
","Co-written by star Seth Rogen and his partner Evan Goldberg, the ramshackle dialogue is familiar from any of the comedies from the Judd Apatow factory. The funniest bits are the throwaway lines delivered by Rogen as Dale Denton, a carefree process server who smokes reefer all day, dreams of being a radio talk-show host, and has a relationship with a high school girl named Angie. The movie's title refers to the new and powerful weed strain that Dale buys from a sweet-natured, likeably loopy dealer named Saul Silver. Both are quickly on the lam after Dale witnesses a grisly murder at the hands of criminal drug lord Ted Jones and his corrupt cop lover Carol. They try to elicit help from Saul's shifty but hilariously obtuse friend Red, but he rats on them to a pair of hit-men who are in hot pursuit of the comic pair.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the film starts rather unpromisingly as a stoner comedy with a somewhat unsavory element in the romance Dale has with his underaged girlfriend. However, it picks up considerable comedy steam when Dale and Saul become paranoid as much from their excessive smoking as their on-the-run situation. Director David Gordon Green, a filmmaker known more for his indie work like ""George Washington"", also brings a refreshing human element to key moments within the escalating shenanigans, especially when the bond between Dale and Saul becomes hilariously intractable. It also becomes clear that Dale's relationship with Angie is based on his emotional immaturity versus a Lolita complex.<br/><br/>As Dale, the schlubby Rogen is really doing nothing different here than he did in ""Knocked Up"", though his baseline character's object of affection has shifted discernibly from a beautiful entertainment reporter to a dealer and his doobies. An actor etched in my memory for his startling turn as James Dean in the 2002 telepic, a stringy-haired James Franco manages to be funny and intriguingly poignant in an off-kilter way. The scene stealers, however, turn out to be Danny McBride (the suspicious brother in last year's ""The Heartbreak Kid""), who survives every action-thriller clich√© imaginable, and Craig Robinson (the hilariously observant nightclub bouncer in ""Knocked Up"") as the overly sensitive hit-man Matheson. Left far to the sidelines are Gary Cole not nearly interesting enough as Jones and a strangely cast Rosie Perez acting quite butch as Carol.<br/><br/>Ed Begley, Jr., has a funny bit as Angie's beleaguered dad, and Ken Jeong (the obnoxious ob-gyn in ""Knocked Up"") shows up as one of the ninjas from the Asian crime syndicate. Overlong at 110 minutes, the movie shifts gears into Quentin Tarantino territory during the last third - first with a predictably wild car chase scene and then the particularly over-the-top mayhem at the grow house where the Pineapple Express is harvested. As a silly overture, the opening black-and-white scene, set seventy years prior, has Bill Hader as a soldier smoking copious amounts of marijuana to test his mettle, but make no mistake that this is at heart a stoner buddy film, a point made clear by the film's hangover scene in the diner. There's a lot of funny stuff in this film, and much of it is well-played, but the audience is clearly pre-determined by the subject. If you are repelled by the thought of watching guys getting high for nearly two hours, then I say just skip it."

The best part of this movie was the previews for the new Shia LaBeouf movie."
"kevbowdc","6","9","49","31 July 2008"," Pretty cool plot for action but not that great
","I saw this movie at a free screening in Hunt Valley, Maryland and was very excited to see it. Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow make great movies such as 40 Year old virgin, knocked up, and SuperBad. Although this movie had a pretty good plot of witnessing a murder, being on the run from the bad guys, and finally having a confrontation with the bad guys, there wasn't really anything new I haven't seen before. There were the same ole gags of a guy getting high, making funny comments every sentence he utters just because he is high 24/7. I do believe that it was a good idea to mix in pot and action, but I was just expecting something a little different. Although I think the movie could have been better, Seth did do a pretty good job acting although he seems to fall into the same story line of being a slob working odd jobs. There really wasn't anything special from his performance, but just like his other movies, he provided the laughs while being serious at some moments. The standout actor to me would have to be James Franco. He did a pretty good job transforming from a superhero villain to a Pothead. LOL But he embodied all of the characteristics of one who smokes weed. His mannerisms, his speech, the way he moved his facial features, his droopy eyes, attire all fit the characteristics. It wasn't an Oscar nominated performance, but I wouldn't be surprised if he gets like a MTV award or something. Overall the movie was cool, but nothing to go crazy about. If you are a huge fan of 40 year old virgin, Superbad, and Knocked up, you might walk away a little disappointed. But for the outrageous fans, you might just have a good time depending on the atmosphere. Although I was a little let down, I will still continue to see future Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow movies. Hey, all of your film series can't be perfect."

","I often check the IMDb reviews before watching a movie, a normally I agree with the general direction of them. Oftentimes I get to enjoy a flick that I thought wouldn't appeal to me. This one though is the first for which my initial instincts were right. <br/><br/>There is a couple of comedies about pot culture, in which a punch of potheads do stupid stuff while high. I never liked them - for me the genre feels like a lazy way to write a script, since you don't have to care about smart dialogues and logic, and you get plenty opportunity for slapstick. This one fits right in.<br/><br/>The only think I genuinely loved was James Franco - he really is great and his range seems to be limitless. Seth Rogen I liked in Freaks and Geeks, but since he's been type-casted as mellow pothead, that changed. I just can't relate to his characters, and I think he's wasting his talent.<br/><br/>The action sequences were alright, the humour I didn't like though. Don't think I laughed often."
"GlassHandle","3","2","6","8 January 2012"," Close to unbearable
","this is a horrible and close to unbearable action ""comedy"". The script seems to have been written in 5 minutes and and was apparently never re-written or even proof read and was put straight into production. While the actors were hanging out on the set and smoked pot they sometimes even shot some film from time to time which was then roughly assembled and released to millions of theaters. Then gullible and simple people all over the planet went to see it and thought it was absolutely hilarious. Why did these young people love this movie so much and rated it a 7 on IMDb is because young people have grown up with ""hilarious"" American comedies like ""Anchorman"", ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", ""Super Bad"" and so on (the list is almost endless). By the standards of these movies ""Pineapple Express"" is equally amazing and hilarious. To people who know what a truly well written and funny comedy looks like it is a complete travesty though."
"Freebird314","5","2","6","15 June 2009"," Average Stoner Flick.
","Being a fan of ""Freaks and Geeks""; I thought it was a dream come true when I heard that former cast members Seth Rogen and James Franco were acting together in a movie. But I would soon find out how wrong I was. I didn't really know much about this movie. Just that everyone's been talking about it. But, I learned not to get excited over a movie because of the hype it gets. That's really what you have to do in this case.<br/><br/>Anyways, let me get down to it. Dale Denton played by Seth Rogen has a job where he gives supena's to people. I forgot the name of the job. But knowing it is essential to the story. Well, he goes to give a supena to this guy and witnesses the guy get murdered. He panics, throws his roach (marijuana) out and flees the scene. Now, some things that bugged me about this were: the location. The killers, weren't disguised and the area was residential. I forgot to mention that one of the killers runs a drug ring where he sells marijuana. So, this is a pretty big guy. Who in their right mind would kill someone where they could easily be seen? Well, anyways, Dale goes to his dealers house, Saul played by James Franco. I like to mention that his character reminded me a lot of Brad Pitt's character from True Romance. Well, anyway they find out that the marijuana that Dale threw out earlier was rare and Saul was the only one who had it. So, thinking that the killers would trace it back to them, they fled to the woods. The whole movie is one adventure after another and even though the story is rehashed and clich√©d; it had it's moments.<br/><br/>Just don't go in with high exceptions. It's a stoner film. There's not a whole lot you can do with a story about two potheads. We pretty much scene everything from best, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" to worst, ""Biodome"". I just don't see why people still think something's missed in the genre.<br/><br/>I give it a 5/10 for having some originality."

","The two leads obviously had lots of fun playing stoners and the chemistry was good. I didn't feel the writing was as strong as in other Apatow/Rogen flicks, nor was it as funny. To be fair, I think it would be much more amusing for viewers familiar with weed (or on it... ;-). The action part of this comedy was OK although I can barely remember any of it now. I do wonder if it detracted instead of helped. It has a few inspired comedic moments but there were stretches, especially near the end, that were just so-so. Nothing much to say about the directing, as usual for those movies, it's competent but you don't really notice anything extraordinary.

"meeza","3","2","6","9 May 2009"," A sour Pineapple taste! Yuck!!!
","A ""Pineapple Express"" movie a day, keeps the viewers away! And that is an understatement on how atrocious and rotten this Pineapple tasted to my movie appetite. ""Pineapple Express"" is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I am sorry producer king Judd Apatow, but your comedy streak express has come to a halt. Apatow has produced, written, and directed a core of elite comedies in the last few years including: ""Knocked Up"", ""Step Brothers"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""Superbad"", ""I Love You, Man"" and even the overrated but adequate ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". But Apatow has manufactured his first cinematic monstrosity. ""Pineapple Express"" is a foolish & disintegrated film about two stoner dudes who get in a high heap of trouble when one of them witnesses a murder. Seth Rogen plays Dale Denton. Dale is a court-process clerk who buys drugs from drug dealer Saul Silver played by James Franco. Dale is cerebrally dormant, profoundly egotistical, and conclusively annoying. Dale is close to his 30's and has a high school girlfriend, which makes him an even creepier character. Saul is your archetypical, lethargic illegal pharmaceutical rep (yea, you got it!) who does constant product testing to most of the hash he sells; if you get my drift. Dale is definitely in the list of Saul's preferred customers. In a token of appreciation, Saul lets Dale smoke & keep his most unique and valued possession: the Pineapple Express hashish. In one of his court-process ""you've been served"" trips, Dale witnesses a murder. The killers are drug dealing kingpin Ted Jones badly played by Gary Cole and corrupt police officer Carol badly played by Rosie Perez. Ted & Carol witness that Dale witnessed the crime. Dale drops his Pineapple doobie after freaking out cause of the shooting and Ted's puff of the Pineapple leads the trail to Saul. The Doobie Brothers themselves, Saul and Dale, consequently go on the run to evade Ted's hit men crew. Saul and Dale hook up with an even more ridiculous character, drug dealer Red. Danny McBride's performance as Red should have been caught red-handed as an exercise in acting futility. The rest of the film is high on despicable irrelevant gore and burned-out marijuana expositions/references. Director David Gordon Green, who is a master of the art house independent film, must have either been offered lots of green to direct the movie or smoked lots of green in directing the movie. Either way, I hope the very talented Mr. Green does not go into this wasted movie Greenland again. Rogen co-wrote the script with longtime collaborator & best buddy Evan Goldberg. They also collaborated for the 'Superbad"" screenplay which was super good, but the ""Pineapple Express"" was ¬Ö¬Ö (Doy! Fill in the blanks! What do you think I was going to say?) I am still gagging! And I am still mind boggled how James Franco was in the company of the Golden Globe Awards' Best Actor (Comedy/Musical) nominees; to be frank with you, any amateur actor could have played his stoner drug dealer role. And let me not get started on Rogen! Seth, what happened? Not very Sethy here buddy! There is no need to travel on the ""Pineapple Express"" through your cinematic journeys. Take the highway home and stay away!!!! Now!!!!!!!! * Failure"
"SebaZava","8","2","6","4 May 2009"," A hilarious comedy experience
","At last, I finally watched Pineapple Express. I didn't have the opportunity of seeing it in theatres because it was never released in Peru, so the moment it was released on Blu-Ray, I ordered, watched it, and well... here I am. I'm one of those people who totally loved Apatow's previous productions involving Seth Rogen (The 40 year old virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad), so I guess I had pretty big expectations for their latest production... and they didn't disappoint. The best thing about the movie is that it manages to combine several genres - action, buddy movie, comedy - so effectively, and that the pairing of Seth Rogen and James Franco works so well. It also helps that a seasoned, indie director like David Gordon Green has directed the film. Despite the fact that most wouldn't think of him as the ideal choice to direct the movie, he proves he's perfect for the material. He gets it, and has clearly enjoyed shooting it.<br/><br/>If there's one particular thought I had the moment the movie ended, it was ""this is the most random film I've ever seen."" But I mean it as a compliment. Nothing in this movie seems staged - as random as most of the things that occur are - most of them consequence of the fact that Ted believes Dale to be a professional hit-man -, they feel like natural events that occur within the flow of the situations. It's obvious quite a bit of improvisation occurred during the filming of the movie, and it works to its advantage. Something very curious about Pineapple Express is that, with the exception of a seemingly-immortal character, and unlike most comedy leading men, none of the protagonists seem to live in a cartoon world. Things have and they have their consequences. The film, despite being a lighthearted comedy, has a couple of dark elements, and plenty of R-rated violence.<br/><br/>But don't take me wrong. Pineapple Express is very funny. Not all jokes work, but most of them do, and most of them made me laugh out loud. There are plenty of memorable one-liners - many of them a result of the actors' improvisational skills, I'm sure - and even the violence is at times funny. Consider the movie a parody of action movies and buddy comedies. As Seth Rogen states during one of the Blu Ray extras - it's an action movie, but with every character being stoned during the action. Although the film is pretty low-budget, even the action sequences look great - take the car chase, for example - and have a comedic edge to them that serves the movie really well.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen is awesome as usual - a comedic genius, although many people are getting tired of him due to overexposure. Still, one can't deny that he has both acting and comedic chops. In here, he surprisingly plays the ""straight man"", a normal guy - who isn't particularly goofy - involved in a very surrealistic situation. On the other hand, James Franco plays the goofier sort of character, and he does it amazingly. He exhibits a perfect comedic timing, and some of his lines are the funniest in the whole film. Danny McBride is equally great - especially during the movie's bloated finale -, and cameos by Bill Hader and James Remar (as a tongue-in-cheek type of general) are memorable and laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is not as good as the aforementioned The 40 year old virgin and Knocked Up, but it comes really close. Its main problem is its running time - being almost two hours long, I believe a couple of scenes and gags could've been cut in order to come up with a more tautly-paced version of the movie. It doesn't help either that I've only seen the extended, ""unrated"" version, although I guess the ""normal"" version of the film has the same problem - after all, this new version is barely six minutes longer. Still, despite its long running time, Pineapple Express never bored me, as it constantly surprised me with its great performances, hilarious one-liners, pop culture references and overall spoof of action movie conventions and buddy comedy moments. Like most Apatow productions, it is not a comedy in the traditional sense of the word - this one contain quite a lot of violence and some dark moments - but it works beautifully as it is."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","6","26 April 2009"," Average comedy with a few highs
","Rogen and Apatow are probably responsible for the bulk of half-decent comedies coming out of Hollywood these days, although even they are prone to the occasional dud. This one - which definitely isn't a dud - follows the misadventures of Saul, a minor league drug dealer and his best customer Dale Denton, a going-nowhere process server who find themselves on the run from both cops and villains after Dale witnesses the murder of a man by Ted (Gary Cole), another drug dealer a couple of dozen rungs up the ladder from Saul.<br/><br/>The story is an uneasy combination of low-level humour and violent action, a curious choice which, together with a protracted final sequence, is one of the film's major weaknesses. Where the film scores is with the central performances from James Franco and Seth Rogen as the hapless heroes who spend most of their time either in a narcotic haze or a state of high anxiety. Rogen pretty much repeats his trademark affable everyman which has stood him in good stead so far and still seems to be working well. James Franco maybe isn't as well known for comic performances but he holds his own against Rogen. Danny McBride also scores as Red, the duo's luckless friend whose survival of a succession of fatal injuries harks back to the violent Warner cartoons of the 40s and 50s.<br/><br/>To be honest, the biggest laughs were all up there in the trailer, but there's enough here to keep you entertained, even if a slightly too long running time means you won't be too disappointed when the final credits roll."
"wendsday","10","2","6","23 February 2009"," Excellent
","This was one of the most hysterical movies I have ever seen.

The movie just seemed like everyone who was on cast or crew had an excellent time. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and I myself have seen it more than once. I also think that the costumes design was fantastic, specifically James Franco's ( Saul's) pants. It just kinda seems like some thing that could happen to a person and there stoner dealer . I think it gets funnier every time. The two main characters of this film appeared at the 81st Academy Awards, and reprized their roles for the comedy section of the movie. Bringing them back was a great idea, i think there should actually be a sequel or even a television show."

","I had few expectations about this film although I was intrigued by it. American humour, for me, either works completely and is laugh out loud or completely misses the point. This film, however, was different.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan plays Dale Denton, a process server whose job it is to serve people as per the law eg with divorce papers or general legal proceedings. This involves him occasionally wearing a suit and handing legal papers to people who promptly swear back at him. In the meantime, between jobs, he's driving and smoking cannabis. Lots of cannabis. In fact, the whole movie's basic premise is the perils of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and being stoned.<br/><br/>Enter Dale's drug dealer, Saul, an equally stoned and nonsense talking fellow who sells Dale the 'Pineapple Express' of the title, in this case, a particularly 'good' type of marijuana. And rare. So rare, in fact, that after witnessing a murder carried out by a drug dealer and a female cop, Dale dumps his roach and the drug dealer instantly recognises what it is and who he sold it to. Cue: a whole lot of trouble and fun! This film combines some of the daftest and most profane dialogue known to man, but unlike Tarentino's films, which also come packaged with profane language, there isn't the cruelty element. The dialogue is classic American older youth speak. There are some real moments of sheer laugh out loud stupidity, particularly when Saul and Dale realise what a mess they're in and try to sort it out. There are also 'nods' to other films, like Pulp Fiction's Jules and Vincent, in Ted Jones' two completely different hit men and also a big nod to American Beauty when Dale finally meets his girlfriend's parents.<br/><br/>This is not a film to be taken very seriously. It is a lighthearted bit of nonsense but good fun and it has the spectacle of the normally po-faced and rather glum James Franco (of Spiderman fame) driving around with his foot caught in a car windscreen. What's not to like!"

I was even more surprised that I continued to laugh throughout the entire movie and it turned out to be one of my favourite comedies to date. Those who appreciate the ""Anchorman"" sort of over the top humour will love this movie. It was stupid, violent, contained scenarios which would never occur.. none of this mattered as the film still managed to have everyone in the theatre practically wetting themselves. To anyone who thinks they wont find the movie funny because they wont get the drug-related humour, you will still find it as funny as everyone else.

"halohamish","8","2","6","25 August 2008"," A benchmark in the stoner comedy.
","Apatow's genius cinema mind strikes the silver screen once again, this time in the latest hit, Pineapple Express. It stars, yep, you guessed it, Seth Rogen as your average pot smoking guy and James Franco as his hilarious drug dealer. Seth Rogen is, as always, spot on with the comedy, though I can't help but feel his character is almost an exact replica of many others in his other films, especially that of ""Knocked Up"". James Franco is also superb, stealing the screen, showing he should definitely stick to comedy from now on. Most of the other performances, that of McBride, Corrigan and Robinson, are impressive, though Cole and Perez are almost pointless - so much more could have been done with their characters.<br/><br/>But regardless of that, the moment the movie begins it is an hilarious epic full of comedy, violence, crime, drugs, language and plenty of other stuff you haven't ever seen before in cinema. But what was most appealing to me about this movie was its utter uniqueness. Green has done a great job in taking a risk and creating something completely different, weird, absurd yet brilliant all at the same time, blending the type of humor we're all familiar with Green's own wonderfully strange touches.<br/><br/>With all that said, though, I know not everyone will like it, including regular Apatow fans, as it is a bizarre, profanity filled ride not for everyone's tastes. But I definitely encourage you to take the ride and see for yourself. Personally, Apatow and Green achieve again.<br/><br/>8.5/10 Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions"

","Rather than pay homage to great action-buddy comedies of the 1980s - films like Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop - Pineapple express merely tries to be one. Of course it's impossible to perfectly recreate the period, and some contemporary sensibilities have made their way on screen - but nothing particularly distracting. Weed is a MacGuffin here, and those expecting a stoner comedy should rent a Cheech and Chong film (also, change your underwear and get a job, you bum).<br/><br/>Franco nearly walks away with this film. It's been a while since you see an actor in a comedy completely disappear into a role. But it's McBride, the latest of Apatow's man-children (and hopefully the last - he's great, but how many more can you have?), who is the revelation. His improvisational talents and brief screen time make him more of a secret weapon.<br/><br/>Gary Cole is having a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Rosie Perez warning in full effect - but she doesn't say much.<br/><br/>Great cameos from Ed Begley Jr. and Bill Hader."
"axis38","6","2","6","16 August 2008"," Pineapple Express...
","... is the new Apatow/Rogen effort, about a pair of stoners on the run from the city's drug lords. I had fairly high expectations from it, because I found Apatow's major projects (40 y.o. Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) to be all quite enjoyable. The reviews were mixed, leaning towards positive (I think it's something like 62% on Rottentomatoes), but I paid them no heed. Somehow I felt Apatow could do no wrong-no, I haven't seen Dewey Cox, Drillbit Taylor or Stepbrothers.<br/><br/>It was a bit disappointing. I was expecting a genre-typical, but high quality male bonding buddy comedy, like Superbad. From the looks of the trailers, that was how it was billed. This turned out to be a mistake, because it was rather, a rather ham fisted parody of the genre. You get the feeling that Apatow and Rogen have let the success get to their heads and decided to fore go the script editing process and instead indulge themselves in shoving in every drugs/stoner/male bonding movie clich√© into its nearly 2 hour run time.<br/><br/>On average, every 5 to 10 minutes or so this formula pays off, and there are some genuinely funny moments- be warned though, a lot of them are the type that leave you raising your eyebrows and sharing looks of disbelief with your mates. In between though, there's a whole lot of unfunny, seemingly improv-ed dialogue riffing that was probably more enjoyable to write than to hear.<br/><br/>At heart, it's a fun B-grade movie parody in the tradition of Snakes on a Plane, and should not be regarded as anything more. I would call it self-aware, but only as far as stoners are self-aware. Worth a rental, but you might want to spare your money for the cinema unless your friends are dragging you along.<br/><br/>3/5"
"bobsgrock","6","2","6","12 August 2008"," Not quite on the level.
","I'll be honest; I've only seen one Apatow comedy and that would be earlier this year with Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That was funny, raunchy and yet had a sweet romance to it and some interesting points on relationships. Here we have a stoner comedy with a lot of pot and a lot of violence all mixed together. Seth Rogen and James Franco play a buyer and a dealer respectively, who go on the run after Rogen witnesses a murder. All plot points aside, they end up in a huge drug war that made me think of what caused the aftermath in No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>To be honest, this wasn't my type of movie and for that reason alone I should not have gone to see it. Don't get me wrong, I laughed many times especially when Franco is talking about the beauty of his rare marijuana, Pineapple Express. Still, I cannot and will not condone the type of behavior that goes on in this story. It really all comes down to a bunch of crazy, greedy, stoned people who end up going at each other with guns. The first half is very high and the second half is very violent. These two don't mix very well and the result is rather distasteful. As good as Franco and Rogen are, I cannot recommend this due to its excessively violent nature and realistic tone. Yes, it's only a movie and should be treated as such. However, it feels so real you wonder if this actually happened or the characters were really high."

Frequently hilarious action-comedy from Judd Apatow's never-ending quest to conquer the cinematic comedy world producing another fine example of low-brow, filthy tongued and smart dialogue driven 'bro-mance' this time with Rogen (who co-scripted with partner Evan Goldberg and Apatow) as a process server in LA whose only ambition is to get stoned via his slacker dealer (Franco surprisingly hysterical and joining the elite pantheon of truly excellent stoners the likes including Spicoli, The Dude and Floyd, the later character of TRUE ROMANCE is practically a kissing cousin and trajectory for the film's plot) who find themselves embroiled in a drug war when Rogen witnesses a brutal killing by a corrupt cop (Perez) and Franco's distributor (Cole) and end up on the run with Franco to save their hides. Frenetic, fast and funny with some unexpected violence permeating particularly in the final act but even more unexpected is indie wunderkind David Gordon Green at the helm in this '80s buddy film meets '70s AIP exploitation flick. Fun closing tune by Huey Lewis & the News. Totally baked, man, totally!"
"truefire","6","2","6","8 August 2008"," don't expect much and maybe you will like it.
","I had high expectations for this movie since they started hyping it over the winter. So I saw it and I was utterly disappointed. It seemed like an unfinished movie. editing was terrible. there was no continuity between scenes. things just happened then they smoked and went somewhere else and smoked and so on. a lot of the movie was just them smoking and trying to be funny. When I was watching it, I felt like all the funny scenes were shown in the preview already. Nothing really made me laugh. a couple chuckles here and there and a funny reference to a Rancor from rotj. other than that it was rather boring. I know there were being innovative with the whole cross genre thing, but the blood and gore didn't really fit well in the movie. The one good thing that stood out was James Franco. His character was greatly intriguing maybe because I have never seen him play a role like this and it was refreshing. he did a fine job. However, Seth Rogan was horrible. His whole look at me I'm a stoner and I'm proud so I write movies about it and then write myself into the lead role thing is tired and boring. This is definitely his worst screenplay yet which is a shame because it is his best idea yet. granted, I didn't get stoned to see the movie so maybe that is why I disliked it so. still, I lauhged more at Gigli.<br/><br/>6/10 bonus points for the rancor reference."
"StackedActor","9","2","6","7 August 2008"," So much better than I expected
","Half stoner movie, half cheesy action movie (intentionally). I was expecting this movie to be funny, but I thought it would not be as good as Superbad or Knocked Up. I was so wrong. The acting and humor both exceeded my expectations. I thought James Franco was going to overact, but he was spot on. Same for Seth Rogen. They are a great comedic duo and I look forward to seeing them in more films together. Many familiar faces from other Judd Apatow productions appear and are perfect additions that make this movie funnier. All in all this is a movie that any Seth Rogen/Superbad/Knocked Up fan should see. It will definitely make you laugh."
"MacAindrais","Null","2","6","7 August 2008"," Comedy as an artform.
","Pineapple Express (2008) ***1/2 It was one of the last names you expected to see helming an Apatow joint - David Gordon Green. Yes, the indie art filmmaker, of George Washington and Undertow fame. Being a fan of a) Green, b) the silly but sweet stylings of Apatow, Rogen, et al, and c) marijuana, I was definitely in for this one.<br/><br/>And yes, I will admit, I was under the influence when I saw this picture. Does it matter? Despite what the critics say, I really don't think so. Then again I was high, what do I know? Seth Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server who happens to love smoking weed, and has aspirations to become a talk radio host. His dealer is Saul, played hilariously by James Franco (yea you read that right, he's damn funny). After buying some extremely rare weed from Saul, Dale goes to serve one Ted Jones, the guy who sold the weed to the guy who sold the weed to Saul, who is the only guy in the entire city with it. Got that? Dale sees a lady cop (Perez) and Ted (Cole) kill a man in cold blood, and being high, you know, like, totally freaks out. He tosses the roach, and flees to Saul's place. They put 2 and 2 together, and realize they better get the hell out. From here on out, they are chased by Cole's henchmen, and must find ways to hide, until high school girlfriends, old age home grannies and dead cats are brought into the mix. Meanwhile, they make use of pretty much every action movie clich√© along the way.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is very, very funny, in that lackadaisical random conversation kind of way. If you're into that kind of humor, I'm sure you'll love it. Meanwhile, the action scenes are quite well done, and choreographed to comedic effect right down to the staple one liners (you've been served, bitch).<br/><br/>Among the funnier characters in the film is Red, played by Danny McBride. He not only continues to sell out the heroes while trying to be their friend, but continues to get beat up, shot, and live to hilarious effect. Also funny is the final shootout, which makes full use of the action movie rule that when you run out of bullets, you will immediately find a new fully loaded fun within arms reach.<br/><br/>Green's finger prints are evident throughout the film, although I'm sure most viewers will be paying no attention to that. As Kubrick once mused about making a porno, Green takes that a step further by making a buddy action comedy. Its not just in the great tradition of 80s staples, but more or less is one. Green is one of the great young filmmakers working today, with credits such as George Washington and the highly underrated and overlooked Undertow.<br/><br/>The film-making is assured, with Green taking on board his usual crew. Tim Orr's cinematography and compositions are quite refreshing in a comedy. He and Green continue to make use of wide shots, flowing camera movement, and simply just great cinematography. Green also employs his usual great editing style. This time he makes some great use of classic scene transitions and wipes that are nice to see on the big screen again.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express certainly is funny, yes. What sets the movie apart though is Green's direction. He clearly had a ball making this picture, and the unique style in this comedy is likely to send more big budget work his way. Although, I'm sure I speak for everyone, when I say please remember to stick to your artful small films. On the other hand, I'm sure I speak for many of you when I say, kudos good sir."

","Bro, this was vastly overrated bro, like, bro. Stoner comedies man, just not my vibe. Smokin' pot, laughin' life away, everything becomes exaggeratively dumb and annoying. Yeah, man. Pineapple Express. Smoke it. On a serious note, as soon as I saw ""from the guys that brought you Superbad"" (another overrated snooze-fest) I knew this wasn't my batch of weed. Apparently this comedy hosts plenty of laughs, yet predictably, I did not laugh once. A stoner and his drug dealer are on the run after witnessing a police officer and businessman murder an individual.<br/><br/>So, all the shenanigans and apparent bountiful scenes of laughter, are produced from breathing in ""Pineapple Express"". The pot that would put all ceramic production plants out of business. Bad joke aside, the strength of the film's plot is Rogen and Franco's undeniable chemistry which in turn threw their career trajectories in the correct angle. They hold the story together, and for the most part, are a joy to watch. A shame that Rogen and Goldberg's screenplay truly was absent of any legitimate laughs. I suspect this is down to personal taste. As a person who has never been high and never will be, watching the characters run around in the woods at night screaming and shouting that they are afraid of the dark, is a scenario that I do not and will never relate to. In fact, many of the scenes just pass by without infiltrating my impenetrable soul.<br/><br/>The plot itself was a simple cat-and-mouse crime caper that takes second place to the ""comedy"". The third act, consisting of a gratuitous shootout at a marijuana factory, was amusing and illustrated some genuine memorable characters. Mostly McBride's Red who just does not want to die. Director Green does integrate some well edited action sequences, particularly a car chase, that adds some much needed excitement. Alas, Pineapple Express is one unfunny locomotive that I shan't be jumping on again anytime soon. ""Murder on the Pineapple Express"" may have been more apt..."

","Rogen and Franco are Dale and Saul, a couple of weed-smoking slackers who get involved in a murder. This type of movie is usually targeted to a young audience and tends to be filled with gross profane jokes, bad language and stupidity. Here we have plenty of bad language and stupidity, but the jokes are actually quite funny. <br/><br/>Having mostly seen Franco in ""serious"" movies, I was surprised by his comic skills. He is hilarious as the perpetually stoned Saul, blurting out one idiotic sentence after the other. He is also very cute and a bit of eye candy never hurts. Rogen seems always to play the same part of obnoxious, lazy looser, but here he was funnier and slightly more energetic than usual.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were actually hilarious and sort of believable, with people hitting each other like in real life, without any spectacular stunt. They ""just"" punched randomly, often hitting the wrong target and screaming in pain. <br/><br/>Danny McBride in the supporting role of Red is also funny and so is Begley Jr. in the small role of the crazy father of Dale's girlfriend."
"rmax304823","6","1","2","13 April 2017"," This is their brains on drugs.
","A description of the characters and the plot make the film sound as silly as an old Popeye cartoon, but it does have its moments and adults ought to find it almost as amusing as its target audience of teens. You'd never think laughs could still be gotten out of weed heads but marijuana works here as a kind of plot engine. If it weren't for some dynamite pot known as ""Pineapple Express,"" nothing would have happened.<br/><br/>It's Los Angeles and there are two high-echelon drug organizations at war -- one run by Gary Cole, the other by Asians. The two protagonists -- Rogen and Franco -- are everyday users, with Franco a small time dealer and Rogen a process server. (Franco, in all seriousness, ""What do you serve? Like, hamburgers?"") Rogen witnesses a murder by Cole, flips away his roach and flees the scene with a great deal of commotion. Cole watches the car speed away, picks up the discarded butt, puffs on it, and says ""Pineapple Express."" Alas, the brand is so rare that it can easily be traced to dealer Franco. Realizing this, and it's one of the few things they DO realize, Rogen and Franco hastily pack up and leave everything behind. The rest of the movie is largely a story of pursuit, with shootings, a high speed car chase, various explosions and a general atmosphere of hysteria.<br/><br/>It's pretty funny. The most outrageous performance is by Seth Rogen who gives expert imitations of flooding out with fear, screaming hoarsely, waving his arms, weeping. Franco, comparatively speaking, has a Zen quality about him. Craig Robinson, as a semi-moronic hit man, gives a splendid performance and is given some good lines. ""You know, I may look tough but I have feelings too, and you just hurt every one of them."" But then many of the lines are -- well, not exactly WITTY, but funny nevertheless. While they are discussing their perilous situation, Rogen asks Franco if it's really possible for Cole and his gang to track them down. How could they do it? Franco, befuddled by dope, muses, ""I don't know. Bloodhounds maybe. Dogs. Barracudas."" There's a good deal of slapstick at the end during a bloody but still comic shootout, but that too is well choreographed. Grownups ought to get a kick out of at least some of the scenes and some of the dialog."

","If I ever got together with a group of my friends and made a movie, it would probably turn out to be a lot like Pineapple Express. It's an action/comedy in the vein of Get Smart, but minus the spies and with an R rating and some weed thrown in. <br/><br/>All the different parts of the movie work well. The action scenes are hilarious, the dialogue is hilarious...it's the funniest overall movie that I've seen since Zack and Miri Make a Porno. We're talking about some of the most hysterical fight scenes that I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Rogen and McBride do their usual thing (which I honestly don't think I will ever get tired of), but Franco's jocose character was completely unexpected. I never knew he had it in him!<br/><br/>I'm glad to know that Rogen is a guy that I can always count on for some laughs. Pineapple Express doesn't leave much room for criticism. There's a dangling little plot threat with Amber Heard that I would have liked to see addressed at the end of the movie, but that's only because I thought the other scenes between Seth and Amber were so funny. If that's the most that I can find to complain about, then there's nothing left for me to do except admit that Pineapple Express is simply a great comedy."
"crackedfan9128","7","1","2","18 January 2016"," Overrated? Please.
","In light of the disappointment of THE INTERVIEW, looking back on PINEAPPLE EXPRESS gives me even more appreciation for it. The use of comic timing was incredibly refreshing, and there were so many moments of off-beat humor that made me laugh my ass off. Much of the humor comes from the main duo's incompetence in all situations, due to their consumption of the devil's lettuce, and that might not seem like a good setup. However, there are some clever nuanced moments that are quite well-crafted.<br/><br/>Granted, I don't think the humor is for everyone and some moments are cringe-inducingly childish, but there's something to be said for this awkward, comedy-of-errors type feel that's present in this film.<br/><br/>A masterpiece? By no means.<br/><br/>Hilarious? Hell, yeah.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to have a good time with a movie that isn't COMPLETELY brainless, but don't want to think too much, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS is the comedy for you."
"dyanordakowski","9","1","2","15 December 2014"," great movie
","Pineapple Express is a very funny and entertaining movie. There was not a moment of this movie where I was bored or not laughing. The wonderful duo, Seth Rogan and James Franco, do a fantastic acting job in this movie and keep up their reputation of being a well-working pair. Yes, this is a comedy, but it also tells an original story in which is easy to get lost in. Pineapple Express also focuses on the importance of friendship and there is glorious friendship development between Red, Saw, and Dale from beginning to end. This is a comedy but it could also be argued that this is an action movie as well which gives an appealing quality to the viewing of this movie. The story line, plot, and characters are all on point."
"jboothmillard","6","1","2","10 December 2011"," Pineapple Express
","From producer Judd Apatow and the creators of Knocked Up and Superbad, I assumed this film was something to do with trains when I heard about it LOL, but when I saw it advertised I was up for it. Basically Dale Denton (Seth Rogen, also writing) doesn't have a proper job, a clerk delivering court-process letters, and he constantly gets stoned, always going to his faithful dealer Saul Silver (Golden Globe nominated James Franco) who is just as lazy as him. Saul has a new drug amongst his usual weed, a rare new strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express, and after buying this Dale witnesses a man he was due to deliver a letter to get murdered by corrupt police officer Carol (White Men Can't Jump's Rosie Perez). Knowing that someone witnessed the murder, drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole) spots the Pineapple Express joint, and he knows it is only sold by one dealer, so he sends henchmen Budlofsky (Kevin Corrigan) and Matheson (Craig Robinson) to deal with Saul's dealer Red (Danny McBride). Dale realises that the gangster will be after him, so the two of them go on the run, and after sleeping in the woods they go and see Red and see if they are in danger, but it turns into a big fight, and after they conclude that they should flee the city. Dale decides that his girlfriend Angie Anderson (Drive Angry's Amber Heard) and her parents Robert (Ed Begley Jr.) and Shannon (Nora Dunn) should warn them about what is going on, they don't believe him, but Budlofsky and Matheson do stop by their house, but not before they go into hiding. To raise money and leave town Saul sells off his Pineapple Express, and Dale ends up arrested trying to, but he convinces the police that Brazier is corrupt, Saul saves him by hijacking a police car, and they narrowly miss Brazier trying to kill them in a chase. After an argument where friendship was questioned the two friends part ways, and while visiting his grandmother Saul spots the two henchmen looking for him, and they kidnap him taking him to Ted's lair. After trying to get a just about alive Red to help him, Dale manages to get kidnapped as well, and the two friends back together, in captivity in the underground army base full of marijuana, they do make up. They are only able to escape when a rival Asian drug lord storms the base, and the brawl ends in both Ted and Brazier killed, and Red saves them as well. They manage to get out of the place alive, and just in time before a bomb exploded, and in the end Dale, Saul and Red have a celebratory meal in a caf√©, and all agree to go to hospital together when the grandmother picks them up. Also starring Bill Hader as Private Miller, James Remar as General Bratt and The Hangover's Ken Jeong as Ken. Rogen and Franco do great as the two drugs smoking buddies on the run, and the other actors all do their parts fine as well, it is a reasonably simple story, but the getting high and gangster situation jokes do rather well, and this is a really fun bromance film, a fun action crime comedy. Good!"
"cpreece-2","6","4","19","7 August 2008"," Close, but NO Cheech and Chong
","For the stoner or common movie goer out for a good laugh, one thing became very apparent after the first 20 minutes of Pineapple Express...this is not your typical drug infused slapstick. At first, this comedy changed action flick seems to be headed down a purely blazed out light-headed-laughter path...the proverbial yellow brick road that has been the crutch of classics ranging from the aforementioned Cheech and Chong to Dazed and Confused and new crops like How High and Half Baked. Yet, suddenly, like a bad buzz-kill, the movie switches gears from comedy to suspense to action. It is almost as if a different director and set of writers hijacked the film and turned it into your common boneheaded shoot-em up bang-bang. Indeed, I beg those with a few minutes to spare to check out the original Pineapple Express preview at the end of Superbad and see if any connections can be made from that preview to an action movie.<br/><br/>While there are laughs and crack-ups to be found scattered throughout the film, the Schizophrenic plot and mediocre cast of ultimately forgettable characters and performances drags the movie down immensely. Just like any of the great comedic brains, Seth Rogen and co-writers Evan Goldberg and Jud Apatow fall short on a dime of a movie. (Hey at least they aren't like Wil Ferrell who is rounding out his hit list of bad movies) With varying genres and a seemingly undecided viewpoint on marijuana, Pineapple Express left many at the theater with a good laugh and a few ""Remember whens"" but unlike other Rogen movies, nothing stood out - both acting and pure laughter wise to make even the heaviest toker take a second hit. For those that wish, it is always best to try it once; but don't be surprised if you find yourself saying ""Puff, Puff, Pass!"""

"Jonny_Numb","3","2","7","9 September 2009"," Less Than Half-Baked
","To Seth Rogen, being Seth Rogen must be a great thing: he starred in the under-appreciated sitcom ""Freaks and Geeks"" and was swept up into commercially successful comedies, often featuring much of the ensemble players from the show and guided by the sometimes-astute, sometimes-labored hand of writer/director Judd Apatow. If the likes of ""Knocked Up"" and ""Observe and Report"" are any indication, America has fallen head-over-banana-peels for this guy...and I just don't get it. ""Pineapple Express"" is another entry into the Rogen pantheon (he co-scripted with Evan Goldberg), a film that takes the tired Stoner Comedy to yawnsome new lows. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server who delivers subpoenas to people, has an uber-hot high-school girlfriend (Amber Heard), and spends most of his lazy days in a stoned stupor (typical gag: he calls radio talk-shows complaining about how pot hasn't yet been legalized!), courtesy of supplier Saul (James Franco). But when he witnesses a mob murder while puffing on the titular weed, Dale and Saul are thrown into a half-assed action-movie plot where they are pursued by police, Asian gangsters, and Gary Cole (a fine character actor who deserves much better). For a film that crawls toward the 2-hour mark, ""Pineapple Express"" is loaded with filler, and many scenes (a seemingly improvised exchange between Rogen and Franco in the woods early on sets the tedious tone) seem to directly bank on the notion that most of the audience will be too high to tell the difference. More like a second sequel in the ""Harold and Kumar"" franchise than an actual comedy, the only thing that goes toward redeeming this remarkably laughless film is the deft direction of David Gordon Green (""Undertow""), who imbues a distinctive sense of style and pace to a less-than-worthy screenplay."
"CelluloidRehab","5","2","7","30 March 2009"," Disappointed. Tropic Thunder is the real deal.
","I have to come out and set the record straight: I am not a fan of Judd Apatow or his minions (especially Seth Rogen & Danny McBride). I never saw more than one episode of Freaks & Geeks and didn't break a smile when I saw the 40 Year Old Virgin. I thought Knocked Up was an evolutionary step for the geek character (maturation), but at the end, instead it falls into a mixed-up, end-justifies-the-means philosophy that contradicts the true nature of the geek.Looking at a list of Apatow's writing/directing/producing credits, only the Cable Guy & Walk Hard,would I consider funny or better than average. He has created this chic-geek template which he just transplants to a new scenario. This wouldn't be so bad if he didn't use a group of similar guys in very similar roles, playing themselves in each one of those. PE is not directed by Judd, but he does have writing and producing credits. As Tim Burton keeps acting out father issues and Woody Allen struggles with his sexual inadequacies on screen; Judd Apatow has geek issues/trauma.<br/><br/>This is the geek-chic scenario in a stoner movie with action scenes. Rogen is a late 20/early 30-something, subpoena delivery, court-clerk stoner, who's dating a high school senior. James Franco is his dealer (a good hearted stoner as well), who has a strain of ""pineapple express"" cannabis. Rogen witnesses a murder, but leaves behind the roach. That roach connects Rogen to the pineapple express which connects him to Franco. The result is a stoner, buddy movie (typical of the genre Cheech & Chong created) with over-the-top, bloodless action.<br/><br/>I have seen a variety of stoner movies, either made with or for stoners. The stoner part is almost identical throughout the movies: hallucinations, uncontrolled laughing, red eyes, cotton mouth, random ramblings, poor logic process & decision-making ability, crazy/random/awkward situations, etc. That part requires an uncanny chemistry between the ""stoners"" to be memorable. Though this movie tries to create an emotional connection between the two main protagonist stoners, it ultimately fails because the goal of the movie is the action. The humor is simple (as in you don't have to think about it and is more similar to a pie to the face or a fart joke, than the life of Oliver Cromwell in song) and implies a certain state-of-mind to appreciate it. A good comedy is funny in a variety of states and I am starting to find that implied required state to be insulting to the target demographic. It is stereotypical and unrealistic of most.<br/><br/>While this movie tries to stand out by adding an extra layer of violence, the problem with the violence is that it seems hyper-realistic & graphic at first, but turns out to be cartoony and unrealistic. I praise the movie for trying something different with this genre, but in the end it fails because it does not go far enough with the one element that is original. The violence angle negates itself by it's own ridiculousness. CG blood still doesn't look real (see 300, Mongol or Rambo for reference). Think of the violence in a Warner Bros cartoon. Recall Elmer Fudd blowing the face off Daffy Duck. Did you feel like anyone was hurt? Are you outraged by the shooting? Does it make you feel anything other than hysterical laughter? Were there any repercussions? For most people all those are going to be answered by an emphatic 'no'. An example of this black, action comedy genre (that succeeds where this fails) is Tropic Thunder (review coming soon). And yes I know Danny McBride is in it, but his comedic influence is mitigated in TT in contrast to his PE role.<br/><br/>The movie teeters dangerously down the divide that separates the two main themes & choosing not to go in either direction. As Mr. Miyagi once said this inevitably leads to being smashed like a grape in the middle. If the movie either stayed on the ridiculous, stoner angle or chose instead to make the violence real (think of the difference between most of Boogie Nights & Wonderland), it would have been more of a success. As I mentioned earlier, I am biased when it comes to this. If you are a fan of Apatow or his brood or are new to the stoner genre, then you might get more enjoyment from this than I did. To me this is just a disposable (cliched and unremarkable) stoner-genre buddy movie that is as disposable as the contents of a Japanese vending machine. BTW, I was thinking of used underwear.<br/><br/>-Celluloid Rehab"

Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Judd Apatow really know how to put together a film that meets your expectations without being completely formulaic, and the writing was superb. I spent a good hour just laughing and talking about the best parts of the movie with a friend, and how there was hardly a dull spot in the film. But it was James Franco, taking a complete 180 on his serious, brooding anti-hero kind of character and becoming the incredibly lovable drug dealer that just MADE it.<br/><br/>I grew up with several stoner kids, and James Franco just made me think of the sweetest, funniest, cuddliest one I knew. His apartment, his clothes, his behavior, it was all so authentic stoner, without making him the outrageously over the top stereotype that would be Spicoli or Cheech and Chong in another era. We all knew Seth Rogen was a funny guy going in, and, while I had faith in James Franco's ability to change it up and tackle a new sort of character from the trailers, I was honestly surprised at how well he was able to steal the show and comedically outshine Rogen.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I wasn't stoned when I went to see it."
"LeninzTomb","10","2","9","5 August 2008"," Apatow & Co. Venture into Action-Comedy...
","...and Succeed with Flying Colors!<br/><br/>""Pineapple Express"" raises the bar for laughs in films made by this group of contemporary comedic geniuses: Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, Bill Hader etc. Seth Rogen shines again, but it is James Franco that steals the show this time as Saul, the drug dealer. Franco's character has some of the most brilliant one-liners I've heard since ""Knocked Up."" And no, his best moments aren't given in the trailer... not by a long shot. <br/><br/>Potential Spoilers Follow: Dale Denton (Rogen) finds himself on the bad side of both a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and a local drug lord, Ted Jones (Gary Cole), after witnessing them murder a hit-man sent by rival Asian drug cartels. Denton and Saul flee, all the while not sure who can be trusted and who cannot. Hilarity ensues as the two try to maintain a low profile while getting high throughout the film. <br/><br/>The last 20 or 25 minutes are particularly exciting and hilarious, as they arm themselves to the teeth and finally throw down (in spectacularly stylized violence) with those who have had them on the run. Franco has some particularly memorable moments in those final minutes. Those scenes blend action and comedy splendidly, and neither are in short supply.<br/><br/>There isn't much, if anything, to complain about the film. If you follow Apatow and the gang and have seen their previous works, then you know what you're in for before you even buy a ticket. ""Pineapple Express"" is another classic and it makes moviegoers wonder if Apatow and Co. are even capable of making a sub-par film. So far, it seems impossible to the nth degree."

","This movie is in my top 5. One of the best comedies ever. Way better than Knocked Up. I don't know why this got low scores, the whole theater was going crazy back when I saw it. I am not a big fan of Seth Rogen, but I loved this movie! <br/><br/>It's about a stoner who witnessed a murder, and him and his dealer are on the run. Both are stoned in every single scene. You feel for the characters, who are very lovable and the development takes the plot from absurdity to laugh-out-loud humor. I hate slapstick, but this so well done. <br/><br/>James Franco is so darn hot, he's absolutely sizzling in this movie. His laid-back drug dealer character is hilarious, but as innocent as a puppy. His smile is an iconic movie landmark. He is so funny as the drug dealer and him and Rogan have great chemistry together All in all, Pineapple Express is a blast, with an endearing quality. Anyone that doesn't find this movie funny...I feel bad for you"

","Pineapple Express (2008): Dir: David Gordon Green / Cast: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Gary Cole, Rosie Perez: Twisted yet innovative dark comedy that goes from extreme humour to heavy action as if the writers were perhaps on something. Title refers to a type of marijuana that lands two stoners in trouble when a murder is witnessed. The underline theme seems to address the mindset and careless actions taken as a result of drugs. Director David Gordon Green improves upon his independent All the Real Girls where his talent is still in its beginner stage. He brings the familiarity of the subject matter within a screenplay littered with hilarious lines. Some viewers may see it as a celebration of illegal substances with violent consequences. Seth Rogan plays a careless stoner whose girlfriend is in high school. James Franco plays his friend who introduces him to the dope. Danny McBride plays the middle man with a high survival rate. Gary Cole plays the drug lord who is at war with Asian dealers but the role is cardboard. Rosie Perez gives a gung ho performance as a no nonsense police woman on the trail. The action is brutal and a complete turnaround from the dope humour previously set as the presumed tone of the film. It brings humour out of the mindset and the rapid spiral into trouble as their so-called innocent lifestyle births its nightmare. Score: 7 ¬Ω / 10"

","It is a great movie of which i think is more of a stoner comedy. Suited for any age. It shows a great performance by (in real life friends) Seth Rogen and James Franco. While also a very good performance by Danny Mcbride. It is a movie that gives way to the 2014 ""the interview"" where Seth Rogen and James Franco play again side by side.<br/><br/>It is a easy to watch stoner comedy with a good story but makes much room for comedy which are used to from Seth Rogen. It is a great movie to watch in the weekend nights if you just want to relax. And not worry about to complicated story lines and just laugh while all of the movie happens."

","Seth Rogen and James Franco star in ""Pineapple Express,"" a 2008 film, directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by Rogen.<br/><br/>Rogen and Franco are Dale Denton and Saul Silver, two potheads. Saul is a dealer and has some exciting new stuff called Pineapple Express. He gives Dale a preview. Unfortunately Dale witnesses a murder of a drug kingpin and drops his roach at the murder site. Since no one else has this new grass, the murderers (Gary Cole and Rosie Perez) put things together pretty easily. Soon, Dale and Saul are on the run, stoned out of their minds.<br/><br/>While this film doesn't beat the insanity of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" it comes pretty close. Rogen and Franco are hilarious together. They have great chemistry. The scene with the cell phones in the woods is a killer and really had me laughing. They're so stoned they barely know their names throughout. Dale's appearance at his teenage girlfriend's house is another scream. The ending is actually quite exciting and while violent, it's been set up so that the violence is actually more comic book than disturbing.<br/><br/>Lots of very funny moments in this. I think we can all remember a time in our youth when we were so out of it, from booze or grass, that we couldn't quite focus but tried. These guys project that feeling beautifully in excellent performances."

Don't get me wrong it was funny but not humor a lot of people might think funny. I thought it was hilarious but there is not that many moments it becomes more of an action film.<br/><br/>This movie is about a process server named Dale(Rogen)who one day while smoking a joint witnesses a murder. He drives quickly to his pot dealers house to hide out. They leave and go into hiding together trying to avoid the hit men who are after them all the while getting into stoned mishaps.<br/><br/>This movie was good I just wish they had put more jokes in it. Though the jokes they did have were solid and the dialouge was really good."

","Why did I watch this movie could be another topic of discussion. Out of ideas, devoid of choices, I made the decision to watch this one. Plot is simple. The protagonist of the movie ,A 'process server' (I heard the job-name for the first time in my life) is a witness to a murder committed by a corrupt female cop and a very powerful drug lord. To escape from their clutches, he along with his local drug-dealer friend run helter-skelter and get into this comedy of errors involving other drug -dealers, cops, Asians and what not . After a sequence of car chases, gun shots, getting high on weed etc, the true meaning of friendship dawns upon the lead actors and the movie ends happily, and a sigh of relief for the viewer.<br/><br/>The movie has got a collection of bad to worse to worst actors. So keep no expectations on the acting front. Yes, James Franco is a saving grace with his 'high on weed' antics. But some 2-3 good hilarious moments cannot save an entire movie from mediocrity. Overall, a below average movie with 2-3 fun moments. Watch it only if you are high on weed or severely drunk .<br/><br/>Rating : 6/10"
"obscurecinema","5","1","3","1 March 2009"," Oddly amusing at first, although I do not know why.
","I cannot quite put my finger on why I laughed at certain points, or why I felt it went off the rails and devolved into something remarkably unfunny. Although, I do know at what point my favor turned...<br/><br/>It started off funny enough. The big hairy guy plays a process server who really gets into his job of serving people legal papers. Then, it gets mildly thrilling and adds some graphic violence that is shocking for a comedy, but oddly exactly what the film needed.<br/><br/>Then, at one point, the camera lingers on the two villains after the scene ""ends"" and they obviously start to ""improv"" and they break character completely. I expect that sort of masturbatory silliness on the Extended Version, but this was the Theatrical Version! From that moment on I was taken from the movie's reality and brought back to my couch where, not stoned, I finished watching with mild interest."
"doctorsmoothlove","6","1","3","29 September 2008"," Best watched while stoned
","I had a positive experience with Pineapple Express. Not only did I watch an amusing film, but I also discovered a new musical artist. For those who remember the trailer, the song played was Paper Planes (the new single from M.I.A.).<br/><br/>This has been the year for stoner comedies. This is the third movie released in only a few months and it's arguably the best of the bunch. I've not yet viewed the first stoner film Strange Wilderness , but with its 0% approval rating on Rottentomatoes, I doubt I will. I was able to catch The Wackness during its theatrical run and I enjoyed it, but I don't think many outside of its youthful target audience would. Pineapple Express is similar to The Wackness in that regard. It's a comedy, thriller, and gangster movie fused into a single picture but with a touch of pubescent humor. The result is a cacophony of watered-down elements from its three influences with extra forced funnies. I liked it but I'm younger than the central characters, so go figure. <br/><br/>The film begins with Dale Denton, a process server who loves his job, visiting his marijuana supplier. Apparently, Dale only dislikes the lost time between delivering subpoenas. His supplier is the eternally stoned and emotionally underdeveloped Saul. Saul's job is to sell pot, and he has lots of it. He gives Denton some pineapple express or high-grade pot. Denton is driving around later that night and witnesses a murder by a corrupt policewoman and drug lord Ted Jones.<br/><br/>Ted discovers Dale's hastily dropped roach and goes after him. Dale flees to Saul's and gets the hell out of there. They hide in the woods and eventually enlist Saul's supplier, Red for help. Red doesn't help and the two are forced to find other means of evasion. This is where the film becomes particularly funny. They sell pot to children, steal a police car, and even contact Dale's underage girlfriend. All of which is essential for their survival. Each event fits into place very well and isn't hyperbolic. A lot of these stoner films (Dude, Where's my Car? comes to mind) become downright silly and lose their humor in acceptance of that silliness. This one doesn't do that. Pineapple Express is required to keep a somewhat serious tone because of its other two ingredients. <br/><br/>Now, despite avoiding capture for so long, Ted and his cronies capture Saul. Dale won't have any of it and vows to save him. He also, coincidentally, needs to deliver a subpoena to Ted. He asks Red for help, which he doesn't get and infiltrates their hideout. Dale isn't successful immediately, but he does rescue Saul with Red's delayed help. A lot of male bonding happens during their firefight with Red. It's reminiscent of a romance but with brotherly dialog in place of sexual chemistry. <br/><br/>Pineapple Express benefits from its loose structure. It is never a complete thriller, comedy, or gangster film but an above average hybrid. The comedic elements parody the gangster elements well. Ted Jones in no way appears like a drug lord and, instead of having a femme ¬ñfatale beauty, he has an overweight cop who is only marginally interested in him. Seth Rogan, as screenwriter, noticed this ability and took advantage of it many times. There's an instance when Dale visits his girlfriend to meet her parents, and too seek refuge from his pursuers. He enters a formal dinner covered in ashes and sweat, and doesn't notice anyone's surprise. Dale's shoddy appearance convinces his girlfriend's parents that she is a lunatic, all in good conscience, of course.<br/><br/>As entertaining as the film is, it does fray at the end. I can only handle so much comic violence. The rescue attempt epitomizes my frustration. I won't spoil it for you, but I was relieved that it was over. Fortunately, however, the silliness occurs at the end of the film and doesn't ruin the experience. Still, despite my criticism, I'd recommend a viewing of Pineapple Express, but I think your capacity to enjoy it is inversely proportional to your age. Note: ""Pineapple Express"" is also the word for a naturally occurring weather phenomenon which brings heavy rain to Hawaiian coasts.<br/><br/>Final Consensus: *** and ¬Ω out of *****"

","I recently watched this film last Sunday.. and I'm a massive fan of the apataw productions. whats really great is to see that there adding new actors to there family. along side the regulars like: Seth rogan, Jonah hill etc etc. The mesh of genres blend perfectly.<br/><br/>Seth rogan seems to take the lovable roles of his characters from previous films (nearly all of which enjoy weed) and blend them together in one gigantic role of hilariousness. him and james franco. both simply disappear into the role. i very much hope that james franco is added to the list of regular actors for the up and coming apataw productions.<br/><br/>In one whole summary its a freakin amazing action movie and comedy but most importantly its a love story between a drug dealer and his client.

This time James Franco makes the movie as a lovable burn out, not the typical role you'd expect from Green Goblin Jr. <br/><br/>If marijuana turns you off then forget it, you'll hate the movie, But if you can chill out for two hours and laugh at the movie's action, stoner-antics, and borderline romantic male bonding then you'll get your ten dollars worth."

","I watched the unrated version. The plot of the film is a simple cat and mouse as a couple of stoners attempt to get away from their supplier who wants to kill them over witnessing a murder. The plot was mostly immaterial as the film was nothing but stoner humor, people smoking pot and acting odd. The film goes on for nearing two hours replicating the same humor which got stale after 35 minutes.<br/><br/>Plenty of F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

","I was impressed. It's the best stoner film yet, but there is more to it than just getting high. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are abundant. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone effects. But the movie has enough to keep you entertained. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. This is the kind of film that tries to prove that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. My overall rating: 7/10."

","Pineapple Express is a terrific movie with a very well written plot and a stellar comedic cast. It was a delight from beginning to end, leaving me both in stitches from all the side splitting hilarious moments, as well as high octane action sequences that kept me at the edge of my seat. The director and crew really did not hold back on making this as big and fun as it could be. <br/><br/>My only real issue is character development, as far as Dale and Saul's relationship goes, we learn very little about them beyond their relationship concerning this story. We do not find out how long they have known each other or when they even met, I would liked to have gained a larger insight on their friendship. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely phenomenal, Seth Rogen and James Franco shine as always, it is such a joy to watch these two perform together cause their chemistry is unfathomable. They are also joined with top notch performances from the likes of Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Gary Cole and Bill Hader, just to name a few. <br/><br/>Such a delight.

I never would've expected James Franco to turn into a stoner. I still have one question about the film though... is there a drug called Pineapple Express? I don't really care but i'm a little curious. I wasn't quite convinced that Gary Cole and Rosie Perez were villains, not that they did a bad job. But I am not quite sure. I think that Pineapple express is a hilarious action film that will be sure to entertain and amaze you. Also, I thought that Seth Rogen did a pretty good job.

","An adult stoner who happens to be dating a high school girl witnesses a murder. Rather than report it, he turns to his dealer for help. Due to paranoia, they both find themselves on the run from the killer, another dealer. This becomes comedic when the pair are forced to involve the girlfriend and her family.<br/><br/>I was growing weary of Seth Rogen. Over the past few years, his face can be seen pretty much everywhere, and if a comedy is being filmed, somehow he manages to appear in it. And, frankly, he's not excessively funny. He's not a horrible actor, but is being overexposed and risks becoming obsolete too quickly (though, perhaps, this is his goal). That being said, he was great for ""Pineapple Express"". Alongside James Franco (in his best role since ""The Ape""), this a comedic duo to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>I have to give the promoters of this film credit. While I initially had little interest in seeing it, this may have been a smart move on their part. I think word of mouth carried this film, and it should have -- you don't want to give away too much in a trailer or the viewer gets let down. None of the jokes are revealed in the trailer, and maybe i missed this, but I didn't even know it was a drug-themed film. That surprised me greatly. As far as drug-themed films go, this ranks as one of the all-time best (alongside, perhaps, ""Half Baked"").<br/><br/>If you don't mind drug references and adult men dating high school girls, this is a comedy to see. I found myself sucked in and I didn't want to use the bathroom or grab a new beer at any point. My attention span comes and goes, but with this film, they had me firmly in their grasp."

Not every kid wants to try pot and selling to kids is very wrong and not funny. Also, I think some of the Hollywood liberals need to remember that pot is still illegal. But after looking over that part, James Franco and Seth Rogan are funny in this.<br/><br/>Dale witnesses a murder by a big time drug dealer and he throws his roach out his car before leaving. Ted, the dealer, recognizes the pot as Pineapple Express and knows the dealer he gave it too, Saul. Dale runs over to Saul's in hysterics and they soon realize, Ted maybe able to track them through the Pineapple Express, so they go on the run. They have a whole escape in the woods. They go to Red's to find out what he knows about Ted. The time they spend at Red's is funny and they are involved in one huge house fight. Dale warns his girlfriend at a funny dinner scene. The 2 track Ted and Saul is in heaven when he is caught and taken to the big pot growing plant. The final showdown is when the Korens show up, whom also want a big slice of the drug market.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Good, lots of fowl language, so if that doesn't bother you, check this out."

"moonspinner55","5","1","4","27 January 2009"," A platonic love affair amongst potheads...
","Seth Rogen is so affable and ingratiating on-screen that, even when he's trying to come off as tough or mean-spirited, you can sense the Jewish teddy bear underneath (he could be the young, screw-up son of Albert Brooks, though neurotic in a more easy-going way). Rogen plays a pot-smoking process server who witnesses a gang hit, giving his identity away when he throws his roach out the window--filled with Pineapple Express, a rare hybrid weed via Canada and Hawaii! This lumpy comedy hits a pothole every now and then, and could've stood some judicious editing (especially during a night scene in the woods, which seems to go on forever). Still, for every fumble there's a funny recovery, either with a sight-gag, some wild action, or clever bits of dialogue (""Oh man, talk radio! It's so boring...your car committed suicide!). The second-half of ""Express"" surprisingly turns into a rough-and-tumble action flick (with a cartoony undermining); although this development is well-handled, the sweetly stoned comic nuances are nearly lost. Seth Rogen and James Franco prove to be amicable ordinary heroes. Rogen in particular is enjoyably flexible and grounded as an actor--you believe everything he says. This may be a new kind of Method acting. ** from ****"

","Some people's complaint about ""Pineapple Express"" is that the end scene goes on too long. My criticism is that it focuses a little too much on high action. But no matter, this movie is still a laugh riot from beginning to end, as a pair of marijuana-obsessed goof-balls (Seth Rogen and James Franco) have to go on the lam after one of them witnesses a murder. It's the sort of movie intended as completely silly, and it succeeds in every way. A latter day Bill & Ted, if you will.<br/><br/>If I thought that the movie could have done anything differently, it was Ed Begley's and Nora Dunn's characters.

The action is a great mix with the comedy that keeps the laugh rolling from beginning to end. This movie isn't for everyone, but is a great ride and a frigging' riot. So many different characters make this movie so enjoyable I had to see it twice before forming my opinion. It was as funny the second time as it was the first, and i was as ""influenced"" both time as well.

"LoneWolfAndCub","9","1","4","11 August 2008"," Apatow, Rogen and Goldberg serve up another hysterical comedy
","While Pineapple Express does not have the heart of Knocked Up or the raunchiness of Superbad, it does not try to replicate it. Instead, it tackles a different genre: the stoner comedy, mixed with the violence action-comedy. Pineapple Express contains consistently funny moments, oddball scenarios and gory fights and gunplay. This is what lifts it above the recent bland comedies.<br/><br/>The film focuses on 25 year old Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), process server and pothead and Saul Silver (James Franco), the constantly stoned dealer. After Dale becomes witness to a drug lord and crooked police officer kill a criminal in cold blood, he goes on the run with Saul. Along the way Dale has to deal with Angie, his 18 year old girlfriend and finding ways out of complicated situations while under the influence.<br/><br/>Rogen and Franco, real-life friends since ""Freaks and Geeks"", have some of the best on screen chemistry I have seen in a ""buddy comedy."" They naturally bounce the jokes off each other, be it scripted or ad-libbed. These two are also the films strength in the fact that they are not the stereotypical action hero. You know...buffed, one-liner spouting robot killing machines. These guys are more realistic and paranoid, much like a normal person would be when being hunted by immoral criminals who just want you dead. They figure out how they can be traced (by phone and credit card), they freak out (and take pot to calm their nerves), they run to wherever they can think of, they try to leave town and they are even honest to other police and friends. Personally, I would be just like them in a situation like that and that helps in relating to the heroes. Even when they use guns, they are utterly hopeless by looks (blind firing, etc), however, their accuracy is a tad too high for constantly high slackers.<br/><br/>And on the action, it is very convincing in its messiness and bloodiness. Most of it is just beating the absolute sense out of the other, and this makes it amusing in its complete randomness. Surprisingly, Pineapple Express works incredibly well as an action flick, which is odd. However, the comedy certainly outweighs the action, with the laughs coming thick and fast. Franco should do more comedy, as his Saul is one of the funniest characters I have ever had the pleasure of watching on screen. Rogen is proving to be the best comic actor currently working (because truthfully, Adam Sandler is utter garbage)! Danny McBride provides hilarious support as Red, the indestructible dealer and Bill Hader makes an excellent cameo. Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson as hit men Budlofsky and Matheson are a nice touch. Beyond these, though, the rest of the support aren't up to scratch. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez's stock villains merely shift the story along and Dale's love interest Angie is discarded towards the end.<br/><br/>However, the minor issues aside, director David Gordon Green has created a hit with Pineapple Express and should please most fans of Apatow's previous work. This one is definitely the best of his films, in my opinion, thanks to the two leads, exhilarating action and some solid focus on the two main characters relationship.<br/><br/>4¬Ω/5"

In a film that seamlessly blends stupid comedy, smart comedy, drug comedy, sex comedy, and about 300 other variations of humour, it's a wonder my head didn't explode from laughing. I haven't laughed this hard in a cinema since 'Team America: World Police.' <br/><br/>I have no doubts that this fantastically written, directed, and acted film will become an instant classic. I personally am considering it the second best recent weed movie coming in a close second behind the first 'Harold and Kumar.' Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good time with some heavy laughs and mind-blowing action.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10"
"cultfilmfan","9","1","4","9 August 2008"," Pineapple Express
","Pineapple Express is a new comedy about a 20 something year old stoner named Dale, who along with his drug dealer named Saul, are both on the run after Dale saw something that he probably shouldn't have and the film's two antiheroes end up running from crooked cops and an evil drug kingpin while drug humour, male bonding and over the top action sequences follow. Basically if you are not a fan of stoner humour, or movies involving that type of humour, then it is a pretty safe bet that you are not going to enjoy this movie. For those who just enjoy a good comedy much like myself then there is a pretty good chance you will like it if you are a fan of Cheech and Chong and other films or sketches of the same variety. I've heard some people were also put off by some of the more graphic violence in this film, but I think a lot of the violence is done in such an over the top and almost cartoonish way that I think it is hard to take it too seriously, or be really offended by it. Seeing as this is a comedy a lot of the violence is more slapstick and even when there is bloodshed it is usually played for laughs. While, I didn't find this film as funny as the writers previous film Superbad, I still found a lot to enjoy and appreciate about the film and there were still several moments where I had a grin on my face and was amused by some of the clever one liners, or some of the on screen shenanigans that were going on. A lot of the humour like most of the R rated comedies now does rely on a lot of crude humour and language, so I guess if that is not your kind of entertainment then this film probably wouldn't be for you either. What, I found impressive about the film was it's fast paced and humorous script and I also liked the on screen chemistry from the film's two lead actors. Once again some have complained that this film was too long for a comedy, but I really did find the film to move really fast and I thought it had a good pace to it and because it was so entertaining with non stop humorous scenes and action (especially in the second half) that I find it hard to believe that people were getting tired of it. I was enjoying myself so much that it could have been over two hours and I probably would have still enjoyed it as much as I did. The film doesn't particularly break any new barriers and I have seen a lot of other films in the past year or two that I would say are funnier, but this film still works really well largely because of the great screen pairing of Seth Rogen and James Franco and the fresh one liners and over the top yet fun action in the second half. Pineapple Express worked for me and if you are a fan of films of this kind then I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well and I'm sure this will be a film that will end up in a lot of DVD collections and work as a late night cult film for some years to come and that is not a bad thing at all."
"projectmayhem1138","6","1","4","9 August 2008"," Decent comedy, but a step down from some previous Rogen/Apatow outings
","Pineapple Express was OK. That's pretty much how I felt about it. It was funny, and I laughed often enough, but the humor was frequently based upon the use of bad language or shock humor, and I found myself wondering too many times whether I'll find a lot of what I laughed at humorous the second time around. Unlike Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, or even Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the dialogue here didn't seem very clever or quotable, and the plot just wasn't that compelling.<br/><br/>This is the story of Dale Denton (Rogen), a process server and marijuana super-user who witnesses a murder committed by a powerful drug dealer (Bill Cole) and a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez) and must go on the run once they track him down through his drug dealer, Saul (James Franco, in his best casting ever) thanks to a rare type of weed called Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>For a while, the movie thrives upon its buddy-comedy conventions, and thanks to good work from Rogen, Franco, and a somewhat brilliant turn by Danny McBride as Saul's supplier/pseudo-friend. Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson also brighten up the screen as bickering hit men. However, in its final third or so, the film degenerates into a violent action showdown that is as unfunny as it is tonally inappropriate to this film. Though this worked brilliantly in a similar way in Hot Fuzz, that film sets you up for it from the very beginning, whereas in this film it just comes out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie really work, such as Dale's relationship with an 18-year-old high schooler (Amber Heard) and the hilarious scenes with McBride's Red, but this movie seems too confused as to what it hopes to be to successfully be anything. I'll stick to Superbad and the others, and hope that the next outing will be better."

","I thought it was so funny. I could not stop laughing. This was the stoniest movie i have ever seen. I did not smoke before seeing it but i wish i had. I saw it the first time it was in the theater, and i am glad i did. The character of Saul Silver is ridiculous and James Franco does an awesome job. A little excess gore but other than that a great movie. I will definitely buy this when it comes out. James Franco is totally unexpected in this role and it works well for him. They have random lines and the story line is just total pandemonium. I won't spoil anything but the cop car slushy scene was absolutely crazy. I liked it better than Superbad (i actually hated superbad, it was too crude) This was actually funny and James Franco was cute. Knocked up was good but was kind of depressing. This is just a fun, funny, random movie that will be loved by stoners, and those who laugh at stoners forever. Go see this movie, unless of course you are a parent... or a kid under 17. Because then you wont like it or get it very much."

If you want a good laugh; you really need to go watch this. James Franco does an amazing job just like the ledger in batman; he really makes the movie. This is one of the movies to watch along with batman. And its as good as OR better than the Harold and Kumars almost. The reason i didn't give this a 10/10 is because supposedly its even better if you smoke ..... (which i didn't) ..you know which is why i left some room for the for one more star."
"p-obrien1","8","1","4","7 August 2008"," The funniest 'Stoner' film to date...
","I won't go into the specifics of the film. Just know, from the opening scene (which is a flashback), until the very end, this movie is hysterical. Whatever laughs Seth Rogen can't out of you, James Franco most certainly will. Anyone who has ever been considered a 'stoner', or knows someone who they would consider a 'stoner' should understand most of the humor throughout the film. This film is not to short, not to long, it's just the right length.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film was funnier than Half Baked, Grandma's Boy, The Cheech & Chong film's, Dazed and Confused, and any other 'Stoner' film. I was never a big James Franco fan, but his portrayal of a constantly-stoned drug dealer is priceless.<br/><br/>WARNING: If you do not smoke weed. There's a good chance you won't get a lot of the humor. This is not a ""smart, dark comedy"" like Little Miss Sunshine or something along those lines. If you go into this looking for something smart and witty like ""As Good As It Gets"", you're seeing the wrong film."
"thepeoplesmoviecritic","8","1","4","6 August 2008"," Action done by the everyman.
","Pineapple Express is the name of the newest film produced by Judd Apatow, and once again, he delivers the goods.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Dale, a 25-year-old process server who smokes in nearly every scene he's in. Dale weed dealer is Saul, another perpetually stoned character played perfectly by James Franco.<br/><br/>STORY: The story is like any other. Dale witnesses a murder, and he and Saul must go on the run from the cops and the mob. The story here, though, isn't meant to be brilliant. This story is just an excuse to squeeze in jokes, action, violence, and yes, lots and lots of weed.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: The characters are, politely speaking, not very original, but they don't have to be. Rogen plays an everyman stoner. Franco plays a drug dealing stoner, who is high, even when he doesn't smoke. There are also some great supporting characters, especially the character of Red, from Danny McBride. I really think I laughed at every time he spoke, even if the line wasn't funny, his delivery is amazing. Craig Robinson also did a great job in his role, which to me, oddly, was somewhat relateable.<br/><br/>VISUALS: Now, going into this movie, you wouldn't be expecting some great special effects. I wasn't, but I was sure surprised. This film has some excellent action sequences, especially the car chase scene. There a fight sequences in this movie, that you might have imagined in a movie like Die Hard, yet, the characters here do not become super human (except for one). They really feel the pain in a punch. I also would like to give props to the Director of Photography Tim Orr, who has some very exciting camera work, as well as calm steady wide angle shots.<br/><br/>PACING: I will be honest, they could have cut a big chuck out around the middle. Around there, the story starts to drag a little. Yet, by the end, I am wishing that the story would go on forever. The editing was very good also, I never once noticed it.<br/><br/>CONS: With all these positive qualities, it would be hard to imagine why this film isn't a perfect. It is very good, but it isn't perfect. I was smiling throughout the entire thing, but I wasn't laughing all the time. I never laughed really hard, but enough laughs to garner positive attention. Seth Rogen's performance is decent, not perfect, but descent. I sometimes didn't really understand some of his facial expressions.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Is this as funny as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. No, but this is still very good. It deserves a nice spot in your DVD collection. Though while H&K was a stoner-comedy, this is more of a stoner-action film. Sure, there are some scenes of pure comedy, but overall, the action if very well done, and I found myself being more excited, then laughing.<br/><br/>A-"
"sweetsteaka1","7","1","4","6 August 2008"," A solid film that pertains to weed but runs rather quickly with its thin storyline
","Pineapple express accomplished what it set out to do, this self pronounced weed/action buddy comedy did in fact deliver on all such items. Still however, it seems that the film was never able to deliver fully on any one. The self depreticating and neurotic humor of seth rogen seen through all his films, was quite carefully contrasted by james franco free spirited saul who steals the film. Never the less the film seemed to quickly move towards its climatic ""growhouse"" shootout"" leaving the viewer with little knowledge of what happened in the mean time.

"efrain911","6","4","40","6 August 2008"," Apatow and Rogen are Hurting America
","Generally, I'm anti- stupid, vulgar comedies and I avoid them, partially out of intellectual/film snobbery and mainly because of moral convictions. I also don't like that I could never in good conscience recommend some of these movies to friends or family.<br/><br/>So it pains me a bit to say that Pineapple Express, the latest shindig from the Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen gang, was actually entertaining. I had fun watching this offensive, pot-smoking caper unfold, and director David Gordon Green (of whose Undertow I am a fan) steps up the cinematic quality by adding some visual storytelling style to what could be just another crude comedy.<br/><br/>Now, before you go rushing to the theatre, let me make it clear: Pineapple Express was funny, and thankfully, not overflowing with a vulgar sex-obsessed storyline, but it's another dumb pothead movie, regardless of the filmmakers' intentions. Star and co-writer Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) said in an interview that he didn't want want Pineapple Express to be just another pothead movie; he wanted to make pot-smoking more commonplace and accepted in films, citing The 40 Year Old Virgin, as the first of their ilk's films to insert scenes of nonchalant pot-smoking.<br/><br/>Pineapple follows Dale Denton (Rogen), a pot-smoking process server who buys a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express from his needs-a-friend dealer, Saul (James Franco). One night while on a job, Dale witnesses a murder by a drug lord and a dirty cop, and accidentally drops his joint nearby as he flees the scene. Since the weed is so rare, he and Saul are easy to track down. And so the murderers are after them, hilarious hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>The story is reminiscent of other pot-infused, crime-comedy caper, buddy movies like The Big Lebowski, Half Baked, How High, etc. In that sense, it's not original. But there is a certain well-crafted quality to the movie, not in terms of story structure, but in the way it's put together. It could be the director, but whatever the case, it certainly makes it a different kind of stoner movie. I'm not sure if that's a good thing, though.<br/><br/>Funny and strange, filled with the regular cast of Apatow slacker schlubs, Pineapple Express continues in the vein of Super Bad and Knocked Up, revealing what's apparently going on the filmmakers' hormone-driven minds. Unfortunately, America may think that Apatow and Rogen speak for all men when they portray them as clubhopping, sex-obsessed, potheads who refuse to grow up ¬ó and that it's okay to be that way, because, as these movies suggest, all men really are like that. It may be obvious, but I feel the need to say that these guys don't speak for the rest.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate to think that this movie will probably enforce beliefs that it's totally okay to be high all the time, and that it's perfectly fine for grown men to act like they never matured passed third grade. Co-writers Seth Rogen (pro-weed) and Judd Apatow (anti-weed) reportedly disputed over the film's message regarding the use of pot. However, there is a somber moment in Pineapple where Dale and Saul get fed up with each other and life because of everything going wrong. The filmmakers get to slip in a ""our lives suck because we're always high"" moment which I think works, even if it's a sort of forgotten by the end.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, folks, I do actually see beautiful, poignant, sensitive messages amidst the overflow of offense in these vulgar movies, but there's too much release-of-pent-up-sexual-tension to consider them great movies. And it's not like everything is vulgar, there is plenty of clean material in Pineapple Express. But it's just the matter-of-fact lack of morality in both action and dialogue in the movie that bugs me when I reflect on the story.<br/><br/>I realize that these types of ""chick flicks for guys"" movies are exaggerated reflections of a hedonistic man-culture, and most of the content is so commonplace in that it no longer offends its target audience. Sadly, it is this adolescent mindset that views casual promiscuity and drug usage as common pastimes while tending to the more important activities of videogaming and beer-chugging. And somewhere in all this, sweet stories apparently can be found and made into movies. Movies with man-boy schmucks who take an extra 10 years after the teenage years to officially grow up. Movies that swim in vain and profane babblings, only to say, ""See? We're men and we have feelings too."" But surely there are other ways of telling the simply sweet messages of love, romance, and friendship that these movies try so hard to convey. Are there no writer-directors out there with more wit, class, and charm than those of the Apatow gang? Must we continue to endure the perverse teenage antics of men and women well into their 40s? Like all the Apatow-esquire movies, I may have been somewhat entertained, but mostly because of low-brow shock value appealing to the ""primal"" senses. There is a part of me that sees these types of movies like small silver coins embedded with poisonous impurities, rendering them without value. To remove all the impurities would take so much effort and time that it's just not worth it. Like that analogy that asks if you were offered some delicious brownies, but were warned that there were tiny pieces of dog poop in them ¬ñ would you still eat the brownies? Would be okay with just a tiny bit of poop in your brownies? No? Seriously, though, it may be an entertaining, raucous joyride, but Pineapple Express is not a good movie, in the moral sense, nor is it a good-in-the-cinematic-sense either. But based on the filmmakers' track record, I'm sure people will flock to it regardless of some critic's opinion. Unfortunately, if Apatow/Rogen builds it, they will come."

Dale runs to Saul, and now they have to run for their lives from Jones' henchmen Budlofsky (Kevin Corrigan) and Matheson (Craig Robinson).<br/><br/>It's a weed action thriller from Seth and Evan. The biggest missing element from this is a long term friendship between the guys. This is a classic buddy comedy without the classic buddy. Cheech and Chong were always long time buddies. There is nothing holding Dale and Saul together. It makes more sense if they could easily turn on each other. It makes no sense that Saul would stick his neck out for Dale. Also they are missing the buddy comedy aspect. Every joke loses a little on the friendship discount. It's a big missing ingredient. Rogen and Franco are still the likable goofballs.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","5","11 April 2011"," Potentially funny stoner comedy . . . but WOW is it bloody.
","'The Pineapple Express' is a stoner comedy about two potheads who accidentally start a war between competing drug lords. Given that, I expected a goofy comedy about the drugs and sex. What I didn't expect was that the movie would grow excessively violent, even gory. When a man's head is splattered against a window, it puts a kink in the laughs.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan - who should to have the words ""Average Joe"" tattooed on his neck - stars as Dale Denton, a nice guy who works as a process server. He is in love with his girlfriend Angie (Amber Heard) who is a senior in High School (he's in his 30s) and they are serious enough that he is ready to meet her parents. He wants to make a good impression but it isn't likely that Angie's parents would approve of Dale's best buddy Saul (James Franco from 127 Hours). Saul is a happy, genial pothead who spends half of his time selling his herb, and the other half inventing new ways to get high. His latest: The Trifecta, a cross-shaped joint that can be lit at three points, thus increasing the potency. Also new to his arsenal is The Pineapple Express, a joint with an effect that he describes as so illegal that it is a crime against nature, ""like killing unicorns."" <br/><br/>The problem for Dale begins after a visit to Saul, when he is asked to serve a summons to, ironically enough, Saul's supplier, a violent drug lord named Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Parked in front of his house, smoking The Pineapple Express, he sees a squad car parked behind him and throws the joint out the window. He also sees, through a giant window, a man inside the house shot in the head. Dale panics and tries to make a very clumsy getaway while parallel parked. Ted and the corrupt lady cop (Rosie Perez) - who brought that squad car - find the joint, know it is from Saul and determine to kill him. This leads Dale and Saul on a wild chase from Ted's hit men while having little time to figure out what to do, or for Dale to figure out how he is going to sideline the chase in order to have dinner with Angie's parents.<br/><br/>The movie sounds like a wacky comedy and for most of the way, it is. But WOW is it violent. There are moments when people are shot and the blood splatters from their bodies. The man in Ted's house is shot in the head and his brains splatter all over the window. Offset that with elements that would be at home in a Cheech and Chong movie and you have a very uncomfortable mix. The characters of Dale and Saul are written as silly doofuses while the characters of the drug lords and the hit men seem grounded in reality, like something out of Scarface.<br/><br/>The movie comes courtesy of a very odd mixture of talents. It was directed by David Gordon Green, who has made two great true-life dramas All the Real Girls and George Washington. It was written by Judd Apatow, the man who has reinvented the notion of the sex comedy by featuring stories about 30-ish males suffering from arrested development. He made Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek and Knocked Up. Here, I think the two styles clash together in an unwholesome mixture. Instead of adolescent adult males facing reality, they are involved in nasty car chases and bloody shoot-outs that interrupt the momentum of the comedy. Given the talent involved, this was a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"

It had all the right ingredients for an awesome ""doobie-movie"" - Seth and Franco are funny just to look at, and the plot of a stoner witnessing a crime seems like a solid starting point. Unfortunately, the story suffers from a lot of unrefined dialog - conversations which are supposed to make you laugh but end up coming off as bizarre or immature. I was also disappointed with the use of violence/gore and the filmmakers intent to turn this into laughs. Isn't this the drug of peace and love brother? Violent fights (and bloody gunfights)- even if they are done in a quirky, slapstick way -just don't push my laugh button.

His pudgy, loud, obnoxious American act is on full beam here, complimented by co star Franco and a host of supporting actors all in on the joke. Sadly, the joke rate is rather low with this, even though it goes for shock value with morally dubious scenes where Rogan smokes pot while driving and where him and his mate sell the drug to some children.

"RainDogJr","Null","1","5","12 October 2008"," Holy c***! Holy hilarious movie! It's like God's vagina!
","Basically when I heard for the first time about this movie it became kind of part of the ""must wanted"" movies for the rest of the year. I never knew when was going to be its theatrical release in my city that was finally last Friday (10 October 2008). I really wanted to watch for the first time a movie from the Apatow team on the big screen (I wanted to watch Step Brothers but now it's too late, it is not more in mi city) and yesterday I really enjoyed Pineapple Express, probably one of the funniest things from this year and definitely one of my personal favourites.<br/><br/>Now I basically recognize all of the ""sons"" of Apatow and immediately Bill Hader, one of them of course, provokes the first laughs. Hader is simply great; I don't really watch TV so I never had seen an entire Saturday Night Live episode so in consequence I only know Hader for his film roles but with that I can say I'm fan. In this film he doesn't share the screen with his cop partner from Superbad, Seth Rogen, however his character shares one little thing with Dale Denton, Rogen's character, and that of course has in marihuana the key factor. Now we move the present days with Dale, again Rogen seems to be playing the same role however that really doesn't bothered me at all mainly because once he is together with James Franco's character everything is fun with these two guys who are in their own thing and who really enjoy and love that thing. By reading some stuff about this film I realize about the fact that Rogen originally wanted to play my favourite character of the film, of course the character of Franco, Saul Silver, but they really scored by casting James Franco who is just hilarious as the charismatic stoner that Saul is. The first sequence with Dale and Saul together resumes everything, these two sees each other only for one thing but always we knew that there was some ""special"", after all Saul gave only to Dale the vagina of god formerly known as pineapple express. They can make the other feel better, Saul could make that Dale felt better by reminded him of the beautiful girl he has and the awesome job that let him smoke many joints and Dale could make that Saul felt better just by reminded him that his job actually consists in selling drugs! But even with this they were only vendor and client and of course there will be one motive to make of these two a ""team"", a ""team"" that will need to fight for their lives. <br/><br/>Pineapple Express turns to have many hilarious fights that seem to be really painful for the protagonists. Since our stoner heroes are being chased by a really powerful drug lord (played by Gary Cole) is obvious that some very dangerous and cold men will try to end with our heroes. And here we have another ""team"" (played by Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan) that also have their moments of great fun. And where are the cops when our heroes and specially the persons close to them need them? Well, writing that one of the right hands of that powerful drug dealer is actually a policewoman (played by Perdita Durango (!) also known as Rosie Perez) is just enough to answer that question (f*** the police!!). But not all the cops are like that bitch and eventually our heroes will find another policewoman who really can help them but why they need her if the actions of hero Saul are enough? Well that is something that only Saul believed and eventually his hilarious actions (Saul breaking the windshield of the patrol!!!!) will make that our heroes will follow their own way to finally meet again to be buddies again and to survive to many explosions between a drug war in place full of drug!<br/><br/>By the end we have a rally terrific and hilarious scene in which our three heroes (damn I didn't mention the hilarious character that Danny McBride plays. His name is Red, he is the connection between that powerful drug dealer and our hero Saul and he starts being a traitor, he just wanted to save his own ass no matter of the consequences however he ends being another damn hero who practically is like a cat with nine lives!) are talking, and laughing, about all the unbelievable things that happened during their crazy adventure. Is like a really hilarious resume of the movie, a movie that I would like to add to my collection. Probably my third favourite from the Apatow Team. 9.5 out of 10"
"gangstahippie","9","1","5","29 September 2008"," Great Seth Rogen stoner film
","Seth Rogen is a great actor/comedian in my opinion.Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad were excellent movies in my opinion, and those are just a few of the many other films he has played a role in.The film also stars James Franco of ""Spiderman"" fame.It's been a while since I have seen this movie but what happens is a stoner witnesses a murder and gets his drug dealer involved.So they hide in the woods while the man sends two hit men to go kill them.Afterwords they leave the woods, try to get help from their friend, smoke some weed and then after the dealer gets kidnapped, the stoner goes and tries to save him.Pineapple Express was not as good as say Superbad or 40 Year Old Virgin in my opinion, but it was an entertaining stoner movie with a good mix of action and comedy.Seth Rogen fans, stoner film fans or fans of buddy comedies should check this movie out."
"tavm","7","1","5","21 August 2008"," Pineapple Express is another quite funny Judd Apatow production
","Since tomorrow is the birthday of my friend who works at a movie theatre, I let him pick the movie we were going to see today. He picked this one (I'm just glad he didn't pick the third Mummy movie). Once again produced by Judd Apatow, this is star Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's second screenplay after Superbad from last year. I actually liked this one better than that especially when the ""witnessing the murder"" sequence kicked in. There are some scenes though that, while they might be funny, later makes me wonder what relation they have to the plot. Like the beginning black and white scene that takes place in 1937 with Apatow regular and current SNLer Bill Hader. He is indeed funny in his scene but before that, I wondered if I stumbled into the wrong movie. Rogen himself, though, is throughly deadpan hilarious whether nonchalantly romancing his 18-year-old high school girlfriend at her learning center or straight-out telling her parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and former SNLer Nora Dunn) during dinner about being chased by some hit men. And his former co-star from ""Freaks and Geeks"", James Franco, matches Seth in offbeat humor whether driving a police car with his foot stuck in the windshield or helping his buddy in untying while he's also in likewise situation. And then there's a third party that manages to stay alive despite being shot at a lot. The stuff with the Asian hit men and Gary Cole and cop Rosie Perez as lovers seems so much filler though they have their moments too. So in summation, Pineapple Express may be a little long but that length provides a pretty satisfying whole for me to recommend."

I'm not quite sure why David Gordon Green was hired to direct this. Many of the critics who wrote about Pineapple Express went out of their way identifying the elements that belong to him.

"robertallenandersonjr","10","1","5","7 August 2008"," This movie has everything that a movie needs
","Pineapple Express was one of the best comedy movies of the year. It was a perfect movie for the end of the summer. It was a great comedy movie with a lot of action. It was one of those action/comedy type of movies. This movie though had it all. It had a ton of action, lots of drugs, sexual references, explosions, guns, and fighting. The drugs were used a lot in this movie. The story kind of revolved around drugs along with chasing two stoner buddies. This was definitely one of the funnest and entertaining movie I have seen in a while. If someone who loves drugs and lots of action will love this movie. If you don't like drugs then don't see this movie. The acting was great as well. It was lead by a great cast. I think that James Franco nailed the part of a drug dealer and a big stoner. He was very funny and pretty much made this movie so amazing. Seth Rogan was very funny as well. With the help of them two being together the whole movie makes it amazing. The visuals were pretty cool. Some nice special effects during action scenes. The story was pretty cool and kept you interested. The whole movie was absolutely funny. I think every scene there was at least a small laugh. Definitely a great movie. Go see it I recommend it to most people. Just one group I wouldn't recommend this movie to is kids."
"giglbox","2","1","6","31 January 2012"," Please..Stop!
","Seth Rogen. Lame. The movie itself. Way too long and stupid. Funny ends about half-way through. I think that if you are 12-20 you might love this movie. If you are older and love it then you probably have some sort of disorder. I must admit, I am biased. Seth Rogen should not be acting in my opinion. He ruins pretty much every movie he is in. He's like Brian O'Halloran in Clerks. He's just not believable! Your character can do nothing aside from being boring. Maybe it's the writer(s) (ahem...Kevin Smith...more crap). Anyway, if you haven't seen it, just ask a friend and that should be enough to convince you to save your money."
"elshikh4","1","1","6","22 June 2011"," I didn't laugh. Instead, I was sad, grossed-out and scared !
","This is Hollywood filth made under the name of comedy and action. It's mainly a buddy movie. It has the extremely predictable plot: ""Someone witnessed accidentally a murder, so let's chase him, and his buddy, to kill them both"", while carrying out the known by heart themes: From zeroes to heroes, from haters to lovers,.. you know.. the usual. However, it's done this round with 2 stoned guys. The result is fast-paced, explosive, totally unfunny garbage!<br/><br/>Save the opening credits sequence, that presented (Rogan)'s character and life, it was like the desert of writing, as it was all empty and dry. There is nothing remotely droll about the characters. Take for instance the evil men teams. They are evil, end of the story! When the script, any script, thinks that being sheer stupid will be funny, then it may be stupid itself. And by watching the leads of this movie, how they talk and deal, then IT IS stupid!<br/><br/>The dialogue consists of things which you can easily find in any bathroom's bowl right after using it. Writing those shoddy lines isn't a talented thing to do. The sexual references were many and ugly. The girlfriend says nothing but the F word. They overused the bad language to a degree where I was board to death. You have to be artistic when it comes to dealing with characters like stoned people. Otherwise, hanging with them would be more merciful. As you see, Hollywood writers have become worse than the stoned people!<br/><br/>(James Franco) is the last comedian on earth. He CAN'T make laughs. I don't know how to cast him in a comedy in the first place. He was torturous. (Danny McBride) was even more torturous. That guy oozes awfulness. He has anti-charisma that can turn you off for good. And it's not complete without the worst in history (Kevin Corrigan). OH MY GOD, here's someone who has nothing to do with comedy, or acting, or anything but provoking you!<br/><br/>I couldn't stand this amount of blood and gore, as if whatever they missed in comedy, they compensated by exploding foots, shooting bellies, cutting off ears; they did that last one and elongated it for what exactly?!<br/><br/>Nastiness for nastiness is essential in here. Recall the weird scene of selling weeds to very young teens?? I bet the movie's makers wanted to win more young audience by manipulating what's shown as their ""forbidden dream"". Therefore, at that point, I came to believe that the movie is a nasty drug itself! And that last scene; it's about friendship and unity and new beginnings (cancel the last one for the sequel!), but while it's played as serene moment, it was absolute gross and fake. It fits being the best end for the worst movie.<br/><br/>By the way, it wanted to be satirical as well. Yeah. Can you believe it?! By the intro scene, and the matter of someone from the police as a drug dealer, this movie points fingers at the authority as a beneficiary out of the youths, like the movie's leads, when they immerse in drugs. Bravo. However, the intro scene was bland, unutilized well, and hence ended up as unnecessary. The matter of the policewoman is usual; rather a worn-out habit in the American cinema during the last decades. And the crime of ""getting benefits out of the youths by immersing them in drugs"" can apply to the movie's producers also!<br/><br/>Still, there is the rock bottom. A line, said by (Franco), about how amazing the Pineapple Express weed is. To be honest, it was one of the most shocking moments in my life. The blasphemy wasn't more horrific like that before. It's so sinful; I can't accept that in the name of art (art? here?!), or else. Now my question isn't about how it has become frequent to find hideousness like that in Hollywood movies lately, as it turned into bizarrely natural, my question is about: how they didn't find any other line to make laugh except THIS??!<br/><br/>(Pineapple Express) isn't another bankrupt comedy only, but freely brutal and horrifically impudent also. The thing is nobody warned me earlier. I just heard that it made big money in America; which is something you have to be so alarmed by it lately. Obviously, the American viewers nowadays need non-stop blood, cursing and blasphemy. When Hollywood producers make a movie such as this, then it's understandable; they woo cheaply the dirtiest human lusts to make money. But when that same movie hit it high, then sure something is really wrong with the mentality of great deal of the American youth; or simply the demographic audience which goods of that sort are produced to.<br/><br/>I was sad and grossed-out while watching. The B movie, especially the buddy comedy, used to be something less tacky and no sickening. Now, we have pure garbage as entertainment? In fact, dumps are cleaner than this. So as a movie, to the toilet of my memories. But as a successful direct current, it's a sign of danger, and a reason to be scared."

","I saw this movie in theatres with my older sister when it first came out. There's a five year difference between us, but we still enjoy the same movies. So at the time i was in about 9th grade, and I found this movie to be hilarious. A little immature to see it needless to say, but i've seen most of his movies, superbad, knocked up, etc. And all were hilarious, but this one was just as funny, if not funnier.

","Pineapple Express is a stoner comedy/action movie send-up from the Apatow factory. It starts by Seth Rogen's character witnesses a murder and gets his drug dealer, James Franco, mixed up in the mess. The two go on the run while some gangsters search for them. It's very loose and sloppy, with an improvised feeling. There are long stretches where I didn't laugh much, and there are some plot developments that make little sense. There was a lot of action violence then I expected, but it was pretty good and kept the movie going. Fortunately, much of the film is inspired silliness, and Rogen's and Franco's comic timing is great. Danny McBride and Craig Robinson both give break-out supporting performances, as Red and Matheson. The final sequence in the diner pushes this one for me from pretty good to almost great. Many of the critics who wrote about Pineapple Express went out of their way identifying the elements that belong to him. I also found the second half of the movie to be much better than the first. The part hour was basically Seth Rogen (Dale) explaining and telling James Franco (Sal) about him being in trouble and people after him. The movie gets going towards the middle and really gets interesting at the end. The action towards the end was great. There was a lot of people who got shot and died throughout the movie. And at the end all the bad guys pretty much die, while the three friends Dale, Sal, and Red remain alive. Though it is pretty weird how Red remained alive since being shot many times. Overall, Pineapple Express was a great film from 08 and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>==================================================================== ======== <br/><br/>After a rewatch 07/28/17', Pineapple Express remains one of the better stoner comedies of the last decade and since it's release. What makes the film continuous great and watchable are the chemistry between Seth Rogen and James Franco, as well as the dialogue. A lot of clever and witty jokes and quotables in which people enjoy."

","I give this movie a 5. Why?. Simple, It's funny and perfectly viewable, the acting isn't anything awesome, James Franco and Seth Rogen are funny as always. Now, what's the problem? That stupid cop that ruins the entire movie. She's suppose to be hot for some reason and she looks like something taken out of the garbage, she also has a little voice that reminds me to Stwart Little (I mean because of the mouses). I think that if you want to laugh you should see it. BUT CAREFUL: If you are expecting a comedy with all those qualities that make a movie be good (acting, a good script, good directing, etc.) you will be disappointed, this is the movie for you if you just want to laugh like an idiot about absurd situations."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","6","6 August 2008"," Terrible date movie, as it should be...
","I saw Pineapple Express the same day that I saw Step Brothers and The Mummy 3 and it's better than both of those movies combined. It is a genuine stoner movie in every way, there is so much weed in the movie that you might start feeling stoned just watching it, but it soon becomes a strange combination of an action comedy adventure crime movie with a much more developed and brilliant script than you could possibly expect, given what the wardrobe department was coming up with.<br/><br/>It starts out with a black and white scene in an underground bunker back in the late 1940s, I believe, where the government is conducting experiments on the effects of marijuana on the human mind. A lucky volunteer is locked in a room where he smokes weed constantly, periodically helped along by a guy in a foil suit, in case he needs a light. During simple psychological questioning, he doesn't give the answers that the scientists and the government guys in suits want to hear, so they promptly illegalize it.<br/><br/>Jump ahead to today, where we meet our protagonist, a regular guy with a regular job who just wants to get a regular high. Seth Rogen plays Dale Denton, who works as a process server. If you don't know what that is, you're in good shape, because process servers are those people that approach you out of nowhere and say your first and last name to you with a question mark at the end, and when you say yes, they hand you a piece of paper full of bad news and walk away saying ""You've been served."" Needless to say, it's a pretty thankless job, so he needs to spend most of his time stoned.<br/><br/>James Franco is probably best known from the Spiderman movies (although I did see him in Flyboys a couple years ago and was wildly disappointed), but he inhabits his role in this movie so well and so completely that I sometimes thought it was a bit of a glimpse of Franco's personal life. I hope not, but it's pretty convincing. Remember Eddie Furlong in that staggeringly bad movie Jimmy & Judy? There's a little of that going on here.<br/><br/>One evening while about to deliver one of his notices, Dale Denton (Rogen) witnesses a murder involving a corrupt police officer, so he tosses his joint out the window and speeds away in a panic, only to find himself pursued because the joint was some super high-quality stuff that Saul (Franco) sold him, and so would be easy for the corrupt cop (Rosie Perez) and the criminal kingpin to trace back to him. Soon they find themselves fleeing for their lives in a full scale gang war.<br/><br/>Like all the best stoner movies, Pineapple Express is packed full of hilarious, classic moments, and will surely be quoted for years to come. There tons of over-the-top scenes and situations, some of which may make you a little uncomfortable, but even though they go a little too far sometimes, nothing seems out of place.<br/><br/>There is one scene that really stood out to me, in which three friends are fighting with each other, throwing each other around an apartment and essentially destroying the place and none of them really knows why, and alternately threatening and apologizing to each other.<br/><br/>Strangely, it's a very difficult movie to describe without ruining plot points or failing to do justice to it. The script is truly brilliant, and the performances are so good that it often looks like they just photographed the lives of the characters and put it right up on screen.<br/><br/>It's hard to really describe why a truly hilarious movie is so funny, so let's just say that, aside from the audience drowning out the movie at many points, there was (and this is absolutely a true story) a point when I was watching that everyone was laughing, and then there was this loud noise that turned out to be a kid kicking the chair in front of him in a panic because he was choking on an ice cube. It was actually a little scary, he was doubled over, not breathing, and people were starting to stand up and say oh my god oh my god, but finally he coughed it up. So be careful eating while watching the movie!"
"brucebaumann1913","10","1","6","6 August 2008"," Stoner's 1st Look At Pineapple Express
","So Pineapple Express was the best movie I had ever seen. Right there is an audacious statement that can only be explained by me being super bombed when I saw the movie. Never before in a movie have the two main characters (Franco and Rogen)smoked so heavily and continuously throughout the movie. I think the entire audience of the midnight showing was obviously high, and explained the audience's uproar after ""Fuck the Police!!"" Every single line of the movie is set up so correctly because even if your not high while watching Pineapple Express,(which automatically brings down the rating from a 10/10 to a 8/10) the movie will still be hilarious to anyone who has been high when they relate to the paranoia and above all the massive trip-outs the characters go through.<br/><br/>Overall Pineapple Express is going to go down with Jude Apatow's tremendous successes as yet again the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>One hint: You might hate this movie if you have never smoked pot before, because the jokes are made for stoners, not for people watching this movie to see what stoners are like."
"gazolineboy","2","1","7","10 June 2011"," On a clear day, don't see this movie
","Okay, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who is not under the influence. The entire movie seems almost like its put together of loosely connected movie scenes and jokes spawned from the hazy brain of a high school pothead. That almost never works in real life. It would have been useful for the writers to take a white day before the filming startet, to see if the script really looked that ingenious sober.<br/><br/>If your idea of humor is watching 30-something guys smoke MJ, crawling around on the floor shouting a lot and acting out too many half-ass action scenes, the movie is probably somewhat amusing.<br/><br/>Still a far cry from the carefully crafted dialogs and well drawn plots from earlier films by Apatow, Rogen et al., like Superbad and Knocked Up."

James Franco to me had one of the best roles in the movie as Saul, he made me laugh throughout the entire film. So to anyone that hasn't seen this movie yet and really loves a nice action/comedy sort of movie then this is for you, because it is an entertaining movie and one of the best movies of the summer of 2008. I cannot wait to see what the next Apatow project is."

James Franco did an amazing job and so did Seth Rogen. Keep in mind that It's stupid stoner comedy, you might love it or you might hate it.

I knew immediately that I was with my own kind. And when the movie started, it was no different! As an admitted stoner myself, I cannot express to you how hysterical this movie is! I have been a fan of Appatow, Rogan, and Franco since ""Freaks & Geeks"", and they still do not disappoint.<br/><br/>Seth Rogan plays the lovable pothead Dale Denton who witnesses a murder by a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and the city's notorious drug lord. This all happens while lighting up a joint of this rare, Hawaiian bud known as Pineapple Express, which is sold to him by his goofy dealer Saul Silver (James Franco), and of course hilarity ensues! It could have been the weed, but there was not a silent moment in the house! Laughter was heard constantly! I mean what can be better than, ""Fuck the Police""? The jokes were spot-on and oddly mature for a movie of this nature. Seth Rogan is still one of my favorite funny-men, and James Franco? He embodies everything that is a pot dealer! He reminds me slightly of the character of Slater in ""Dazed and Confused"". Also, amidst all the obvious stoner comedy, was a true bond between friends. Yes, folks, marijuana really does bring people together! So, that being said, go see this movie with your friends!

","I just saw this movie last night at midnight, and I must say, it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Ever since I saw the preview on the Superbad DVD, I have been waiting for this movie on pins and needles.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen stars as Dale Denton, a stoner and process server. Apparently a process server puts on disguises, comes to your work and gives you a subpoena. Anyway, the trailers do a pretty good job summing up the plot. Dale witnesses a crooked cop and drug dealer murder someone, so he grabs his drug dealer, a fat baggy of weed, and runs. The killers find out who they are, and chase them down. Hilarity ensues. Pretty much the entire time too. The jokes aren't stale at all, and there aren't even any actors you wish weren't in it. You know that feeling of going to a movie, and that crappy, unfunny actor you don't like keeps popping up and spoiling your fun? Won't happen here.<br/><br/>All the actors are first rate, too. Gary Cole has a great freakout moment about halfway through the movie while on the phone with a Chinese dude. James Franco is absolutely amazing too, hilarious from start to finish. The essence of a weed dealer is very well captured. Craig Robinson is also incredibly funny as Matheson, the hit-man in blue. Watch for a great Bill Hader cameo in the beginning as well.<br/><br/>The action was also pretty first rate. There was definitely a fair amount of gore, but even then you have to laugh the whole time. There just isn't enough I can say to do this movie justice. The story was hilarious, the acting superb, and the writing was crisp and smart. Don't even hesitate. Go see it. Baked or not."

","Ever since I watched 'This is the End' I have been itching to see Pineapple Express (namely because they film a 'sequel' in that film). So, when the local cult movie cinema decided to run a double feature of The Interview and this film I was there with bells on. However, to my dismay, Pineapple Express simply did not live up to my expectations. Okay, it wasn't a bad film per se, however it certainly wasn't one of Rogan's best. To me it seemed to be little more than an excuse of having copious amounts of marijuana being smoked on film.<br/><br/>Okay, this was probably one of his first films, which is probably why it didn't appeal to me all that much, but I suspect if I was a lot younger, and still hanging around a certain crowd, we would have lapped this film up. The reason being because it was, well, an excuse for smoking copious amounts of marijuana on the big screen. However, unlike a lot of his other films, I didn't think that it was all that funny. Okay, while Rogan's comedy tends to be quite puerile, that puerile part of me simply cannot help but laughing, yet that did not seem to be present in this film.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is basically about marijuana. Well, it's not about marijuana in the sense that Acapulco Gold is about marijuana, but rather it is about a strain of really potent marijuana that gets our uninspiring heroes into a lot of trouble. Rogan plays a process server (a job that seems really cool, but pays pittance) and his comrade in arms is, well, a drug dealer. Anyway, Rogan is going to serve some guy named Ted Jones, who as it turns out is a big time drug dealer, but gets into trouble when he witnesses Jones and a female cop (that's her name) kill some Asian guy. Rogan flees, but leaves his doobie lying on the ground which means that Jones is able to track Rogan and his friend down because it is, well, Pineapple Express, and Ted has only sold Pineapple Express to one guy.<br/><br/>Thus this is what the movie becomes ‚Äì a couple of no hopers stumbling around Los Angeles trying to keep themselves alive while attempting to get the better of the villain. Sound familiar? Well, that is because it is familiar since it is the basic plot of quite a few other films that I have seen. Okay, those films may not have the main characters smoking as much marijuana as they do in this film, but in the end if that is what sets this film apart from the multitude of other films with a similar plot then, well, all I can say that it is not all that fantastic."

","Yet another comedy that starts well but then cracks at the half-way mark, until it completely disintegrates and degenerates into unfunny slapstick nonsense in its last half-hour, including a typical cop-out action finale that makes Bugs Bunny cartoons look like Discovery documentaries. (OK, perhaps a bad example; Discovery Channel ain't what it used to be.) The immunity to bullets which everyone in the movie has (except the bad guys) is also fairly stupid.<br/><br/>Even less funny than the dumb shoot-out was that whole BFF shtick. It was embarrassing to listen to, cringe-worthy even. Very poor writing indeed. Even if you're only 15 you might find it hard to watch.<br/><br/>PE starts off as a funny buddy movie, but degenerates into a Vince Vaughn / Ben Stiller-type farce, perhaps even as bad as an Adam Sandler ""comedy"". Another way of explaining this movie's genre confusion: it starts off as ""Midnight Run"" (not plot-wise) but ends as ""Naked Gun 4"". This new generation of comedians doesn't even understand the basic rules of film-making, not even Seth who shows a lot of promise (or did show a lot of promise before starting to team up with the likes of Streisand and Diaz, hence joined the trashy commercial mainstream). You choose a comedy form and then you stick with it. What you don't do is start off with a reality-based buddy comedy but then suddenly, without rhyme, reason, cause or explanation (laziness perhaps?) switch to absurdist farce.<br/><br/>Besides, there is still a LOT these new kids can learn from the ZAZ team, when it comes to absurdist comedy. One of these things would be that LESS IS MORE, i.e. that you don't milk a gag dry until there's nothing left, especially when it's a dry gag to begin with hence no amount of squeezing helps."

I re-watched it again today and it sadly wasn't as good, its not as bad as iv seen some reviews say in my opinion. Seth Rogan (Dale Denton) and James Franco (Saul Silver) work brilliantly together, they make the movie for me and made you want to watch the film and get some great gags in there. The parents of Dale's girlfriend (Amber Heard) had some of the finniest scenes. I thought the directing was good nothing special but I wasn't expecting anything spectacular in this sort of movie. At times tho I thought they were trying to hard and you were just left in a bit of a limbo. I thought the script was very good, has to be said. Danny McBride as Red was great and he was as funny as ever. One of the hit men played by Craig Robinson was also very good and played his part superbly. Gary Cole as the wired 'villain' was a joy to watch as well. Overall if your looking for a goofy easy watch comedy this will be ideal. Its a good enough movie to just watch on a lazy Sunday if your board but not much more. For the good performances, witty script and a good feel film its a 7/10 from me."

","Pineapple Express struggles to find its rhythm, even from the very beginning of the movie, and you find yourself expecting some sort of start that doesn't come.

This one, like a lot of his productions, is almost two hours long, when you feel it could have easily been trimmed of a good twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Moreover, the humour is off most of the time: most of the gags fall flat and the few funny ones don't compensate for the already boring story.<br/><br/>Still, let's note that there are a few interesting and well directed scenes such as the fight at Red's or the car chase."

","I personally believe this is the most outrageously hilarious film I have ever seen; it's the Cheech and Chong of the twenty first century. If one took Cheech and Chong, Waynes World, and White Castle and put them in a blender, it would make a smoothie called Pineapple Express, so if you like movies similar to the ones I've mentioned then what are you waiting for?? I regret not watching this movie earlier. I thought it looked stupid but it somehow turned out to be my favorite comedy of all time. In regards to the other comment posted, that's just it: this movie is not for people in their 40's plus; this is the comedy of our generation, mainly people in their late teens early twenties, but maybe this film may attract a wider audience than I know. If you aren't into people acting stupid and idiotic, then this may not be the film for you. IMDb is tough on comedies like this one, mainly because they are poorly directed, but it means something for a comedy to get above a 7.0 rating on IMDb, and that says something about this film."
"CagedinSanity","8","0","2","8 July 2009"," Impressed
","Not sure if this has spoilers but, better safe than sorry.<br/><br/>I have never seen any of the Cheech+Chong films, but I know that this was to be up that alley. The previews had amused me, but not really being a whole fan of the ""make weed legal"" subculture, since drugs seem to shut down the mind of all rational thought (Hell, Seth's character Dale said it himself in the movie, saying ""We don't think right when we're high!"", or something along those lines). But, I actually did finally sit down and watch it.<br/><br/>And I was impressed. I was going in expecting some mindless comedy with two stoners going across the city dodging gangsters. What I got? A bonified action movie. I mean seriously, there is a fight every fifteen minutes. And not just stupid slap-fights, I'm talking actual in-home brawls and 20on20 gunfights.<br/><br/>This movie started slow but definitely picked up later. In the beginning, Dale Denton calls a talk show and spews pro-marijuana nonsense which I didn't care much for. He also meets with his high school girlfriend, Which I didn't like, but oddly? I have to admit they had some chemistry. I find myself silently rooting for their relationship. I make myself sick, haha. Anyway, the third stage of the introduction is meeting his drug dealer, Saul (James Franco).<br/><br/>James? Are you serious? The first movie I ever saw him in was Spiderman, and I didn't like him. He barely improved. But in this? Holy crap, he led a hilarious performance and thought he happily stole every scene he was in. It was great to see him in a role that required more than just starting at the screen with a fixated scowl.<br/><br/>Anyway, they talk some more drugspeak which, again, I didn't care much for, but being already slightly enthralled, still amused me. So finally, Dale goes to this one man's house who he's trying to report a subpoena to, and witnesses a murder. It snowballs from there into a big action-chase movie.<br/><br/>It doesn't let up. With anything. The humor, the brilliant violence.<br/><br/>If I have any complaints; it's this. The ridiculous falling-out section of the movie where the two leads get into an argument and temporarily part ways. Why do movies still do this? Does every director exchange an exact movie formula, that uses a cookie-cutter scenario in every separate genre? I mean seriously. Watching that segment was like trying to stomach a children's Disney movie. The argument, and the reunite with a bunch of ""sorry""s and ""I love you, man""s thrown around. It wasn't needed and it was annoying to watch, and it just. Wasn't. Funny. Bringing a dull spot within the movie.<br/><br/>They also seemed to have jumped the shark with Dale and his girlfriend. Halfway through the movie they exchange a final call and then they just forget about her. As I said before, they did a good job making it seem like they had a good relationship, which I wasn't expecting. And at the end,the whole ending seen just kind of dropped abruptly.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I didn't appreciate -anything- this movie stood for. Older men dating high school girls, pro-weed, all that nonsense... But I enjoyed this movie a great deal."

","The thing about Pineapple Express and its comparison with other action/comedies is that it's similar in its own unique way. You've got a simple premise, two guys on the run, consistent laughs and decent action sequences along the way. But what sets Pineapple Express apart is its impact of marijuana in the overall plot. Not only is weed what leads to the main conflict, but it also has an impact on the supposed friendship between the two main characters and has a surprising effect in the climax of the film. Good laughs, timely action and a hilarious performance from James Franco all define Pineapple Express as perhaps one of the most praiseworthy stoner flicks in years.<br/><br/>With a premise as simple as a stoner comedy needs, Pineapple Express is enjoyable to anyone. A lazy slacker stoner named Dale (Seth Rogen) witnesses a murder and is forced on the run along with his dealer (James Franco) after dropping a rare strand of marijuana called Pineapple Express, which can easily be traced back to both of them. While on the run, they meet an old friend (Danny McBride), run from crazy cop (Rosie Perez) and a drug lord (Gary Cole), and even discover their friendship along the way. Clearly marijuana has a deep impact on the story and climax, and along with great laughs and hilarious performances, Pineapple Express delivers at every level.<br/><br/>Despite Seth Rogen's notable performance, Danny McBride's breakthrough and Gary Cole's nice evil turn, James Franco clearly steals the scenes as Rogen's hippie pot dealer Saul Silver. With hilarious dialogue and not much awareness of anything, it is great to see a talented actor such as himself take such a great turn into comedy. Also, the movie properly bridges comedy and action by the climax toward the end, and that that point, one would think that nothing could be more fun than to see two stoners fending for their lives in such a crazy, smoke-filled and fast-paced situation. Overall, Pineapple Express is a fun-filled ride, and anyone looking for laughs--even those who aren't high out of their mind--won't go wrong with the bong-load of fun called Pineapple Express."

","David Gordon Green, a balladist of the cinema, is the last person you'd count on to direct a Judd Apatow male-buddy comedy about two potheads who farcically spark a drug war. But he makes such an above-average stoner comedy, there's a hazard he'll be reduced to vogue in mainstream Hollywood and lured away from the high-brow human interest of All the Real Girls and Snow Angels.<br/><br/>This definite turn by the Terence Malick-inspired filmmaker, from the same writing collaboration as Superbad, with a sizzling hot Rosie Perez in a cop suit and a die-laughing cameo by Ed Begley, Jr., has all the components you'd assume from the school in which it swims: male bonding, sophomoric though reasonably relatable sexual desires, rhetorical ribaldry, staggering drug abuse, fight scenes, gunfire, explosions. Yawn? Not this time. It's a splendid movie, first-rate of its iffy genre. In effect, it's a stoner comedy that is actually hilarious and very clever.<br/><br/>The heroes are a process server, Seth Rogen, and his drug dealer, James Franco. Both are stoned in every single scene. Rogen has a romance going with a high school girl. I think he is still at the age of temperamental maturity where going all the way means asking a girl to be his girlfriend. Franco is even more useless, hiding in his apartment permeated with electronic gizmos and pop culture wares.<br/><br/>Most buddy films aren't that radically distinct from romantic comedies. The relationships are generally progressed in a similar demeanor, simply with male bonding substituting erotic rapport. I think that particularly characterizes the buddies in most buddy movies produced by Judd Apatow. Consider this film's satirically mandatory ending, there's just as much hugging and reciting, ""I love you, man!"" as there is high-fiving.<br/><br/>A third chief character arrives on the stage when Dale and Saul pop in to see Saul's buddy Red played by Danny R. McBride, who has by now dimed them to an odd couple of hit men, played by the underused Kevin Corrigan and the hilarious Craig Ferguson. All of this steers, don't ask how, to a full-scale gunfight between Ted's men and a rival drug empire, only ever referred to by anybody as ""The Asians.""<br/><br/>Two unlikely troupes have convened: the Apatow production gang, and Green and his recurrent sight-and-sound team as well as actor Danny McBride. Not shrugging off creative responsibilities on account of working within the same genre as Cheech and Chong, Harold and Kumar and Half-Baked, Green for the most part uses wide-screen set-ups with becoming aesthetic savvy. The smartly toned movie even surpasses the conventional contemporary action- comedy chase, this time involving two squad cars.<br/><br/>This fifth feature for Green is the resolution to the question, ""What would happen if probable garbage material was made by a good director?"" The result is not only a funny action- comedy, but one that is even funnier if you are or ever have been high smoking pot. The conversations, paranoia, lack of motivation, indulgence in pop culture including its obscurities, the characters' sense of humor, the ending. The film could be argued as either in support or opposition of marijuana. The answer is in the characterizations. I think if you are or have been high on it, you come out both in the mood for it and feeling guilty for being in the mood for it."

","To be honest, I expected more out of Pineapple Express. Watching it just felt like 111 minutes of drugs, violence and some comedy. Wait, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's sort of a good thing, I mean comical violence with weed is pretty fun to watch but the movie itself dragged on for way too much and it felt like the director wanted to take a risk, which is absolutely fine by me. But, by doing that he takes out all the modern humor and makes it into a comical action/adventure still with the typical characters and such, but by doubt the movie itself just got old half way through just watching it. Seeing constant drug taking and violence with no real plot-development isn't entertaining to watch, it's rather boring and that's what Pineapple Express felt like. Apart from that, it's quite funny, got some very quotable dialog but too much of the same thing turns it into a disappointment."

","The Apatow crew have brought us the funniest film in 2008. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, their follow-up to 2007's ""Superbad"" is one of their best films so far. In the film, process server/pothead Dale Denton (Rogen) and his drug dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) must go on the run after Dale witnesses a local drug lord murdering the competition. The filmmakers have succeeded in creating the first great weed action/comedy, blending fun action with Rogen and Goldberg's usual style of comedy.<br/><br/>I continue to find Seth Rogen to be one of the funniest actors in modern movies. I've loved him in every movie I've seen him in with his goof-ball style and off-kilter improv. Considering I had only seen James Franco in his role in the Spider-Man franchise, I wasn't sure how to take his casting in an Apatow comedy. I thought he was pretty good in Raimi's films (well, except his villainous turn in the third...Franco should avoid bad guy roles), but I hadn't seen him do comedy. To my surprise, he was a perfect choice to play opposite Rogen. The two had great chemistry and I actually thought Franco outshone Rogen a bit in this film. I want to see Franco in more comedies! He really needs to become a regular in Apatow's crew in the future. Another shining spot in the film was Danny McBride as Red, Saul's supplier. I had seen McBride in the hilarious ""Tropic Thunder"" and the amusing (but less-than-stellar) ""Hot Rod"" and he is on par with Rogen as a great Hollywood funny-man. Toss in performances by the great Gary Cole and Apatow-regular Craig Robinson and this film's loaded with some hilarious people.<br/><br/>The film has the same low-brow brand of comedy as ""Superbad"" but it never gets stale. Rogen and Goldberg know how to do comedy better than a lot of other Hollywood writers out there, and now we know they can do action if they want to. There isn't a great deal of action in the movie but the few action scenes are great. One of my favorite sequences in the film is when Saul ""saves"" Dale when he believes he has been arrested by a corrupt cop, leading into a hilarious car chase. As I said, this is the funniest film of 2008 in my opinion and I'm really hoping it's success will continue to give Rogen and Goldberg the freedom to create the films they want.

","Do we really need another stoner comedy? With Dude Where's My Car? Harold and Kumar's various adventures, not to mention the Cheech and Chong movies already out there, surely Pineapple Express is a bong movie too far? Well fear not because this latest vehicle for the ubiquitous Seth Rogen is a likable and funny addition to the stoner buddy comedy canon.<br/><br/>Seth plays Dale Denton, a process server with a penchant for pot, who witnesses a murder. Unfortunately for Dale, in his panic to flee the scene he discards a joint made from Pineaple Express, a drug so pure and exclusive, only one dealer possesses it, the bad guys are soon after him and said dealer (James Franco). Franco is great as Saul Silver, laid back and poetic purveyor of illegal substances, his character is a million miles from the stuffy, stiff and wooden Harry Osborn he plays in the Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Rogen's antsy chatter and Franco's addled musings is pitched just right, in a tight Rogen Goldberg script (Superbad) that throws in some sparkling dialogue for our heroes. Indeed, the script only really falters with the weak subplot involving an Asian gang muscling in on gangster boss Ted Jones'(Gary Cole) drug empire.<br/><br/>There are some great supporting characters, Danny R McBride's haplessly indestructible Red is a scream and has the best line in the film, ""You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos, motherf****r!"" The bickering hit men Budlofsky and Matheson, played by Kevin Corrigan and an hilariously childish and camp Craig Robinson respectively, nag their way through the movie like an old demented married couple.<br/><br/>Throw in a hilarious car chase, which wonderfully subverts the machismo of more serious action movies, shoot outs, explosions, fist fights and not forgetting the greatest pot ever devised, Pineapple Express, that according to Saul is so good ""it's like God's vagina!"" And what you have are the ingredients for the world's first and best violent stoner action comedy."

","Much in the line of both Harold and Kumar films this film drives on the thought that the adventures of two constantly high guys can be fun. If you disliked the Harold and Kumar films, skip this one. If you liked them, see this one. Easy as that.<br/><br/>It all starts when Dale Denton, excellently put down by Seth Rogen, comes back from his regular marijuana dealer and accidentally witnesses a murder happening. In his high fear he goes back to his dealer and tells him of what happened, and from there things start rolling. The events that happen are pretty typical - the regular things that would happen to two people that are out of their skull on weed and that are being chased by a murderer. Action sequences are followed by simple and sometimes successful attempts at humor and funny characters and all in all it works out pretty well.<br/><br/>As the story continues on it goes further and further over the top and the grand finale had me in stitches for quite a bit of time. Add to that a good number of in-jokes in the form of references to other films and the ending result is there - some good laughs in a funny film that can be forgotten the moment you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 samples of weed"

","I believe that in order to enjoy Pineapple Express, you are required to have a select sense of humor, or at least an appreciation for its particular brand of humor, but provided that you do, the film really delivers.<br/><br/>I laughed non-stop... the timing was priceless, and the interactions between Dale (Rogan) and Saul (Franco) had such a natural flow. None of the laughs felt planned to me, as funny lines and moments in films often do, and I appreciate that no one was TRYING to make me laugh the entire time.<br/><br/>While Rogan was his typical, blunt, classless-humor self, James Franco really steals the show in his role as Saul, turning Rogan into more of a straight man than anything.<br/><br/>One last thing I'd like to add: You do NOT have to be a stoner or see this film baked to full enjoy this movie.

","At first, I wasn't really paying any attention to the movie. After watching the trailer, I was definitely going to watch this movie. Seth Rogen is a great comedian actor, but I didn't know anything about James Franco's comic side. After watching the movie, he was funny as hell. His fake hair was so realistic. I thought it was his real though, but obviously it wasn't. Whoever did the hair did a great job.<br/><br/>Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a lazy court clerk and a drug user. Every time he needs weed, he goes to his best friend Saul Silver (James Franco) to buy some, specially, one called Pineapple Express. One day, while in his car smoking weed (the pineapple express), Dale witness a murder buy a dirty cop and the city's drug lord. Dale panics and throws the weed out of the window and takes off in his car. He rushes to tell Saul what he saw and they both start running for their lives. Now, the dirty cop wants to kill the witness and sends his trio of bad guys to kill Dale and Saul also.<br/><br/>I thought the story was great and well told. I really like how everything was brought to the end of the film without any confusion. I enjoy the script from the beginning until the end.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen was the right choice for Dale Denton. I thought he was great and delivered a great hilarious performance. But I thought James Franco was amazing as Saul Silver. He really look like a big time drug addict. Every time he was on a scene, I laughed. He is one of the funniest character in the movie.<br/><br/>I really like how the action was mix up with the humor. It wasn't force at all like other comedies. It was perfectly done. I laughed throw the entire movie. There wasn't a minute where I couldn't stop laughing. I thought the action was good though. I was not expecting that much gun firing in the movie.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express is one of the funniest movie this year. Seth Rogen and James Franco were hilarious in the movie, especially Franco. If you are a comedy movie fan, then I believe this movie will leave wanting even more."

","I thought that this movie was going to be my new favorite movie. I had waited so long to see it. It seemed as if the ads for this movie were out for about a year before its release. The hype was also strong for pineapple express, so when i finally went to see it, i was psyched. However the feeling i had when i left the theater, wasn't as good as i thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong, this movie was still awesome, it was so funny, and the twisted action was comical. However i think it lacked the feel that its advertising hyped up.

"bloodymonday","7","0","2","24 October 2008"," Review: Pineapple Express
","I'll have to admit, there are plenty ""wtf"" moments for me in the first 10-15 minutes. But then I realized that I really need to set my perception right. Because Pineapple Express is stoner comedy that made by people who stoned (it's not necessary whether you need to get high or not, but it would be amusing if you do haha+). And you must be able to accept a bunch of meaningless gestures and dialogs that spread around this flick. If you can do that, then you will find that what you've seen so far is pretty friggin' awesome.<br/><br/>Although it has Judd Apatow's watermark all over it (no doubt, since he is a producer), but if you seek out for meaningful lines or intrigue storytelling (movie like Knocked Up comes to mind), then you will likely to be disappointed. Because Pineapple Express is solely aim for laughs, since it's written by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg. But I would say that their collaboration in this time is a bit letdown from previous effort like Superbad, which is amusing AND touching, whereas PE is totally lack of character's intimacy. Be that as it may, there's a lot one-liners that can guarantee to make you rolling on the floor laughing.<br/><br/>First thing when you heard the director's name, you will have a weird feeling about what the hell David Gordon Green is doing here. He is the man who responsible for thoughtful indie dramas like All the Real Girls, George Washington and recently Snow Angels, which starred by Kate Beckinsale (and which going to be my next review√Ç‚Ä¶ I guess haha+). But then my doubt was completely gone since he seems to ""get"" the flick. An awkward male bonding, incoherent action scenes and trippy dialogs, all these ingredients he put into can make this film an absolute stoner comedy.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen might be on the roll now (Knocked Up and soon to be classic Zack and Miri make a Porno), but sad to say that his character in Pineapple Express was pretty uninspired. Maybe it was caused by the fact that he's got ""straight role"" in this film. And sub-plot between him and his barely legal girlfriend feel pretty half-baked and yet it worsens by inconclusive ending.<br/><br/>On the other hand, James Franco's Saul is totally own this movie. His character maybe the funniest crack dealer ever put on screen. His child-like persona makes me totally forgive that he sells weed for living. For James, people might consider him to be a lovable hunk in movies like Spider-Man trilogy, Annapolis and Flyboys, but I think his true potential is comedy. It's a role that I find him felt comfy and belonged to, I guess fans of Freeks and Geeks (which I haven't seen it yet) tend to agree with me on this fact.<br/><br/>Pineapple Express maybe completely pointless, it also doesn't have any valuable lesson to teach us (don't do weed? Hell no, this film is totally up for it haha+). But one thing that it succeeds is an ability to give you good times. Do you remember simple yet brilliant buddy action-comedies in 80s? (ie. 48 hrs, Lethal Weapon) If you do, then Pineapple Express will give you just the same amount of hilarity."

","Pineapple Express is the name of the strain of cannabis that serves as the McGuffin in this movie. It's fair to say this film is closer to the original buddy-stoners, Cheech & Chong, than anything else, including Harold & Kumar which are awesome too, in their own way.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen kinda trades places with James Franco, who plays the dealer/stoner Saul. Rogen is Dale, who witnesses a murder which gets the pair in trouble. Confusion and laughter ensues. So forget about the p(l)ot.<br/><br/>This movie has a very 80's feel to it, and sometimes feels like it's paying homages to many different movies. There's action and some blood, but everything is done with some humor, including the bad guys. There's a lot of subtle satire here, but, surprisingly for me, not as much stoner humor as you'd expect.<br/><br/>The great thing here are the convos between Rogen and Franco, who react realistically in unrealistic situations. It's a great mix of action and comedy, and you've ever been a dealer or a 'client', you'll relate to this on a 'higher' level. However it's not a non-stop laughter movie, but it's one that will make you smile for the duration, provided you don't take anything seriously.<br/><br/>Great to watch stoned, too! While it's not the definitive modern stoner movie many were expecting, it's a treat. If the Apatow crew keeps it up, they'll be the John Hughes of the 2000's.<br/><br/>7/10"

","""Put this in your pipe and smoke it."" <br/><br/>Process server Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) has a grudging business relationship with the laconic Saul Silver (James Franco), deigning to visit only to purchase Saul's primo product -- a rare new strain of pot called Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and the city's most dangerous drug lord (Gary Cole), he panics and dumps the Pineapple Express at the scene. When it's traced back to him, Dale and Saul run for their lives... and they quickly discover that they're not just suffering from weed-fueled paranoia.<br/><br/>If they survive, these two just might become real friends. All aboard the Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>REVIEW: Pineapple Express is yet another comedy hit from the Apatow posse and by far one of the funniest movies of 2008 alongside Step Brothers. David Gordon Green, one of the finest director Hollywood has to offer, easily transitioned his A-game from heavy set dramatic piece Snow Angels to this: a laugh out loud, hysterical, riotous comedy romp. The buddy chemistry between Seth Rogen's Dale Denton and James Franco's Saul Silver glued perfectly. Franco's hilarious turn as lovable and trustworthy drug dealer Saul shines at every scene he's in, he basically just steals the show from everyone around and even scene-stealer Rogen just stayed behind him, not in front where he usually is.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying Rogen didn't shine in the movie, his role, just like every other role he's done as a lazy slacker, every day stoner and the number one customer to Saul's drug enterprise. He just basically nailed it, he's so used to playing the role that he need not exert effort to act, he's good at what he does and that's what makes him one of the budding comedic actors today.<br/><br/>Hysterical and and laugh out loud scenes are very abundant in the movie, right from the start and until it ends, you will not stop laughing. From the solid deliveries, the new and freshly picked gags and jokes from the mind of screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen and to the memorable and instant classic quotes, Pineapple Express is one of the funniest films I've seen so I highly recommend it if you're into stoner comedies or just to have a good laugh. All aboard."

","This is an enjoyable movie that serves the buddy genre well. Whilst not a great movie and not a comedy classic (and let's be honest there are very few of them) this is a good fun movie. A comedy that mixes in action aiming well and truly and the younger male demographic. This could easily have been awful. But instead what we have here is the story of two pretty average guys who go about their business under the radar. Seth Rogan is well cast as Dale Denton and equally good is James Franco playing against type casting as small time drug dealer Sail Silver. When a crime is witnessed by Dale the pair end up pursued by a criminal cartel headed by the excellent Gary Cole and Rosie Perez. They are pursued by a couple of henchmen and they also hook up with a buddy 'Red'. The minor roles are well drawn out which adds to the charm of the movie. The film is well directed though I found myself loosing interest at times. So maybe could have been a little tighter in the editing. But overall I would definitely give the director David Gordon Green another chance and will see more of his films, and will probably end up watching the film a good few more times."

","Pineapple Express combines genres - it is a mix of stoner comedy, knockabout farce, buddy movie, and crime thriller. The crime thriller element provides the plot on which everything else is hung and, it has to be said, is probably the element which sits least easily with the others - for instance, after the intermediary dope supplier has amusingly betrayed the two hapless protagonists to the bad guys, they shoot him, and suddenly funny doesn't seem quite so funny any more. Having said that, genuine jeopardy is a valuable engine for driving the story.<br/><br/>I didn't care for Seth Rogen very much before seeing this movie. My attitude has softened, but not by very much. His character here simply isn't very likable, and most of his performance is delivered in hysterical shouting. By contrast, James Franco (who also does his fair share of shouting) comes across as a much sweeter, if befuddled, character. In fact, by far the best thing about this movie (if one discounts Amber Heard's not inconsiderable decorative value) is the buddy aspect, and the way the friendship between this pair of losers develops and comes to be recognised by both of them as something which is of such value that it transcends the horrible situation they find themselves in.<br/><br/>My knowledge of marijuana culture is limited, so a number of the stoner gags were lost on me (though not on the row of young men sitting just in front of me, who laughed uproariously at points which left me puzzled). And there is a lot of stoner stuff, particularly in the first half hour. But there are a lot of other funny lines too (not least from the parents of Amber Heard's character), some very funny physical stuff and, at the heart of the movie, an engaging relationship between the two main characters. The mixing of genres may not be 100% successful, but it works well enough to make watching the movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>It is probably redundant to mention that the use of our old friend the F-word is almost incessant."

Now, he must disentangle himself while trying to keep or build all the relationships he values most.<br/><br/>The plot itself deal with many serious issues and was definitely darker and more complex than many other part comedy movies, but the amount of comedy was not as heavy as in some other movies and somewhat detracts from the nail-biting moments of suspense.<br/><br/>Sean Rogen plays Denton well, and most of the other actors were pretty good. Denton's high school girlfriend, though drop-dead attractive, probably was the worst in terms of acting. After a strong start, the movie does drag on a bit, and leaves a major subplot unresolved at the end, making it seem as if the movie was rushed in production. Most of the funny moments were also not humorous, and realism was not something to be found in this movie. If more time was spent editing out a few things, this movie could become a classic, but instead, it is just merely worth watching."

","I'm not exactly a die-hard Apatow fan, with the exception of his work on Anchorman. I'll admit that when I can watch his movies with a buddy, rather than my wife, I enjoy them a lot more, as his movies are really geared more towards younger male crowds. Superbad, while having its funny parts, was a little over the top most the time. And although Forgetting Sarah Marshall had some great laughs and a decent storyline, the sex scenes and crotch shots just get ridiculous.<br/><br/>That being said as to state my position on Apatow films (as it seems most the time, people are either die hard fans or flatout hate his movies, whereas I'm kinda in the middle), I thought Pineapple Express may have been the funniest Apatow film I've seen since Anchorman. Naturally, as with nearly all his projects since Anchorman, this movie contains plenty of language. But it doesn't seem to distract from the movie so much. When I saw Tropic Thunder, even without my wife being there, the language from the character Les Grossman (played by a noteworthy cameo) was a bit much. All I could think was ""Man...my wife would hate this"". In Pineapple Express, I didn't really notice the language so much as to give me that same feeling. I was aware it was there, but it didn't seem to detract so much from the movie. I was also glad to see the movie absent of gratuitous naked shots, which have become a norm in Apatow films. The drug use really didn't bother me throughout the film, even though it's pretty much a constant the whole time. But watching a guy smoke a doobie on screen just doesn't really offend me on the same level as a male crotch scene or loading the movie up with extremely tasteless profanity. And while I've seen some people comment on the gore, it wasn't really that bad (well...it was no Rambo). At the end, it did have a little more, but it was always in a comedic manor and added heavily to the humor.<br/><br/>With all the pre-warnings out of the way regarding the reasons for the R rating, let me just tell you that this film is hilarious. You have to really understand the type of humor used in this film and understand the subtle jokes, slapstick, and random spoofs (don't worry, when I say spoof....I don't mean in a Disaster Movie or Epic Movie kind of way). While this could be considered a ""stoner movie"", the film is actually quite brilliant in the sense of comedy. It never takes itself seriously, and if you ever think it's about to, it turns right around and turns the situation into a well setup joke. The plot isn't elaborate and if you're looking for a ""smart"" comedy with a thick storyline.....well....you're a moron for thinking this film might be that. It's pretty much a plot thrown together for the most part to make you laugh, just as Anchorman or Dumb & Dumber. But also just like the aforementioned movies, you still get wrapped up in the plot and characters because it's just so dang funny.<br/><br/>I don't really know how else to explain the movie. It's clever, witty, entertainingly stupid, and just downright fun. It's one of the better comedies I've seen in several years. I'd say go see it with a group of guys, and you'll all be rolling."
"bballpat23523","9","0","2","26 August 2008"," Not your typical Apatow production
","As a big fan of Judd Apatow, I went to this movie with sky-high expectations, especially with Seth Rogen as a writer coming off the incredible success of Superbad. I can't say I was totally pleased with the film, but it did have many laugh out loud moments. The dialogue is very much geared toward stoners, although it retains the sense of humor we've seen from Apatow in the past. There are plenty of intense action scenes, and overall I'd say it is totally geared toward men. However, girls will still attend just to get a glimpse of James Franco(as I found out personally.) Franco plays a more extreme version of his character in ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and hits it right on the head as Saul. I like him better in comedies than in dramas. Rogen's character is similar to those he has played in other movies, the dialogue is just a bit different. I personally thought Danny McBride was good as Red, and many others have small roles that help bring this comedy to another level. Apatow's productions have recently been all about sex, until this film came out and showed us a new side of his comedies. I think this will hit with stoners more than it will with the regular Apatow fans, probably because more of them are having sex and can relate than are smoking weed. It did not quite live up to its gigantic expectations, but a good movie nonetheless."

","There is no denying Seth Rogen is the new face of comedy over the last year and a half, but who would've thought that dramatic stand-out James Franco had so much comedic genius (I've never seen the TV show Freaks and Geeks), and for the case of this specific movie, was the funniest person in it. While that isn't exactly saying his performance was stellar, because the movie was ho-hum at best, it can be said for Franco is a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Only slightly better than Step Brothers this movie does not compare to 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked-Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall etc. I did not laugh as much as I did during Step Brothers, and one of the less laugh out loud comedies in recent memory. What was clear from this movie and perhaps where its charm lies (and the same can be said for the other movies previously mentioned, except Step Brothers). It never forces you to laugh, movies of comedic past Austin Powers, Borat, and other movies like that either you laugh and you think it's funny or you think it's stupid, it's very hit or miss. With this new breed of comedy they center it around a solid story and characters, so even if a gag or whatever doesn't make you laugh, there is always this charm or like for the story/character that you still like it anyways. Case and point: even though I laughed out loud during Step Brothers more, I can't help but give a slight edge in Pineapple Express(unfortunately IMDb does not do half stars).<br/><br/>As for actual movie logistics, Rogen plays a stoner in just about everything he's associated with and puts forth a similar performance to what he did in Knocked-Up. Franco is the ""dopest dope"" in this movie, as a completely convincing doped out Pot-dealer. With OK, supporting performance's from Gary Cole, and super milf Rosie Perez. While Danny R. McBride, absolutely drove me up the wall, I can't stand him, doesn't make me laugh and I'm worried we could have another Dane Cook on our hands (Worthless, crappy comic, who will get a career out of over the top garbage performances), the only way you'll find this guy funny is if your high.<br/><br/>Pros: James Franco is great. Rogen is solid, again. Story has charm, regardless of how much you laugh.<br/><br/>Cons: Didn't laugh out loud that much. Danny R. McBride needs to turn down the suck knob. I don't like pot, so it was partially doomed from the get go.<br/><br/>Overall: The best way to recommend this movie, is if you like pot. Immature college frat boys will no doubt flock to this movie regardless just because pot is a theme. Even if your not a fan of the chronic, you still might have a good time, but my diagnosis you might be better off waiting for another Rogen performance in Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno, which comes out later this year. Or go watch The Dark Knight again..."
"MuchTooDutch","8","0","2","18 August 2008"," High as a kite ¬ó eh, a great summer escape.
","One Crazy Night There I was, back in high school, watching two grown men wander the streets of their hometown in search of friends and foe, drugs and dreams. I didn't have to try very hard to see them walk through their front door to standing parents, awaiting their arrival; their disapproving looks saying it all. Before speaking they pause, minds spinning from the night's many adventures, they rewind, trying to start from the beginning. Then, very slowly and seriously, they begin, ""You guys¬ÖI can explain. This could have happened to anyone."" Armed with a throwaway job as a Process Server and a mediocre high school girlfriend (the very cute, Amber Heard), Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) has his daily sites set on two things: getting high today and preparation for his high tomorrow. Generally, the only thing deterring him from these goals are the minor obstacles in his path ¬ñ new costume ideas for the next 'serve', scraping together enough cash for tonight's purchase, calling his girlfriend ¬ñ and even they rarely seem to keep him from his hazy utopia. In Denton's eyes, he lives in the pinnacle of life's glorious drag, sucking down joints like yesterday's leftovers. Its comic genius, I must admit and no joke is lost among the laborious scenes of everyday puffing.The mellow attitude with which the film opens is only enhanced after we meet Saul Silver (James Franco), Dale's just-as-lazy drug dealer. If Dale's a pothead, I'm not sure where that puts Saul ¬ó maybe, Dale in a decade? **Spoiler(s) ahead** The movie stays in its smoky saga only long enough to paint the scene. After Dale witnesses a cop's murder by the hands of a crocked dealer (Gary Cole) and leaves a joint of the infamously rare Pineapple Express at the scene of the crime the movie switches gears after he finally begins fearing for his life after realizing the rare weed's traceability and just like that, we've got a full blown mouse hunt on our hands. Between Silver's lackluster zeal for much of anything and Dale's predisposition to practicality, the jokes are brilliantly normal and the comedy perfectly understandable. What did we expect, really? Every Apatow movie to date has been about the average man; each time finding himself in an increasingly more improbable, but never impossible, situation. Pride yourself on cleanliness and 1980's comic books and you could be a 40 Year-Old Virgin. Hook up with a girl out of your league and both of you could very well be unhappy and Knocked Up. Follow around high school boys trying desperately to swipe the V-card and successfully purchase alcohol with a fake ID and I guarantee you the footage will be Superbad. Pineapple Express is no different. Smoke enough weed in a short period of time and this could actually happen to you, there's not a doubt in my mind.<br/><br/>Don't read me wrong here, this movie becomes more and more outlandish with each passing turn, but the jokes are never too far ¬ñ save the fighting ninja warriors, those were a bit much, I suppose. After these modern-day Cheech and Chongs realize their notorious stash of PE can be traced back to them, they decide to sprint for the middle man ¬ó tweener-dealer Red (Danny McBride) and easily the funniest character of this film (and maybe the entire last year).<br/><br/>Each twist of fortunes finds Red fighting against someone else and by the end of the film the now-famous clip of the neck brace-wearing Red chirping, ""thug life¬Ö"" has never rang truer. With the dealer's goons (The Office's Craig Robinson and Superbad's Kevin Corrigan) hot on their tracks, the three underdogs embark on the save-all-except-themselves mission using the PE to finance the necessities: Slurpees and snacks. After Dale gets arrested for blatantly selling to minors, their plan seems thwarted ¬ó all hope lost. Arms behind his back, trying to explain to the driving police officer, Dale glances up to see his counterpart ¬ñ a Slurpee-holding Saul ¬ñ standing directly in front of the speeding vehicle, willing to take a hit for his friend. The slushy drinks erupt, mostly on the windshield, make the Police cruiser now both their getaway and a seemingly obvious hit-and-run homicide. Misconception¬Öall one big misconception, but hilarious nonetheless. I wouldn't want to spoil the rest of the film for you, but bottom line: it's worth a watch if you feel like a night off from responsibility."

","I don't smoke the reefer so that is perhaps why some parts of this film didn't make sense. <br/><br/>It was still worthy of a lot of laughs but there were times where only a stoned individual could grasp the existential (or blunted) undertone of the comedic interaction. <br/><br/>I still liked it but I would recommend investing in an herbal modifier (like echinacea) prior to viewing the film :) <br/><br/>Also, there are instances when ""dude space"" is violated and if you are homophobic at all (which is sad) you will be uncomfortable. <br/><br/>It doesn't follow the same tone as the other Apatow movies but it is worth patronage."
"stewiefan201","9","0","2","18 August 2008"," It's the greatest stoner comedy ever!! It has a few problems here and there but I laughed a lot.
","Well over the years we've had Cheech and Chong, to the recent Harold and Kumar. These famous duos are both stoner comedy icons. And now we have a new pot smoking duo: Dale Denton and Saul Silver (Seth Rogen and James Franco). Pineapple Express begins with Dale Denton, a 25 year old pot smoking process server, who just so happens to be dating a high school girl. Saul Silver is the dim-witted pot dealer whom Dale buys weed from, and desperately wants to be friends with Dale. One day after buying rare weed from Saul, named Pineapple Express, Dale puffs a joint in front of the man's house he is about to ""serve"". It is here that Dale witnesses the owner of the house Ted Jones (Gary Cole), and a police officer Carol (Rosie Perez), murder an Asian man at the window. Dale speeds off after getting rid of the joint, but it turns out Ted Jones is a drug lord, and the second he finds the rare joint he immediately knows it came from Saul. Dale and Saul now band together to run away from the dealers, and realize they may not be able to trust the police either. Ted sends a band of strange hit men (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson) to hunt down Dale and Saul. But as the pot smoking duo continue to only get in more trouble, they have no realization they're about to end up up in the middle of a drug war: Between Ted Jones' crew and the Asian drug dealers. Now with the help of Saul's friend Red (Danny Mcbride), they decide to take action with a fine arsenal of guns to boot! <br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that Pineapple Express is the greatest stoner comedy I've ever seen. I've seen bits and pieces of the Cheech and Chong movies. I've seen both Harold and Kumar movies, the first one was great, the sequel not so much. And although Half Baked used to be the epitome of stoner comedy for me, it was just a little too short and thin on plot to be great. Pineapple Express has a plot, characters that are very funny, good performances, classic one liners, and a great deal of entertaining action. The transition from Comedy to Action movie doesn't exactly mesh together perfectly, but it still provided laughs through its sheer preposterous goofiness. And who says a stoner comedy has to be perfect. Are stoners themselves perfect in real life? No. Walking in to see Pineapple Express expecting perfection is sudden death.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a misfire if it wasn't for the excellent team up of Seth Rogen and James Franco. The two characters blaze up a joint in almost every scene, and provide huge laughs through the hi-jinks they get into. They have really funny charisma together, and some of the parts depicting how blazed they are really ring true. Combine them with Danny Mcbride, and the film only got funnier because now it turns into a pot smoking trio. This may be Mcbride's breakthrough role, just like Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Mclovin) in Superbad. I thought he was very funny when he starred in The Heartbreak Kid, in fact he was one of the only things funny about that movie, and I'm glad he may finally glad recognition after this role. The first 5 minutes are set in 1937, and involve an experiment on the effects of marijuana, and the test subject just so happens to be played by Bill Hader. I won't give anything else away but it's one of the best parts of the movie. A lot of stoner comedies depend solely on the charisma of their leading characters. Pineapple Express has that and much more.<br/><br/>What I also liked about Pineapple Express is it's brand of humor towards pot. It takes a few chances and raises the bar on stoner comedies. Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay tried to raise the bar by adding lots of gross out humor, and even a scene where the duo blaze with President Bush. That was even more preposterous than the actiony explosion-filled ending to this movie. There is a scene in Pineapple Express where Dale and Saul sell some weed to a few middle schoolers, and end up getting high with them. This scene offended plenty of people for age reasons, but amused many others including me. Maybe I'm desensitized, I don't know. Pot is the least harmful drug out there, it is even safer than alcohol...Come on admit it. Does that mean I like the idea of pre-teens toking up? No, definitely not...in real life! On screen it's funny, I can't really explain why, and feel free to call me a hypocrite. I liked that Pineapple Express took these chances, because it only made it funnier. I go on the IMDb boards for Pineapple Express, and most of what I see is people bashing the film and weed in general. You know what, if you don't like the idea of people smoking pot then why did you choose to see Pineapple Express? And as for weed in general, people have to learn to live their own life and stop complaining about what other people do.<br/><br/>Finally a stoner comedy that raises the bar. Pineapple Express is a fun summer comedy that, while not perfect, has a lot of laughs. I give Pineapple Express a 4.5 out of 5."
"freakaman24","9","0","2","15 August 2008"," Offbeat Characters Steal the Movie !
","The actual plot of this movie is nothing special, but I don't think that is what this movie is really about. It is about the very special friendship between Dale and Saul. You can label it a "" stoner movie "" if you want to, but I think it insults the talent involved. Dale ( Seth Rogen ) is a process server who hands out subpoenas and lives a rather dull life , but has a teen girlfriend and likes to get high. Saul is a hard pot head who sells weed and likes to get high watching 227 ( who doesn't ) but they are thrown together after Dale witnesses a murder. What culminates is a journey, where they meet several strange and odd characters as they try to escape with their lives. It ends with a massive and very violent shoot-out that some-what does not quite fit the beginning of the movie. Why is this a great movie is because of the characters and the actors portraying them. Seth and James Franco , as Saul, are 2 of the most unlikely heroes in film and they play off each other perfectly. The supporting cast is beyond reproach. Ed Begley Jr and Nora Dunn are hysterical as the teen girls' parents and Gary Cole and Rosie Perez give real edges to potential cardboard characters. The real find is Danny McBride as the hard to kill Red, a backstabbing go-between who steals every scene he is in. I know people knock comedic actors, but he is very deserving of an Oscar nod for his wonderful work. It isn't the lines he says , but it is the way he says them that will have you rolling ( no pun ) in the aisles. The rest of the cast work well and by the end, you may be thinking about the friends you have in your life and you may want to tell them how special they are because this movie is not about weed and such, it is about finding a true friend and knowing that they will always be with you no matter what."

","I just got back from watching this movie not to long ago, i was impressed, very funny movie!. Story is nothing short of Hilarious, jokes are funny, acting quite good. its kinda funny how Red always kept on getting shot and what not and he would always come back, it's like hes invincible. James Franco did a good job, you wouldn't expect a funny role from him because he's always doing serious roles such as Harry from Spiderman, or Capitan Prince from The great raid. That female cop thought she was all that and then some, kinda annoying. Lots of sexual jokes near the end, although they made it funny, it got boring after a while of hearing the same thing.<br/><br/>Great movie! i enjoyed it allot, if your a fan of Seth Rogan, you should definitely see this movie."

A lot of comedies kind of stop and die off near the end if you ask me, but not this one, it's an excellent comedy film. I really honestly cannot say anything negative about this film.

","In the 1930s, when the United States government deemed marijuana illegal, low budget movie producers put out over-the-top, anti dope (yet subtlety pro-decadent) creeds like ""Reefer Madness"" and ""Assassin Of Youth"" to scare the crap out of Joe and Jane Rube, using cheap tactics. We today chuckle at these melodramas, along with modern day farces, featuring the likes of Cheech and Chong, Jay and Silent Bob (my favorite duo) and Harold and Kumar, all stoners or dealers who are in the most hysterical situations.<br/><br/>I can't say ""Pineapple Express"", the latest product from uber-comedy mastermind, Judd Apatow, is totally hysterical with its' bloody-letting gun plays, but I admire the film's heroes love of the chronic that keeps them from being killed.<br/><br/>If he's not serving subpoenas in disguise or hanging with his barely legal (18!) girlfriend at her high school, Dale Denton (the lovable, burly Seth Rogen who echoes Albert Brooks without a sweat) is getting high with his happy-go-lucky dealer Saul Silver (the surprisingly good James Franco of the Spiderman films), who's in the biz to support his grandmother as she lives in an retirement home.<br/><br/>They're good buds (!); Saul even gives Dale a sample of the title, a rare weed that was discontinued by the government in the 30s (more on that later). Dale's likes it, but, during a 'hit"", he inadvertently sees a mob hit, committed by a nasty drug lord (Gary Cole of ""Desperate Housewives"") and a corrupt cop (a shamelessly slumming Rosie Perez) and leaves his blunt (weed cigarette) as a clue for the reprobates. Can our two social defects outrun and outwit (!) their bloodthirsty yet eccentric pursuers without taking a puff? Uh¬Öwhat was the question, again? <br/><br/>A favorite director in the indie film district, David Gordon Green (""All The Real Girls"", ""Undertow""), imbues the gonzo script by Rogen and Evan Goldberg (""Superbad"") with frantic wackiness, homaging Quentin Tarantino, the Three Stooges and every average action film from the 1970s to the present. His cesspool swim will turn off his fans, but a man has to work, and Green's reliable.<br/><br/>Good friends since the short-lived ""Freaks and Geeks"" series, Rogen and Franco delightfully suffer from Peter Pan syndrome; their post-joint paranoia saves their butts, but they barely learn from their mistakes. Cole and Perez are odd as the lead villains, but better are their field operatives, played by Kevin Corrigan (""Grounded For Life"") and Craig Robinson (""The Office"", US version and ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" with Rogen). Amber Heard (""North Country"") is surprisingly mature as Rogen's gal, countering his immaturity. Ed Begley Jr. (""St. Elsewhere"") and Nora Dunn (""Saturday Night Live"") are goofy strict as Heard's parents.<br/><br/>Most interesting is Danny R. McBride (a stock actor of Green's, ""Drillbitt Taylor"", ""Tropic Thunder"") as Red, a two-faced associate of Saul's, who has the same invulnerability trait as Tim Roth's Mr. Orange from Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" and spousal worries as Tarantino himself in ""Pulp Fiction"". Also memorable is the film's black and white prologue (using an old Columbia Pictures's torch lady stamp), where an Army test subject (Bill Hader of ""SNL"" and other Apatow works) gives a goofy, vulgar opinion about the military while stoned to a no-nonsense, Nick-Fury like colonel (character heavy James Remar of ""48 Hrs"" and ""The Warriors""), who looks likes he's in dire need of a colon exam.<br/><br/>Though it's not filled with the socially responsible sweetness of past Apatow productions (Dale and Saul sell weed to a trio of foul-mouthed kids during their run), ""Pineapple Express"" is a nice reminder that raunchy comedies are like tree houses, occupied by boys. They don't have to have fancy curtains all the time."

Rogen and Evan Goldbring deliver a tight script that goes maybe minutes too long. David Gordon Green directs this amusing tale with ease<br/><br/>The comic sequences will become memorable, especially as more people will probably see this movie on DVD.<br/><br/>Rogen fits the bill and brings t all home.

"Polaris_DiB","7","0","2","10 August 2008"," Needn't toke to enjoy this one, but what the hey, can't hurt either...
","Well, I knew this was ""just a stoner movie"" going in, though the trailer had a few laughs and it was directed by David Gordon Green. It's practically not worth reciting, but, uh, Judd Apatow and his crew. Man-boy. Those same old words that are in practically every review of these movies. And anyway...<br/><br/>Pineapple Express starts out really well and manages to keep the humor up through most of its playlength. The dialog is pretty spot on in places, and the relationship between the two leads is actually really believable and moving. The real fun of it is that pretty much every party involved in the plot really has an imperfect notion of what is going on, leading to some pretty hilarious sequences as takers, dealers, and everyone in between psych themselves out over what is mostly just hyperactive imaginations--though sometimes they're actually correct, making it all the more silly.<br/><br/>The second half? Not so great. Once the various parties start meeting and the guns start going off, the movie leans towards wanting to be serious as a sort of tease, then just goes for the slapstick and absurd. Make no mistake: it's funny, but it detracts from the real humor of a plethora of characters slowly wigging out over things they know nothing about, mostly as a result of being under the influence. Sorry, but once the action starts, it's like a cheap Hot Fuzz knock off... the sequences are silly but rather ridiculous, and some of them really lead no where.<br/><br/>Also, there are some pretty massive plot holes in this movie, the type you can stick an arm through and see yourselves flipping off the writer over. Yes, I know: stoner movie, no one cares. No reason to at least put in a single line of dialog saying, ""Hey, I happen to know something about a supposed secret hideout, maybe it's actually there"" instead of just having characters randomly show up there. I mean, I know expectations are low on this movie, but that's no reason to just ignore significant plot points.<br/><br/>What does make the movie up is the performances and the contemporary pop culture savvy. This is definitely a movie with legs, the type of one that people will watch in 20 years and be all like, ""Hahaha, ahhh the millennium!"" (like watching Dazed and Confused and laughing about the 90s). And as Apatow productions go, this is one that manages to be just intelligent enough to not be ""Dewey Cox"" BS and still silly enough to not drag like ""Knocked Up"".<br/><br/>What the heck. Check it out. And if you're the type, go ahead and toke before you go, because as Rogan's character says, ""Weed makes everything better... bad days, bad music, bad movies..."" Luckily this one didn't have to be all that bad, so that the weed isn't required.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I saw this movie with two friends and my younger brother. My friends and I are definitely not opposed to stoner movies, but my brother has never smoked marijuana, knows very little about it, and has hardly even been around people who smoke marijuana. We all still thought it was hilarious. I think that it has a very wide appeal despite using marijuana as a major element. I saw an interview of Seth Rogen where he was saying they wanted to try very hard to create an actual story line and have entertaining and funny parts that went beyond the classic ""stoner"" movie. His example was that Cheech and Chong was great for all the stoners, but nobody else would ever want to watch a movie about two guys driving around in a van made out of pot (which is pretty much what the entire plot was). This was much different and was really refreshing. I think that like it or not, marijuana is a big part of American culture. The government estimates that at least 70% of Americans have at least tried marijuana once. I think it's about time that it becomes acceptable for marijuana to appear in popular culture in a way that transcends the usual fringe ""stoner"" movie, and I for one think this movie greatly succeeded at that."

If it was another Superbad, it'd be just that, and all I'd have to say is if you liked Superbad go see this blah blah blah. <br/><br/>But, while there are similarities of course (just cause it's not Superbad doesn't mean the same guys didn't write it,) this movie is in a league of its own. The action scenes are really brutal, but the things that are happening to the characters in the midst of them are hysterical. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS IN CASE YOU DIDN'T SEE THE WARNING!!!!***<br/><br/>Seth Rogan gets part of his ear blown off, James Franco gets his foot caught in a broken windshield, and stabbed with a fork, and runs into a tree, Danny R.

When James Franco got stabbed with a fork, I didn't cringe as much as crack up at how abruptly it happened, or how funny the things he and Seth started screaming when it happened. ""He's a good pot dealer, he's my pot dealer!"" ""I'm the good guy!"" while he's got a fork dangling in his right shoulder.<br/><br/>But, amidst the well put together action scenes, the plot is pretty intense. Two stoner's get caught up in a drug war, and just keep digging themselves deeper and deeper, until you're thinking how in the hell are they going to get out of it.

This performance shows that he can be more than just the Green Goblin. And of course lets not forget Seth Rogen. The comedy genius strikes again. This movie was cleverly written and surprisingly action-packed. By far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The movie was filled with hilarious one liners and the fact that both characters were high throughout the whole movie made for some interesting scenes (the woods, fighting with red, and a car chase). I'd recommend this movie to every person who's ever craved munchies and reaked of marijuana."

","Obviously, they were high when they made this movie. At times it works to the movie's advantage, creating really hilarious moments, and other times it leaves the movie looking sloppy.<br/><br/>What's awesome about the Apatow productions we've grown to love is their fearlessness in being blatantly crude, yet smart, and actually pretty touching in their own silly ways. This movie was exactly that at first, but once the movie switched from comedy to action/comedy, it snowballed into a mess that could've been done a whole lot better, and maybe even funnier.<br/><br/>Watching the previous Apatow movies, it's pretty apparent that a stoner movie is something they've been anxious to do for a long time. With their edgy sense of humor, and a touch of Mary Jane, Pineapple Express was destined to become perhaps the best stoner comedy in history. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to its destiny.<br/><br/>What Pineapple Express suffers from is another case of great characters stuck in an okay movie. You got Dale (Seth Rogen) who of course smokes pot all day and has a day job passing out subpoenas in the most creative ways he can think of; Saul (James Franco), Dale's dealer who is hilariously outlandish at times, but proves to have a genuine heart, and has a day job selling and smoking pot all day; Dale's high school girlfriend Angie (played by the lovely Amber Heard), who remains devoted to Dale despite being thrown into his unfortunate predicament; Red, Saul's supplier who displays incredible resilience; and the hit men, who are just as sloppy and clumsy as the potheads they're chasing.<br/><br/>Sounds funny, and it is, which is why I'd still recommend this movie, but the movie was only a disappointment because I strongly believe an Apatow stoner movie could have been done way better. As far as stoner movies go, I'd still pick Half Baked or Harold and Kumar over Pineapple Express. As far as action/comedy, I'd pick Hot Fuzz or Last Action Hero over Pineapple Express. As far as Apatow productions go, I'd still pick Knocked Up or Superbad or 40-year-old Virgin or Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Anchorman or Talladega Nights over Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>Again, I'd still recommend Pineapple Express because there's no denying it's hilarious. It's like the Class Clown. He says something, and you laugh because he's always funny, even though he's had better days. Today the Class Clown just happens to be high."

","It's difficult to critique a good comedy. Everyone has a different sense of humor. I can say that the entire crowd at the theater laughed almost non stop. With that said, I feel safe to say that this is an incredibly funny movie.<br/><br/>Movie previews typically show all of the most humorous scenes, which does tend to spoil the film. Surprisingly, there were many more scenes to roll in stitches over. It wasn't just a slapstick comedy. It also had a storyline that wasn't completely ridiculous. I would even climb out on a limb and say it had pretty good character development. I would have to say it was a very well made comedy.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen absolutely shined in this movie. It was his normal brand of humor, but he was complimented well by James Franco. It was nice to see them in something together (Knocked up didn't count, and it's been a while since Freaks and Geeks). I heard James Franco claimed he doesn't smoke weed, but I think he acted the stoner part all too well. Not to spoil, but Danny McBride was a nice addition to the team. You probably remember him from Hot Rod.<br/><br/>In short, this is a great movie. I laughed, then cried from laughing, then laughed even harder. If you like weed jokes, gay jokes, or just plain wrong jokes, then this movie is for you. Definitely a theater worthy film. Go see this movie!"
