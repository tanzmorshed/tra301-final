","In case you are not aware of it, this makes Phillip K. Dick officially one of the most influential storytellers in the last 50 years. His books have inspired such Sci Fi classics as Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, and now, the Adjustment Bureau. At least 19 films and television episodes have been created from his works.<br/><br/>The story is an interesting take on the notion there is a God in the universe who is carefully directing the actions and happenings on the planet. Here, of course, the element of 'faith' is removed and instead the Chairman makes plans and has the Adjustment Bureau to make sure the plans are kept on track. These 'agents' merely interfere when they need to, making suggestions that set actions in place. Theology is not in the plan, just a pattern to prevent mankind from becoming extinct by their own hand.<br/><br/>This is a different type of Sci Fi film, and it would take an actor with the flexibility of Matt Damon to play David Norris. His confident yet humble portrayal of the politician is riveting and interesting throughout. Emily Blunt portrays the blossoming ballerina with verve and appeal, sort of a cross between the focused artist and the determined woman who puts her career ahead of herself. Anthony Mackie and John Slattery work well as the adjustment agents sent to sidetrack Norris from reaching Elise.<br/><br/>Overall, the film moves well, offers some interesting twists, and allows us the interesting perspective of predestination without the burden of deity. Rated PG-13 for language, some sexuality, and a few brief scenes of violence, I personally can't think of a single scene that would be too intense for a ten year old. Collectible is a little early to say, but certainly a film you will want to see again."
"napierslogs","7","116","172","6 March 2011"," Intelligence mixed with big-budget Hollywood action to form the new science fiction romance genre
","I'm starting to like this new genre of science fiction romance that ""The Adjustment Bureau"" falls into. Hollywood seems to have learned how to add a significant amount thought to their films, just with their usual dumbing-down procedures.<br/><br/>David (Matt Damon) has met Elise (Emily Blunt) and based on one spontaneous kiss and one flirtatious encounter, he's determined that she's the one he's supposed to be with. They have other plans. Oh yes, the indefinable, ambiguous pronoun ""they"". Just to keep a sense of the intrigue afloat, I'll define ""they"" as the men of ""The Adjustment Bureau"". What they want, we don't really know. But David wants the girl—a beautiful girl—but just a girl nonetheless.<br/><br/>For us, questions of free will, fate, soul mates, success and pre-defined destinies abound. All running around an intricate maze of New York architecture. Although intricate might not be the best word because there's nothing here for us to figure out; the film lays everything out well in advance, and over and over again in case you missed it. At least there's intelligence to the story but unfortunately no subtlety.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" has pretty city-scapes and pretty people playing more profound characters than pretty people usually play. As with most genre-mixing films, there is something for everybody. I got the intelligence that is usually sorely missing from big-budget Hollywood action films although I could have done with a bit more respect."
"julian-mumford","8","99","147","9 March 2011"," A well made and more thoughtful film that you might be expecting
","What if your own free will was nothing of the sort. Every move you made was in accordance with a master plan, any kinks or imperfections ""adjusted"" by persons unknown, constantly on hand to ensure you stayed on track.<br/><br/>Many people might assume that their lives are quite the reverse, with all the bad decisions they have made, anything resembling a master plan is unlikely.<br/><br/>David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York Congressman with his heart set on becoming a young Senator, everything is going according to plan until he meets the beautiful quirky ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in a mens restroom.<br/><br/>Elise inspires him in ways that he could not have imagined but any longer term relationship is not part of the plan the ""Men in Grey"" have mapped out. They do not like their careful plans messed with, ever. Although they do get to wear Trilby's, which not only look cool but are also a necessary tool for their profession.<br/><br/>The many scenes between Blunt and Damon are very believable and natural, real chemistry in action and is fun to watch. Blunt is a breath of fresh air in the congressman's driven life, living more in the moment than he possibly ever did before.<br/><br/>Just when you think the film will descend into a smorgasbord of special effects, the story goes into the opposite direction. A thoughtful and character driven piece about choices and the ripple effect each path taken, or not taken, has on your own and other peoples lives.<br/><br/>Terence Stamp, still with one of the best voices in the business, together with Anthony Mackie & John Slattery, do good work as the agents attempting to get everything back on track.<br/><br/>There are some good lines and Damon can play an aspiring politician with ease, no doubt he could be one in real life if he chose to move in that direction.<br/><br/>The central question of defining who we are by the choices we make is explored and it is good to see another movie messing with our heads, if only just a little. If we have no free will are we still the people we thought we were, very deep but don't panic, the film does not get too caught up in this existentialism.<br/><br/>The action is limited, there are no cars exploding and the body count is non existent, a refreshing change from most modern films. A film that could have been made in the 50's from a story point of view, although actually based on a short story by Phillip K Dick of ""Do Androids dream of electric sheep"" fame, the inspiration for ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>Production values are good, although not of the highest flight. The costumes worn by the adjustment police are rather dodgy and look like guys with spare motorcycle helmets sprayed black. Not what you would expect in a big budget Hollywood movie, a small point but quite noticeable.<br/><br/>Similar to many films of this genre, the movie has to decide how to wrap everything up neatly. The final reel is perhaps a little disappointing but that depends on how you would want the film to end, somehow it feels that the easier option was taken.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A well made and more thoughtful film than you might be expecting.<br/><br/>Well acted with a believable romance, a light dusting of Sci-Fi and a great story. ""Inception"" lite perhaps, which is certainly recommendation enough for any film.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"
"dapplegrey13","9","238","374","7 February 2011"," We loved it! Imaginative, Romantic, Intriguing
","I was invited to a free screening with a big group of friends in Atlanta. I thought it might be right up my alley and it definitely WAS. It's similar to ""Inception"" (one of my very favorites), but simpler.<br/><br/>This fantasy-suspense-action-love story is very intriguing and ROMANTIC. I don't think any of us have seen Matt Damon be this passionate about a woman in film before. THIS is the very best Matt Damon I've ever seen -- he is at his most charming, lovable, and most moving here. And that's coming from a big fan of the Bourne Identity films, The Departed, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Rounders, and many other Damon films.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau has a great supporting cast. Emily Blunt was delightful and mysterious..... There were quite a few laughs as well as some gasps from our audience (a packed house, too.) Most importantly, the STORY is intriguing. Yes, that's what makes the film unforgettable is simply the story. It's imaginative and very well-written.<br/><br/>It's a family-friendly film as best I remember --maybe PG-13 because of some almost-nudity; but no swearing, no gore, no bad scares, and no drugs or alcohol. It's all suspense, charm, intrigue, action, and romance!<br/><br/>If you are not a fan of The Matrix, Inception, Moon, Memento, or other fantasy type mind-benders, then you may not enjoy this film. We loved it though. We heard rave reviews from other audience members afterward, too."
"colinrgeorge","5","88","135","11 March 2011"," Ministry of Silly Hats
","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is preposterous, and before you counter with ""Well, duh, it's science fiction,"" allow me to elaborate. I'm down with the premise that mankind is safeguarded by an invisible shadow organization that dictates the paths we follow and the decisions we make— what baffles me is that they achieve these means through (spoiler alert?) magic hats. I wish I were joking. The single biggest misstep in this bungled Philip K. Dick adaptation is that the mystique of our antagonists is dispelled almost instantaneously. We get to know our aggressors who, as it turns out, are anything but aggressive. To compare genres, there's never been a great thriller where the detective in pursuit of a killer is 'just doing their job.' Passion breeds compelling cinema, and the paper pushers at the heart of ""The Adjustment Bureau"" are supremely uninteresting.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that they are explicitly ""not human,"" a very human error sets the plot in motion. An Adjustment Bureau agent oversleeps (these guys sleep?), thus congressman and senate hopeful David Norris (Matt Damon) catches an early bus, bumping into a familiar comely Englishwoman (Emily Blunt) whom he was never supposed to see again. The film's saving grace is the pair's believable rapport, but after the forces that be repeatedly pull them apart, with sometimes years lapsing between meetings, it gets harder and harder to believe either is still carrying the other's torch.<br/><br/>Then you get into the contradictions and lapses in logic so heady a concept lends itself to. The law that governs the Adjustment Bureau is foggy at best, and though they evidently think nothing of freezing time to manually alter the opinion of Norris' political adviser, they seem incapable of preventing the divergences Norris himself so frequently propagates. Why not squelch Norris' irksome infatuation through similar tactics? Elsewhere, the Bureau threatens him with a memory wipe, but repeatedly chooses to reason with him rather than to take more effective action. For as much as they make of their supposedly infallible plan—which looks a lot like the animated Marauder's Map from ""Harry Potter""—and the omniscience it grants, these celestial shepherds are about as dumb as sheepdogs.<br/><br/>In the belated final act, Norris races toward the mother of all movie climax clichés—the eleventh hour wedding intervention. With his unrequited love set to marry another dude, Norris exploits ""The Adjustment Bureau's"" two most ridiculous plot devices in order to intervene. First, he scores a magic hat, enabling him to access the subspace network that provides a series of shortcuts throughout New York. Second, he cloaks himself in a rainstorm, which like all water, inexplicably clouds the Bureau's ability to chart movement.<br/><br/>It's a shame that ""The Adjustment Bureau"" hangs its own proverbial hat on so many ludicrous details. The big questions it poses, while far from new, are well suited for a love story, and the directorial debut of screenwriter George Nolfi shows some promise. Unfortunately it's the writing that's at fault here, and while I can't speak to the source material, Nolfi's adaptation is rife with questionable choices. Potential squandered, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is cast adrift in sci-fi no man's land between good intentions and their eye-rolling realization.<br/><br/>""Trust no one with a hat,"" Norris is melodramatically advised. ""A Yankees cap, even a yarmulke."" No joke, if you can swallow a line like that—hat's off."

","I was invited today to see an Advance Screening of this movie by a a friend and was excited to find out it was this movie. I had seen the preview during the commercial break from one of my TV shows that I follow and it seemed promising.<br/><br/>In a movie world today where everything released just seems to be sequel after sequel and remake after remake, I found this movie original and thought provoking. With a combination of elements that included thriller and science fiction themes, and then adding in a spiritual and romance side of things as well, this movie had it all.<br/><br/>I thought Matt Damon was excellent in his role and I was captivated for the whole movie in its concept it was drawing onto between fate and free will.<br/><br/>It is my hope many people will show up to see this movie. I loved it and know that I will definitely buy it when it's released on DVD in the future.<br/><br/>Oh and the theater I saw it in had a couple of hundred people watching it and they erupted into applause at the end. How often does that happen these days at the end of movies? Hopefully that tells you how great this movie was!"
"xwingz","9","63","100","6 March 2011"," How far would you go to be with the love of your life?
","The Adjustment Bureau, written and directed by George Nolfi based on a  short story by the name of Adjustment Team by Philip K. Dick, is about  how much one would be willing to sacrifice in the name of love. Matt  Damon plays David Norris, a young, ambitious, idealistic Congressman  seeking election for a seat in the Senate. However, upon a short  encounter with Elise (Emily Blunt), when they share a brief but  meaningful kiss, David realizes his true love lies with Elise, not at  the hands of registered voters of New York City. The adjustment bureau  quickly notices the spark, and was determined to separate the two  lovers because according to ""the plan"", their love was never meant to  be. David, however, refuses to back down, and fights against his fate  to be with the one he loves.  What makes The Adjustment Bureau a truly great movie is that it sends a  powerful message: don't be afraid to go after what you want. Even if it  means going against the will of a powerful, if not divine being. The  movie makes it no secret that ""the chairman"" is a symbolism for God,  and the people of the adjustment bureau are His angels (""we've been  called that (angels)"", says Harry Mitchell, a member of the adjustment  bureau in one scene). However, in the film, even God is not all  powerful, as He only has limited enforcers in the adjustment bureau, so  if a nuclear warfare were to break out, even He could not prevent the  catastrophe that would follow.  The film also makes a strong case that free will does take its toll. As  Thomson, another adjustment bureau member reminds us in another scene,  that although ""the chairman"" has blessed us with the gifts of intellect  and reason, it was those same gifts that caused the world to be on the  brink of destruction during the Cuban missile crisis. To add additional  pressure for David to keep away from Elise, Thomson informs David that  if he chooses to be with her, not only will it ruin his dream, but will  also ruin her dream (she is fated to be a famous dancer, and then a  famous choreographer). As if to add insult to injury, Thomson flexes  his muscle, causing Elise to sprain her ankle, then telling David that  he is the one to blame for her injury.  After a few twists and turns, the film reaches its climax with a  showdown between David and the Thomson, which was very exciting and  kept me on the edge of my seat (as did all other parts of the movie), I  have to admit that the resolution was a bit of a cop out (I won't ruin  it for you). In fact, if the movie had a resolution that was as epic as  the rest of the storyline, I would not hesitate to give it 10/10 stars.  Unfortunately, the ending did disappoint me a great deal, so as it  stands, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As a final note, I would like to say that you were planning on watching  this movie at all, you almost certainly should see it in the theater.  Director George Nolfi (FYI, this is his first movie as director)  incorporates beautiful cinematography, as well as great sound mixing  (or is it sound editing? I'm not sure). I especially loved the clicking  noise of the dressing shoes of Thomson and his enforcers against the  tile floor as they chase down David to set him on his ""correct"" path.  The noise was complimented by their perfect formation, as they all send  a clear message: we are the ones in charge, and we WILL hunt you down."
"changmoh","7","82","136","1 March 2011"," Sparkling chemistry between Damon and Blunt
","Fate, coincidence and free will come at odds with one another in this sci-fi romance re-imagined by George Nolfi from the short story, ""Adjustment Team"", by sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. Nolfi's plot can go from interesting and intriguing to downright silly at times but the main attraction is not the narrative. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC.<br/><br/>Having been to New York City recently, I find the sets nostalgic, and I am defenseless to the charms of Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>Young Senate candidate for New York City, David Norris (Damon), is rehearsing his speech in the men's restroom when a beautiful stranger (Blunt, right, with Damon) emerges from one of the stalls and starts chatting with him. Before she leaves - in quite a hurry - they have an impulsive, passionate kiss, and he is smitten. Their next encounter in a city bus has to be by chance - and he learns that her name is Elise. He is determined to call her. To court her...<br/><br/>And then David comes across a bunch of Men in Black suits and hats, led by a Mr Richardson (John Slattery), who says bluntly: ""We are the people who make sure things go according to plan."" David's relationship with the free-spirited Elise is NOT part of their plan and he must not see her again - for both his and her own good! The rest of the movie is, of course, the tussle between Love and Fate for David. After being charmed by Elise, a rising star ballerina, we can understand why David is bent on seeing her. We can also understand how their relationship would possibly wreck their careers - and why David would want to take a chance on that. David and Elise seem so perfect for each other that we root for them.<br/><br/>It is good that Nolfi has written such a romantic angle into this Dick tale instead of turning it into another action flick like ""Total Recall"", ""Paycheck"" and ""Screamers"". He could have polished up a bit more on the second half to keep it from becoming childish, though. Still, the notion of Fates personified could not be taken too seriously - and it would be better to just go along with the flow of the love story so charmingly portrayed by Damon and Blunt - and supported by a sympathetic Anthony Mackie and menacing Terence Stamp as members of the Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt has such captivating eyes that look into your soul and make you weep."

","This film is about a successful politician who has to choose between the woman of his dreams and his career, when he meets a team of messengers who control fate.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is certainly a different romantic film. The plot is an engaging and refreshing mix of romance and science fiction. The thrill and excitement of the science fiction part is well maintained throughout the film, while the romance part melts viewers hearts. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so convincing together, making their romance very believable. Once again, Emily Blunt puts on a particularly stellar performance, showing her impressive range of acting skills and on screen charm. <br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a good film as it is a refreshing departure from mundane and formulaic romantic comedies. It deserves 100 minutes of your time."
"lekgolah","5","141","254","5 March 2011"," More wasted potential when the concept was great but the treatment...
","Those who have seen the trailer will think that this is a cool, exciting action film about men who control the destinies of others and the man who says, ""I will not stand for this!"" but sadly that is not the story of the film. The concept is great and there are moments where I thought the film was going to get better because the story sounds interesting. <br/><br/>I'll start with the good. As I have mentioned before the film sounds interesting and as these mysterious men enter the film, you are interested to see what they can do. Anthony Mackie and John Slattery were well cast and Matt Damon's performance while not perfect (because of the script) is good and keeps the film together. <br/><br/>Apart from the above I can't think of anything else because the script is dull and the characters feel one-dimensional. Emily Blunt has little to do in the film and Terrence Stamp is completely misused. We hear how his character is cold and will do anything to get the job done but the film never shows this. <br/><br/>What could have saved the film would have been some kind of emotional pull if we felt that the two leads were meant to be together because that would have kept the film interesting. Instead there is little reason to care what happens by the end. <br/><br/>Themes including free will and pre-destination are mentioned and are interesting when they are brought up but the script doesn't do anything with it. Without spoiling anything, Matt Damon does make a discovery halfway through the film and it could have been a major plot point but the way film deals with it feels unnatural and out-of-character.<br/><br/>The film also lacks a sense of energy but maybe that is due to my initial expectations as the film is completely miss-marketed as an action thriller. However the film could have played up the villains in the film (if you can call them that) because you learn what they have done and what they are capable of doing. <br/><br/>In the hands of another director, this would have been an enjoyable film to watch. The idea is there but something went wrong along the way and this is the result. This isn't essential viewing but if you are interested, rent it."

","Jan 11: I was invited to see and rate this movie at a free audience screening. While biting the hand that feeds you is incredibly bad form, this film is not worth paying a full price admission. DO see it on the big screen, but go to the matinée instead. <br/><br/>Caveat, I'm not the target audience, (and hadn't read the short story source first) so for you to calibrate: I rated Jumper at 7; Avatar at 6 bumped up to an 8 for CGI; and Last Airbender at 3. <br/><br/>This film has all the individual elements for a great time: The opening draws you into the story; Blunt is engaging and sensual; Stamp is villainous; Damon/Blunt have fabulous chemistry including a great meet; initial mystery, sophisticated humor, snappy repartee, wonderful score, and superb scenery. The supporting characters are well cast and acted. However, the thin plot doesn't sustain the whole movie, and it takes too long for the minimal plot to unfold, even though there are myriad chase scenes to divert you at first. <br/><br/>The movie was seemingly created for chase scenes, with a poorly contrived reason for the ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl but continues to search for her storyline"", tossed in to justify all the chasing. In attempting to make everything mysterious, the audience is kept as ignorant as the characters to the point where it became ""THATS the reason he's been chasing after her? How DISAPPOINTING!"" when the cause for separation is unveiled. The secret meetings which presumably either advance or reveal the mystery were annoying instead. Finally, in the last portion of the movie, the opening doors and running become so repetitive, you can feel like the Blunt character, who has her hands over her head and is screaming. The ending is abrupt, contrived and disappointing, a veritable deus ex machina version. <br/><br/>Conversely, my companion who loves everything sci-fi or sci-fantasy, and reads Phillip K Dick (including the short story on which this was based) rated the movie ""excellent"" as opposed to my ""ok"". Even though the movie diverges from the short story, he suffered no confusion or disappointment with the story line, big reveals, or ending. He also thought the cast, romance, and humor were great.<br/><br/>We both agree--do see the movie on the big screen as it certainly enhances the suspense and startling moments (political crowd scene, adjustment scene, car crashes, action scenes and finale) and shows off the great NYC locations.

","I saw this at a preview screening. The premise of mysterious strangers controlling our destiny comes from the eccentric imagination of Phillip K. Dick; everything else in the movie is cookie cutter Hollywood fluff. None of the characters are remotely believable either in their everyday lives or in the nonchalant reactions to learning mind bending secrets about themselves and human destiny. What could have been an entertaining and creepy paranoid fantasy instead becomes a by the numbers sermon on the power of ""true love"" (which seems to refer to the infatuation you experience after spending a few hours engaging in cute banter and rolling in the hay with a virtual stranger). Has a number of unintentional laughs, not the least of which involves a character recounting a skewed history of the human race that ignores everything outside of Western Europe and America. Beyond all the silliness and the immaturity of the script, however, what really surprised me was how lazy it all felt. The performances were lackluster, the tense scenes were boring, the love story was passionless, the fantasy elements pedestrian. Towards the end I thought we might be at least being heading toward something really outrageous, but even that turned out to be a false hope."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","10","14","17 November 2011"," I am eagerly looking forward to this first-time director's entire career
","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a first-time piece of directing work by a certain George Nolfi, who before had worked in Hollywood pretty much exclusively as a screenwriter. He also composed the script for this picture and that is half of what impressed me so much. Just looking at the way he choreographed his images, and worked so well with his two stars, despite the occasional lapse here and there expected of somebody making their first feature-length motion picture, I must say I am eagerly looking forward to his entire career. For ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" while not any kind of a masterpiece, is one of the most unexpectedly pleasing and wholeheartedly enjoyable movies of the year.<br/><br/>Mr. Nolfi's involvement in the third Jason Bourne movie may have had some input in his getting Matt Damon to take the lead as an ambitious but somewhat dubious New York governor candidate. Through some odd and very charming circumstances, Mr. Damon runs into a bold, pretty young ballet dancer played by the always intoxicating Emily Blunt. Affectionate toward each other at first sight, they slowly fall in love and try to reach each other several times over a period lasting years. But the only thing tearing them apart and stopping them is not a jealous ex, not a terrorist plot, but instead a group of mysterious men in 30s-style jackets and fedoras calling themselves the Adjustment Bureau.<br/><br/>The screenplay was based on a Philip K. Dick story called ""The Adjustment Team"" and although the story is completely warped, the purpose of the titular men remains essentially the same. Their purpose, as a character played by very-good actor John Slattery explains, is to control how time plays out. Time and fate is prewritten in what is called 'The Plan' and they work in groups to make sure that things play out according to 'The Plan,' using whatever methods possible to make sure that the rest of the world falls in accordance to it. And as it turns out, the romance between Mr. Damon and Miss Blunt is something that is prohibited in their strategy and the film evolves into a very passionate and exciting story about two people deciding what is more important: to be with who you love, or to do what is better for the world entire.<br/><br/>With a plot this extravagant, it is surprising that director Mr. Nolfi did not blunder into an entirely corny yarn. Occasionally, he does falter (some of the scientific lingo gets a little too pseudointellectual for my taste) but as a total, he succeeds in weaving a strong and passionate tale. But that may also return to the surmise that ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is not really a science-fiction tale. Rather, it is a deep romantic thriller that benefits from two sharply-written characters and two very charismatic performances. The movie rides on the romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt and you could not ask for better performances. This coming from someone who typically gripes at the 'Love At First Sight' gimmick but became an instant sucker for it here within ten minutes. Mr. Damon, who usually casts himself as tough guys with pasts, takes a chance at playing a softer, more emotional type who does not hurl a fist until the third act and does not instantly become a stuntman. And Miss Blunt does a fabulous job playing a courageous and strong-hearted woman. It's their chemistry and their moments together that really benefit the picture. For right away, I believed in the love brewing between them and it mattered to me whether or not they actually got together at the end. Just looking at these two people together is absolutely charming and even the obligatory love moment between them in bed is performed and shot in such a way that it does not become unnecessarily erotic and doesn't stop the story. Rather, it seems to work, like a piece of a puzzle.<br/><br/>That is the definition of a good love story. If you were to take it out and transplant it in some totally different movie, it would still work.<br/><br/>The love story is more interesting than the Adjustment Bureau men themselves and that may be one of the weaknesses of the picture. Despite some great performances from John Slattery, Anthony Mackie, and Terence Stamp, and the fact that we see inside of their operations quite a bit, we don't really come to know much about them. In addition, because this is a first-time directing job, some of the shots are imperfect. A moment where Mr. Damon tries to escape from the Bureau men and trips on a rising floor tile is awkward. The shot seems sped-up too fast and his leg hangs in the air for too long.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" would have to be the much-griped-about ending, which has some religious subtexts that may anger some. Not offended myself, I just felt it, despite that wonderful shot of the two leads - and one of the few times where I liked the shot of the camera whirling 360 degrees around them - was a bit of a cop-out and not entirely satisfying.<br/><br/>But my few notifications aside, I must happily repeat that this is one marvelously entertaining and emotionally-gripping little movie. And despite the fact that there have been some better-made pictures this year, few of them are liable to last as long in the memory as it. Sometimes it's better when a picture does not aim for masterpiece-status and it's better for the audience going in with an open mind and not assaulted by a big hype campaign. For then a movie like this becomes even more surprising and delightful. Congratulations all around, especially to Mr. Damon and Miss Blunt for their fabulous performances, and to writer-director George Nolfi, who has made a more-than-impressive first step into the most-cherished profession of directing motion pictures."

","I watched this film with my family and we all agreed at the end, that we should have left when we first thought of it only 15 minutes into it.<br/><br/>This is, by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. All of the characters are shallow, cliché and the acting is near awful. The plot is terrible. This is a really bad romantic drama, which premise is off the charts of ridicule. It is, seriously, hard for me to describe the worst parts, as there are endless amounts.<br/><br/>What I've learned from this movie is: - Don't run for president if you want love - God is a prick and hates love - God is not a prick, he/she just make crappy plans which need fixing and remodeling all time - God is maybe a prick, but is definitely incompetent - Humans easily outsmart God and a great bunch of angels - Don't do what God wants you to do, unless you really want to and then God is alright with it - Everything is a test. God just loves to play around and bruise your ankles, if necessary to test your love; he/she will even make a car crash happen and bruise innocent people just to test your love. Or maybe is it not god who did that, maybe it was the incompetent angels. Well, then you can conclude that god has some serious administration issues and a 'bureau' running wild.<br/><br/>Basically this is one terrible movie. It is a cliché 'romantic drama' which tells you to follow your instinct on love no matter what. If you do so, the woman of your life will automatically love you only after being with you 4 times over a period of 4 years. She will dump her fiancée just for you, because you made her laugh a few times and told her 'deep' stories about your dead father, who was a great man (or so we were told, as he is not introduced nor 'treated' in the movie at all, only spoken about).<br/><br/>This is religious propaganda, a terrible movie with a terrible plot, which wasted millions of dollars on something which should have never been produced.<br/><br/>I advice you to watch this movie, as it is a textbook example of how not to produce a movie and to laugh at religious clichés. It is not boring... Its just really bad."

","I honestly had extremely high expectations for this movie from what the movie trailer was portraying. However after I watched the movie I was sorely disappointed. In my opinion it should have been about how ""The Bureau"" was controlling everyones moves and actions uncovering their every single move into their lives. Unfortunately the movie zeroed in on a ""love story"" and ""fate""; which in my opinion made this Sci-Fi Action movie turn into a Sci-Fi Drama Chick Flick!<br/><br/>Like I previously stated: the trailer lead me to believe that the plot was going to be a Sci-Fi conspiracy movie about how the government or ""The Bureau"" controls the world (USA) and someone found out about them and tried to stop them to tell the world, but end up being killed for treason! Something along those lines, in my opinion. Anyways, overall I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because the plot could have been so much better for a Sci-Fi Thriller! Instead of turning it into a love story, which by the way there are way too many of those around already so why did they do this to the movie? I have no idea. But it was a bad idea.<br/><br/>Final Note: (SPOILER) Folks, if you love movies like 'Vantage Point' or 'The Bourne Supremacy' - stay away from this movie because you will too be sorely disappointed as was I. This was nothing close to what I was expecting from what the movie trailer of ""The Adjustment Bureau"" portrayed at all! Good luck folks, I hope you too have a different opinion than mine. Because I am just one person, who has seen hundreds of thousands of amazing, great, stupendous and kick-ass movies!

"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","19","31","23 August 2011"," This dime tour of NYC did not impress or entertain
","This review will contain a few spoilers. Here's the first one: it's mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Philip K. Dick shorts could fuel Hollywood for years. They're nice, well thought out premises that aren't so complicated that they leave viewers confused – movies like Minority Report and Total Recall. However when you put a good short in the hands of someone like George Nolfi, the clown responsible for penning Timeline and Ocean's Twelve, you get The Adjustment Bureau.<br/><br/>The movie starts out as a quirky rom-com with lead man Matt Damon losing a Senatorial election and find comfort in the arms of a flirty girl hiding in the men's room. Such stuff as dreams are made on. He has a chance meeting with her again some time later, but the big twist occurs when he's confronted by the partners of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, told it's just not meant to be and angels will kneecap him if he spills the beans about their big operation. Years later, we get a replay of the situation and it all goes to heck in a knapsack when The Adjustment Bureau says it must not be.<br/><br/>There are a few big problems with how this movie handles the thriller aspects. First, you have to care about characters for any chase or conflict to even matter. We get a slew of sappy Notebook-esque lines with little character development. As far as I'm concerned, David Norris is a childish flake and Elise Sellas doesn't give two craps about anybody's feelings but her own. Not very likable, but I guess they do deserve each other. Second, a thriller won't be thrilling if there is no danger. The biggest dangers are Norris not being a great politician and Sellas not becoming famous in modern dance circles. No threat of bodily harm and the bad guys are completely befuddled when water is in the picture. I've ranted in the past about this Hollywood notion that unless you get the girl AND the money, fame, and good looks, it's not worth it. For most of us, finding true love would be enough – we wouldn't have to be President on top of all that. Last, all throughout the movie the plucky ""buddy comedy"" music doesn't give the a sense of impending doom. If Richard Widmark's brutal wheelchair down the stairs scene from Kiss of Death had been accompanied by bongos and a symbol hit at the end, I don't think it would carry the same weight.<br/><br/>Maybe we've seen too many Matrix-type movies to be impressed by mind- bending sci-fi chases, but this dime tour of NYC did not impress or entertain."

","I have been a ""warmish' Matt Damon fan. Some of his work hasn't been too bad. But this shocker- what was he thinking? When the first incident through the magic door took place I thought we were in for a bit of thuggery -a.k.a- ""thriller' even though the protagonists were wearing overcoats, scarves and 1960 hats. But no, just some odd looking people in motor bike helmets who pushed our hero David back into a chair and that was it. The plot was so thin I half expected to see a smoke machine adding a bit of mystery. And the script... words fail me. I must say the collision gave me a jolt, and by the reaction in the cinema I wasn't the only one drifting off with boredom. The movie looked like an adult take on Narnia and the trip through the wardrobe. At least in that movie the costumes and scenery made it worth watching."

","We have here smart and smooth dialog, ontological arguments, great acting, sci-fi, clever editing, space-time dimensions and an inspiring love story. After watching the trailer, when I hear Philip K. Dick + George Nolfi (Bourne's Ultimatum, Ocean's 12, ¡Timeline!...), something disturbing came to my mind: a kind of Dark City-Paycheck hybrid... Nothing further from the truth.<br/><br/>The adaptation of PKD's short stories for the screen has no newness, but do it in a completely new shape within a romantic-comedy-like film (preserving all the Chaos Theory/Free Will/Determinism leitmotiv of the text) is a show worth seeing."

","stupid, stupid movie, we have a group of people that include the Chairman (God)and the men (no women here) who make thing go according to plan (the angels). The single purpose of this group is to keep two people apart. To assist them in their undertaking they have their godlike supernatural abilities whereas the two people are just ordinary Americans. Amazingly enough we find that God and his angels are no match for two Americans and so the two people cannot be kept apart. Now it seems that God doesn't care to be thwarted so he or she decides to change the plan so that it is no longer necessary to keep them apart thus ensuring that everything still goes according to plan (the new plan). This change of heart seems to have something to do with a lower level angel although we are not sure how this comes about. This plot is quite ridiculous and an insult to peoples intelligence. It's even worse than the Bourne movies. I guess Mr Damon will do anything for a buck."

I haven't seen acting this wooden since Nicholas Cage was outperformed by the titular character in the Wicker Man.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film was the ridiculous premise that wearing a hat is a key through a secret door.

I excuse myself, the originality is, that there is no reason why the whole world is against them, because our great monkey is already sucking its thumb in foetus position.

","There are many movies with impossible plots that are entertaining because you are carried along by the story. You don't notice the holes in the plot until the next day. In this case, the plot is not merely preposterous, it is transparent. As such, it is impossible to enjoy the movie because you are sitting in the theatre analyzing its faults. Let's begin with the idea that Matt Damon looks for his true love for 3 years after their chance meeting. O.K., so I didn't realize until the next day that his true love had crashed a wedding and that she was last seen being chased by security people much faster than she was. Matt could simply have checked back at the hotel to learn her identity. But even while I was watching the movie it was obvious that he plays a well-known public figure. So why didn't she just call him up? Once you realize this is all she would have to do, the premise of the movie collapses. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, the human hero is outwitting God. How believable is that? The angels suggest that God just doesn't have the resources to monitor everybody, so He focuses on ""important"" people. That's simply annoying. This is a God who (rather than knowing when any sparrow falls) apparently only knows when a condor falls. And then you have the angel who violates God's orders to help our hero find his true love by loaning him his cheesy hat. I could only think of the Red Hat Ladies. Where do they end up when they go though a door? I've never read (or heard of) the scifi novel from the 50's that this is based on, but I recognized the genre when it was postulated that all the large events of Western Civilization could be explained by times that God intervened and times when God took a hands-off approach: God was on-duty up to the Fall of Rome, but took the day off during the Dark Ages, etc. Other reviewers quibble that this ignores other cultures, but 1950's scifi was into sweeping concepts like this. Frankly, it is kinda neat, and as a teenager I would have been intrigued. But the problem here is that Hollywood has taken what was probably a pretty good idea from the 50's and trashed it. I'd bet that the author made a much more credible case for his premise and tied up the loose ends in a way that was internally consistent. Not so here. I give three stars because of the scenes of New York and because smoking was not prominently featured. Even Big Tobacco passed on this turkey."

","You take a big budget - A list actors, a top sci-fi writer, a big-time city location etc... and what do you end up with? One of the stupidest movies EVER made. I had no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this. I was under the assumption that this would be a movie about how sinister, evil organizations are secretly running our world (reality basically) and how a young do-gooder politician learns the truth and tries to fight against it... if only... Instead you get a lobotomized story about Men with Hats (not the safety dance ones either)that are agents of god who are working tirelessly (and falling asleep at the job) to rectify all the horrible mistakes that mankind continues to inflict upon the world. The Roman Empire - the agents set that one up... (because we all know how good that empire was... ;). The middle Ages? Well that was a big mess according to the ""agents"" so they brought us the enlightenment, reason, romanticism, the wonderful industrial revolution (in which children slavishly worked 16 hour days for the benefit of the wealthy). But then ""they"" let us take control again and we ended up with 2 world wars, Hitler, the great depression etc... Really? Well, I'll tell you I would barf out laughing if some fool in a fedora told me such pile of feces.. but Matt Damon's character buys it hook, line and sinker... So we get a movie that tries to tell us that everything is running according to a plan and that, if by some chance that plan gets disrupted... Well it involves a whole lot of fedora wearing men running around cities through doors... Oh yes... and how can I forget - the love story. Well take one cliché and add two parts cliché and a cherry cliché to top it off and you get that. So what do we learn? That handsome young politicians don't get married and wait for years riding the same bus every single day in order to run across the girl that shared a ""moment"" with him... Yeah... I buy that. Oh... but God doesn't want these two together (cue the fedoras!) so he sends his agents to disrupt any chance at love these two might have.... And that's your movie folks... And it gets a 7.1 rating on IMDb. If you reversed the number (1.7) you would have the CORRECT score. Just terrible."

Expect an uninspired soundtrack, and no twist. Yeah, that's right, there is no twist. And expect John Slattery with all the wardrobe from Mad Men.

The movie tells an interesting story and more so it's entertaining and sweet. There is true chemistry portrayed on screen which makes an unbelievable story of love and destiny, believable. All in all this film is done so well; it makes you want to believe it's all possible. (The hat thing was a great twist, I thought.) But it's not all mushy gooey love and kisses that makes cherubs puke. There is actually quite a bit of movement and a few ounces of mystery all mixed in the Adjustment bureau<br/><br/>Religion, though never mentioned in this production does play a role and so it is only natural that both sides of the religious spectrum will have strong opinions about it. All I can say is: ITS A MOVIE, MEANT TO BE ENTERTAINING! Sometimes we dig too deep to question things that better be left unasked. The plot has a few holes which could have easily been taken care of with an easy explanation. I, for my part however usually don't go see a movie and start analyzing the plot from start to finish... I more so decide once the film is over whether or not I was entertained by it and whether or not I'd watch it again.

Although I would be utterly tragically hip if I failed to tip my hat to the flash of campy sight-gagging on that theme! And, in the end, it was worth the investment of suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Not the greatest venue for Damon's cache and skills, but not too chabby, either. At the end of the movie, I was quite touched and taken by the moral of the story. The proof lies in the following pudding: Given that there is no Adjustment Bureau, does the moral still ring true?<br/><br/>*** Spoiler Alert ***<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>""Waking Life"" said that ""dream is destiny"". But is Dick (and this movie) more aware of the underlying truth?

","The blurb on the DVD cover describes this as 'Bourne meets Inception', so as I enjoyed those films I was keen to see this. While there are similarities I must say I thought this was much lighter fare; that's not to say I didn't enjoy it though. At first it looked as this would be a political thriller; with candidate for the US Senate David Norris faces a surprise defeat. As he tries to compose his thoughts in the gents he is interrupted by a mysterious woman, before he gets chance to learn who she is he has to go. He doesn't expect to see her again but some time later he bumps into her on a New York bus, this time he gets her name (Elise) and number. He doesn't get chance to call her though as things suddenly get very strange for him; he gets to work and finds everybody frozen and strange men capture him and explain that it is their job to make sure that everything that is meant to happen does happen and he was not meant to meet Elise! They take her number but he is determined to find her and one day three years later he does, their problems are only just beginning however as The Adjustment Bureau haven't given up their plans to keep them apart.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this; Matt Damon but in a fine performance as David Norris and Emily Blunt was suitably beguiling as Elise. Other notable performances include Anthony Mackie as the Bureau man responsible for Norris and Terrance Stamp for played one of his superiors. There was enough excitement without having the action swamp the plot and character development. It also made a nice change for there to be no real bad guys in a film like this The Bureau may have been against the protagonist's plans but their motivation was never sinister. I also liked that no attempt was made to explain how things worked; we were told the Bureau men's hats enabled then to use doors to travel across the city but no time was wasted giving reasons; it just had to be accepted. Over all it was a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it."

There is no chemistry between the leads. Matt Damon looks too boyish for a senator and is a bit small sized for Emily. Emily looks a bit cross eyed and doesn't have that lean look of a ballerina. Serious miscasting. The running around and doors are repetitive and the passing of time is abrupt. The ending is a let down. Just a silly far fetched waste of time.

","The Adjustment Bureau<br/><br/>Think a scripted blending of ""Charade"" (1963) meets ""The Matrix"" (1999), and you have an idea of the plot that is the basis for ""The Adjustment Bureau."" (2011) All three films revolve around romance, suspense and a heightened sense of place. In ""The Adjustment Bureau"" New York City is almost a third character, and spotting cameo appearances by East coast media elites (past and present) is a side game. Humor is also an element of this story, although it sometimes undercuts the power of the suspense and romance that I imagine is the film's intended tone. <br/><br/>There are engaging performances to recommend the film, such as those by stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt; as well as supporting actors Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and the ever dangerously sexy Terrence Stamp.<br/><br/>All the witty repartee between characters, the striking views of New York City, and the driving pulse of the soundtrack make ""The Adjustment Bureau"" an entertaining film, but not so well pulled together that it demands great thought and consideration after the screening is over."
"AtlanticSwell","7","17","30","9 March 2011"," Nice concept, lovely cast, slight problem with the screenplay and execution
","I really wanted to like this because Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are two of my favorite actors and get a dream of a story based on a short essay by Philip K Dick (he of 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' fame i.e. what turned into Blade Runner). Matt plays David Norris, a young congressman vying for the senate who keeps bumping into a girl (Elise = Emily) who he then manages to lose. Is it coincidence? Is it all meant to be? Are there darker forces at work? Is there a God? Is fate preordained? The film and script ask us all of these questions and then more.<br/><br/>I found that the world which David and Emily inhabit is full of seemingly arbitrary rules, that the story was driven by forced coincidences which could not be explained away as semi-ironic, and which sometimes felt more like script conveniences than story, more plot-devices than plot.<br/><br/>I found the denouement predictable and was waiting for the last half-hour of the film for Messrs Damon and Blunt to hurry up and get on with it as it was so clunky and PREDICTABLE(ironic given the story-line). Yes I've used the word 'predictable' twice. With good reason.<br/><br/>There are many, and I mean many, things, props, tricks, flips etc that you will have seen before and that do appear, again, in this film. I do not want to give any spoilers, so you'll just have to watch the film and spot them all for yourself. This is billed as 'Bourne meets Inception' and I think it's MUCH more like Inception than a Bourne film.<br/><br/>I did find the David Norris congressman/senator thing reminiscent of The Manchurian Candidate but without the strength of purpose that that latter film has and in fact, in Adjustment, it was a bit half-hearted and almost all of the subsidiary characters were very poorly fleshed-out with no characterization or arcs at all.<br/><br/>Finally, the end message that this film delivers is extremely naive and slightly disappointing. I can see exactly what the filmmakers were trying to do but the problem is they've taken a solid PKD short, conceived a film but then effectively spoiled it a little by not spending enough time on developing the story into a fully-fledged all-singing all-dancing screenplay.<br/><br/>Perhaps not enough controls were placed on the writer/director: however, I suspect that this script has been rewritten by a number of people, as certain things appear to be inserted as if part of a scientific exercise than as a fluid story, a sort of 'well, the way we managed to do that is...', continually playing the get out of jail free card.<br/><br/>And this, I think, is the problem with the film. Despite the likability of the leads, you just don't feel for them. When they cry, you don't know or even care if it's real or not. They're cardboard cut-outs, doing their best, manipulated by PKD and the writer/director. You never feel like they're in danger. The film's only a 12 too which I think, for this 'darkness' of story, is simply not right.<br/><br/>This should have been beefed up, the ante been raised and the MPAA/BBFC certificates upped to R and 15 respectively with some hard-hitting, juicy content which unfortunately this film shies away from at every opportunity.<br/><br/>That said, it's still worth a 6.5 or 7 out of 10 because it IS fun: the problem is I also think it was, with that cast and that budget (USD51m), a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>I can't believe they didn't see that coming ;-)"

You can see the decisions Matt Damon's character has to make when he realizes what his choices will lead to. <br/><br/>It was very thought-provoking. It makes you ponder life, and where it would have taken us if our choices would have differed just a little bit. The actors did a great job, you could identify with them, and even like them. I've never been a huge Matt Damon fan, but he did such a great job as a politician, I'd vote for him. Definitely a like-able character, along with the rest. In short, my husband and I LOVED this film, we talked about it afterwards more than most movies as it was thought-provoking and poignant. Finally, a fabulous sci-fi. Keep them coming like this please, Hollywood!"

","""The Adjustment Bureau"" addresses favorite, and much-contested, themes: the role of fate, or chance, or free will in our lives. Theologians, scientists, theists and atheists have puzzled over these questions for thousands of years. The film posits an official bureaucracy that massages everyday human activities – whether or not rising young political star David Norris (Matt Damon) spills coffee on his shirt during his morning commute through a park, whether Elise Sallas (Emily Blunt), a dancer, falls and sprains her ankle onstage – in order to achieve the outcomes the Adjustment Bureau desires. It's a fantastic premise, which the film thoroughly wastes.<br/><br/>David Norris is a rising political star; Elise Sallas is a rising dancer. They meet and fall in love at first sight. Their love defies the desired ends of the Adjustment Bureau. The Adjustment Bureau may be carrying out the will of God, and its caseworkers may be angels. The film never makes it clear. Hats give the Adjustment Bureau's caseworkers their power. Yes, hats, exactly the kind of snap-brim hat that Frank Sinatra made famous in the 1950s. (Thus the title of the tribute book, ""The Way You Wear Your Hat."") Too, Adjustment Bureau case workers refer to their boss, who may be God, as ""The Chairman."" They don't mean Mao – this must be a reference to Sinatra, nicknamed ""Chairman of the Board."" I'm sorry, but this film was so boring, it sent my mind down these trails.<br/><br/>When the Adjustment Bureau made its presence known, and revealed its near omnipotence over David Norris' fate, I didn't care. I felt no anxiety for David or Elise. The film evoked no sense of mystery, not even the shiver you get when you think of a friend and that friend immediately phones you. I kept thinking of other films that introduced supernatural, fate-altering others into average mortal's lives. Cary Grant as the angel Dudley in ""The Bishop's Wife"" caused more of a sense of wonder and awe. In ""Portrait of Jenny,"" another movie about a fated relationship, there's a scene of ice-skaters in Central Park. The scene is very wholesome and suitable for family viewing. It's shot in black and white. Even so, with no special effects, it creates a powerful sense of the weird that ""Adjustment Bureau"" never matches.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays, as he always does, Matt Damon: an oversmart, internal guy who keeps his cards close to his chest and doesn't so much relate to others as manipulate them to his own purposes. He was brilliant at this in ""Good Will Hunting"" and he's been good at it ever since.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is not his best partner. She's a great dominatrix, as she was in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" or ""Young Victoria."" Her crispness never penetrates Damon's emotional armor, as did Minnie Driver in ""Hunting"" with her over-the-top emotionality.<br/><br/>I never felt that David and Elise were experiencing the kind of love worthy of the risks they take in the movie, and I really did not care whether they were together at the end or not.<br/><br/>Because the movie didn't grab me, I noticed all the plot holes I would not have seen had I been swept up in movie magic. The Adjustment Bureau teams are thrown off their game by rain. But they're shown to be almost omnipotent. Why rain? Throw me a bone, here! Hats make them powerful? HATS? There are simply too many Adjustment Bureau personnel. They're like a bumbling team of Keystone Cops, chasing about, and accomplishing very little. They don't intimidate or impress us. They don't make us go, ""Wow!"" Any discussion of fate, chance, free will and God invokes huge questions. Why does God allow the innocent to suffer, for example? Do we really control our own fates, or are we merely puppets in the hands of the Gods? The movie attempts to address this in a monologue by Terence Stamp. He says that the height of civilization was the Roman Empire. Yes, that same Roman Empire that crucified six thousand slaves along the Appian Way, and entertained its masses with scenes of wild animals feasting on human flesh. Stamp then denigrates the so-called ""Dark Ages,"" a misnomer intended to make the Christian Europe that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire look bad. Oh, how silly.<br/><br/>In order to establish that David Norris is a man on the move, the film uses fake news clips of real personalities, including Jon Stewart and other television news commentators. The careful and extensive inclusion of these real personalities betrays the film's failure. Who cares if Jon Stewart is in a movie about love, fate, God, chance? Don't give me Jon Stewart and Mary Matalin; I can see them on TV. Make a work of art that makes me think something I've never thought before."
"underwearhero","1","22","43","4 May 2011"," Familiar concept badly executed
","This is probably the worst movie i've seen in a while. There's a bunch of flaws that's I'll be discussing but the worst one is the unconvincing concept of the men with hats that never had any credibility at any point. <br/><br/>While watching I couldn't help but to be reminded of The Matrix (a film that DOES convince us with it's bizarre concept) because of the 'agents'. We're never given any backstory on these men with their hats who happen to control everything around them. Who are these people? Where did they get this power and how? We just have to assume that they have a book in which they see everything that goes on. Their hats allow them to open doors and teleport from place to place (similair again to the matrix but without the hats). The turning of the doorknobs to the left or right is also very important, but why?Why the hats? How does that make sense? Is there a device in the hats that allows them to do so? Is it magic? Never is any explanation given and it makes us ask all these questions because this is all happening in OUR world. To compare it to the Matrix again (where a lot of strange thing happen as well); in the Matrix the strange things that happen, happen in the Virtual world so it's much easier to assume that everything can happen there, because it's a VIRTUAL world. That's not the case in this film. <br/><br/>The second major flaw I noticed (which could be personal preference) is the unconvincing romance. The whole 'we we're meant to be together, it's fate' type of thing is unoriginal and predictable because you know what will happen at the end. <br/><br/>There were also plenty of corny and preachy dialogues which I could point out to you if I had a copy of the script, but it's not worth the effort. In essence this is a cheap B-movie produced with a Hollywood budget. This film is a bad execution of a known concept (previously seen in films like The Matrix, Enemy of the State) combined with a typical Hollywood romance."

","The Adjustment Bureau intervenes when people deviate from the ""plan"" for their future selves - no such thing as free will other than choosing a toothpaste brand we are told (when free will is given to humanity without Bureau intervention, humanity near destroys itself and the Earth along it; hence, why the Bureau exists to prevent this from happening). No one knows about them, unless you are Matt Damon who desires Emily Blunt in a non-plan love affair and receives an appearance from them telling him not to pursue her. The Bureau has a Chairman just like the FBI (I am laughing as I type this). <br/><br/>Then we go from stupid new wave ballet scenes with an obvious fish out of water Blunt to electoral campaigns for want to be Senator Damon, just as uninspired as Blunt, with the Bureau intervening to keep them apart (apparently Damon will not make President with ditz Blunt as a wife, that was the only believable part of the movie - her character was at best a spun woman child).<br/><br/>But wait a minute, Damon's obstinate character says otherwise and after a couple of false starts pursues Blunt in the end. So, let's give this a happy ending by having the Chairman rewrite the plan for Damnon and Blunt to be together and wrap it all up by saying that you have to want free will very, very, very bad to change the plan, and these 2 space cadets managed that with the collective IQ of perhaps 100. Somehow their love swayed the Chairman.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie that were worth watching was when Terence Stamp and John Slattery made appearances. As for the rest, insipid is an understatement. I'm all for Sci-Fi and fantasy, but the ending was just too dumb in the end."

They seemed almost natural and real in their conversations! And she's so dang pretty! I really enjoyed the acting of John Slattery and Terrence Stamp as well! This movie, for me, turned out to be more of a romance than a sci-fi flick, but it was still a decent view. I liked the hats and especially the doors, which were super cool. But I really liked Blunt with Damon and would love to see the two of them together in another film!"
"rmax304823","5","2","2","20 July 2016"," What It's All About.
","In the post-war period, when existentialism was in flower, everybody was reciting Jean-Paul Sartre: ""Existence precedes essence,"" meaning you can do and be anything you want, as long as you're willing to accept the consequences of your choice.<br/><br/>That's what this movie is about. There is this supernatural entity called The Adjustment Bureau -- represented by unsmiling guys wearing hats -- that determines your future by arranging incidents that bring that future about.<br/><br/>Take Matt Damon's character. He's a very low-level politician but there's a presidency in his future if the Adjustment Bureau has its way. That's his essence, so to speak. They manipulate events so that he accidentally bumps into Emily Blunt, who inspires him to give a candid speech that increases his political hooper rating.<br/><br/>As far as the bureau is concerned, that's it. Blunt's purpose is fulfilled. She made him give a good speech. Now she's supposed to disappear from his life because HER destiny is to become a world-famous ballerina. If she and Damon were to hook up, it would spoil the bureau's plans for both of them. Damon would wind up an Alderman and she would teach dance to six-year-olds.<br/><br/>But Damon has his own ideas about where he's going and he fights the bureau's plans. It's HE who will determine his essence, and that of Blunt as well.<br/><br/>It sounds a little complicated, and it is. The writer/director is George Nolfi, an intelligent and perceptive artist. He's maybe a little too sophisticated for most audiences. The Chairman of the bureau -- presumably some sort of divine presence -- is referred to but never shown, except symbolically by sunshine. That's one example of the kind of symbolism that escaped my apperceptive apparatus. I only learned about it, and about other details and intentions, from the director's commentary on the DVD.<br/><br/>Actually, it confused the hell out of me. Not just the symbolism. Damon seems to fall in love with Blunt after a five-minute bout of banter with her. Then he drifts in and out of her life over a period of years, rescuing her at the last minute from marriage to someone else. The romance seemed forced rather than organic, although it's needed because it provides the source of conflict between the bureau's desires and Damon's individualism. It almost devolves into an examination of free will which, in a way, I guess it is.<br/><br/>It would have been a more successful movie if -- and you can't imagine how much I hate saying this -- if it had been slightly dumbed down."
"jbirks106","4","2","2","15 July 2014"," Sci-why?
","When science fiction meets romantic drama in a Hollywood film, one of them almost always suffers. Writers either lack the skill to pull off the combination in a way that's mutually reinforcing and consistent, or they lack faith in movie audiences to comprehend what they're watching without lots of pace-killing exposition. In the case of ""Adjustment Bureau"" we have the added Hollywood trope of political intrigue. The result is only occasionally enjoyable. The rest is just a mess.<br/><br/>What's enjoyable are the performances of fine actors making the best of some sketchy material. Damon seemed a natural for the Norris character, even though he's done better work in the ""Bourne"" films. The interplay between him and Blunt is completely authentic on screen. Mackie, Slattery and Kelly are very good also, and Terence Stamp is always good for that suave, menacing role. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the script seems more focused on humanizing the ""adjusters"" than in filling out the other characters. Oh, there's tons of back story on Norris and his family, mostly from Mackie, but the relationship between long-ago events and present-day reality seems either forced or tenuous. Blunt's Elise character has no back story at all, and her front story is strikingly one-dimensional. <br/><br/>The main problem, though, is simple logic. We're told that the Bureau has ""the story"" and is simply ""adjusting"" its characters to keep to the plot. But the plot keeps changing, apparently, and it never makes sense to me. Both Slattery and Stamp seem to have telekinetic powers (if only to make people fall down) as well as a sort of omniscience. Why, then, are they so powerless to prevent a simple kiss, or to predict that one of their agents will secretly aid Norris? Why does Stamp, after telling the Damon character why the powers-that-be can't trust lowly humans to manage their affairs through free will, minutes later send him on his way to prove his point? Why is Norris' political career so important to them? And the hat thing: why not just get an extra hat for Elise? I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are inconsistencies, plot holes and loose threads galore.<br/><br/>One personal peeve of mine is the obligatory celebrity cameo, specifically media figures who seem to appear in every single movie with a political angle -- even when, as here, politics plays a minor part in the story. It no longer adds verisimilitude to a film, if it ever did; it's just a cliché. And a self-defeating one, because many filmgoers these days don't watch CNN and have no idea who James Carville is. In coming years nobody will even remember these people, let alone recognize them.<br/><br/>I don't discount the problems inherent in making a story like this accessible to easily distracted audiences. I don't even want every question raised by the story answered. I just want the story to be internally consistent, to make sense on some level. It can be done, it has been done before. But not this time."

","A young man running for the US Senate meets a mysterious, charismatic woman on the night he loses the election. He falls in love instantly, but higher powers have decreed they cannot be together, and set out to keep them apart.<br/><br/>Great acting talent compels you to the first two thirds of this movie, but the inherent promise is of a great pay-off, and instead we get a damp squib. <br/><br/>Matt Damon plays David Norris as a humanised Bourne, a man driven to seek something out and fairly unstoppable in his insistence. Emily Blunt is Elise, and as usual lights up the screen with her naturalism. I first came across her in My Summer of Love, and was recently impressed with her in My Sister's Sister. Yet again, as in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, she takes a very average script and raises it up a notch. I think I may be in love with her. Anthony Mackie plays the near-omnipotent others beings as human and fallible, which makes it all the more interesting - think a down-to-earth version of Wings of Desire. <br/><br/>But what lets this movie down is that the premise is intellectually unsatisfying. It is laid out in its starkest terms by Terence Stamp as Thompson in his denial of free will. Apparently, anything noteworthy human kind has achieved has been due to the guiding hand of these higher powers, and anything dark - wars, genocide, environmental damage - is our own poor fault. So free will was an experiment that failed, and has been replaced with the illusion of free will.<br/><br/>Except... David and Elise have a love so strong, so unprecedented, that they have caused the higher powers to re-think the whole grand scheme.<br/><br/>Now, David and Elise have chemistry, but they aren't Romeo and Juliet, or Anthony and Cleopatra. They're not even Thelma and Louise. They're more Jack and Rose. So it is a hard sell to say these two have a love unprecedented in human history. And to base the ending, and so the whole film, on having the audience buy into that.<br/><br/>So go along to Adjustment Bureau for the ride, but don't get your hopes up about the destination."

","Well I could go in to minute detail but simply this film really fails to deliver on its hype as a hybrid love child of the Bourne Films and Inception.<br/><br/>the whole story line suggests that your life is laid out for you and basically you are on a set path with the look of free will, with chaps in hats running around by the thousand jumping through doors.<br/><br/>what a deity needs with riot police I don't know?.<br/><br/>put simply I looked forward to the film and watched it but in the end it really fails to cross any new boundary in film ideas, even as a romantic film the only thing it captures reasonably well was a fleeting moment between strangers that you remember for years, other than that thumbs down from me."

","A film that starts out well with great acting from both Damon and his love interest in the film played by Emily Blunt. With an interesting premise in which Damon uncovers a group of people running the show on Earth from an alternate dimension, the film however quickly turns for the worst with Sesame Street caliber turns of plot which are so inane one wonders if they intended to make a comedy. With a steal from The Matrix here and a pinch from The Thirteenth Floor and Man in Black there, Adjustment Bureau just becomes annoying to watch after a while. The romantic scenes with Damon and Blunt seem to drag more and more as the film progresses and fail to add to the mystery or any other aspect of the story.<br/><br/>4/10"

About half way through I had lost the will to live and although I didn't walk out before the end ( it was touch and go though ) I suffered terribly until the credits came up at the end and I was able to make a swift exit.

"bob the moo","Null","7","12","6 November 2011"," Yes the romance is nice but the idea is lost and presented with such blandness that it is hard to care
","This film offers an interesting idea regarding an unworldly force that nudges and directs the path all of our lives take, it could have done a lot with it but what it decides to do is make a romantic film within this plot. Now there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself but someone should really have a word with the marketing department who decided that a concept-thriller would be easier to sell, since that is very much the film they set their campaign around – not this one. Anyway, cheap marketing aside, I came to this film on DVD with the trailers a long distance memory and average word of mouth having lowered my expectations somewhat.<br/><br/>The film starts with some spark and drive to it as we are introduced to the characters and have the curtains pulled back to reveal what is really going on and the power that ""they"" have. At this point I was interested but as the film progressed this was slowly worn out of me. Some will say this is because I am not a romantic; while that may well be true I did actually like the romance between David and Elise, it was well played and the two had that sort of spark that was required to make me believe in them after so little time, so my problem with the film isn't that the central motivator for the events is this potential love between them. No, my problem with the film is with what it does with the idea itself – which is practically nothing.<br/><br/>The film has very little pace and generally it drags itself along with the audience always looking over their shoulder to see where the film is – we're already 2 steps ahead and it would be lovely if the film at very least kept up with us. It doesn't though, it plays its spiritual card very early on and it never presents a real danger or threat to be overcome – the men in hats never come off as controlling or a threat or even anything close, at worst they come off as stuffy old kill-joys and in this way they make a poor ""opposition"" for our protagonist. I'm not suggesting I needed this to be an action movie, but the lack of any sort of sense of threat or urgency really hurts the film because this ""idea"" is the majority of the film, not the romance – so to mess up the basis for your film is not going to go well.<br/><br/>It is a credit to the on screen presence and charm of both Damon and Blunt that the romance side of the film works well, they both held my attention and kept me interested even when the rest of the film was so very light and surprisingly bland. Mackie, Slattery and Stamp deserved better – all three of them seemed to be phoning it in without anything really going on in their performances, only the odd flutter of urgency gave them good moments but otherwise they are let down. And they are let down by writer/director Nolfi; this guy has been the writer on a couple of big money-makers but he has done himself no favours with this effort – he loses the idea and gets tied up with the romance, forgetting that the idea is the story, not the romance. He lets his cast down and he lets the audience down – it still all looks expensive and professionally done, but this is for little comfort when the story-telling is so fluffed.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau may well be built on a good idea (I will find and read Adjustment Team) but it does very little with it. The romance at the core is engaging but the idea is lost and is handled badly. There is little of interest, threat or pace about it; it isn't a terrible film by any means, it is just so average and lacking in edge that I really found it hard to care – and the fact that I was often ahead of it in regards narrative really didn't help either."

Matt Damon and Emily Blunt became lovely couple in this movie. The mixture of the science-fiction and romance. It sparsely seems in the genres. It has a dreary ambience.

As just one example, falling in love would stop someone from wanting to be president...but God was considering wiping that person's brain clean so that they would not fall in love, yet the personality that would cause them to become president would be gone, too. There were just so many nonsensical moments that we lost count.<br/><br/>I will say this, if there really is an adjustment bureau it would account for how many people actually gave this film high marks. Fortunately, I am posting my '3' before they get to me."
"GirishGowda","7","3","4","15 March 2012"," The Observers.. um, Adjusters, are watching you!
","Are the choices we make really made on our own free will or is it all fate, predestined and set in stone no matter how hard we try to escape it? In ""The Adjustment Bureau"", a rising politician, David Norris (Matt Damon) bumps into a ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of places under the strangest of circumstances and they are immediately attracted to each other. Even though mysterious men (The Adjusters) are dead set on keeping them apart, they keep bumping into each other by chance. Finally, one of the stranger mysterious guys kidnap him and lay it all in front of him. They are the course correctors of the world. Whenever they hand over free will to humans from the heights of human advancements, we inevitably decline into anarchy, the Dark Ages and world wars. He realizes the gravity of the situation where his and Elise's entire starlit future will no longer be a possibility if they fall in love. In the face of overwhelming odds, either he must let her go and accept his fate or risk everything to be with her and push their career into an abyss.<br/><br/>People who haven't watched 'Fringe' are calling this movie imaginative and intriguing, while I'd say its derivative of a far greater work. The Adjustment Bureau in the movie is quite obviously fashioned along the lines of Fringe's ""OBSERVERS"". The differences being the notable not-balded heads, the use of 'portal doors' and The Adjusters being more or less angels. The Observers though, are obviously much more better written than The Adjusters who seem very non-threatening. Implying God as the Chairman was really funny to me. It made the movie less suspenseful than it should have been. Then there's a plot deviation in the middle when its revealed that David and Elise were meant to be together in all the previous plans, but the plan was changed suddenly. So, now they were meant to be with different people. This brings up the whole - Why the hell did the Chairman change the plan in the first place!! Thus, David and Elise, when you think about it, never had any free will to fall in love with each other since the remnants of the previous plans were subconsciously in their minds.<br/><br/>Most people are comparing this movie to Inception which is highly unfair since its not an all out intelligent action/sci-fi thriller. But, if this is the kind of stories 'Inception' helps bring about in Hollywood, then its a step in the right direction. Let me be clear, I really liked the movie, but the potential it had was never quite achieved. Why did the Adjustors want humans to have a better life? What was their interest in all this? It was never explained. They didn't delve into the philosophical or sci-fi aspects of the story. The first half was far superior to the latter half of the movie. Also it didn't help with the fact that the gorgeous Emily Blunt is just the arm candy for Matt Damon and is completely under utilized, barring a few scenes. Matt Damon is perfect in his portrayal as always. By far, the breakout character being the Adjuster, Harry (Anthony Mackie) who goes against the rules and helps David Norris in his quest. In retrospect, his was the only arc where the philosophical and moral conundrum in following God's plans was even remotely touched upon (same storyline is done better in 'Supernatural'). This movie is just another 'love triumphs over all hardships' with a sci-fi/supernatural twist. Could have been done better, but its enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/>7/10"

The Adjustment Bureau is like a book that you cannot put down. It gets ten stars because at this moment I just watched it and want to tell everyone to watch it right now. The chemistry between the main characters is on top with all of the modern classics that we think of. I believe that this movie will be considered one of the greats. This movie truly hits the ball out of the park. It has emotion, excitement, and intrigue and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

","My next movie review is going to be on the film ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Anthony Mackie. My very first thoughts when I saw this movie coming out is that it looks different. As a movie watcher you always want something different. Something that no one has came up with. As viewers we crave that, and that's what I believed I saw when I watched the previews for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man(Matt Damon) that is just living his life and finds out that there is a higher power that regulates what goes on in everyone's life. He doesn't like there game and he wants to make his own rules. Through his journey he meets a woman and they challenge the higher power to try and stop some adjustments that they have(Matt Damon and woman) made. Who knows if they'll be able to live to tell this story...<br/><br/>I liked the movie. This movie was different. I was expecting a little more, but I'm satisfied with what I got. For some reason I was expecting some kind of twist or something. Yet and still, I feel like this was a very good movie. This movie does make you think though. This is a movie that conspiracy theorist will go crazy for. I'm almost positive there are many of them referring to this movie to prove some kind of point. For the average viewer I approve this movie and I also feel like it is DVD worthy. This is a movie that can go into your collection, without feeling like you have to just buy the movie because you are a big Matt Damon fan. I'm giving this movie a 8 out of 10."

","You could either cherish the good things the movie has to offer (light sci-fi, enjoyable thrills, actors with chemistry and the romantic theme) or you could bash it for its downfalls (not that deep, plot holes, maybe even inconsistencies in the story). It's up to you. As you can see, I rated it high. Why? Because I was entertained and that weighed more for me than any of the weak points the movie had.<br/><br/>Still even President Obama had a stab at the movie (after he heard that Matt Damon was disappointed in his presidential efforts, Obama stated in one of his speeches, that he could say the same about Damon, mentioning the Adjustment Bureau). Still the source material is strong enough to justify at least one viewing :o)"

","Knowing this was adapted from a Philip K. Dick story, I knew that the premise of this movie was a little out there. Matt Damon plays a career politician who loses an election and accidentally encounters a pretty woman entering the men's room. She's played by Emily Blunt and we later find out she's a ballet dancer with ambitions of her own. Both seem smitten but there's these men in business suits and hats that are attempting to prevent this romance from blossoming. Why? Well, it seems there are some plans involved from up above...Quite entertaining what with the story, dialogue, acting, and an exciting chase though I did wonder if there really was a point to all the exposition that resulted. Still, it wasn't too bad and I'll maybe watch this again one day so on that note, The Adjustment Bureau is worth a look."
"ainfozino","Null","3","4","15 August 2011"," It makes me wonder....
","The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi, is an action packed romance movie that captivates from beginning to end. David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York politician who has a chance meeting with a professional dancer, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that completely changes his life. The two fall madly in love and must deal with divine powers trying to keep them apart in a battle between free will and fate. This is a thought provoking film which challenges personal beliefs regarding a higher power and creates an interesting plot. Although I believe in free will, the possibility of ""Adjusters"" or ""Angels"" guiding our lives and keeping us on a predetermined path is intriguing. It makes me wonder what my life would look like if I chose another path or had an ""Adjuster"" correcting my mistakes.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is intense and enhances the believability of David and Elise's emotions. The intimacy and impulsiveness of their first kiss leaves me feeling like they are meant to be together. Although this adds to the predictability of the ending, I appreciate David's determination to win Elise. Since I am a hopeless romantic, watching a man fight for the love of his life is very appealing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very well done and the special effects create a visually exciting chase scene through Manhattan. The seamless transition as the characters move supernaturally through doors all over the city is mesmerizing. After living and working in Manhattan for many years, the backdrop evokes a feeling of nostalgia and makes me a little biased towards movies set in New York City. The music of Thomas Newman, one of my favorite film score composers, is engaging and compliments the feeling of romance between David and Elise, as well stimulates the action scenes throughout the film.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is entertaining and emotionally gratifying with a love conquers all theme. I look forward to watching again.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau. Dir. George Nolfi. Perf. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt: 2011, Film."

","Philip K. Dick ((December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) grows more popular as a writer in contemporary culture than he was during his lifetime. He typically focused on the fragile nature of what is ""real"" and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion constructed by powerful external entities, vast political conspiracies, or simply from the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.' Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word. <br/><br/>David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track. David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing. At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen - Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies. David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly. David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer. Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp). It is a struggle between destiny and free will. <br/><br/>There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction. In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense. The entire cast is excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi. THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that. In order to completely appreciate this film the audience must relax and go along with Dick's ideas - then it all seems very right! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"yris2002","8","3","4","18 June 2011"," deeply intriguing and enthralling
","Can we plan our destiny, or is our destiny predetermined by forces outside our will? This is the main point of this science-fiction thriller, where the romance between David and Elise captured me so much as to make my attention concentrate more on the extremely attractive couple Damon-Blunt than on that central issue. Their chemistry works out effectively, never seen such a lovable Damon before, with such a charming smile, Emily Blunt proves mysterious and attractive as usual, so when they lips first meet, something explosive is ignited. The central issue is of course not original, but interesting in the intriguing and breathtaking way it is represented, without moving too far to any conclusion. Certainly free will is eagerly supported, certainly the movie sides with the need to dare and not to be afraid to follow what you think important for your life, against all more or less reasonable obstacles, even against your destiny, mainly when the love of your life is involved. The story proceeds with a quick, intriguing pace, the science-fiction and the romance, the supernatural and the realistic blend perfectly, on the stage of a wonderful and an ever-enchanting New York, keeping the viewer always captivated and entertained, and making the movie really enjoyable from the beginning till the end."

","I'm not sure what this movie is. A romance? Yes. Science fiction? Yes. Thriller? Yes. Religious theme? Yes. Political drama? Yes.<br/><br/>Maybe its split personality is why I liked it so much. It has elements of all those themes in it. I thought Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were fantastic in this film, and I have to admit that although I have long liked Damon's acting, I'm not always pleased with the roles he takes on. I wasn't familiar with Anthony Mackie, but I enjoyed his performance, as well. And, cameo appearances are always fun, and the number in this film are staggering and intriguing because they are mostly political figures.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't like was how the film ended...suddenly (as too many films do end today), and I guess God (that was the power here...wasn't it?) just gave up and let the leads have their way with their love. Hmmmmmmmm. Did David become President? A flash forward would have been great. Oh, any BTW, if it was God, wouldn't he have been at the top of the Empire State Building? ;-)"

","David Norris (Matt Damon), an up and coming politician, meets dancer Elise (Emily Blunt), and they fall for each other. The path of true love never runs smooth, however, and in this case it is because of a bunch of mysterious hat-wearing bureaucrats who devote considerable resources to ensuring that events move along according to a predetermined Plan (which, it transpires, doesn't include David and Elise getting together).<br/><br/>There are three major elements to this movie. One is the romance between the two main characters. The second is the science fiction notion of The Adjustment Bureau itself, continually making minor adjustments to the lives of ordinary people to make sure that The Plan proceeds uninterrupted, and occasionally messing up big time. And the third is an interesting subtext about free will vs predetermination.<br/><br/>All three of these elements interweave, and work very well. Forget the Bourne comparisons. Although Damon is in it, and there is a chase (which makes excellent use of the sc-fi concept, special effects, and New York locations, any Bourne comparison is massively wide of the mark. The science fiction side of things is well handled, but never threatens to overwhelm the heart of the movie, which is the touching and believable relationship between David and Elise - yes, I would have fallen for her straight away, too! These likable characters are very well written and performed, and are a big part of what makes this film very successful."

The trailer makes it seem like this is a hyper suspenseful and violent action thriller, which couldn't be further from what it is - an entertaining puzzler. I wouldn't give it a 10, but it was genuinely entertaining with some fresh and interesting faces. Why everything seems to need to be sold like and action thriller these days is confusing to me. I'm sure they test market a lot of these things, but the trailer totally missed the point and I wouldn't have gone to see it had my friend really wanted to go and had I just noticed a decent review."

","Movie Review: ""The Adjustment Bureau"" – A wannabe sci-fi film with a very interesting premise, only to turn into a lame love story!!!!! Matt Damon stars as David Norris, an up and coming politician. After failing to secure a seat in the NY Senate seat in his first attempt, David has a fate encounter with a mysterious ballerina in the restroom of the Waldorf Astoria. This incident triggers a set of pre-determined events which will enable the continued success of all mankind. To ensure that this master plan is followed, the ""chairman"" has dispatched ""case workers"" or some may call ""angels"" to nudge or direct key people in order to guarantee that these predestined happenings occur. When the master plan gets derailed or goes off-course, a special group of individuals (men in hats) called ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is called upon to correct the timeline. In the scenario of this film, it's a ""second chance"" meeting of Norris and the ballerina. The Master Plan has it preordained that these two individuals should never come in contact again. However, no matter how hard the ""Adjustment Bureau"" tries to redirect, hinder, or disrupt these two from coming in contact. An even larger force or entity seems determined to bring the two back together. AND THIS IS WHERE THIS MOVIE GOES TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET!!! Instead of this force or entity being some sort of ""anti-chairman"", bent on the destruction of mankind it's the power of LOVE that cannot be stopped. OMG, PLEASEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! So when the Norris character (Damon) is given the option of never seeing the ballerina again, or it could mean the end of civilization as we know it; he opts for being with the girl!!! And that my friends, is where the film spirals into mediocrity!!! What occurs next is a ridiculous chase through a series of ""magical doors"" in which only ""men with hats"" can manipulate; and if this sounds ludicrous, IT'S BECAUSE IT IS!!!! How a movie with so much potential, could turn into such a pile of drivel, I will never know. I cannot / will not recommend this film, and would avoid at all cost!!!"

","Sorry but Matt is not a good choice for being a Romeo who gives up politics for his love of his life.. I don't buy it, and all the romantic scenes flaws very badly, no electric between the boy and the girl, and no any romance.. So since they do not suggest a deep love, I do not buy the rest, either. In my opinion, for example Richard Gere would suit this movie much better.. he is a better actor in terms of showing his feelings. He might make this one a deeper movie. Don't think that I don't like Matt, he is a better actor for action adventure movies. I love his spy movies, but come on, this movie, the story is built up on a deep lovers who can not reach out, and if you cant show it, then the movie collapses."

","Summary: The premise is the worst I ever heard of, the plot is lame, and the film ended really poorly. You didn't get sucked into the world of the film, the special effects and action are not cool. There was bad acting. At this point there is nothing worth seeing about the film besides Damon acting well and a typical love story, but this was supposed to be a thriller. This movie would be a waste of drugs if you thought they could aid in making it watchable. This movie isn't romantic enough to make your girl swoon at any point. You will never say ""That was awesome"", you may laugh at the stupidity of the film or simply say ""I don't care about this $#*+""<br/><br/>Here's why this film will disappoint you for watching it:<br/><br/>Ending: Cop-out and includes an infuriatingly cheesy life philosophy. This ending alone would ruin even a good film.<br/><br/>Big Bad Guy: Will not scare you. Doesn't do much.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Doors open to different places than they should. This is the big special effect in the movie, it is not noteworthy and not a reason this film is worth seeing. Other special effects are not interesting and few and far between.<br/><br/>Poor acting: If you weren't a main character, you got typical confident bad guy lines. These lines were delivered very flat and made the characters forgettable.<br/><br/>Bad guy's kryptonite: Dumb enough to embarrass you for watching. I won't spoil the film, but there are two and both of them should have been left out because they never mattered. They seemed to be added as an afterthought or got bungled in production and are some artifact of a more thought out plot device. <br/><br/>Plot Hole: Hard not to make this a spoiler....they were larger holes than are usually acceptable, not even being picky here 1.) Something all knowing didn't know something very obvious 2.)

","""There's much to be said for challenging fate instead of ducking behind it."" Diana Trilling<br/><br/>Fate, determinism, chance, existential choice, and love-- all need adjustment, and the sci-fi The Adjustment Bureau is right for you if you love those abstractions and miss Twilight Zone and X Files. Matt Damon gives a strong under-acted performance as a New York senatorial candidate dogged by the Adjustment Bureau under the direction of a ""chairman"" who writes the life plan for specially targeted humans. His minions adjust as is necessary to the god-like's plans with as few ""ripples"" as possible.<br/><br/>Based on Philip K. Dick's short story, The Adjustment Team, it's an imaginative screenplay that takes itself not too seriously but risks being underdeveloped. What distinguishes Damon's David and his dancer-love Elise (Emily Blunt) is their determination to fulfill their serious love despite the Bureau's plans contrary to the consummation. The on-screen chemistry between Blunt and Damon is so pleasing that I am tempted to call this film a romance rather than a sci-fi thriller. <br/><br/>Actually, what makes me so favorable is the nicely-acted romance, which asks questions about whether to choose love or public service, love or professional success. For the existentialist, these are vexing alternatives squarely in the realm of personal choice, not a bureau's design.<br/><br/>Therein rests the philosophical core of the film: Can mankind be trusted with free will given how badly they have screwed up over the last 2000 years or so? The Bureau's notable success at intervention during the 16th through 19th centuries promises that it needs to make itself felt again, especially as the path of a future USA president must be controlled.<br/><br/>Although I am tempted to cite the absurdities of the plot and the philosophical inconsistencies, I will refrain in favor of a pleasantly provocative tale that tries more than most other films at this time to engage our minds. The parallel to Inception is not far-fetched; the manipulation is just different. But in the end the humans must take control of their fates, and in both films they do.\<br/><br/>Although it's not Blade Runner or Minority Report (both Dick stories), I applaud a film that dares to remind us of our determination to forge productive lives. Egyptians today are living proof of the power of free will.<br/><br/>""If I'm not supposed to be with her, why do I feel like this?""

I was hoping for an intriguing, suspenseful, conspiracy style (cf Three days of the condor, Parallax View) film, and we got something quite ridiculous, schmaltzy and so on, with NY setting and visuals being the only redeeming feature. Emily Blunt is not bad, Terence Stamp is as good as can be in a simplistic role. Matt Damon should be well advised not to do more turkeys. Marginally better than The Tourist. Inception is a masterpiece compared to this and the Bourne films are several leagues above. Strangely, there's a very 80's feel to the production and narrative - very disappointing."

","Any movie that has a spiritual underlying tone to it, always raises questions and The Adjustment Bureau did just that. Surprisingly, this movie did not have much plot holes as compared to the other sci-fi genres. From the very start of the movie, when you have the four statuesque figures looking out at the world. You try to figure out their roles in their movie. It was a nail biting movie till, the clichéd love story kicks in. My sense of optimism would like to believe that there was a bigger story of lessons to learn and the love story was just an example the audience could relate too. Though as the movie progresses, one would start thinking that the love story resembled the 2008 movie Hancock with both the protagonists loving each in other different time periods despite the numerous reincarnations. <br/><br/>On the whole though, classifying this movie as a thriller would be a far cry. As we all know Hollywood and clichéd endings go hand in hand and this movie was brimming with it. From the ex bad boy David Norris (Matt Damon) falling hard for the free spirited, opinionated Elise (Emily Blunt) to the scene of falling in love at first sight. Right till the end of movie with, a passionate kiss always saves the day. Hollywood, quit being a bore and give us some real thrillers."

This was Matt Damon's first romantic role and he was really good. His crooked smile gives him charm. Although I can see why some religious groups may have some issues with the movie as it gives a unique twist to the subject of angels and God (although it never says God - refers to ""the Chairman"").

It is an intriguing premise, but unfortunately it goes pretty much nowhere.<br/><br/>The plot could have developed by investigating further the nature of the adjustments and the ripples they create, or on what free will is actually about and why humankind is not yet capable to handle it.<br/><br/>Instead, it develops the idea that love at first sight do exists and so does that elusive ""other half"" we need to find to feel finally whole. Both concepts are very romantic but difficult to sell to a grown-up (or just cynical) audience.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays David, who could have a great future and a positive influence on mankind (or at least on the US), but keeps deviating from this nobler and higher purpose because of Elise– a flirty ballerina he met in the gents room (not the most romantic location).<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I kept thinking that Elise kept popping up at the worst possible time and considered her more as disturbance rather than the romantic interest, which is a clear sign I did not buy into the star-crossed lovers' side of the story.<br/><br/>What I appreciated was the minimal special effects and Damon's performance, but I still consider - with regret -this movie a miss, despite the huge potential.<br/><br/>P.S. and in real life, people who fall asleep on the job usually get fired, not promoted."

"howard.schumann","8","5","9","7 March 2011"," Plans can change
","We know that plans can change but the key question in first-time director George Nolfi's thriller, The Adjustment Bureau, is whether or not ""The Plan"" can change. Very loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (J.D. Salinger would say ""I told you so""), The Adjustment Bureau is a highly entertaining film, filled with an intriguing story line, enough action to keep us awake and focused, and a storybook romance in which the lovers actually have good chemistry together. On a philosophical level, however, calling it murky gives it more credit than it deserves.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is that there is a ""Plan"", that nothing happens by chance, and that free will is a comfortable illusion. According to Nolfi, our destiny is not guided by a loving universe but enforced by a cadre of cold ""enforcers"" who advise us to stay on the right path without question or our severed heads will be impaled on a spike on London Bridge for the tourists to take pictures of. These enforcers have been with us throughout human history except for the times when they took a vacation just to stand back and observe us stumblebums get ourselves into mischief like wars, depressions, and going to Justin Bieber concerts.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Matt Damon is David Norris, a candidate for the United States Senate from New York and a young man who looks as if he has unlimited promise for future leadership roles. His campaign is attracting large crowds, though he never seems to talk about any issues. Riding high in the polls, his campaign goes off the tracks when the New York Post splashes a sensational story across the front page about a prank that he committed many years ago and his chances taste like the proverbial toast. On the night of his concession speech, however, Norris bumps into Elise Sellas (Emily Blount), an attractive young woman hiding from security in the men's room after she crashed a wedding. It is almost contrivance at first sight, until she is chased out of the building by security without giving Norris her phone number.<br/><br/>The chance (or so we think) meeting empowers David to make an honest concession speech which immediately makes him the front runner for the next Senate race, by which time it is assumed his reckless behavior in the past will have been forgotten (unless he decides to moon someone on the subway). Later, he meets Elise on the bus going to work who tells him that she is a professional dancer and gives him her phone number. Their relationship seems to be heading in the right direction until four mysterious spooks enter the picture and gum up the works. Their identity is never revealed, except that they are sort of mid-level enforcers for someone called The Chairman, a kind of a big shot sky captain who insists that ""they do it my way"", even with no Sammy Davis, Jr. in the picture.<br/><br/>Unlike the gentle angels in Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, these guys are no fun to be around. One of the members is Richardson (John Slattery), a straight-laced, humorless kind of guy that you might find at a Tea Party rally. Another is Harry (Anthony Mackie) who was supposed to have prevented David form meeting Elise for the second time but bungled the job and later even becomes sympathetic to his charge, a no-no for these goofballs. When the spooks capture David, rather than treating him to a vegan dinner, they lead him into a cavernous ballroom to let him know in no uncertain terms that their Plan Book says that he and Elise should not be together and that he must stop seeing her immediately.<br/><br/>As if that is not enough, they tell him that if their existence is revealed to anyone, even inadvertently, his brain will be ""reset"" which is enforcer-ese for Instant Oatmeal, presumably unflavored. The four guys have one motto and that is ""keep your hat on"". Apparently their hats allow them to enter through one door and come out another door far away such as Yankee Stadium, The Statue of Liberty, or the subway during rush hour. Later someone tells David to ""assume everyone with a hat on is a threat, no matter if it's a beanie, a turban, or a yarmulke."" Hopefully, they won't be put into magic ghetto's. The enforcers carry iPad-looking devices which they use to change someone's fate in real time, entering into someone's mind to screw it up or at least prevent them from finding a taxi (doesn't take a magician to do that in New York).<br/><br/>Though we never meet the big cheese, we are privy to the company of Thompson, a ""senior adviser"" who looks and acts like the others, same great taste, fewer calories. Unable to find Elise because the guys burned her telephone number, poor David rides the same bus every day for three years hoping to see Elise again, though you'd think that after a while he might get the idea that she no longer rides this bus. Despite the important snowfall alert that both of their dreams of future glory will turn to mush if they insist on being together, David thinks that true love conquers all, and who knows, he might be right. After all, strong intention can overcome the most powerful force in the universe - yourself.<br/><br/>May the force be with you!"
"DICK STEEL","8","8","17","1 March 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Adjustment Bureau
","Matt Damon stars as the charismatic congressman David Norris, who's on his way to senatorship if not for some last minute press expose that tanks his campaign. While crafting out a speech in a hotel bathroom, he meets the dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) and the two fall in love almost instantaneously. However, larger forces are at hand to ensure that the plan for the entire world gets to move according to what they designed, and this love story is clearly to be avoided at all costs. So begin that bewildering cat and mouse game with The Adjustment Bureau operatives adamant in stopping David Norris through all their limited (yes, limited, according to rules that will be explained) abilities of short range telekinesis of sorts, and teleportation powers through the opening of seemingly random doors to portals elsewhere.<br/><br/>The science fiction concept here is interesting. There's always a book showing, in indecipherable terms, how events happening now can open up endless possibilities of how things will shape, and showing the one path that unravels in real time, together with alert points and pitfalls that should be avoided, failing which a ripple effect greater than can be contained will be caused. There's also some deus ex machina moments which allowed for the introduction of Terence Stamp's character as a higher order Mr Fix It, nicknamed The Hammer for sledging his way through difficult and sticky situations, brought in to try and provide enticing reasons for David to give up the chase, when fellow underlings Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) and Richardson (John Slattery) have failed. Then there are those hidden portals which open up to probably anywhere in the world, done to perfection through seamless special effects and editing to slice everything together in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>But the more thought provoking issues will be that of free will and destiny, whether everything unravels according to a set path pre-determined by someone else, that what seem to be choices turn out to be no more than what's already laid out and planned for, giving the simple illusion that one has that level of freedom to choose. Discussions in the film crank up the appeal factor, and of course introduces us to this particular sandbox of reality that all the characters have to live with and abide by. For the romantic then, if you're told to give up someone whom you've just met and who could be that soulmate you're looking for, at what price sacrifice comes the question, whether one would be willing to fight, even if it may seem futile, for that chance that you may just beat the system with odds tremendously stacked up against.<br/><br/>That's when The Adjustment Bureau perhaps required a little adjusting itself. The system isn't perfect, and so neither is the film, since its technology isn't as robust, easy to deploy or efficient such as the flashing penlights of the Men in Black. Being the blue-eyed boy of The Bureau's plan also helped since there are much larger plans for both David and his lady love Elise, and seriously it's quite the hard sell trying to give up all the potential and plans laid out in front of you, where you see the seed starting to grow even, for something quite intangible as love. But a romance this is, so that's the path the film undertook, only for this fight against a higher order not too well fleshed out.<br/><br/>I felt that George Nolfi pulled his punches, having set up so much anticipation when David and Elise will try their best to deviate from their destiny, only for one major running sequence - not even the chase we were quite promised and outlined - which underwhelmed, and I suspect could be left as deleted scenes for the DVD. It's like setting the boxing ring for that extended slug, only for a first round knock out to spoil the party and appreciation for the finale, too bright I think, but that's personal as I prefer my science fiction to be rather bleak, so that's a little bias for you readers out there to note since I felt it could have been a more open film rather than a verbatim one, contrary to its theme against the laying things all out for everyone.<br/><br/>Damon shines with plenty of likability factors put into his politician (which is rare considering the profession of choice!) and seriously this is one candidate I would root for and support as he struggles to find some meaning into the mess he's in. The romance between his character and Emily Blunt was believable as they engage in the type of banter couples do, and situations that will call for heartbreak after heartbreak, with the powers that be standing in their way employing tactics that is what I call emotionally cunning - that is - if you want eternal happiness for someone living her dream, don't get in her way and bog her down in a relationship. Hmm.<br/><br/>Still, the production values are gorgeous, and art direction involving the internals of the Bureau were interesting to gawk at, and deserves a second look, as these men with fedoras move around the world tinkering with small, micro level events that have repercussions at the macro level, going along with the whims of a higher being. There is enough scope here to equate the Bureau with how things are governed here even, with issues kicked up to the higher levels of bureaucracy to solve if it exceeds one's bandwidth, or horrors, pay grade! You don't question, but you conform and comply, and for the mavericks who prove their worth through sacrifice and steely determination, hopefully could one day overcome and emerge winners in some form. Recommended!"

It quickly descends into initially stop us from meeting if you can, and then a ridiculous catch us if you can race after we do.<br/><br/>We are supposed to believe that there are aliens with living books that write the scripts of fate and control events. Judging by the number needed to manipulate events in just two people's lives there would have to be about 20 for every person on the planet.

"monkeysgalore","4","3","5","1 December 2019"," What?
","I went into this film with high expectations. I'd read a lot of positive reviews and seen a lot of high ratings for this film, and I was really hoping for a smart, entertaining thriller that might even make me think. I finished the film very disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot follows a man who desperately wants to be with the woman he loves, but a mysterious, clandestine group of apparently otherworldly beings attempt to make sure the two never get together.<br/><br/>I have to give credit to the director and screenwriter, both of whom are George Nolfi. He is no stranger to writing films, but this is his first directorial effort. He adapted the story ""Adjustment Team"" by legendary science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick (which I haven't read), and this is the result.<br/><br/>I'll say my positive comments first. I wasn't entirely un-entertained. The film had an interesting idea, and it was well-directed. It looked very nice, and Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both threw themselves into their roles, and they had excellent chemistry, and both made it almost, ALMOST, rise above its shortcomings. I also want to give credit to Anthony Mackie, who is actually a pretty great actor. I liked him in this and ""Point Blank"" (2019), and he actually has way more range and versatility than people probably realize, since most people only know him from the Marvel movies, which often drown their actors' performances in special effects. Anyway, the film was interesting, and well-cast. But for such a ""high concept"" film, it should've delivered much more than that.<br/><br/>Now to my criticisms. I didn't get the point of the film at all. Everyone already pointed out the obvious Christian imagery and metaphors in the film, but the messages seemed so muddled. I couldn't tell if George Nolfi was a Christian or not. I myself am a Christian, but even trying to view it objectively, I was confused, to say the least. It appears that Nolfi heard about Christianity second-hand from someone on the street, and decided to make a movie about it. Everything in the film only portrays the most basic elements of Christianity without ever explaining the importance of it. It's actually a little offensive.<br/><br/>The titular ""Adjustment Bureau"" is eventually revealed (indirectly) to be angels working for ""The Chairman"" (God), and they carry out The Chairman's tasks and whims, and make sure the plans that he writes fall into place. Sounds like an interesting concept right? Well that's about all you get. The Chairman decides he doesn't want the two main characters to be together, for no apparent reason. He'd previously written that they should be together several different times, but then without any explanation, he decides they shouldn't be together, and his minions work off trying to make it happen. So the film portrays a fickle version of God who changes his mind all the time and can't make decisions, and when he does, they're dumb decisions that happen seemingly for no other reason than to hurt people. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that God changes his mind all the time and makes decisions for no reason. Nothing in this film attempts to accurately portray the motives of God, or even an interpretation of them rooted in actual Christian texts.<br/><br/>Also, why does God, sorry, ""The Chairman"", carry out such important plans through such bumbling henchmen. If he supposedly makes everything work, are we really as an audience supposed to accept that this supreme being's plan could come crumbling down because of one of his employee's missteps. I mean, the one angel misses the main character because he doesn't see him come out of a building, and that sets off the film's entire chain of events. Come on. They eve say in the movie that the main characters met because of chance. So now both chance and predestination coexist happily because of the efforts of a being who is so powerful, yet he makes mistakes like this, well, fairly often, according to lines in the film.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't even get me started on the hat and water plot points. So these beings are supposedly smarter and more powerful than humans, yet they're unable to detect anything going on around water, and they're only way of magically transporting is through their hats? I get that the writers needed a way for Damon's character to even the odds in the end, but it's so arbitrary and silly (the water element too).<br/><br/>The film ends with the two main characters being allowed to stay together because they ""fought so hard that they inspired The Chairman"". If this Chairman is so powerful, how come he can be so easily beaten, and influenced, but such lesser, insignificant life forms whom he controls so easily? Is the underlying message here that God can be beaten and his mind can be changed if one fights hard enough? Don't make me laugh.<br/><br/>The final voiceover narration says that The Chairman's ultimate goal, most likely, is for us as humans to write our own plans. This is contradictory to earlier scenes in which members of the Bureau told the main character that they tried giving humans free will several times, but that it always ended in disaster. So if the Chairman's goal was for us to write our own stories, why didn't he do that from the beginning? Is the message that we as humans can eventually evolve to the level go God by becoming mature and smart enough to handle our own lives? If that's the case, what makes The Chairman so special? This also is a slap in the face to basically anyone with even the slightest idea of the God depicted in the Bible.<br/><br/>Often, thriller films will attempt, and occasionally succeed at, distracting the audience from its narrative flaws with its style and flash, often in the form of intense and fast-paced scenes, or action sequences. This film had no action sequences (a car crash and a few punches are the only instances of violence), and the only intense moment really was the chase at the end. When a film puts all its eggs in the basket of its story, then the story needs to hold up. Without anything to distract me from its issues, I was left to enjoy the story, which I already expressed my problems with. The characters, as I said, were good, but only could go as far as the story allowed them to.<br/><br/>All in all, this film, while entertaining as a thriller, devolved into a muddled, contradictory mess. It seemed like Nolfi just spewed his ideas onto a page and went with it, deciding to forego script revisions, which is a shame, since this could've been a great script and film with a few more rewrites. I couldn't even tell what Nolfi's religious convictions were. He seemed to bash Christianity one minute, and sing its praises the next, without giving any substance to any of the ideas on display here. I think that he should've only hinted at the spiritual/religious aspect of this, and just left it more up to interpretation as to the nature of the Adjustment Bureau, and had it more like ""The Truman Show"" (a superior film) where a man discovers his life is being orchestrated. I wish the love story would've had more of a focus, without the lofty mixed religious messages bringing it down. Adding the spiritual aspect without any apparent knowledge of the source material just made it look dumb. I wanted to like this film, I really did, but for such a ""high concept"" film, it was too lackluster for me to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Nolfi said in an interview that ""The point of the film was to raise questions."" Well I had many questions by the end. Namely ""what was the point?"" and what was he thinking?"" If you're looking for a smart thriller that makes you think, especially if you're a Christian and want to ponder Christianity itself or see a non-Christian intelligently ask questions, look elsewhere. This is just a middle finger to anyone who takes their religion seriously."

","Let me start saying that whoever says this movie would remind them of Dark City (which is an excellent movie) would be completely ashamed for associating a great movie, like Dark City, with a bad one i.e AB. I really thought this would be somehow either a remake or inspired by Dark City: man walks in on a team of people who froze time and are messing around with people's heads, man was not suppose to see that (indeed no human was suppose to see that) and it basically goes from there, some love, some action, thrill... Well Dark city was very philosophical, had to do with aliens and humans being test subjects (actually many speculate that the people were never ever on earth, they probably were born there generations after generations, and never set foot on earth, more like lab animals...), well the Adjustment Bureau took the ""main"" idea of the premise of Dark City but went in a different direction, i.e, love and passion can overcome destiny and basically the old question of free will vs determination and can you defy your destiny and write it yourself or is it imposed upon you...Concepts are very deep and controversial BUT movie was a joke, did not deliver and for many parts it felt like I was watching a Walt Disney movie (especially when they informed the audience that they definitely can NOT let them kiss, reminded me of Arial in the little mermaid where she needed a kiss to get her voice back or whatever and the villain's main job was to prevent that kiss...). And seriously? you are basically told that if you do not stay with that certain person, not only that person's long life dreams will come true, you WILL change the world to a better place. So instead of giving in and sticking to ""Let's change the world and probably save millions of lives in the future... and make earth a better place"" AND let that person have whatever they wished for, and consider this a good memory that would stay with you forever, and who knows, you may manage to be friends in the future... NO, let me be as stubborn as humanly possible and be a selfish S.O.B and stick with that person. Not only that, he did not even give her a choice! (Did not tell her that she WILL be the best ever and live all her dreams and that he WILL change the world)... So dumb, selfish and stupid. The only thing that would have made this movie better is that the cut scene at the end of the movie would showed them (say few years later) divorced and of course none of them have achieved anything. And then the moral would be ""don't be an idiot and stop being selfish!"".

","Hugo Award winning author Phillip K. Dick penned over 40 science fiction novels and more than 120 short stories. Dick forged a career out of writing about omnipotent corporations and dystopian governments that manipulated people like puppets. Even if sci-fi does not share shelf space with your mainstream literature, you should have heard about him from a number of film adaptations released since his death 1982. For the record, Dick died in 1982, and Hollywood belatedly appropriated his inventive output. Of course, ""Blade Runner"" (1982) ranks as the most celebrated Dick adaptation. ""Next"" (2007) with Nicolas Cage, ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006) with Keanu Reeves, ""Paycheck"" (2005) with Ben Affleck, ""Minority Report""(2002) with Tom Cruise, ""Impostor"" (2001) with Gary Sinise, ""Screamers"" (1995) with Peter Weller, and ""Total Recall"" (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger followed in the wake of ""Blade Runner."" The thing that most of these films have in common is that they do little justice to his genius. Freshman writer, producer, and director George Nolfi has done a splendid job turning Dick's 1954 short story ""Adjustment Team"" into an entertaining opus with Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Terence Stamp. If you shun sci-fi thrillers because of the gadgetry, jargon, and far-out creatures that dominate so many of these movies, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" may appeal to you. Damon does not show up in a space suit and Blunt does not cavort about in some futuristic coiffure. Nobody brandishes either a laser gun or the neutralizer. Alien life forms neither invade Earth nor enslave humanity.<br/><br/>Aside from the earlier Dick adaptation ""Paycheck,"" ""The Adjustment Bureau"" qualifies as the least sci-fi looking epic that you will see. Nevertheless, it concerns a theme that obsessed Dick throughout his life: alternate realities sometimes referred to as simulacra. Damon plays Young, single, unruly Brooklyn-born politician George Norris christened 'the GQ Congressman.' Norris falls in love by a happy coincidence when he encounters a beautiful dancer in the men's room at the elite motel where he maintains his election campaign headquarters. Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt of ""Gnomeo & Juliet"") is hiding from motel security because she tried to crash a wedding. Norris struggles to organize his thoughts for a speech conceding his election to his opponent. Initially, he asks if anybody is in the restroom. This is the kind of rest room where the toilet stall doors resemble front doors. When he gets no response, Norris mulls over the wording of his speech. Elise surprises him at the last moment and steps out, and they strike up a conversation that leads to a kiss. No sooner have they concluded their lip-lock than David's long-suffering campaign manager Charlie Traynor (Michael Kelly of ""Law Abiding Citizen"") enters and catches a glimpse of Elise as she strolls out. Afterward, David concedes defeat with a speech about the absurd lengths that his campaign went to so that he would attract voters. He talks about the choice of shoes. The shoes have to look nice enough to attract the upper elite without alienating the middle class voters. Although he lost the election, David has proved so charismatic that he won't be overlooked during the next election.<br/><br/>Later, David and Elise meet again on a New York City Transit bus. As it turns out, a group of guys are monitoring everything that happens to David and Elise. They dress elegantly but unobtrusively in gray suits and ties. They tote around title books and like to haunt rooftops where they survey the city and make plans. Actually, they don't make plans. More appropriately, they follow plans. When they open their books to check the progress of their plans, we see what looks like a computer screen saver on paper with scribble-like lines and circles. They report to a superior who calls himself 'the Chairman of the Board.' No, the Chairman of the Board is not Frank Sinatra with a harp, a halo, and a hat. In fact, we never see the Chairman of the Board. Nevertheless, this 'Chairman of the Board' might be a supreme deity. Writer & director George Nolfi leaves this up to the imagination of each individual moviegoer. The problem is that the Chairman of the Board that orchestrates the moves that mankind makes wants neither of them to hook up. <br/><br/>Indeed, these many mysterious men in hats do their best to keep our hero and heroine apart. Initially, they succeed after the man-in-gray, Harry Mitchell (Will Smith lookalike Anthony Mackie of ""Million Dollar Baby"") takes a nap on a city bench and misses a rendezvous with Norris. When he misses colliding with Norris, Harry accidentally allows him to run into Elise on the city bus. The men in gray scramble to make-up for this error by getting to David's office where they try to erase everybody's mind. You can see all of this stuff in the trailer. They warn David that they will zap his mind if he does not play along with them. Specifically, they don't want him to meet Elise because she is destined to become America's greatest dancer. If they get together, he will destroy her career as well as sidetrack his own political aspirations. Predictably, the Damon protagonist refuses to be manipulated, even if these enigmatic gentlemen threaten to erase his mind. Sounds a bit like ""Men in Black?"" Nevertheless, he does everything within his power to thwart these people who would keep the woman of his dreams and he apart in this exciting romantic thriller. The closest movie to ""The Adjustment Bureau"" that seasoned sci-fi aficionados may recall is director Alex Proyas's second film, the neo-noir ""Dark City"" (1998) where aliens recreated an Earth-like environment and conducted endless experiments to understand the essence of humanity. Unlike ""Dark City,"" ""The Adjustment Bureau"" prefers to be more cerebral than sci-fi."
"KineticSeoul","8","3","5","5 March 2011"," Interesting premise with a good blend of sci-fi and romance
","I really didn't have high expectations for this movie when I saw the trailer, but after seeing it I can now say it really did beat my expectations. It's a clever sci-fi romance/thriller that is crafted very well and intrigued me throughout the whole movie. It sort of reminded me of movies like ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Inception"" a bit, but I personally liked this movie a bit more than ""The Butterfly Effect"". The movie is about trying to outrun fate or predestination and also makes you think more about freewill and also has elements of love and has a perfect blend of sci-fi and romance. The vibe and style has been done before especially in other sci-fi movies, but the direction of it all makes it worth while. The lighthearted aspect of this movie is done right for a serious tone movie and I didn't really like Matt Damon as a actor all that much but I enjoyed his performance in this. His character was very likable and a ideal politician in this movie. There is few parts that doesn't make sense, but overall the premise is mostly cleverly done. Now I never read ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick this movie is adapted from, but judging by the film itself I really enjoyed it and seemed like a very good adaptation. There is some parts that seem to drag on sometimes and a bit slow. But overall almost everything in this movie works and has a perfect blend of two main elements. If your looking for tension you might be disappointed, because the Adjustment Bureau isn't very intimidating in this and you will see why. Despite some flaws, it's still a intriguing movie done right and to anyone who is looking for a good date movie, this one is worth checking out there is something for everyone.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"rgkarim","8","3","5","5 March 2011"," Message in a movie
","Review for Adjustment Bureau On Saturday March 5, 2011 I decided to do a double movie day and see two promising blockbusters. The first on my list was the adjustment bureau, a drama I thought would be a mixture of the matrix, inceptions, and a little bit of titanic drama. In a sense that is what it is, but favored more of the romantic tale than anything else. The movie opens up with an intro to Matt Damon's life up to this point, which is done in a similar manner to most political based movies. After the intro, the movie starts off a little slow, but the plot is intriguing as the men in hats begin talking about plans and looking at their agendas. Questions like what's in the book, what is the importance to the matter, and why him are running through the brain and you wonder what is specific about a few agents. Eventually things get suspenseful and focused, but it all revolves around the romance between Matt Damon and the girl. Within the suspense lies constant situational comedy that keeps you laughing at the challenge Matt Damon provides the bureau. The peak of suspense is reached towards the end of the movie in my opinion, when we see Matt Damon take action. <br/><br/>So what are the high points of this movie? The first is the message that this movie brings about the challenges one can face when it comes to being in love. It's funny how many times love can blind people and result in nothing more than turmoil, anger, and misery. In this movie, Matt Damonis willing to do anything for the woman he loves, and makes decisions for her good. Their bond and relationship is constantly tested with things most relationships never have to face, and still they make sacrifices to be together. I know it's a movie, but still when one looks at the love they share, you can't help but feel empowered to make your relationship work. <br/><br/>A second message is about how life cannot be planned and requires one to take risks and carve a path of their own. This doesn't mean you should go out and break the law, destroy property, or do something radical, but instead shows that life really can't be planned out. Constant challenges will change the best laid out plans and the truth is you have to take a few risks and go down some uncertainties before you arrive at a life you will be happy about. It's scary and hard, just as portrayed in this movie, but with determination and courage you can overcome those challenges. Yet the challenge can be easier when you have a friend as loyal as the character Harry. People who will stick by you through and through, willing to sacrifice their own careers and reputations to help do something that is right, is a crucial factor that can help success come easier. The various scenes with Harry's conscience and his determination to either help or hurt is something I could relate to with my everyday life. Choices will come and challenge you're plans, but in the end you must do what is right for not only yourself but for other people as well. That's the message this movie conveys. Outside of that the acting is good, the pace mostly moderate with a few slow parts here and there. The story is good, and as I have already stated there are strong messages that can be learned if one keeps an open mind to the movie. Okay so what's bad or iffy about the movie? For one thing it's predictable from the foreshadowing that they do early on. You will see constant signs and hear constant messages that will tell you what is coming up. There are not really any big surprises that jump out at you except for a few scenes that can make you jump if you're the kind that startles easily. The next thing is that there is a strong religious theme in this movie that may or may not offend you. I'm not going to reveal much, but the movie can possibly suggest things of tyranny, cruelty, and mistakes in plans and that might get underneath some skins in the audience. One must again be careful and make sure that the messages I got are not misinterpreted to lead to total anarchy and disregard to rules or plans. Still some may be disappointed with the ending of the movie, thinking it's too rushed or too chopped up. Overall though I really enjoyed the movie and got a big lesson out of it. It's suspense makes it fun, its plot predictable yet enjoyable, the acting superb, and the pace just right for this kind of movie. Normally love stories bore me, but this one did not. In my opinion audiences who will like this movie are the following: Huge Matt Damon fans, romance and suspense lovers, and anybody who is looking for a quick film. Fans who will not like this: action lovers, chick flick comedy lovers, science fiction fans, or anybody who thinks it looks like Inception or the Matrix. Overall I give this movie an 8 or 8.5, and hopefully this review helps."

"paperback_wizard","6","4","8","4 March 2011"," An Imperfect Plan
","We make choices every day, and these choices can lead us down any number of paths. It's a plot device that's been used so many times, in so many different ways, that I don't think I even need to describe it any further. In the new sci-fi thriller ""The Adjustment Bureau"", starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Anthony Mackie, though, a twist is added.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by sci-fi literary giant Philip K. Dick, Damon discovers one day that his choices in life are being made for him. A group of shadowy agents are working behind the scenes, literally, changing the course of humanity in subtle but profound ways. In Damon's case, they want to make him a success in life, specifically in politics; and they've been working a long time to make him a success. But Damon himself is thwarting their efforts, unknowingly at first, but soon deliberately.<br/><br/>It seems, to the Adjustment Bureau and its unseen Chairman, that humanity is not ready to choose its own destiny, protect its own future (or, indeed, its own survival). It's not made clear in the movie just how much influence they have over humanity, but in Damon's case, it is enormous. When he discovers their efforts, he has no idea what to make of it; but when they try to separate him from the woman he loves, played by Emily Blunt, he's determined not to let them succeed.<br/><br/>The movie has been described as a cross between ""Inception"" and the Jason Bourne series; unfortunately, it isn't much of either. Its action sequences are not that exciting, despite several chase scenes through New York City, and frankly, neither is the chemistry between Damon and Blunt. At various points, the agents of the Bureau attempt to reason with Damon, giving him hints of the great plans in store for both him and Blunt which would require they never end up together. It's a potentially compelling conundrum, trading two people's happiness and love with each other for the chance to do great, important works in the future; but Damon can't quite convincingly portray the internal conflict.<br/><br/>As for the underlying question of whether any of us can choose anything for ourselves, the focus on Damon and what he will choose completely ignores all the characters, on screen or otherwise, who didn't even know their choices were taken from them. Thus, any ray of hope the movie offers us is a cynical one, at best. The mysterious Chairman's ""plan"" for humanity, as is constantly hinted, is neither infallible nor complete, and may even be subject to change with no warning. You could leave the theater wondering why they bother to change anything at all.<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie, to be sure, and the premise, as I said, is a timeless one: can we choose for ourselves, whether we know the possible outcomes or not? Frankly, the movie doesn't even fully address that question. It waivers too long between trying to be a psychological thriller or an action movie that it ends up being neither.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2011/03/an-imperfect-plan/ )"

","(Synopsis) Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is a charismatic and highly motivated politician running for the U.S. Senate. He is on the brink of winning the Senate seat when he meets the beautiful ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the hotel bathroom while preparing for his speech. David looks into the captivating eyes of Elise, and the two fall in love simultaneously. Once David realizes that he has fallen for Elise, he is contacted by some mysterious men wearing hats from The Adjustment Bureau who have orders to do anything in their power to keep them apart. They must do this because Elise is not part of his written plan and his destiny to be with her.<br/><br/>(My Comments) This is a story that has a combination of elements that includes science fiction/fantasy/action/suspense with a spiritual and romantic side all thrown into one. The main point of the story is do we have free will or is it our fate to be who we are? The movie ask the question of what would you do if you had to choose between love or professional success? If it were our fate, we don't have a choice. The on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt was done so well that you may think this movie was a romance rather than a science fiction story. Matt's performance in his first love interest movie was done very well. Emily Blunt was mysterious and delightful with her snappy wit and sophisticated repartee. After the movie is over you begin to think about is our life predetermined for us, and maybe we don't have a choice about what path we should take. I know that you will be very suspicious of men who wear hats after seeing this movie. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:45, PG-13) (7/10)"
"moviewizguy","5","6","14","1 March 2011"," Fight for your fate.
","On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas, a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself--the men of The Adjustment Bureau--who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path...or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her.<br/><br/>TAB is a great example of a film with an intriguing storyline (aren't most of Philip K. Dick's material usually are?) which is executed in a mediocre way, and I stress that word to the fullest extent. While watching TAB, I felt very indifferent throughout. There were some random, decent chase scenes here and there and the film has a lot of surprisingly funny scenes, but I never really cared for the characters. I was never really involved with their situation. I just didn't care, and that made my viewing experience a bit exhausting to get through.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the weakest thing about the film is the plot. It's so flimsy, thin, and predictable that you really don't need a feature length film to tell it. After an hour in, the film begins to spin its wheels. It goes on and on and on and the chase scenes (which seem to be added just for the hell of it) get really repetitive. From the third act on, it's just a huge mess. On top of that, the ending is lame as hell. It is probably the definition of deus ex machina. It felt really tacked on which is ironic since it seemed that the reason the film was pushed back from 2010 to a 2011 release was because they had to reshoot the ending. So much for that.<br/><br/>The characters weren't really developed either, even though the talented Matt Damon and Emily Blunt tried their best to elevate the mediocre script. If anything, they saved the film from being a totally forgettable film than it already is. I thought John Slattery added some well needed humor throughout the film, which I didn't expect at all. I really liked his character. On a technical standpoint, it's a mixed bag. The good was the awesome scenery of New York. The bad was the camera focus itself. It felt like the cinematographer had no idea what he was doing. Doubt me? Watch the film and you can see MANY blurry scenes throughout. Talk about a rushed production.<br/><br/>Overall, TAB had huge potential. The story was very interesting to me, although it did remind me a lot of DARK CITY (a much better and effective film, in my opinion). The actors seriously try their best but even they couldn't save the film. As a huge sci-fi fan, I was severely disappointed by it. If you're intrigued, just wait for it on DVD and rent it instead or watch DARK CITY...or even read Philip K. Dick's original short story itself."

","We live in two worlds with usually hidden doors between. One world is unexpectedly complex, powerful and cosmic in an apparently demented way. The second world we have to put up with. It is a world of rote mechanics and faux imagination. <br/><br/>That first world is the world of Phil Dick, something I value and experienced relatively firsthand. The man was a genius. With Agatha Christie, he has had more influence on contemporary, imaginative fiction than any other. <br/><br/>One of his minor but still excellent short stories is the inspiration for this. <br/><br/>The other world is the world of bad filmmakers. Formulas where artists follow a rulebook and we as viewers respond as we are programmed to. Participants in art that dulls rather than sharpens, that puts us more in the groove than out of it. <br/><br/>I recently rewatched Damon in Hereafter. He was something of a miracle there and though simple, the film took us places and he helped. <br/><br/>This. This is scrap paper.

","Saw this at a free viewing beginning of February and it is a movie that you should go and see. It has a great set up on the story although some cheesy lines kind of detract from some of the more pivotal moments. It has some good laughs and also makes you think. Though in the end this movie does the typical Hollywood finish and makes everything tie together and everyone happy which they could have left as a better ending. I was hoping for an ending like Memento's in which the screen darkens and you are just amazed and confused. However, this ended as a happy romance when the two lovers end up together and live happily ever after."

I found myself rooting for the good guys and wishing the baddies to just go away. I realized that Matt Damon is really good at what he does, that the chemistry between his character and that of Emily Blunt worked (in a movie sort of way), and that the adjusters were nothing more than practitioners of a Skinnerian form of tough love. <br/><br/>More than anything else, this was a fun movie to watch; to allow myself to suspend disbelief and let the flick envelop me was refreshing. When I was through watching it on the SyFy channel, I was glad I put up with the fragmentation grenade of advertisements.<br/><br/>Sure, The Adjustment Bureau won't be hailed as a landmark film 20 years from now, but it will, hopefully, sit on a display shelf for future viewers to sample. <br/><br/>I found it worth both my time and my investment of emotion and intellect (all seven brain cells), not something I can often say."

The pseudo-cosmology underlying the story is banal and vague (is it philosophical, theological, theosophical, or just tosh-ological - methinks the latter). It coulda woulda shoulda been a compelling movie but lazy scripting consigns this to the dustbin of movie history - it's a shame because Matt Damon tries hard and the actors are well-cast.

","I'm happy to write about The Adjustment today. <br/><br/>Even though there's a clear crisis going on deep in the cinema industry, we still get jewels for generations to come. And this is one. Why? In part because is written by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report and died in 1982 (just to hold in mind). Simple, artistic, light hearted, clear, and hallelujah with no guns or murderers! With some ingredients resembling Dark City, I find the story very accessible and uplifting, with a nice and tight script (loving its clever dialogs). The casting is great and they all look just right. <br/><br/>The only downside is the ambiguous power the Bureau holds and Matt expressions in some short parts... that may have been directed better (Matt and Emily make a refined match though!). <br/><br/>This is a love story with a kick in the glass of reality, with cool music and perfect pace. The deleted scenes are kind of worth deleting and the bonus parts are not that important except for Emily's hard work on becoming a dancer. I congratulate George Nolfi (big fan since Ocean's 12) for the screenplay and fully recommend this movie, definitely to watch and own."

Unless we're in love. Then it's OK. Cos this is Hollywood.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to bother critiquing the plot. It's completely transparent from the first five minutes - from the premise even. <br/><br/>Insultingly, the 'adjustment bureau' (read: angels) gave humans free will once or twice in history, but we 'chose the dark ages' (sure, that period defined by fundamentalist Christianity) and the holocaust. But when they planned everything for us, we ended up with the enlightenment (and, incidentally, the humanist movement and evolutionary theory).

","What I Think Nolfi uses Philip K. Dick's clever premise to its best advantage, with an effective script, directed well. The principal roles couldn't have been better cast, the suit and hat attire of the Bureau members is just right, and the effects, such as the doors that open into random locations across the city, are seamlessly executed.<br/><br/>It's possible that some viewers, depending upon their religious views, might take offense at The Adjustment Bureau, because its conflict could be interpreted as not only fate versus free will, but faith versus free will. Sometimes a little offense is a good thing, though, because it can lead to thinking.<br/><br/>Putting myself in David's place (as a moviegoer should), I wanted to ask Richardson and his cohorts more questions, and more pointed ones, sooner than the protagonist did. You've asked me to trust you, now tell me why I should. You might want to start by telling me exactly who and what you are. Has anyone even tried to come up with a plan that gets us from A to Z without (bad thing)? If you want my cooperation, you'll explain why there's no other way. Come on, sell me on it, walk me through it. I have a right to that much. It's a compliment to the filmmakers, I think, that I cared enough to want answers before they were provided.<br/><br/>I don't find the film's treatment of Fate as a mystical force to be quite as profound as it's probably intended to be, probably because I'm not big on mystical forces. However as an action-adventure, an intricate romantic fantasy and even as a diverting philosophical exercise, The Adjustment Bureau succeeds.<br/><br/>Why you should see it: You like it when Matt Damon runs around and Emily Blunt has emotions at people. You enjoy mislabeling fantasy as science fiction. You can pretend this is a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada, in which Blunt's character has given up the fashion world for ballet and magically teleports onto the field at Yankee Stadium with Jason Bourne, Senate candidate.<br/><br/>Why you shouldn't see it: You're afraid you'll accidentally use the word ""Chairman"" in church.<br/><br/>--from my review at www.1man365movies.com"

My girlfriend got bored and stole my phone to play bejeweled about 10 minutes in. I wish I would have had the idea first, as to not have to wade through the sea of awful corniness and cringe moments that appeared in front of me. Nothing is really explained the entire film.

They go by their books, keep an eye on people like us and change or modify their lives in case they think it is deviating from the intended direction).

They instantly share a connection before kissing, and Norris leaves her feeling inspired, and makes a landmark speech that will put him into pole position for the next election. The two happen to meet again on a bus, and again the spark is re-ignited. Yet Norris is being tracked by mysterious men in hats who seem to be controlling fate and keeping everything in line with 'the plan' of the big man upstairs, and the couple being together seems to go against this plan. Determined not to lose who he thinks is his true love, Norris defies the suited men, and finds himself watched and chased at every turn.<br/><br/>Adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick, The Adjustment Bureau is a pretty solid idea that is confidently played out, but seems thinly spread out over the course of a feature-length running time. The idea that our fate is being tampered with to keep things 'on course', and that our fate is out of our own hands is something that was done much better in 1999's The Matrix. This film, however, focuses less on the sci-fi aspects and more on the idea of 'true love', as Damon's David Norris is convinced that if something feels so comfortable and right, then it simply must be how things should be. John Slattery and Terence Stamp's suited agents are compelled to feel otherwise, although they don't know why.<br/><br/>If the romantic angle seems all a bit soppy, it's actually more convincingly done than the science fiction. Damon, although not the greatest actor in the world, is certainly likable as always, but it is Emily Blunt that comes out of the film most impressively. Her sweetness and laid-back quirks combined with her natural beauty makes for a love interest worth caring for, and you can understand the lengths that David goes to be with her. The magic hats, doors leading to anywhere, time freezing and fate maps are certainly quite interesting, but are so casually executed that often just seem silly, although these shady characters are played well by The Hurt Locker's Anthony Mackie, the ever-reliable Terence Stamp, and John Slattery, who I'm a big fan of from TV's Mad Men.<br/><br/>After 90 minutes of romance and the odd foot chase, I was expecting a thrilling climax that would perhaps throw in the odd surprise or two as well. But what I experienced was a half-arsed effort that rarely got the pulse racing, and a final scene that could be easily described as cop- out. It almost rendered everything I had seen prior to it pointless. However, this is still an enjoyable film with likable performances all round, and an intriguing idea at its heart, but very far from the best Dick adaptation. <br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","The Adjustment Bureau exists to make sure everything happens according to Plan explains Richardson (Slattery). David Norris (Damon) sees these people making adjustments on fellow workers, runs, is chased and captured. They explain to David what will happen to him if he tells anyone what he saw. They also tell him that he cannot be with Elise (Blunt), the woman he just met. It's not part of the Plan. What to do? What to do? <br/><br/>So now I get it. I now know why the girl I asked to marry me did not, could not, would not. It all makes sense now. Also, I know the reason I do not, can not and will not ever win a big money lottery. Yes, it is all very sad, but also very clear. Now I get it. There are people out there helping us make the right decisions. Wait a minute, that can't be right. We have free will. Right! Don't we? Tough Room!<br/><br/>This is a highly entertaining and engaging story. I especially like the honest dialogue from all parties. The pacing was just right. The cinematography was outstanding. Could have used a little more humor. There was some, but more wouldn't have hurt. The men of the Adjustment Bureau were like the Men In Black, except they were notable for their hats. The hats are very important. <br/><br/>The music near the end when David is running was exceptional. I was toe tapping to beat the band and I never do that. <br/><br/>This was a very creative effort. I mean this story is big, bigger than inventing or reinventing the wheel. See? Really big. That is, if you believe. Until the day we die, we may and will ask ourselves: predestination or free will. What do we have? Huh?<br/><br/>The acting was perfect due to the actors, of course, but mostly, it was the dialogue that made everything seamless. I was also most impressed by Anthony Mitchell who played Harry (one of them) who tries to help David from time to time. I liked the way he knew what his job was, yet you could see in his eyes that he had reservations. Very good. And, Terrance Stamp as Thompson, one of the chiefs of that Bureau, what can I say? He is perfect under any circumstances. Emily Blunt: was that her really doing those dance moves like she had no bones in her body? Outstanding. And, when John Slattery talks, I believe every word he utters. As for Matt Damon, he is finally getting his due other than the Jason Bourne roles, although I wouldn't mind another. <br/><br/>Anyway, now I know. It all makes sense to me now.They are out there making sure..<br/><br/>Violence: Not really. OK, a car accident only. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb was heard late in the movie."

","It was inevitable that there would be comparisons with The Adjustment Bureau and last year's big hit Inception. Both are about changing time , perception and fate but there is one big difference between both of the films and that is that The Adjustment Bureau is better .<br/><br/>This film is not complicated at all , despite being far fetched and at no time do you think "" What the hell is going on here"" as i did with Inception. Sure , it does not have the fantastic special affects but to be honest , affects are not good when the plot is a mess.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a politician who meets a beautiful woman and it's love at first sight. The problem is the Bureau can't let it progress because it's not part of the plan. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed Matt Damon's performance as well as Emily Blunt's and Anthony Mackie's . It's the kind of film that does not patronise the audience with a plot that needs several viewing to understand it and it's not too long either.<br/><br/>Well worth watching."

","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) ***1/2 Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, John Slattery, Anthony Mackie, Terence Stamp, Michael Kelly. Crackling good Philip K. Dick adaptation with a politico (Damon at his low-key best) finding himself the unwitting pawn of a phalanx of the titular 'men-in-hats' who control select persons' fates and futures makes things difficult for the choice in his career climbing ambitions for the love of a beautiful dancer (eternally beguiling Blunt) – wherever the chips may lie. Trippy and provocative with its emotional core stripped to some serious on screen chemistry for the couple in peril and the ramifications of Dick's freewill vs. fascistic state is wonderfully put to task by filmmaker George Nolfi who also did the clever adaptation – a decidedly romantic ""1984"" if you will."
"MovieManMenzel","7","2","3","7 March 2011"," Emily Blunt & Matt Damon fall in love and question their destiny in ""The Adjustment Bureau""
","David Morris (Matt Damon) is running for office in New York. After a shocking photo is revealed to the press, David realizes that his dream of taking office as New York's next Governor isn't going to happen. While prepping for his last big speech to congratulate the winner of the election, he runs into a woman named Elise (Emily Blunt) who changes everything. Elise makes David feel something that he has never felt before and changes his whole outlook on life. This is when the Adjustment Bureau steps in to make sure that Elise and David never cross paths again. An interesting film about destiny ensues...<br/><br/>I have been seeing advertisements for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" for what seems like over a year now. The film was originally slated to be released in 2010 but the film went through some re-edits including some alterations with the ending. Needless to say, I was really worried when it was pushed back for so long. Normally in Hollywood, when a movie gets its release date moved so much, its a bad sign. I am happy to report, however, that the film is actually pretty solid and lives up to it's solid marketing campaign.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are the stars of the film and the two of them work great together. They have solid on-screen chemistry and seem like they really enjoyed working with one another. Damon's character David seemed like President Obama when he was running for office. Damon is skilled at playing characters like the one he played here. He plays the smart yet action packed role perfectly and has done so in several other films. Emily Blunt is great in the film as well. I enjoyed her humor and she has solid on screen presence. Her character is fun yet intelligent, which really made Elise such a likable character. She just felt real, like someone who you would meet in real life.<br/><br/>The other supporting actors were terrific as well. There are so many smaller roles in this film that I probably won't name them all but will focus on a few of the main ones. Anthony Mackie who played agent Mitchel, played a really solid character. It was interesting seeing him go through the emotions and fighting the idea of whether or not he should help David. John Slattery and Terence Stamp who also played agents in the film did a good job trying to warn David about adjusting his future. These supporting stars all helped to build the suspense in the film.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is probably the story, which oddly enough is also it's biggest flaw. The idea of an organization that controls our faith and destiny is an interesting one. The film makes its audience wonder about the events that occur on a regular basis in ones life and asks the question was it part of a bigger plan or was it destiny? That idea alone is what makes this film interesting from start to finish. The audience is always trying to unravel the mystery behind what's going to happen next. We want to know how and why this organization is controlling the faith of David and Elise.<br/><br/>With that being said, the movie's idea is great but the script leaves the audience wanting more. Its one of those movies where the idea is intriguing but requires its audience to shut off their thinking caps. I will begin explaining this with the simple fact that David is running for major office, yet he is never surrounded by body guards or security. That seems odd from the get go. Then this organization gets introduced and why they pick him isn't really flesh out. Then the idea of going through doors isn't really discussed with enough detail either. The ending, while I did enough it, left me wanting more. I just felt that the story's premise was a great one especially for a film but it just wasn't intelligently executed. The story was more for the non-thinkers and I guess for a Hollywood type film, I shouldn't knock it because at least it was a creative story.<br/><br/>In closing, I ready did enjoy ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and thought it was a solid flick. The story will really grab the audience's attention and the performances by Blunt and Damon will have you at the edge of your seat and rooting for them at the same time. Some may argue that the end result was one that was too clichéd but I think in terms of the story here, it really made sense. I think even in life as much as we don't want to admit it, all we really want is companionship and the film really goes the distance to rely that message. Sure, it should have spent a little less time with that message and more about the bureau itself and I will not try to deny that. This film could have been a masterpiece if the storyline was better explained. I realize most people don't like thinking when they see a movie but I think nowadays with film's like ""Inception"" making big bucks, I think a few movies a year that challenge its audience really would be great. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" had the potential of being that type of film but instead it took the turn off your brain route instead. At the end of the day, it was a good flick with some flaws but I really did enjoy it from start to finish even though I had to turn off my brain to do so!<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" was a 7 out of 10."
"LiaskosAlex","9","1","1","21 June 2020"," What a movie!!
","Even though of course and it could have been better or could have lasted a little bit more, i have to admit that it was breathtaking. It shows the war between freedom and control. How far should each part reach and if balance between them is the answer to a better society. Control runs through secrets and adjustments, and freedom through free will, AKA ""randomness"" maybe..
But the problem i sense with free will is that humans aren't geniuses and gods, we make mistakes in silly things, so the decisions we make in our everyday life must be based on the things and small details we interact with all the time and not in some imaginary and unknown power, that by the way we have created it's meaning. It's like believing in a god, a concept we have created and we embrace without giving an explanation.Thinking and imagining is the most amazing and ''out of this world'' thing we can do, but when it comes to making it something real without any proof, then it's just like behaving as a child, without thinking hard!
We must let our imagination free, but not force it becoming something real without any scientific proof.."

","This is really great movie, especially when you consider the short story it's based on. as a screenwriter myself, i know how hard it is to take a short story concept and make a feature film and the filmmakers did a great job. I'm kind of appalled at some of the criticisms of this movie. someone called it a romantic comedy. i didn't laugh once. i don't know what you think is so funny. romantic drama, maybe, but it's really a sci fi film with a romantic element. imdb just isn't happy until a movie is 'inception' and you have to watch it 30 times to understand what just happened. someone made a comment about the writer of the short story and i looked up his writing. He really is one of the most influential writers of the last half century and a brilliant writer. i think his genius is underestimated. anyway, this is a really enjoyable film that i was glad i could watch once, maybe twice only, to understand. I find it's not enjoyable to watch a movie you don't understand but hey maybe that's just me. Matt Damon is a great actor but we know this already. Emily Blunt also does a great job as his ultimately confused love interest. Their chemistry is really what holds the movie together. you're really rooting for them and feel bad when things don't go well. I wouldn't call this movie AMAZING, but the negative reviews make me wanna offset them. story 8/10, plus chemistry add 1 point plus everyone else's negativity=10. definitely recommend."

","A short story by Philip K Dick titled ""Adjustment Team"" (1954) was freely adapted here by Bourne screenwriter George Nolfi who turned it into a glitzy futurist conspiracy thriller.

"TheLittleSongbird","6","1","1","31 October 2017"," Fighting for fate
","The fascinating premise, that there are some talented actors on board and the generally positive word of mouth were my reasons for seeing 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Seeing it, there are no regrets watching it but at the same time it was a little frustrating. It is an interesting and decent film, but had real potential to be a great one and could have been much more.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is a charismatic presence and commands the film with ease without ever trying too hard. Emily Blunt has a genuine winning charm as one often finds with Blunt, her character is not quite as interesting as Damon's but Blunt makes it work. The two have great chemistry together, it really sparkles. In fact it is the romance that comes off the best and most consistently, being where 'The Adjustment Bureau' really comes alive. Anthony Mackie is suitably mysterious while also quite likable in the film's latter stages.<br/><br/>John Slattery really looks the part and has a lot of fun in a suitably shady role while Terence Stamp brings some sinister dignity and authority to a rather severely underwritten character that appears in the film too late somewhat. On the acting front, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is very good.<br/><br/>As it is too with the way it's made, suitably gritty and slick with some inventive moments and an audacious style. The locations are chosen well and used cleverly. The music score has a good mix of understatement and thrilling pulsation. The first half has a lot of very interesting and smart ideas that leaves one gripped enough to carry on and see further how it goes and there is a good deal of fun and a few suspenseful jolts to be had.<br/><br/>For all those great things, 'The Adjustment Bureau' would have been an even better film if it had done more with the premise. The romance is the most well done and memorable element of it and the rest doesn't live up. It's intriguing and entertaining, but the second half suffers from playing it too safe and having too many ideas needing to be tied up, meaning that potentially great ideas are not fully expanded upon (even the whole basic premise doesn't feel fully cooked).<br/><br/>Pacing does get stodgy, as a result of the lack of risk-taking and struggles with keeping things probable and consistent. Despite the conflict being well performed the threat feels lacking because it is handled in a way that's under-cooked and somewhat repetitive which dilutes the suspense quite badly. The more under-explored 'The Adjustment Bureau' gets, the more confusing, tonally muddled and far-fetched it gets too. This is especially true with the ending, which to me is down there with the decade's ""what the heck"" film endings.<br/><br/>Overall, has a lot to recommend but there was a lot more to the film that never fully emerged. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

This is not science fiction. This movie is really a documentary. The movie shows you how everything is planned and some things are not coincidences at all. It is interesting the fact that the story (originally written by Philip K. Dick) was first published on 1954.

","The Adjustment Bureau (2011)<br/><br/>A fun and funny and farcical romp about fate and love. The Bureau is a layer of men— quasi angels—who watch over mere humans and guide their futures. The center of attention is Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) who encounters a blip in the system. And helping him along (or not) is a young woman he meets twice by accident, Elise (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>The rules are not very clear here, even though they get explained a couple of times. The Bureau men (and they are only men) seem to have unlimited powers at times (moving the floor to trip a running Norris) and other times are helplessly running to try to catch up with him. Then they reappear far ahead. There is a trick about going through doors (rather like ""Monsters Inc."") but sometimes there are no doors and the men pop up here and there.<br/><br/>So you can't take this seriously and logically at all. Just go with the flow. Like the stricture that this huge god-plan, mapped in little notebooks, goes all to hell if two people fall in love. Or more accurately, kiss like mad. Remember that trick when the world is against you. <br/><br/>The movie works and will make you wonder and laugh and feel good despite its internal flaws. The main reason (for me) is the truly natural on screen chemistry and rapport of the two leads. It's as if they are hitting it off as we watch, really smiling and delivering clever comebacks with great timing. It's worth watching for Damon and Blunt above all."

I would also call it action-ish without breaking form and going all over the top with explosions and CGI. There is a fantastic, on foot chase scene towards the end. The love story was well done too, believable as was 'David's' reaction to learning of the adjustment bureau. I really liked Anthony Mackie who played the adjuster with a heart.<br/><br/>The story follows rising politician David Norris, who learns that his life (and that of space and time in general) is and has been adjusted in order to keep him away from a beautiful dancer -the love of his life.

It's a chase film with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt being pursued by people (albeit sci-fi baddies rather than moral government agents) and trying to sort the mess out.<br/><br/>If you like chase films or sci-fi, give it a go.

","In my mind, Philip K. Dick is pretty much the greatest science fiction author ever. From his pen we've received an onslaught of works that have been spun into classic movies: Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report are just a few examples. Recently, his story of an up- and-coming Senatorial candidate who finds himself the observer of men who carefully organize mankind's existence so that it pans out in very specific ways was released on Blu-ray/DVD. It's nicely directly and features some solid performances, but the screenplay is full of holes—so many, in fact, that it bears asking whether or not the thing was even finished when it ended up in the hands of director George Nolfi.<br/><br/>As indicated, The Adjustment Bureau is—for the most part—science fiction. One might classify it as a fantasy, though elements of both are present. More than anything, though, it's a love story. When the previously mentioned politician is prevented from carrying out a relationship with a girl he bumped to after losing his most recent election bid, he does everything he can to defy the ""powers that be."" Our protagonist feels driven (by nothing more complex than deep-seeded love) to spend his life with a girl he'd met only once, even after he's informed that his ""plan"" calls for him to assume much higher duties that don't involve said romantic interest (he is, in fact, scheduled to one day become President). Mr. Damon wants none of this, however, if he can't have the girl.<br/><br/>And that's the plot. Damon's character darts around NYC, eluding obstacles placed along his route by the trench coat men of the enigmatic Bureau, occasionally exchanging dialogue with a rogue agent who believes the whole thing is a faulty endeavor. The philosophical and religious explorations related to free will are certainly thought-provoking, but these are never mined to their full extent. Likewise, we're never given any concrete information about what the Bureau really is (and who its members really are). Are they spiritual entities? Aliens? Trans- dimensional beings? We never know, and these questions end up being more burdensome than any grander subtext that the screenwriters tried to weave into the script.<br/><br/>A lot of people would likely say that worrying about the origins of the Bureau is criminal, as that's not really the focus of the film. I'd respond by saying there's some truth to that, but the minimalist philosophical dabbling of the story coupled with the ""yeah, right"" factor that ultimately arises from the presence of the all-knowing men in black is too problematic to ignore."
"alexjames-rager","6","1","1","9 September 2012"," A Tale of Two Halves
","This isn't necessarily a bad film, but it does indeed suffer from a lack of directorial discipline. The first half of the film, though riddled with fanatical implausibilities, is thoroughly entertaining and intelligently engaging. Nevertheless, this promising first hour is all but squandered in a second half plagued by silly expedients and laughable plot twists. In my opinion, the entire second half of the film felt rushed. For example, the acting, which had hitherto in the film enhanced the believability of narrative action, fell off entirely. The last fifteen (or so) minutes of the film are directed with such a sense of slipshod nonchalance that one can't help but feel like they're watching an entirely different film. The saving grace for the film is, in my opinion, the star power of Matt Damon coupled with a captivating first hour."
"arginnon","9","1","1","4 May 2012"," Unexpectedly well done
","This film surprised me. I was expecting something completely different, but it was a good surprise. The thing I instantly noticed was the truly remarkable photography. The film was beautifully shot, the amazing John Toll did a superb job. He is a great cinematographer and absolutely deserved his two previous Oscar's and needs to win another if not more. The editing and the music also stood out.<br/><br/>The story was very interesting, and I liked the way it was done too. I haven't read the original short story, but I think the script was rather good. The actors also did a good job, I especially liked Terence Stamp. Oh, and Anthony Mackie surprised me with his appearance, I didn't expect to see him. Matt Damon was good too, but Emily Blunt played him off I think.<br/><br/>The story is not the of the simple kind which I am used to when watching American movies nowadays. A troubled, but popular New York state representative, David Norris (Matt Damon) meets the woman of his dreams, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the men's room. Their ways depart, and David doesn't even know her name. A few months later they meet on a bus. Elise gives David her phone number. It turns out that some people, very important people don't want them to be together.<br/><br/>I liked the film, but it wasn't the greatest."

","An ambitious NY politician, David Norris (Matt Damon) has two chance encounters with a beautiful dancer (Emily Blunt) who inspires him to continue with his faltering campaign. But he rapidly discovers a group of men who are intent on manipulating this love affair, to their own ends. They are the Adjustment Bureau. David learns that his destiny is not with the woman, even though he is certain she belongs to him. The men of the Bureau are nothing less than manipulators of humanity. They possess superpowers, using special interactive maps to pursue & intercept their subjects. They instruct David that any attempt to meet her again could have calamitous consequences for both. However, David has resources of his own, and is determined to find her, though he only knows her first name - Elise. So begins a cat-and-mouse game between David and the Bureau. The agent detailed to follow David, Harry (Anthony Mackie) seems to have mixed feelings about his task, and is far more sympathetic than Agent Richardson (John Slattery). We eventually discover why. But when things get serious, an altogether more sinister senior officer, Thompson (Terence Stamp) is called in to put an end to the affair once and for all.<br/><br/>At the heart of this intriguing sci-fi thriller is a bittersweet love story, played out with great delicacy and panache by Matt Damon and his co-star Emily Blunt. I would go so far as to say that the mounting intensity of the scenes between them, is what makes this movie a cut above the ordinary. Damon is always watchable, but Blunt is a real revelation. Will they, won't they? A good romance, and a good thriller, always keep us guessing right to the end."
"clarek1975","8","1","1","24 January 2012"," Surprisingly meaningful Sci -Fi, love story
","I was expecting The Adjustment Bureau to be dark and sinister, instead it turned out to be a meaningful cross – genre, uplifting love story which wasn't very sinister at all; which leads us to question the choices we make and events of chance or fate that adjust our 'plan' every day.<br/><br/>The part Sci-Fi, part love story between Senator elect Norris and contemporary dancer Elise starts with a chance meeting in a men's room; not so curious when we find the free-spirited gal is gate-crashing a party. The chemistry of this first encounter and the following charming, witty and convincing chance encounters immediately elevate our belief in the romance and allows us to invest care in our would be lovers from the start. This makes The Adjustment Bureau work best as a love story; Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are great together as the beautiful, but thankfully unpolished and believable love-birds.<br/><br/>Further events of chance, fate and intervention by ""the people who make sure things go according to plan"" conspire to pull apart and push our lovers together. <br/><br/>The inevitable head scratching and guesswork starts when we cross genres and first meet 'Mad men's' John Slattery and Anthony Mackie as the initially one dimensional chase-giving men from the bureau; tasked to ""nudge"" Norris back in the right direction. The later entrance of the superb Terrence stamp as the quite ruthless 'Thompson' brings some overdue peril and even grander revelations about ""the appearance of free will"". <br/><br/>It is here where this hybrid could have gone very wrong, but first time director Nolfi manages to succeed in the mixing of Sci-fi and love story as he ultimately does both very well; binding the two with important thought provoking themes, engaging and often charming screenplay and strong characterisation; in particular Mackies' portrayal as the ""case officer"" with a heart.<br/><br/>Comedy is provided curiously and possibly unintentionally at times by the suits of The Bureau. Often haphazard, often just negligent in their supposed really important roles, they are one minute virtually superhuman, the next quite inept. Either way, their human like frailties makes for some genuinely funny moments and also leads us to care for them too, when they too question their own sense of right and wrong and the choices they make. <br/><br/>Director and screenwriter George Nolfi sets a solid pace throughout and keeps our attention with some well-timed, but slightly predictable reveals and solid direction, with some beautifully framed shots. The neat score compliments the on screen action well. <br/><br/>Fate, chance and the question of how much free will we are truly afforded run through 'The Adjustment Bureau' and it is these themes that really give meaning to our protagonists struggle to evade the supposed plan. Every choice has always been and always will be of consequence, every act has repercussions and events can often be fateful. Even random chance events have great resonance, chance seemingly being far more influential than any supposed predetermined plan. The film and the mixed genre experiment works because of these themes as we too begin to question for ourselves and not just follow what transpires on screen. Everything we do causes a ""ripple"" and you will be left with one big question – ""24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case – coincidence?"" <br/><br/>I WAS expecting The Adjustment Bureau to be dark. I am glad to say that the lighter, uplifting and meaningful film I got, rather than the expected sinister one (suggested by menacingly toned pre-release posters and trailers) was in the end; welcome. This perhaps made for a more enjoyable ride than a more formulaic, dark figured men in raincoats (been done before) chase movie. Not to say The Adjustment Bureau sometimes didn't follow a well-trodden formula and isn't without flaws; It was executed well and just balances slightly better as a charming meaningful love story; smartly tied together by the things that matter to us all."
"Eumenides_0","7","1","1","13 January 2012"," Romantic, funny, but didn't meet my expectations
","George Nolfi's directorial debut delivers a lot in terms of acting, little in terms of innovation, and demonstrates that at least he knows how to put together a movie. The Adjustment Bureau, supported by a solid cast, flows with little bumps but leaves its major weakness for the finale.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, who has given a string of good performances lately, doesn't disappoint in his role of David Norris, a politician running for Senate. Watching him are the agents of the Adjustment Bureau, the people who make sure things run according to plan. They have monitored Mankind since its dawn and have the mission of taking it to a brighter future. David matters to them because his path through life can lead to great improvements. Unfortunately they fail to make a small adjustment in his life and he meets a ballerina called Elise (Emily Blunt). It seems that by being with her, David will never feel the need to fill the emptiness of his life with politics and so she must be removed so he can pursue his career. But David, who discovers their existence almost by chance, is determined to fight the bureaucratic embodiment of fate to be with the woman of his dreams.<br/><br/>As I compare the good and the bad in this movie I'm left convinced that there is more to enjoy about it than there is to complain about it. But sadly complaints exist. Let's start with the agents. First of all I love the fact that the AB isn't the typical super-secret omnipotent organization. The agents are blunderers like your average public functionary; they're not good with improvisation (too used to rules and rigid plans), and they're overworked. If Richardson (John Slattery) is to be believed, they're paid. But they're probably underpaid. They're just guys doing their job and it shows in their personalities.<br/><br/>But the agents suffer from what afflicts typical super-powerful bad guys: vaguely-defined powers. They can freeze people in time, but they never use that on David once in the movie. They have telekinetic powers but they never make much use of that either. And those fedoras they use? Knock them off and you depower the agent. Incidentally, one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie is when David gets hold of one of those magic fedoras. ""Sir, he has a hat!"" cries a panicked agent. This movie is not without its delightful levity.<br/><br/>Although the screenplay is weak when it comes to defining the agents' powers, it's surprisingly strong during the seduction/flirtation scenes between Damon and Blunt. The lines the two leads exchange overflow with wit, charm and tenderness, and convince the viewer that their love truly is special and worth challenging the power of fate for.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast delivers solid performances: Michael Kelly; Anthony Mackie who plays Harry, an agent who goes rogue to help Damon's character; Slattery, who brings some deadpan humour to the movie; and Terence Stamp, who plays Thompson, the main antagonist, the agent who's called when all other agents fail.<br/><br/>The movie is technically good. It's worth noting that the director of cinematography in charge is John Toll, whose past credits include The Thin Red Line and Braveheart. The movie is well shot and possesses stylistic coherence. I guess at some point someone must have asked: how do we transmit the idea of the vastness of an omnipresent organisation monitoring the whole world? Of one single man fighting it? The movie is mostly shot in widescreen and vertical lines (the gigantic headquarters of the AB in Manhattan), and most scenes take place in huge, long, empty halls and corridors. There's a feeling of magnitude in the movie, a feeling that Mankind is very small thing and that something powerful looms over it.<br/><br/>The special effects and editing also do a fine job of keeping the movie fast-paced and exciting. One of the many powers the agents have is their ability to teleport through doors. Imagine you open a public bathroom door and you end up inside a football stadium. The agents use this power to move faster than other people and it's arguably the most ostentatious display of visual effects in the movie. Otherwise the movie is very subdued.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the conflict between free will and predetermination life in the movie. That's the philosophical question that holds it together. But I personally found something more interesting to chew on. There's a dialogue between Thompson and David about the AB existing to lead Mankind to a better future. When they stepped down during the apogee of the Roman Empire we had the Dark Ages. After the AB stepped down again in 1910, we had WWI, WII, the Holocaust, you get the picture. Without them we're screwed.<br/><br/>Let's put aside that the fact that things weren't so great during the Roman Empire (slavery, no rights for women, brutal wars, deranged emperors, etc.), and that a lot of great things were invented between the two world wars. The movie also ignores the morality of the AB agents' actions. We deposit our power in the hands of politicians because we hope they will know how to make good decisions for all of us. It's out decision to do so. No one's voted for the AB, but in the context of the movie they haven't really done anything harmful to Mankind, in fact they're keeping its destruction at bay, barely. Bur is it OK for them to decide the lives of others or not? That's a question worth thinking about, I believe. I don't think the movie even imagined people asking it, so casually does it throw it into the air and then forgets it, unlike the clichéd free will vs. determination dilemma, over which the movie takes a clear stance in favour of free of will, of course. <br/><br/>This is something I wish the movie could have explored."

","If your looking for Bourne meets Inception then you wont find it here.<br/><br/>The story is of a man trying to change his destiny and win the girl he is not supposed to be with.<br/><br/>Its has quite a slow place but it is a very good and original film. There is solid acting as usual from the fantastic Damon and Emily does a good job as his love interest. Though the film is original and a very good watch it isn't a classic which is a shame because all the parts are there if there was a bit more action and a bit more focus on the hidden world it would have been better. Worth a watch but certainly can't be compared to Bourne or Inception."
"ETVdreamer","8","1","1","19 July 2011"," An intriguing and thought-provoking movie.
","This movie is predicated upon the age-old debate of whether life is predetermined or left to our free will. It also offers the supposition that perhaps life is a compromise between the two concepts: We are able to control the seemingly inconsequential aspects of our lives, but any significant choices we make are decided by a higher being. This higher being is of course called God, or by any other name given to Him by other cultures.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" questions whether the adjusters (angels) and by implication, God, has the moral right to intervene and direct human destiny. Does the end justify the means? Should a desired outcome take precedence over free will?<br/><br/>The film, however, ends on a positive note...that free will can be exercised by one's determination and that even God himself is willing to make compromises.<br/><br/>I found the movie entertaining and thought provoking. It balances the action and philosophical sequences well. Highly recommended."

","Matt Damon's new movie outing is a science fiction romance telling the tale of a young charismatic and slightly unorthodox congressman David Norris (Damon) who is running for the United States Senate. During his campaign he meets Elise (Blunt) a beautiful contemporary dancer who bestows great honesty and wisdom upon him in the men's toilets (it's where all the pearls of wisdom are discovered) before their obvious attraction boils over, resulting in them locking lips with each other....how romantic. Thank goodness their tryst is interrupted by Norris' best friend and campaign manager and it seems without a name they are destined never to meet again. Later, however Norris is on his way to his new job working with his best friend Charlie the campaign manager he happens to sit next to the delightful Elise again and the attraction is still very much apparent. But alas this meeting was not destined to take place, a lone suited man in the park was to spill coffee on Mr Norris ensuring that he would need to return home and change his shirt thus meaning he would not see Elise again. Soon after arriving at his new employers he bears witness to an unexplained event, strangely dressed men in Charlie's office seem to be performing odd things to his uncharacteristically still friend and when he is seen he is chased and promptly caught. He awakens in another realm (masquerading as a warehouse) and discovers that the real world, his world is influenced and manipulated by the shadowy figures in the background. Life's a stage and they are the stage managers, prop guys and theatre directors. Norris is introduced to the Adjustment Bureau a group of celestial like beings who guided by the Chairman (you never see him....hint hint) help keep the human race from descending into anarchy and chaos. What ensues is a battle of wills of epic proportions as Norris fights to be with the woman he loves even if fate seems to have another design for him. This is an intriguing notion for a movie and you won't be surprised to learn (actually you might be) that the original was penned by the master of future visionary Phillip K Dick the writer of the original story behind 'Blade Runner'. This adaptation is clever as it infers that there are forces at work that ultimately determine what we do and were our lives will lead us and free will has nothing to do with it. Ironically Norris complains to Elise about having his life controlled, from everything he says, to the clothes and shoes he wears which is itself some measure of control. It is when she inspires him, during their first encounter, to be honest and true that he is set on a new path. However a path is already pre-ordained for him, but his love and no doubt rebellious temperament will not allow him to conform and he fights to stay with Elise despite the predictions of impending disaster from the Bureau members if he chooses to stay with her. This is a clever and well thought out script from the writer of the 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and it is directed with confidence and conviction. The leads exude an effervescent chemistry which draws you in and makes you care for their predicament. The members of the bureau are excellent with Anthony Mackie ('The Hurt Locker') performing his role with a quiet but awesome wisdom beyond his years. It was genius for George Nolfi to construct the story around a politician who rebels from one level of control only to be subjected to another. The religious undertones are ambiguous but at the same time clear. Are the Adjustment Bureau agents in fact angels and the Chairman in fact God...that fact is deliberately left unclear and it is for you to decide this conundrum for yourself. Life is not entirely in your hands, there are just too many variables, surely there has to be some supreme being controlling your life from behind the curtain doesn't there?? You either embrace that undeniable fact or try your damnedest to change your destiny....will love conquer all??? Check out this mesmerising romantic thriller and judge for yourself. 'The Adjustment Bureau is on general release now and I implore you to check it out!"
"patrickmbrame","9","1","1","4 April 2011"," A unconventional love story that is thought-provoking, well acted, and extremely entertaining.
","The Adjustment Bureau stars Matt Damon, as David Norris, an up and coming congressman of New York, and Emily Blunt, as Elise Sellas, a rising professional dancer. The story follows David, who is in the middle of campaigning for a Senator seat for New York, and on the night of the election he finds that he has lost and must deliver his concession speech. When he stops into the bathroom he unexpectedly runs into Elise, who is hiding from security because she was caught crashing a wedding in the same hotel, they immediately feel something strong for each other. We are also introduced to the mysterious group of men that are always watching behind the scenes, with notebooks, business clothes from the 60s, and most importantly a fedora. Without going into too much detail about who they are and what they do, because that would really ruin a pretty fun and intriguing part of the whole story, they essentially make sure that everything goes as planned (Every person has a certain path, and their job is to make sure everyone stays on course. There are strong religious themes here however the film does a pretty good job I think of addressing those themes). However because of a mistake from one of their own, David is shown their world and was never suppose to see Elise after the night of his concession speech thus creating the motivating drive of the film.<br/><br/>George Nolfi has shown that he can both write and direct, mostly direct, an intriguing, well made film with power house stars like Damon and Blunt. His direction of New York City is very well done, and he really excels with the many on-foot chase sequences throughout the film. Where he really shows his strengths however is in the dialogue between Damon and Blunt. It's extremely witty and humorous, with a touch of romance and his words are brought to life brilliantly by his two lead actors. All the while he intertwines the love story with the science fiction aspect of the Adjustment Bureau and the mystery surrounding this powerful, all seeing, all controlling group. <br/><br/>The cast is excellent and I can't picture anyone else in the roles of David Norris or Elise Sellas. The simple dialogue scenes between these two are just as entertaining, if not better, than the suspenseful and/or action packed scenes throughout the film. Damon is great, but no real surprise there. And Blunt was right up there with him, now if that's because I'm in awe of her sheer beauty with an accent to top it off, I cant really say, but I thought she was great none the less. <br/><br/>Overall it's a very good film and one of the better stories that have come along since Inception (unfortunately Nolfi can't be credited for an original story here because he based it on Philip K. Dick's short story). My only real problem with the film that I didn't like was the ending, which is pretty unfortunate because up until that point it was almost flawless. It's a bit anti climatic, however I can't see how you would end it any other way and have it still work with the overall story. Bottom line though, the film really makes you think about the idea of fate versus choice and if we really have a say in our future. Whether you believe in a higher power or not, these ideas are prevalent and will always be an important topic to discuss and the film does a pretty good job of asking questions and giving some answers while also leaving enough open for discussion. All in all it's the perfect film for all audience's, both male and female, young or old and one that relies more on it's acting and story than it's special effects like most film now a days, and that in itself is something worth seeing."
"gortx","Null","1","1","3 April 2011"," Interesting if low key P.K. Dick SF adaptation
","********* Mild possible spoilers ********** A pretty decent low key SF film. Nothing great, nothing earth shattering. But, if you want a break from all the action movies masquerading as SF, it's worth catching.<br/><br/>While based on a (public domain) short story - ADJUSTMENT TEAM by P.K.Dick (read it at wikimedia commons), it's a pretty loose adaptation. The Dick story has much in common with Jack Finney's BODY SNATCHERS which came out just after this tale (something was in the air).<br/><br/>Rather than just being a straight out adaptation, BUREAU tosses in elements of 1984, BRAZIL, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and those 50s stories of secret agents in black hats. In keeping with the low key approach, the relationship between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt (and the one between Damon and his ""Bureaucrat"" played well by Anthony Mackie) is emphasized over the larger SF elements.<br/><br/>**Mild Spoiler** That's largely a good thing for Blunt is so engaging that you can believe that a man would literally risk his future to be with her (hey, it's in the trailer).<br/><br/>I've had my eye on Blunt's work ever since her breakout role in MY SUMMER OF LOVE. She has an intelligence and sparkle that isn't really matched by the more stolid Damon (and Damon's accent is much more Bostonian than of Brooklyn where his character is supposedly born and bred from). Damon does OK, but it's a lopsided match on screen. Further, the film falters when it tries to explain the nuts and bolts of the Adjustment operation. Better to be ambiguous than to bore the viewer in this case.<br/><br/>The film's ending seems a bit pat, but, somehow, still works due in no small part to Blunt's performance. Rarely, have I seen an actor pull off the tricky balance between bewilderment and resolve.<br/><br/>Worth seeing if you 'adjust' your expectations. If you are a fan of low key SF films from the 60s like the 3 British DAMNED films, THE MIND BENDERS, CHARLY etc., then this is for you to seek out."

","I just saw the Adjustment Bureau, starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. I liked it a lot. It had good performances, an intriguing story and great cinematography. The color was good, the camera shots were creative, and the angles were obtuse. New York never looked so good. This film, directed by Gorge Nolfi (Bourn Ultimatum and Oceans 12), was based on a short story by science fiction great, Philip K. Dick. This was vintage Dick. The film had a vintage feel to it too even though it was supposed to take place in modern New York. It could have taken place in the 50's or 60's. The costumes were no help on terms of dating the piece, but he Adjustment Bureaucrat wore suits with skinny lapels, thin ties, and narrow brimmed fedoras. They did not carry electronic hand-held devices as you might expect, but rather books, or manuals with mysterious diagrams that pulsed electrically from time to time.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a love story of two people who were fated then ""unfated"" to be together. This was a case of two people who fell in love and that love was so strong that they were ""ruined"" for anyone else. I hate it when that happens. They had to exert their free will over their predestination for everything to work out for them.<br/><br/>This was a great movie to watch and I give it ""7 Bells."""
"rossables19","8","1","1","29 March 2011"," The Adjustment Bureau - Essential Viewing!!
","The Adjustment Bureau - A hard film to stick in a particular genre. It's a Romantic Science Fiction film that deals focuses on fate and idea that a power out with our human control is manipulating events and deciding our destiny. Essentially this film is a love story between a hot shot politician (Matt Damon) and a up and coming ballet dancer (Emily Blunt) both on their way to greatness. This film works so well due to chemistry that Damon and Blunt have on screen. Dealing with such controversial concepts such as God and Fate is challenging to convey to an audience, but George Nolfi's seems to have managed to present these themes in a smart and digestible way. So far this is my favorite film of the year and I would give it a (B+) - Highly Recommended!!"

","First I must say that the trailers make the movie look like something it is not. I'm not saying it was a terrible movie, though if you're going for an action packed, sci-fi thriller, this isn't probably it.<br/><br/>The film starts off slowly, taking around 20 minutes to get into the interesting plot which the remainder of the film follows. There are some scenes which really suck you in, but they only last for short periods of time and after they finish the movie becomes dull again.<br/><br/>The movie was too romantic for me, personally I feel the movie would have benefited without the love story entwined into the screenplay.<br/><br/>As far as direction and acting goes I feel that it was pretty good, not Oscar worthy but not half terrible either.<br/><br/>So still wondering if you should spend your money on this film? It entirely depends on your personal tastes. It's not really much like 'Inception' like the trailer says but it's still messing with the concept of different realities. If you expect non stop action don't see this film. But if you feel like a romance with a science fiction twist this film should satisfy you.<br/><br/>I give this film 7/10 stars."

It had everything I liked, action, thriller, sci-fi, Emily Blunt (and her English accent, obviously) and romance all into one package. The two leads had great chemistry and the whole cast performed really well.<br/><br/>The storyline was original, and while the ending I felt was a little weak and cheesy, I was hoping it would have been kept a little more open, but that's just me.

"big_ryan15","9","1","1","14 March 2011"," incredibly enjoyable film, in the vein of Inception and Blade Runner
","I was lucky enough to see this film recently with a few of my more intellectual friends.<br/><br/>I wasn't really sure about this film; having nearly had an overdose of Matt Damon recently as he popped up in every movie pre Oscars bar Black Swan. (or so it felt) Same with Emily Blunt, although it was Jack Blacks horrendous Gulliver's Travels that she decided to be a part of recently. Upon taking my seat and sitting through the ritual advertisements that now litter our once sacred movie previews section, I was surprised at the fast paced film opening. Catching the cinema goers off guard al a Blade Runner, is an art i had seldom seen used for years until The Social Network turned up last year. How is it that yet another Phillip K. Dick novella has been adapted so incredibly? and into one of the best films this year will deliver mind you. Matt Damon is SPOT ON! Playing New Yorks youngest ever Senator, his performance is dark and troubled, yet incredibly powerful and fragile. ""Chance"" brings around the meeting between Damon's ""David"" and Emily Blunt's ""Elise"". It is here the story gets interesting. A man is assigned by ""The Adjustment Bureau"" to ensure David's destiny is carried out the way ""the Plan"" has it.<br/><br/>The plan being God's (The Chairman) overall outlook on how things should unfold, something he changes throughout the movie on numerous occasions. What they didn't count on was this ""adjuster"", having an untimely nap the exact moment he was supposed to stop David from meeting Elise; and keeping the new plan, on track.<br/><br/>What unfolds from here is part sci-fi, part philosophical, part thriller and part action. A movie with a lot of bite and a whole lot of heart. Damon and Blunt are spectacular as the two lovers torn apart by ""The Chairmans"" plan, fighting for their own free will to be together!!!<br/><br/>A spectacular turn from Terrence Stamp is the cherry on top of what is no doubt a brilliant film. The score winds everything together while the film comes to a very confusing head.<br/><br/>I have read numerous reviews and threads all in conversation as to the films end. I wont ruin it, BUT, the people whom do not understand the films end, need to watch it again. There is a very strong metaphor in there, you'll just need to look a little harder.<br/><br/>Fantastic film, if you enjoyed Blade Runner (any real movie-goer will) or Nolan's instant classic Inception, you will fall in love with this movie.<br/><br/>Phillip K. Dick. I love you."
"MalcolmJTaylor","8","1","1","13 March 2011"," Superb chemistry
","Damon and Blunt deliver chemistry that is a throw back to classic Hollywood screen romances no longer made in today's culture of ADD that sees cinema pandering to nervous eyeballs in need of a constant VFX fix. Emily Blunt jumps off the screen without the need of 3D glasses. Her presence is so electrifying, I felt as if I was holding my breath waiting for her to appear again. Her smile does indeed light up a room. Watching her highly tuned reactions became like a narcotic for me. Matt Damon, though difficult to buy as a New Yorker, given his strong Bostonian identity; continues his stellar work here showing he's a bankable dramatic actor for thinking adults.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully shot with great locations and gorgeous views of NYC. It is brilliantly conceived and seamlessly edited. The only complaint I have is that the climax is a bit week and could use one more layer of revelation, or perhaps a bittersweet twist. The full on happy ending is somewhat telegraphed and ultimately unsatisfying as much as we are rooting for it though out. Having said that, there is much to love here, including a stellar cast, beautiful cinematography, outstanding locations and above all the chemistry of the leads.<br/><br/>A nice touch too is the whimsical story element of having to wear hats to get through secret doors and passages. It's a welcome contrast to the world of hard science and cold cynicism we face in our daily lives. It triggers our imagination and reminds us of the playfulness of childhood that may have become over complicated by the seriousness of modern life, where crises dominate every headline.<br/><br/>Though reminiscent of ""Inception"" in theme, I'd argue this film is far more fun. It doesn't take itself so seriously. Sure it lacks the awe-inspiring visuals of Inception and the M.C. Escher-like plot structure. But unlike ""Inception"", it has a very strong love story at its centre. Also welcome here: this film does not descend into an ultra-violent, machine gun battle on the peak of an alpine range in the midst of chaos and destruction.<br/><br/>Here you actually get to watch great acting in the form of dynamic on-screen chemistry. Blunt and Damon are determined to be together, no matter the cost, in spite of the highest order of fate. That is the compelling pulse of this film. ""Adjustment Bureau"" serves to remind its viewers of the importance of his or her own freewill and what is lost when he or she do not exercise it. And that is a terrific thing to be reminded of.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this film provides a terrific ensemble cast all around. It's wonderful to see Terence Stamp in such fine form. A delightful performance from Anthony Mackie, in what I'm guessing may be a real break out for him, lending this film his unique presence and refined character. Michael Kelly, whom I enjoyed in ""Fair Game"", also stands out here. As does ""Mad Men's"" John Slattery who is perfectly cast as a sort of middle management ""Bureau"" exec. who can't quite catch a break cleaning up his subordinate's mess.<br/><br/>""Adjustment Bureau"" is a refreshing film increasingly rare in a landscape over-saturated with technical wizardry born out of the chicken-and-egg syndrome of ADD. Is it an inherent disorder or did we create it with our technology? And if we did, is the only solution to pander to it? Thankfully this film doesn't think so. This is a film that remembers, perhaps one of the greatest rewards for an audience is to watch other human beings, actors, portray life's greatest challenges and its most exhilarating moments so that we may glean insight into our own lives. In today's environment, that makes it refreshing.<br/><br/>Thank you George Nolfi for creating such a wonderful piece of work."

","i love it. it's that simple. but actually it's not. philosophy, metaphysics, existentialism: are we free agents, making independent choices, or are we managed and controlled by a higher power, the ""chairman"" and his pawns in the movie, who let us move through our lives, and ""adjusts"" us as needed to make sure we follow the plan. David Norris AKA Matt Damon sees something he is not suppose to see, and nothing is ever the same. he'd seen how his friend is getting ""recalibrated"" and found out that men with hats can make things happen, according to a plan that dismisses his free will and choices as caprices of a child. <br/><br/>after chasing his identity through 3 movies, Damon isn't giving up on his identity and free will, limited as it may have been, for the chairman's plan.<br/><br/>it's a love story, a sci-fi of sorts, it's a spin-off of the Matrix, it's a well-done unusual chase/escape/love story. and for a change, the super power compassionate guy, while still black, is not Morgan Freeman. <br/><br/>one jump out of my seat, few very predictable sequences of acts, and at the end i left the theater with the same happy-silly smile that i associate with watching the princess bride and a firm belief in the power of true love. but don't get me wrong. this is NOT A CHICK FLICK!!!

"jjnoahjames","9","1","1","12 March 2011"," An unexpected philosophical masterpiece!
","In the beginning of The Adjustment Bureau you see, David, Matt Damon's character run for election. It's kind of a lighthearted moment. These moments come and go throughout the film adding to it's dynamics and making it more than another conspiracy thriller a la' Bourne Identity or Taken.<br/><br/>As The Adjustment Bureau moves on it unwinds into a stunning work of art sometimes churning out cheesy moments but rarely, in exchange for romantic desire and philosophical mind bending, along with occasional action.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Emily Blunt perform their very best as usual. They seem destined to be together despite what seems like a whole universe keeping them apart. The array of Adjustment characters are also remarkable and are not too pretentious (though it get's close, they we're chosen wisely).<br/><br/>Also Anthony Mackie plays his character gracefully while pushing the film above average for a great story with a wide array of good characters. With just one more unique character I would have given this a 10.<br/><br/>One of my favorite films of the year!"
"flickist","7","1","1","12 March 2011"," Almost great...
","Trailers and promo spots for this movie sell you a love story wrapped in a very Bourne-esque action/fight against the powers that be blanket. Throw in the tagline that it's based on a story by Philip K. Dick (the writer behind Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, and more) and you've got enough to get me in the seat. What you get, on the other hand, is something a little different. This movie starts a little slow, builds a little slower, but ratchets up the suspense and love story to a great pitch before it fumbles miserably 2 yards before the goal line. It just seems to wrap up swiftly and in a disappointingly anti-climatic way.... see more of this review at http://flickist.blogspot.com"
"esoteric-pirate","9","1","1","11 March 2011"," This is so good I dunno where to start
","What can I say? This is how a movie should be like. The best thing with this movie is how it applies relativity to the settings. Free from moralism and exaggerated evil archetype antagonists. Another example of relativity is how the action scenes are free from exaggeration but still keeps intensity.<br/><br/>The story is smart, irrefutable and consistent, and even though it bears a strong metaphysical tone it is open to most religious beliefs (not including atheism) unlike many movies, with this kind of genre, which usually refers to some type of Christianity.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the main characters really does it. This is a real love story."
"nEoFILM","8","1","1","10 March 2011"," No adjustment necessary...
","Is it just me, or is Matt Damon just getting better and better? He is developing into a well-rounded actor, with a definite ability to draw in his audience and deliver some great performances. In this, Damon is a would-be Senator who meets a falls in love with Emily Blunt, a modern ballet dancer.<br/><br/>Meanwhile it quickly becomes clear that the world is being organised by a group of shady men in 50's suits and hats, don't forget the hats, who 'Adjust' Peoples life paths to adhere to the grand plan. Unfortunately for the star-crossed lovers, they are not meant to be together and the they must ultimately challenge them to pursue their own fate.<br/><br/>Philip K. Dick is a strange and often wonderful sci-fi novelist, whose work has often been adapted for the screen, with the likes of Bladerunner, Total Recall, Minority Report and more recently, and I believe more faithfully In A Scanner Darkly.<br/><br/>The cinematography, art direction and ultimately the direction as a whole was very stylised without becoming uncomfortable or otherworldly, which I think was quite an achievement.<br/><br/>This has been referred to by other critics as 'Inception light', and though I can recognise a vague comparison, I wouldn't like to compare them myself. This was an interesting science fiction story, dealing with deep ideas in a lighter and ultimately more palatable way. Damon and Blunt were both enjoyable to watch as their romance blossomed, though be it in small vignettes, and the shady men themselves were often amusing if not outright funny.<br/><br/>There is nothing particularly new for fans of the genre, and though it is not as deep or intense as Bladerunner, this is certainly a nice addition to the Philip K. Dick movie cannon and it's always great to see a decent Sci-Fi film."
"sitabanu","10","3","6","6 June 2011"," A Composite Movie
","I am a movie nut. All things weird and unusual that play on the idea of true love and the required personal sacrifices to ensure the feeling is not lust is not easily conveyed in a movie. Having said that, this movie, in my opinion, was a composite of themes from ""City of Angels"" - library and angels, ""The Matrix"" - the agents and entry doors, a little bit of the ""The Butterfly Effect"" - personal sacrifice, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" - nothing scary behind the curtain! <br/><br/>The implied sex was tasteful in an old fashioned romance way that did not come across as gratuitous as say in ""Blue Valentine"". Perhaps, having been married for 21 years has created an intimate buffer zone that rejects voyeristic sex. In other words, sexually adjusted people - married or not - do not need to see other people having sex. <br/><br/>This was a movie that could be watched with a 16 year old child and discussed afterward without the awkward in-the-face sex seemingly thrown into so many movies these days. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the effort Damon's character exerted to have the woman of his dreams - the soul mate - the best friend - the true kiss, and the ability of Elise to trust him and herself to go through the doors. <br/><br/>For the 50 year old set, hard-core sex does not intimate-sensuality make, and more movies should provide the essence of innocence in 'the first time' experience, even if it is the 30th first time - sex should not be depicted as a handshake - but must always be forever the mystery of 'other-worldly possibilities' !"
"kavenga","4","3","6","23 April 2011"," Great acting, sub par plot
","Given the cast, the reviews and the hype, I was expecting more, lot more. There is no arc to the story. The main character is at the mercy of his ""controllers"" all the way to the end. The plot is one-dimensional (they're apart, they're together, they're apart, etc. etc.) with no hooks or twists. It tries to be cute: Who are these guys? Angels? Devils? None of the above? Not interested. Damon, Blunt, Slattery and Stamp are excellent and essentially carried this film as far as it has gone. I'm disturbed that reviewers that I respect found this to be a better than average film. I hate to think that this caliber of plot meets or even exceeds our current standards. I gave it two extra stars simply for the quality of the acting."

","OK i'll start this review by saying that if this film doesn't get your wheels turning i don't know what will. It's hard to review a flick of this stature without ruining or giving away the outcome. However its pretty good for plot twists and turns that's one thing i don't mind giving away at all. Romance/ sci-fi is what i would categorize this kinda reminded me of a twilight zone episode i had seen before but cant quite recall what it was entitled. Could you quite possibly foresee that all human's have a pre directed path they are supposed to follow during their lives? And if they fall off of this designated path their is someone or some unseen force guiding them back on path as you cannot cheat destiny or can u? This film brings to life the saying of if it was to happen it would happen and if it doesn't it was never to be."

","I read several reviews before I saw the Adjustment Bureau so I already knew that it would not please my scifi or fantasy needs. I had already heard that those elements were limited and that the story was basically about love. Well I consider myself a hopeless romantic so I thought I would at least be pleased with that aspect of the movie. Alas I was not. This movie is cinematically pretty, mostly well acted, a bit humorous at times, but ultimately very lame. Again as has been the case with so many movies the past several years, the writing is poor. We're still waiting for a story that will blow our socks off. And that doesn't just mean a thrilling story, it means an interesting story or an ordinary story told in an interesting way. This movie was so telegraphed that I just wanted them to get to the ending that I knew was coming so I could do home. Too bad once again. Don't even think I want to see this one again on DVD."

","From the many years of watching films and a generous list of favourites it is surprising even to myself that this is probably the first review I'm submitting to IMDb, which I think tells a lot about the quality of this film.<br/><br/>I won't go into spoilers or dissect the film for you as this is something to experience yourself but if you're looking for that 'feel good' movie to watch with people you care about, if you're after a film that raises your spirits and makes you go that extra mile for your dreams or if you believe in free will then this is definitely for you.<br/><br/>A well executed project with good, natural performances from the actors; Matt is already an established 'jack of all roles' considering his characters from Bourne to Will Hunting and Emily Blunt comes across as a veteran as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand I do see people here saying the end was abrupt and predictive but hey that's just how it is for 90% of the films out there. Afterall we usually watch films to enjoy ourselves not to solve puzzles. This film should be taken and viewed exactly as it was meant to be; a good romantic drama which is quite true and applicable to the life we live on earth.<br/><br/>Personally in the years that I've lived I have come across moments (and so would have others) where you do feel restrained by superior powers; it's what we do then that counts. Matter of fact a lot of people who didn't like TAB were those who don't believe in fate and higher authorities.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film as a must see."
"warthogjump","10","3","7","29 April 2011"," Unexplainable!
","Unfortunately I can't precisely explain why I loved this movie so much.<br/><br/>I usually find it hard to suspend disbelief in fantasy type films. But the Adjustment Bureau is simply phenomenal. It has such a uniquely novel and immensely interesting plot. It is definitely something not seen before. I love the originality of the film and although it does rely on an aspect of surrealism I was extremely surprised that it did not distract my viewing at all.<br/><br/>The romance scenes between the two leads are intense! I usually hate it when one actor surrenders their love for the other, because it is so unrealistic. However, the plot of the movie and the acting of the two leads made the romance so emotional for me. I was on the verge of tears, my eyes were extremely watery, ready to cry in a pool of sadness.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau can be deemed a ""romantic thriller."" It is a story about love, about fate, told with such sensation and intensity that it keeps you on the edge of your seat with no bloody and gory violence or any course language.<br/><br/>The delivery of the film is truly wonderful. It is immensely enjoyable to watch. This is one of my favorites only among a first viewing.<br/><br/>I have to say I was very surprised. I walked into this film with no expectations and was extremely happy I spent my time on this magnificent piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is similar to such films like Inception and Matrix, but is understood in a much simpler sense, tied up in the end without too much complexity.<br/><br/>I would imagine this film to have a wide range of audience to please. It's got romance, it's got thrills, it's got action and it doesn't contain content inappropriate for the younger audience.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is able to reel you in quickly to a very interesting, but questionable premise, but by the end of the movie you realise it was so enjoyable to watch that you didn't even take notice of the ""outside"" factors in the film. Highly recommended!!! Also to note...this is a perfect date movie."

The acting is great, the shooting locations are great as well, and the story, the story is jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>It actually makes you wonder, could it be true. The whole idea of men in suits who control your destiny, in such a cool way is a perfect fit for a film. The best thing, there is not time wasted on fillers and not-important things.

If you like ""James Bond"" soundtracks, Newman has done the last two: ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"". ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is in my top three movie soundtracks along with the 2002 soundtrack to ""Solaris"" by Cliff Martinez and the 1981 soundtrack to ""Thief"" by Tangerine Dream.

","This feature certainly feels like it was based on a short story.<br/><br/>The original idea comes from the legendary pen of sci-fi author Philip K Dick. That idea is essentially that the world is shaped and directed by a group of what I would call ""God's bureaucrats"", who intervene with human affairs in a darkly comic, cloak and dagger 50s spy film kind of way.<br/><br/>We explore the idea of free will and divine intervention through the experience of one man, played by Matt Damon, as he struggles to choose his own fate, even as it clashes with The Plan of ""The Chairman"". (Yes folks, Frank Sinatra is running things upstairs. But I digress..)<br/><br/>The beautiful Emily Blunt brings charm and emotional depth to the love story, so much so that I can almost forgive its predominance over the broader sci-fi elements. She can have all the screen time she wants.<br/><br/>But there's not enough juice here for sci-fi heads - the mind bending ideas are not fully explored, and we're left with more questions than answers. The Bureau remains a mysterious place, reminiscent of Get Smart's CONTROL. It's an entertaining ride, and a love story with a light philosophical bent, but it's not a Philip K Dick sci-fi."

","Before I saw The Adjustment Bureau I was unsure what to expect from it. On the one hand, the trailer depicted what looked like an action-packed surreal thriller. On the other hand, I had seen tedious film posters claiming 'It's Bourne meets Inception!'; about as vague a description of a film as describing Finding Nemo as 'Jaws meets Toy Story'. It starts promisingly, and to its credit, the lead performances are strong and the chemistry worked. However, about halfway through the film, the plot takes off in a random unconvincing direction that builds up to an ultimately unsatisfying conclusion. Good if you like lots of footage of Matt Damon running through doors away from men in hats who don't like the rain."

This turned out just like Tron: Legacy; it had great ideas but didn't focus on them and had a simple story line. The idea of a bureau adjusting someone's life is amazing and yet they focused too much on Damon's character and should have delved into the bureau without going away from the story, or made a huge conspiracy of it.

","OK, I admit I went to see this film without reading anything about it first, but sometimes that's more fun......although not in this case. I was expecting some shadowy, high tech, time travelling, spacetime continuum policing bureau that was created in 1950's US (judging by the way they dress) that was attempting to foil or impose some dastardly plan with Matt Damon as the counterpoint to either of these. Instead it turned out to be a pseudo religious romantic tale and 'The Bureau' turned out to be angels from heaven keeping humanity on track. Oh dear. 'On track' for the films two lead protagonists means keeping them from becoming romantically involved. But guess what? Ta-daaaa. It's all just a test set by god ( the 'Chairman'). Er, that's it. The audience are supposed to be intrigued by the question of whether or not they really have free will (yaaaawn). There is some nice dialogue which is just as well as the small special effects budget was obviously blown on the angels' notepad effect which is shown gratuitously at every conceivable opportunity.

","Last year, I started 2010 with Martin Scorsese's fantastic Shutter Island. Now 2011 has come, and I'm starting the cinematic year off with The Adjustment Bureau. While I don't think it's a perfect movie, I will say this much: It is a rock solid movie with thrills and intellect to spare.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as David Norris, a New York congressman running for senate. After a huge loss, he has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman (Played by Emily Blunt), a woman who after another chance meeting is revealed to be named Elise. But unbeknownst to David, he was only supposed to meet her once, as part of a grand plan by an entity of black suited overseers. But David decides to challenge his destiny by pursuing Elise, but doing so is an action that could not only destroy his personal ambitions, but Elise's as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay by first time director George Nolfi is an interesting one, and delivers serious food for thought on the concept of challenging fate, and the consequences of one's actions and deviations. Nolfi proves he has talent as a director, as he not only keeps a firm grasp on characterization, stages the action sequences well, or knows when to let the cinematography by John Toll, or musical score by Thomas Newman do the storytelling, but he also never strays far from proper structure, tone, and pace.<br/><br/>The movie moves quickly, the conversations are interesting, and the ensemble cast, specifically that of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's perfect chemistry, is terrific. It is worth noting that certain elements of the film can get confusing, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I'd be lying to myself if I said I wasn't enthralled by those 100 minutes. Plus, I have to give praise to Kasia Walicka-Maimone for the film's inventive costumes.<br/><br/>It may not be perfect, but I'm very satisfied to have kicked off 2011 with The Adjustment Bureau.<br/><br/>I give it *** out of ****"

Call it a realist fantasy if you will, like Stranger than Fiction.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable in the moment but it's never a whole lot more enriching than than. The product feels kind of half baked, only somewhat romantic, only somewhat clever, only somewhat thrilling. Sometimes it actually come close to being funny in a self reflexive way.<br/><br/>For a movie that is largely about fate vs. chance, I have no doubt that the film makers would have thought it ironic to use such an ending as the one we get, but it is ironic in the wrong way. The last ten minutes form an insulting deus ex machina/ cheap shot, the kind that makes you want to wonder if the film was rushed in the making. Indeed, the Adjustment Bureau ends up feeling way shorter than it should be. It's a nifty movie to be sure, and arguably a nice movie, but it needs adjustment."

","'THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>A man challenges fate itself and it's protectors in this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story 'Adjustment Team'. Matt Damon stars as politician David Norris and Emily Blunt co-stars as ballerina dancer Elise Sellas, the two must fight for their love when the enforcers of fate try to keep them apart (for reasons not fully explained). First time director George Nolfi wrote and directed the film (he also wrote and co-wrote the screenplays to two other Matt Damon films: 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' and 'THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM'). The movie is a fantasy / romance / thriller and it doesn't do a very good job of mixing the genres thoroughly but it does play out with a lot of enjoyment all the same.<br/><br/>As the movie opens David Norris is a popular and very promising political figure on the verge of winning a U.S. Senate seat when he blows his lead through a highly publicized and very unpopular reunion party prank. This is when 'The Adjustment Bureau', as they call themselves, is first brought into action to clean things up. They work for a higher power (presumably God) and are what some people call angels (although they act a lot like bureaucrats). They have special powers, can teleport through magical doors and alter (as well as erase) people's minds. It's their job to make sure their boss's plan (they call him 'the Chairman') is executed. Their skills are further put to the test when Norris, by chance, continues to run into the woman of his dreams, Elise, who he's not supposed to be with. When he, by chance again, witnesses the men in action he is told of their duties and that he can never reveal them to anyone or suffer the consequence of being lobotomized. They also tell Norris he can not see the girl. Norris following his heart, passion and love of course decides to ignore their commands.<br/><br/>The movie is as silly as it sounds and completely over the top (which is odd for a Matt Damon film) but it had a lot of potential to be something really great. The acting by Damon and Blunt is outstanding and their chemistry on screen is pure magic (one of the best cinematic relationships I've seen depicted on screen in a while). That's why I really wanted to like the movie and after a botched and cheesy scene here and another there I kept hoping it would redeem itself. The writing is a little weak and the directing is amateurish (although there are several scenes that work, all involving Damon and Blunt). The whole movie it felt like their was a great movie waiting to break free but it couldn't. Even so it's worth seeing if for nothing else than to see Damon and Blunt in action together. As a romance and a film about the power of love it definitely works.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAZ2104LOU"

","I really enjoyed this film. It is easy to understand, however, in some places the plot dwells on the love story between Damon and Blunt, when I would rather more see suspense and thrilling action. However, the chemistry between Damon and Blunt was very good! I think the plot had more potential (especially at the end), and it is not as complex as Inception, and the plot does not have as much of a build up, which may disappoint some people. Also, half way trough the film the element of mystery is somewhat gone up until the very end, but overall, this is an interesting film.<br/><br/>If you like: Matrix, Inception and other mind-benders, you'll like this!<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","What if free will is just a myth; an idea that keeps us happy? What if everything in our lives was planned out for us, from the people we meet to whether we achieve greatness or not? These question race through your mind as you view The Adjustment Bureau. Based upon the short story ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick, George Nolfi has written and directed one of the most thought provoking, imaginative and thrilling films of all time. The story follows politician David Norris (Matt Damon) whose life plan isn't adjusted at a small moment in time, leading to him discovering the truth behind everyone's ""fate"" and giving him a glimpse of his own future, a future he doesn't want. Pursued by the hatted agents of the Bureau, David must do everything he can to outrun and outsmart them to alter his plan and be with Elise (Emily Blunt), the woman he loves; the woman the Bureau is conspiring to keep him from being with. With a great cast that includes the likes of charismatic Matt Damon and delightful Emily Blunt leading the way, as well as Michael Kelly, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp, you have an assortment of believable characters. The chemistry between Damon and Blunt worked very well and you truly believed that these characters were meant to be in love with one another. I think that Nolfi definitely has delivered one of the more unique pieces of cinema in recent memory, but at times the pacing was a bit too slow and a lot of it built up to a climax that wasn't so well, climatic. Overall, though, it was a good film that takes you on a thrilling ride and leaves you thinking."
"ajs-10","7","2","4","5 March 2011"," An interesting adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story...
","Based on a short story called 'The Adjustment Team' by Philip K. Dick, the ideas behind this film intrigued me from the moment I first heard about it. Imagine a world where your fates are determined for you and if you stray from your prescribed path, an adjustment is made to put you back on it. The 'people' responsible for making the adjustments are, of course, 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Now you know that, I can write a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please try on some stylish hats while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>David Norris is a young ambitious politician; he is running for the Senate, representing New York, when his campaign is de-railed by a scandal from his past. Resigned to defeat, he retires to the men's washroom to practice his speech. There he meets dancer Elise Sellas who he instantly falls in love with. She gives him the confidence to give a brilliant speech that galvanises the public enough to call for him to stand for election at a later date but that's in the future. He is so enamoured with Elise that, when he meets her again the very next day, he asks for her number, which she gives him. Now, the path that has been prescribed for David Norris does not include a relationship with Elise Sellas. In steps the Adjustment Bureau in the guise of a group of agents led by a character known as Richardson. They do all they can to keep the couple apart and even reveal themselves to David in an effort to make him see sense. Unfortunately for them, he is determined to be with her and eventually the case is sent up to the next level and Thompson takes charge. He gives David a choice, either continue on this path and ruin both of their lives, or take the path prescribed for him. It's a tough decision, but David has an ally in Harry Mitchell, who has been following him for a long time. And it's here I'll leave my summary don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film with some great special effects, but it is the story that drives the action and not the other way around. It is very much a love story, but a love story with a rather cunning twist and one that I very much enjoyed. All of the leading cast are excellent; Matt Damon as David Norris, Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas, John Slattery as Richardson, Michael Kelly as Charlie Traynor, Anthony Mackie as Harry Mitchell and Terence Stamp as Thompson.<br/><br/>I love the premise of this film and, although I enjoyed it very much, I felt there was a little too much focus on the love story and not enough on the bureau. Maybe it's just me, but I never really felt there was enough chemistry between the two lovers to warrant the effort put in by the David Norris character. In the end though, it's a perfectly watchable entertaining film, without being particularly mind-bending or spectacular. Better than average and recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.2/10"

","The 'Adjustment Bureau is a 2011 film based on the Philip K. Dick novel, 'the Adjustment Team' -- I guess the producers thought 'bureau' ran better with their focus group. The film centers around a New York Congressman, David Norris (Matt Damon) running for Senate and his surprising encounters with a professional dancer, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). The problem is it doesn't seem all of their encounters are a product of chance. Quite randomly, Norris uncovers a mysterious organization who control people's lives and prevents David and Elise from being together. The film ensues with David struggling against the bureau in the hopes of being with Elise. It's an interesting story, albeit hardly suspenseful. If you're Damon or Blunt fans you may be relieved that they're the best parts of this movie but everything else is hardly exciting. Lots of plot holes with very few answers. Very unextraordinary."

I found it hard to see them as any serious power striving to execute the plan as it is, what they really were to me was a bunch of people running to stop someone from doing things that they do not approve of. 
And then comes Elisa talking about the senator of New York and how she left her ex for not wanting to settle for less because of him. I believe it's a little easier to reach someone running for the congress for two consecutive years than it is for him to find her. I mean she did want to right?

","The movie starts out great. I thought it was going to be Jason Bourne vs. The Matrix. As it turns out if was a bizarre love story involving fate. Matt Damon, due to an oversleeping ""angel"" or controller accidentally discovers that ""God"" aka ""chairman"" (apparently Frank Sinatra took over that spot) has a master plan for humans because we can't do anything right on our own. The chairman uses ""angels"" to control the outcome of major events in the world by tweaking people's thoughts and sometimes causing accidents and deaths.<br/><br/>Matt meets a girl and they immediately hit it off, however they were never supposed to meet again as that would change the game plan. When they do, it sends ripples through that ultimate game plan, apparently flexibility is not one of the Chairman's virtues. The movie is about them trying to be together vs. fate keeping them apart. It is perhaps more of a love story than anything else. For people who believe in a higher power, it is as thought provoking as the book of Job.<br/><br/>This movie has no great special effects as Matrix, no fast speed fighting, no great sound track, no nudity, no sex (just implied) and I don't recall any F-bombs."

","Set in the 2012 New York City setting, The Adjustment Bureau, is the hands down the best movie for hopeless romantics who love an alternate world. The main character, David Norris, played by Matt Damon, is on the brink of winning a Senate seat in the government. On his journey to success, mysterious men begin to overwwatch the events in his life, coincidentally all with magical hats. On the night of the election, he meets an extremely talented and charming ballerina, Elise Sellas, played by Emily Blunt. Even though the election did not sway his direction, he is left with the though of Elise. For three years after that magical night, he is left with the first three digits of her number, claiming he, ""legitimately lost the her number!"" On his journey to figure out who these mystery men in velvet hats are, he gets caught in love, desperately trying to change the fate of his life.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a fantastic movie if you love a twist on a love story that persists. Throughout the film you see David go through personality changes, in fact, mindset changes that alter his ""life course"". The first reason why this movie is worth watching is because of the epic love story of David and Elise that ultimately inspires him to take control of his life without any press, right-hand man, or decision makers in his life. He, for once is the boss of his own life, and there was no one to stop him. I think that is what this film is trying to teach its viewers, and that is, that no matter what obstacles, barriers, or crazy life altering organizations come your way, there is always some way you can take control of your life. The film also tries to teach us that to make your life worth while, that being with the limited time we have here, that you have to stray from the black and white lines, and instead add color and mystery.<br/><br/>Another reason why you should watch The Adjustment Bureau is because, even though the elements within the film are strange and new, it is the intriguing plot elements along with its characters, David and Elise, that make the film so captivating. It is also a real life superhero movie. Until you get to the end of the film, you will see the tension between David and the Adjustment Bureau's relationship. This film will make you believe in love again, and it will entice you to become a hope-FUL romantic! I really do not know what else to say other than if you do not watch this movie, you will not be exploring your life, you will be following it. Now, One may be asking: Is The Adjustment Bureau a really well-rounded movie? And my answer to that is of course not, and I know that I'm encouraging my fellow hopeless romantics to see this movie, but it can not be all of the above thrilling, mystical, dare-devil-seeking, romance enhanced, and plot thickening movie ever, but that is not the point. If it was a movie that was ""all of the above"", there would be no specific plot line; no intimate relationship between the audience the relationship between David and Elise.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau was not the most thrilling, action packed, stunt-filled movie I've seen, and I admit that, but the user named, ""Legolah"" says on imdb.com that the script, along with it's characters were, ""misused and dull"". Boy was he wrong. He explained his experience with his vision of the movie and how it didn't live up to the trailer. That's the whole point of a trailer; it is supposed to make you want to see it, and it's supposed to entice you to purchase the movie ticket to see if it lived up to his expectations. Now, I'm sorry that the movie did not live up to his sky high expectations,m but that shouldn't be your thought going into it. The point of a movie is too enjoy its characters, and to teleport you to a different world. Its point to make you live life within another person's experiences and thoughts, and I think The Adjustment Bureau does a great job of that. It not only makes you familiar with a city that is well known, which is New York City, but it puts a twist on real life scenery. In conclusion, I think this user missed the entire point of the movie. He also may not have had the right mind set going into the film."

","I was completely unprepared for the surprises in store for me, in spite of having watched the trailers and clips before. <br/><br/>Now, I view this as a (kinda) fable, or a fairy tale, if you will, with a dash of sci-fi thrown in, but sci-fi of the supernatural kind. <br/><br/>One of the best fusions of hard-hitting ground reality based fictions, that fuses seamlessly with the sci-fi and supernatural elements, and creates a new universe, getting the audience members (those without an agenda, that is, who can appreciate art for what it is, and what it tries to convey - and no, not those who're elitist about it either) to completely dive into its unique world, and get encompassed by the fabric of its storytelling. <br/><br/>One of the best romantic dramas out there, as well. And that is an element that sold me on this one completely, in spite of the hard- to-buy aspects of this kind of an entanglement (of sorts, not to be demeaning though). <br/><br/>Emily Blunt. A-ma-zing! <br/><br/>If ppl fell in love with her after her role as the FMB in 'Edge of tomorrow', but have missed this, I do hope this set of my observations;/thoughts about my viewing of this one influences them enough to check this one out. At least once. <br/><br/>I cannot wait for her upcoming movie based on 'The girl on the train'. She was born to play that. <br/><br/>And I do hope we get more of her as the FMB in a sequel to 'Edge of tomorrow' (based on the graphic novel, 'All you need is kill'). <br/><br/>Coming back to 'The Adjustment bureau', I was hooked. <br/><br/>I can now watch this any number of times, and my appreciation for it increases with each viewing.<br/><br/>But, is it flawed? <br/><br/>Movie viewing is a subjective experience, and in my head, yes, the world it built did not seem to be able to stand on its feet. There were plot contrivances (not contrivances galore, but a few that I found a tad difficult to ignore, but which did not detract in any way from my enjoyment of the flick as a whole). <br/><br/>Director Nolfi's earlier effort, the political thriller, 'The Sentinel', was so by-the-numbers decent, that I did not expect something like this from him, in spite of his writing credits on 'The Bourne Ultimatum', and collaborating with John 'Flight' Gatins on writing the upcoming 'Spectral', among others.<br/><br/>Among my list of grouses, there's just not enough Anthony Mackie or John Slattery, though Mackie, as always (watch 'Triple Nine' if you need more validation of what I'm saying here), makes the role his own, and gives a solid, grounded performance (grounded, heh!). <br/><br/>An underrated gem, imho. Not to be missed. Worth multiple viewings, even better with someone you're really, really fond of."

It's a shame it somewhat fell under the radar.<br/><br/>I loved both K-Pax and Serendipity, and for me this is a perfect blend of the two films. Adjustment Bureau tells a story but doesn't quite join all the dots. It is a metaphorical interpretation of the idea of fate and a creator, and who doesn't love a great romance on the side. <br/><br/>Does it matter that we don't get to see the creator? Does it matter that a couple of things don't really add up?

","David Norris is a rather arrogant fellow. As well he might be as he is a Congressman who is expected to coast to victory in his upcoming Senate race. The sky is the limit for young David Norris...but then the sky comes crashing down on him. He loses that Senate race and, humbled, makes a candid concession speech which goes over so well he immediately becomes the favorite to win the next Senate race a few years down the line. In this speech, by laying himself bare and talking from the heart, David really connects with people. He'd really like to thank the person who inspired the speech. That would be Elise who is...a woman he just met in the men's bathroom? This intriguing woman might change David's destiny. And that is a problem. David and Elise were never supposed to meet. Says who? Some mysterious men in fedoras.<br/><br/>David and Elise have their restroom moment and then she's gone. David would very much like to find her. The men in hats would very much prefer he not do so. And they have strange powers which enable them to keep David and Elise apart. But then one of the men in hats screws up, David bumps into Elise and things start to get really, really weird. The men in hats are from the Adjustment Bureau. David catches them in the act of doing some adjusting on people in his life. They can change people's thoughts, ensuring that everything unfolds according to The Plan. What plan? The Chairman's plan. Who's the Chairman? David would surely like to know but the Adjustment Bureau is not going to be forthcoming with any such information. All they need David to know is that if he reveals their existence to anyone he will be ""reset"" which is a cute way of saying lobotomized. And he is not to see Elise ever again.<br/><br/>So of course David becomes more determined than ever to see Elise. The Adjustment Bureau throws obstacles in his path, David overcomes them. Eventually the Bureau has to call in the big gun, Thompson, the scariest dude in their arsenal. Thompson provides a little insight into the Bureau. He provides a little insight into why David is so important. And he makes it perfectly clear that he will have no qualms about crushing Elise to make sure David sticks to The Plan. Can love overcome? This is all very intriguing but as the movie plays out it is not quite as exciting as one might hope. Things get rather muddled, bogged down. For much of the film's running time there is not much energy to it. Matt Damon gives a good performance as David, a character who is initially unlikable who we very quickly start identifying with and pulling for. Emily Blunt is also quite good as Elise, creating a character who is instantly intriguing and always interesting. Easy to see why David would fall for Elise. Damon and Blunt have good chemistry but, seeing as the whole point of the movie is their two characters being kept apart, they are not ever really together long enough for that chemistry to pay great dividends. The Adjustment Bureau is of course shrouded in mystery. That mystery doesn't pay itself off as well as you might hope, instead of a big finish things sort of fizzle out. Questions are raised about humanity's free will but those questions are not really answered satisfactorily. In the end it doesn't quite all tie together. There's some good intrigue here, some good romance too. Damon and Blunt do very well, drawing you in and making you really invest in this relationship which, for reasons unknown, is not allowed to be. It's an intelligent film, one which makes you think. So there's a lot the film has going for it. There is the nagging sense though that the film falls just a little bit short of the greatness which seemed to be within its grasp. Maybe a slight adjustment here or there..."

","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is one of those movies that is intelligent, beautiful, charming and just enough action to keep the story moving to places you wouldn't expect. It is also one of those cutting-edge movies that makes you want to watch a second time just to see what was done. It's like watching a magician's entire act and being amazed, then peaking behind the curtain to see where the rabbit really is before he's pulled from the hat.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the perfect lead as the charismatic, young politician who wants nothing more than make a real change to our country. He's also just been steamrolled in an election and is practicing his loser's speech in the men's restroom when Emily Blunt steps out of a stall to the stunned amusement of Damon's character. In a few moments of romantic flirting, Damon and Blunt kiss and she disappears. When they reunite a month later - to the chagrin of the by-the-book ""Men in Hats"" - things take a sideways turn when Damon realizes the world actually has specific designs and suffers potentially catastrophic changes if any of those designs are altered. When Damon's character is faced with the choice of never seeing the woman of his dreams ever again or finding her for a few wonderful moments of pure love before getting caught and being lobotomized permanently, his choices will alter not only his destiny but the woman he loves and possibly the country itself! <br/><br/>The supporting cast is splendid. John Slattery is the middle-man ""Hat"" who strong-arms Damon into changing his mind about Blunt's character and is believable in his bully-wannabe persona - until the real bully arrives. Terence Stamp is his evil best as the ultra-bully ""Hat"" who will stop at nothing - including causing physical pain to a main character - to make sure everyone follows ""the grand plan"". To see Stamp's supposedly righteous character stray to the dark side more and more in order to set right what went wrong is a very clever twist. Anthony Mackie is excellent as the put-upon, screw-up ""Hat"" who has ethics above his own bosses and wants to do the right thing, no matter the personal cost.<br/><br/>The story bobs and weaves through a series of doors and passageways in New York City and it's outlying communities. At times this can get confusing and may need to be watched a second time to keep up with the speed once Damon and Blunt start their race to the finish.<br/><br/>Here's the spoiler alert: I wish they would have shown ""The Chairman"" at the end. Reading the IMDb site, I hear there was an actual scene filmed where Damon meets ""The Chairman"" but it was axed by the distribution company due to the actor playing that character was of a minority. I wish the director and/or the powers that be who own the rights to the movie would create a ""Director's Cut"" DVD with the correct scene put back into the story. It would make much more sense at the end. Shame on whomever would have chopped a much-needed scene simply because of the color of one's skin and/or their religious heritage.<br/><br/>With that glaring exception at the end withstanding, this movie is well worth watching. The scenes are gorgeous. The cast is stellar. The story is twisted and intelligent enough to keep your interest throughout. It is a very well done piece of Hollywood magic. Downtown New York and it's huge concrete jungle has never looked so overwhelming and looms large as the backdrop. Highly recommended. 8 out of 10. Once they re-insert the scene with ""The Chairman"" at the end, it will be a 9 out of 10."

That David sees ""behind the fabric of reality"" was a mistake:""You have the appearance of free will."" By this mistake he and Elise choose by free will what they want. Without helping aids (here the hat and the door) As they believe they met by mistake, Elise and David: but not. They just continue earlier events. Is this still 'free will'? By crossing the line we see behind and act accordingly. Even them,chasing David and Elise, have not the whole Picture. Only parts and must accept what He/She says according what is said above them. When can I come behind the agents of Fate. And when have I my own (free) will? The agents of Fate try to stop David. Without success. They try to get him back on line, following his fate as the book says. He does not. Even that his and her career is the bargain. The ending Words: Take your fate in your own hands. And pay. Then the Charlies, Harrys and Richardsons are not needed as we do it now: ""Most people live life on the path we set for them, too afraid to explore any other. But once in a while people like you come along who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way. People who realize freewill is a gift that you'll never know how to use until you fight for it. I think that's the chairman's real plan. That maybe one day, we won't write the plan, you will."" The Swedish writer Elisabet Nemert has love and hate in her books but love must always win.

Passing the shopping center towards the library where the newspaper should be delivered, I heard her familiar voice:'Hello Stephan'. I turned and we had a short chat. What could have happened if I had left my bag, waited for the next buss and, consequently, missed her. Or, turning while going on, a short hello. Doing what David and Elise did, taking in their hand their Owe destiny. Facing brave and confident the obstacles.<br/><br/>Daily we have the possibilities to rewrite, to change destiny with what we, not them want. What we actually should do."

","The movie starts off pretty well. There is an acceptable introduction of characters, each and every of them. You can easily feel the roles and the motions and feelings coming through. The lines have been written thoughtfully.<br/><br/>However, there are obvious non-matching parts about the story. This movie is showing David Norris in a serious campaign for the senate, when he suddenly meets Elise and falls in love. And this is exactly the very questionable part of the script. As a viewer, you reserve yourself the right to wonder that why and how such an ambitious person could give up his speeches and interviews just to give excuses to the woman of her dreams. It is understandable that George Nolfi meant to picture how mighty love can stand against anything, even desire to walk into the office, yet he might have neglected that there needs to be a tangible balance between these two to uphold the credibility and acceptability of the plot for the watcher.<br/><br/>Moreover, there are parts that Harry or Richardson start talking about David's brother, father, and mother, while there is no extra information and you may keep wondering who they were exactly and why the adjustment bureau should need to worry about them; and this ambiguity is deteriorated once there are occasional references to the family, such as ""Your father used to say that!"" or ""What your brother told you before he overdosed!""<br/><br/>And about acting, it is enough to say that ""Matt Damon"" is just typical him, as well as Emily Blunt's performance which could have been carried off by any other female actor, which both are, to be fair, mainly a script problem for being too worried about keeping two totally different lines together.<br/><br/>All in all, you may watch The Adjustment Bureau if you only mean to spend time watching a movie, regardless of story details, as it has scenes to take you along."

","The Adjustment Bureau (2011):<br/><br/>The extraordinary love story of a couple who aren't allowed to meant to be for each other.<br/><br/>The Bureau is a group that corrects the mistakes people make and be sure not to allow people to outrun their corrects they decided. This is all written in books that members of the group carry with them. Each book defines the persons life. The boss of The Bureau, what the group calls him the ""chairman"". He writes the roads that people must cover to reach their end destination, fate/destiny. If anyone reveals who and what the group is. The group then will take responsibilities. Erasing the memory of the person who breaks the rule.<br/><br/>A man that will eventually maybe make it to The White House meets a girl that for sure will make it to professional ballerina. The place where love overtook was the bathroom and the place where destiny meets was in the bus.<br/><br/>As the group try to prove they aren't meant to be for each other and do whatever it takes to prevent they won't meet each other again, the truth rest in pure love. He must let go of her, but he can't. He is willing to do everything for her.<br/><br/>Eventually, a member of The Bureau decides to help the man to find his love again.<br/><br/>Later on, as the man found the women, The Bureau found them too. And is willing to brainwash his memory. (The movie lets us see that pure love overcomes everything, even the Adjustment Bureau). We see the couple kissing as the guards standing around them. But their love for each other is so strong that the chairman rewrote their books and let them live together.<br/><br/>This movie could be phenomenal and very well told, but unfortunately I think the writers just didn't raise the bar and stayed on one level as they work to the core of the movies topic.<br/><br/>But the incomparable predictable story and the message the movie left was so beautiful and emotionally touching. It belongs to one of my favorite.<br/><br/>Review by: Brendan Resnick."

","David Norris, a young man with the vice of politics, is a candidate for the office of senator in the state of New York. In Jurassic advantage over his opponent, David points throughout his campaign on the freshness of his few years and a talent as oratory. But the funny pictures , untimely published by the press , compromises his victory , assuring nevertheless sympathy, trust and vote of Elise , a promising dancer met by chance in the men's room. Falling in love in the time of a kiss, David and Elise take their leave to seek and find themselves on the streets and on buses in New York. Their love , however, is not written in the book of the President , a sort of deus ex machina that decides the fate of men. Elise was not included in existential journey of David and therefore the guardians of destiny, operatives of the President in suit and Borsalino , will deflect , ironing out the kinks and ensuring a greater plan . Claiming free will , David will challenge superior orders with head shots and heart. After (probably) an acid well done, Philip K. Dick saw a spring inside the seventies the programmer to program our lives on earth. That direct experience of ' ecstasy ' revealed ' the truth ' , that is to say that men are the means by which it accomplishes the design of the Great Puppeteer . From another experiment , this time of literary creation and in any case aligned with the mystical , came into being The Adjustment Bureau , short story by American author transposed to the screen by George Nolfi . Romantic thriller , The Adjustment Bureau combines strong moments , tense adrenalin emotions , with closed loops in themselves to the pursuit of emotion and the realization of a gorgeous love . While Matt Damon fights the dark antagonist that causes him to beat a desired path , the film raises the obsessions of Dick on the need to distinguish objective reality from the subjective, the idea of the plot as a plot hatched against the individual, the obsessive surveillance exercised by the apparatus of power . The original title ( The Adjustment Bureau) anticipates the step that leads to the film , the advance towards the desired outcome for the protagonist to be a presence or ' presidency ' top . The entity has an arm that controls officers armed with Borsalino scrupulous men move along predetermined lines without compromising the final result , without peer behind the door of the near future. But David Norris does not want to take part in the event planned , proceeding in the direction obstinate and contrary . The Adjustment Bureau is yet another adaptation of Dick's trying to read the contemporary with a look that borrows from its pages fundamental themes ( the crisis of the subject, the essential falsity of our perceptions, the presence of parallel realities , etc. ) marking the ' soul unlike other works , influenced by his literary world without being direct transpositions ( Memento , If the Spotless Mind , eXistenZ ) . Without having the merits of aesthetic innovation , however the romantic thriller Nolfi (writer of The Bourne Ultimatum ) finds its strength in the protagonist . So The Adjustment Bureau is one of those movies that are worth seeing just because. Just because there is Matt Damon, flushed from Eastwood took his mask ( Hereafter ) and recovered its identity. Staying true to the concept that the character is action and clutching the hand of the woman he loves, Matt Damon through the doors of a New York ' liquid ' and marks the point of transition : from actor to actor to being. So Nolfi revealing the matrix reveals the star . A movie star good . Bravo seriously."

","What is more important, have a meaningful life or a life of happiness? This film directed by George Nolfi is about a successful politician David Norris (Matt Damon) who has to choose between the woman of his dreams (Emily Blunt) or his career while trying to stop a group known as the Adjustment Bureau from making the choice for him. The Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's short story 'Adjustment Team'. I went in looking for a clever sci-fi flick with philosophical tones and it was pretty OK. It had what I love to debate such topics like 'Determinism VS Free Will' and ""Predestination VS Freedom'. The problem with the movie is there is no reason to root for one side or the other. The powers that be, the Chairman and the fedora wearing hat men want him to be elected to the senate and then president. Thompson (Terrence Stamp), the leader of the hat men, says when he becomes President, it would benefits the world. While it never stated how; but if he able to save millions of people from dying when president, then he should choice duty over lust and sex. For him to choice a woman over the stalk of humanity might seem little too selfish. The only thing standing in his way of obtaining the highest political office is his love for a free spirited dancer, who he meets while she's hiding in the Men's room from hotel security. Damon and Blunt have very little chemistry, which leaves you wondering why he would drop everything for a girl he made out in front of men urinals, after only 5 minutes of dialogue. The lover connection is too weak between the two. I can understand if they were childhood friends, high school or college sweetheart. A flashback scene, or just some scenes in the beginning that showed other ""near miss"" moments between the two would have been a breath of fresh air. They barely knew each other. Love at first sight is probably what the filmmakers were going for, but the way both Norris and Elise acts in public and in private isn't classy at all. At this point, both were at their lowest point, it wasn't like they felt in love, it look like they made out for a chance of pity sex. The movie makes a great deal of David and to a lesser extent Elise taking their fate into their own hands, by having free will. However, this is contradicted early in the movie, when the adjustment agents find out that the reason they want to be together in the first place is that they were supposed to be together, then the plan changed. How do you have 'free will' if you destined to fall in love in the 1st place? The film isn't about 'free will', but chasing destiny even when the plans changed. If the bureau had anything to do with them from the beginning as far as their ""supposed"" connection to each other, it wasn't free will, but past bureau programming. The film acts like you can't have both ways as well. They act like she can't be a famous ballerina if she dating a President, and the President can't be the President if he married a famous ballerina. Case in point: Matt Damon's character: he can still be president he can amass enough money and power to eventually find time for Elise. For Emily Blunt character: if she dating a President, that would only help her career even more, and it's not like a ballerina can't have vacation or spent time with her husband. It might be hard for them to meet up due to the demands of their career, but it's no way impossible that they couldn't find a way to work it out. While the romantic part sucks, I do like the Sci-fiction part, with the Bureau men able to teleport place to place through doors. How comes there isn't any women bureau members? Honestly, they can be a bit dumb. If they wanted to make sure, David Norris sticks to 'the plan'. How come they didn't adjust his memory that day, they met? Instead of trusting him to keep their secret, a secret. He is a politician, you dumb, Adjustment Bureau! You can't trust him with your secret! I know that a total mind reset would turn Norris into a vegetable state of mind, but why couldn't they just make small decision making ""adjustments."" To Norris like they did to his coworkers. It seems easier than threating and forbidding him to see the girl. You can have him decide not seek the girl, or tell the public, your secrets. You can even change Else's mind to not see him. The ending is a bit of a cop out. He should have met the chairman. Why didn't they reveal the chairman? That would be awesome to see. Some people believe there might be some theological gnostic over tones with what the bureau really represented. They say that the chairman represent God and his caseworkers as its angels and the bureau is really about religion. There are some people that think the bureau represent illuminati type inside government, similar to the Men in Black. For me, I don't care who they represented, the whole concept of what the Bureau is on film is interesting. The story does remind me of something. It reminds me of the real life historic story of King Edward VIII and his choice to abdicated the crown when the Church of England refused to allow him to marry Wallis Simpson, because it was morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce and goes against the church teachings. Overall: it's an OK film with rather white-centric movie plot. Thomas Newman's music score for the film is brilliant. The man is a truly talented composer. I would say, adjust your free time, it's worth watching."

","I saw the ads for this when it was out, it looked pretty good but I forgot about it until it hit cable recently. I really like Matt Damon best in quietly underplayed roles, and he works effectively in that style in this movie. Damon is politician who has chance encounter with the stunning Blunt after an embarrassing photo kills his election hopes. He becomes magnetically attracted to Blunt and her to him - with one problem - she's not part of the ""plan"" for him. See, there's a group of advanced folks around making people follow the ""Plan"", and making adjustments when there's a deviation from the Plan. They soon make themselves known to Damon and make it clear that 1) he isn't supposed to be with Blunt, and 2) he can't squeal on them. It's really sci fi and chick flick all in one, but it mildly worked for me including the upbeat wrap up."

","I expected nothing about this movie; I was sick, headache, and feels like my whole bone structure was falling apart You know, psychically ill. Well in such a day, go out for a movie probably could make me feel better. Ada chose the movie; I didn't even read through the introduction. The poster is kinda lame; a couple is running from something. And here comes the story, which is not really new at all; yet wears a quite new cloth. So, fun.<br/><br/>Fate, do you believe it? Most people I know do believe. The fate brings people together, the destination leads our way; and what meant to be will comes to you eventually, if it isn't happen yet, it's just not the right moment yet How about free will? Well don't you think free will could be part of the fate as well? Well The emotion drives you to someone or to some dream; and the desire toward them, exactly, could be our fate.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a new version of God and his Angles. Put it in an easy-understanding way: God (Chairman in the movie) planed our fate, for people who is important on the earth; and Angle (Officials who wear the hat) make certain adjustments in these VIP's daily life, to make sure their behaviors follow the plan; the old-school plot, you know, spill coffee to make you late from work, or in worse case, change your mind or the wost, reset your brain.<br/><br/>The story is of course about free will, which suppose to against the fate. The guy who meant to be the Present of United States fall in love with a girl, who'd make him feel satisfied and no longer needs to be powerful or ambitious. They can't be together cause that would ruin the greater good for both of them.<br/><br/>Well the guy discovers the Bureau and decides not to follow the plan, cause he really loves the girl and that is all he needs. (Wooo nice guy haa?) And the even more 0ld-school ending After all the risks they took, the Chairman decides to let them go, to change their plan, to fulfill their free will. And the whole thing is more like a test, to see if they could take every difficulties to be together. In another words, they are meant to be together, the God just need to be sure how strong the will is. Beauties walk on street with smile and happiness; END.<br/><br/>Like I said, old-school plot Name few talk about the same thing Er, INK? Yeah bad guys who bring bad impressions and good guys bring the good staff, to make the hero change or keep go down to hell Blabla.. What else? Well, there are a lot, aren't they? = =~~ (Shamecan't remember any) Okay, no way I could think through the fate vs. free will thing These are words around us all the time: fate, destination, soul mate, plan for life, desire, emotion Oh C'mon, what is it? Do I have a destiny? Who is my soul-mate? Can it be like that, I randomly meet a person and I will easily spend the rest of my life with him? How can such thing happens from no where? Love is a long journey. It comes with compromise.<br/><br/>It's a good thing though. If it comes, the Present of United States couldn't mean nothing. I believe that. : ) I don't care how much percent of this love is planed and how much is lead by my free will.<br/><br/>http://luluning.wordpress.com"

Matt Damon is a politician that sees the ""Adjustment Bureau"" and falls in love with Emily Blunt, but is never supposed to ever see her again I went into this movie thinking it would be a high action,edge of your seat, thriller. I was wrong. I would say the movie is 75% romance and 25% action/thriller, so I think that kind of disappointed me. I have nothing against romance movies, but I was just a bit let down by this one. Another problem I had with The Adjustment Bureau was that a lot of the dialogue was cheesy , for example, ""I need you to trust me."" Although, I wasn't too big of a fan of The Adjustment Bureau the acting was great from every actor and the effects were very well done. If you did not know 2011 set the record for the most sequels ever, with 27 sequels, so it was great to see an original storyline . Final Summary: A romantic thriller that could use some work. I went into this movie with very high expectations and was unfortunately let down . The Adjustment Bureau is not bad, but unfortunately not too good either."

","If you don't watch a lot of movies, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" will be an entertaining ride. If, like me, you've ""seen 'em all"", this one does not stand out in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Adjustment Bureau"" tells the story of David Norris (Matt Damon) and Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), two lovers seemingly destined to be together. However, a mysterious group of derby-wearing men in suits (known only as the Adjustment Bureau) do all they can to prevent the coupling in order for the world to stay on ""the plan"".<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that it tries to be so many different things and doesn't succeed at any of them. It's a romance, but without romantic tension. It's an action flick, but with no effects or chase scenes that stand out. It's a philosophical piece, but with little time to really dig in. It's a paranormal romp, but without any explanation in the end. Basically, it's one of those movies where the lead characters run around a lot, emote a tad, and end up with a very contrived, unappealing climax for the effort.<br/><br/>Thus, while ""The Adjustment Bureau"" doesn't outrightly fail at anything (hence the two star rating as opposed to one), it doesn't really succeed at much, either.

This is a similar mistake as the one they made with Dark City: this is not sci-fi enough or fantasy enough.<br/><br/>Seriously who thought there was room for a movie, let alone a good one, about a police force with absolute power on the course of our lives? The moment the hero is told about this the whole story falls flat because it is a goddamn gigantic hole that they would let him know without resetting him the minute after, and even if they thought he was worth the dare it would take sloppiness over sloppiness from the AAA+ uptight Adjustment crew to let a prominent profile slip through its claws.

","""Is love the ultimate affirmation of free will, or its negation?"" - Anson Shupe<br/><br/>Based on ""The Adjustment Team"", a 1954 short story by Philip K. Dick, George Nolfi's ""The Adjustment Bureau"" stars Matt Damon as a Congressman who has a chance encounter with Elise, a beautiful young woman. Damon, it later turns out, is being groomed by an agency called The Adjustment Bureau. A cross between angelic beings, deities, extraterrestrials and Rene Magritte paintings, the members of the Bureau are essentially puppet-masters who control mankind. Led by a mysterious, god-like figure called The Chairman, the Bureau manipulates various real world variables such that they have knock-on, future effects. Their goal? For Damon to fulfil his dream of becoming the future President of the United States. To accomplish this they must prevent Elise and Damon falling in love.<br/><br/>In the original short story, Dick turns the question of human agency into a real corporate agency – The Adjustment Bureau. The Bureau then essentially becomes a metaphor for investigating various then-novel ideas relating to hard and soft free-will, determinism, indeterminism, predestination, existentialism and cause-and-effect. The idea is that human beings have much less free-will than they typically imagine, and that a myriad of invisible entities, or invisible variables – social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc – are responsible for our actions, thoughts and who we are. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. Later Dick stories would push this further. The Self, what you think of as a free, independent controlling agent, would be reconfigured altogether; it becomes both Other and Nothing, a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of an interplay between the senses and consciousness) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. The self, what you think as You, is a relatively recently ""built"" neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. <br/><br/>Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of freewill, the Sovereigh Self and believe in something very much like Dick's ""Adjustment Team"". Entities do control us, they're just not literal sentient beings. To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stresses a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, God's given you the ability to choose, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (the self as illusion, a preoccupation with letting go, self as illusionary artifact of the mind, no independent bodies, only interconnected matter etc).<br/><br/>George Nolfi is a Christian, however, and has constructed ""The Adjustment Beaurea"" to reflect a very conservative, traditionally Christian slant. So in his hands The Chairman covertly becomes a stand-in for God and Damon is vaguely emblematic of various Biblical tenets. Damon has no choice, no free will, is a lowly animal, until he ""disobeys god's plan"" and ""chooses love"", which is then revealed to have been ""the plan all along"". Like a good Christian, Damon questions whether his will is better than god's plan and asks how can he be responsible if all is predestined by God. The final message is what some old Christian philosophers called the ""axiom of authentic love"". God's plan in the film is for Damon to freely choose between loving another and fulfilling his dreams of becoming the President.<br/><br/>While this may make a reasonably competent action thriller, philosophically it's mostly stupid (continuous rewrites have left the film thematically incoherent). In the real world there is no plan, there is no god, the lack of a plan doesn't necessarily mean man now has free will (one can have no free will precisely because they are buffeted by arbitrary variables) and the notion that ""choosing love"" signifies ""free choice"" ignores the fact that there are few things less free than ""romantic love"". Today many studies are starting to show that in issues of love, learning, choices, actions etc, your brain/body makes decisions long before you consciously know it, man acting before he becomes conscious of making the decision to act. In effect, we are so programmed that we can't even conceive of just how programmed we are. This is not to say that there is ""no such thing as free will"", but there are nuances and factors involved that completely contradict Nolfi's false binary. Nolfi puts ""Damon freely choosing to love Elise"" on one side, and ""Damon forced to obey a rigid plan"" on the other, but ""choosing to love Elise"" is exactly as ""unfree"" as ""obeying the plan"", and real world ""plan's"" are both as whimsically arbitrary yet as rigidly coded as this act of love. What the film wants you to believe in is a very Christian, Western version of Man as a wholly autonomous, free agents who is ""allowed by God to be free"" but only so that he may ""choose between good or bad"". It's not quite the Biblical blackmail tale of the New Testament, but is almost.<br/><br/>5/10 - Worth one viewing."

","What could have been a nifty, high-concept premise is hampered by poor execution in this supernatural thriller starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>The religious angle is pushed a little too hard for my personal taste, but I could even have swallowed that if it hadn't been couched in a lame script that spends half of its time delivering plot exposition straight up to the audience. There are a thousand plot holes throughout the movie that had my wife and I rolling our eyes with exasperation, and most of them are admittedly nicely resolved by the ending. But though I liked the resolution the movie came to -- and the message about the role free will plays in the lives of men -- a good movie doesn't make its audience wait until the very last scene to convince them that it's not just a stupid and badly-written piece of disposable junk.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is appealing as always, but her character is terribly annoying (I would have slapped her right around the time she dunked my cell phone in a cup of coffee), and Matt Damon is serviceable but unmemorable. John Slattery has fun simply playing a variation on Roger, his character from ""Mad Men,"" and Terence Stamp tries to bring some British dignity to the proceedings, if unsuccessfully.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

","Matt Damon, who looks and sounds in this film like another of the Kennedy clan as befitting his Boston background, stars in The Adjustment Bureau as a would be US Senator from New York State. He's just lost a race, but is looking eagerly for a comeback. And he's met whom he considers his soul-mate, promising young ballerina Emily Blunt. So what is wrong with this picture?<br/><br/>If you are of religious bent and are a conspiratorial theorist than you've waited all your life for a film like The Adjustment Bureau. The Christian Faith's central tenet is that the broad march of human history is predetermined and it would follow that those of us who are leaders of some kind also have a predetermined path to follow. The Adjustment Bureau is a group of supernatural beings who move and work among us, guiding us in their own way to those paths.<br/><br/>One of the Adjustment Bureau beings, Anthony Mackie, missed a cue and Damon and Blunt meet again and develop an attraction. This is not part of the master plan for the human race so for whatever reason we've got to keep them apart.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting and unique concept that doesn't quite know the conclusions it wants you to reach. Damon and Blunt are sincere and more than capable as the young lovers who someone upstairs is not willing to see together. Damon's problem is more unique, he actually stumbled upon the existence of this Adjustment Bureau and he gets more set in his ways to have Blunt come what may.<br/><br/>Where is God in all this? According to the film he's not in a separate and faraway place called heaven, but he's right here among us in the trenches of our everyday lives. If the message is a bit muddled, The Adjustment Bureau is still entertaining and interesting."

","I confess I liked this movie more than I expected to. While not being exactly profound, it is at least thoughtful. That is, while there are chase scenes and all, it never devolves into a mindless action flick, there's still a story going on and some actual ideas involved. And if it employs a ridiculously simplistic vision of history, at least it employs a vision of history. And I can never be too unhappy with a movie that comes down on the side of the Enlightenment!<br/><br/>But I confess that what I really liked was the romance. Chemistry is a funny thing, I guess, and I've seen reviews here which claimed that the two leads didn't have it. But that was not my experience. I definitely felt the two protagonists belonging together and was pulling for the romance throughout. Since I left the theater I keep thinking about sharing this film with my overseas girlfriend, so I guess that's pretty romantic. :)<br/><br/>A masterpiece? Maybe not.

Dick's short story (whose written work inspired - A Scanner Darkly, 2006; Paycheck, 2003; Minority Report, 2002; Total Recall, 1990; Bladerunner, 1982) brings together the often times human element that is only experienced as a supporting role but in this movie is made the central element in this movie.<br/><br/>The beginning scenes, especially with the John Slattery's character having an uneven tone between dramatic and wry humor, seem to almost take its manipulative premise almost too well and comes across just a scripted and manipulative for the audience as the characters in the movie itself. The Wil Smith character-look-a-like also is a bit distracting and his role in the movie seems a bit too obviously interfering and distracting somehow taking a little away from the totality of the movie's suspended authenticity.<br/><br/>Overall though, this movie quickly merges into a finely honed character-driven, emotive and compelling dramatic thriller and allows its principal characters to show the audience (us) in a fantasy in a fantasy of how we ourselves would like to see ourselves.

"gcsman","7","1","2","21 September 2017"," What is reality?
","Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick was born a couple of decades too soon. His output of stories and novels mainly in the 1960's and 70's were ahead of their time, or else too far off on a track of their own, even for the world of SF in his day. But now they're a gold mine for some of our most mind-bending movie and TV plots being made long after his death, often invoking nightmarish alternate worlds of hidden levels behind our apparently normal realities. These include Blade Runner, Minority Report, Paycheck, The Man in the High Castle, and The Adjustment Bureau among others.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is fun to watch and it's built on one simple but powerful idea (SPOILERS!): our individual histories and lives are constantly being monitored and tweaked by an organization (the Bureau) to make sure that they don't disrupt the Plan laid down by the Chairman, i.e. a God who's never on screen. Their operatives are an anonymous bunch of men in black suits and fedoras who can use ordinary doors to go from anywhere to anywhere else. (Interestingly the one thing they can't seem to do, however, is travel through time.) One clever device the movie introduces is the set of notebooks the operatives carry around, which have map pages that change in real time as their assigned targets move around, as if everyone in the world has a tracker.<br/><br/>This movie builds on its two main stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, who are two of the most attractive, versatile, and bankable actors we've got. For them, this movie is a pay-the-bills kind of role, but they still do good work. Supporting roles by Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and Terence Stamp are all fine as well. To give the script credit, it openly raises decent philosophical questions about free will and whether anyone, even the Chairman, should change the destinies of two people who will be very happy together. The main thing that I think holds this movie back from being more prominent might just be its budget and its level of ambition. It's generally well executed, but it stays small and at the B-movie level. It's not hard though to imagine a bigger-scale version, because the central idea of Hidden Reality beneath our own and manipulation of lives by shadowy operatives is just too good.<br/><br/>One last note -- the storyline reminded me of Isaac Asimov's novel The End of Eternity (from WAY back in 1955, well before Dick was writing). It's essentially the opposite side of the same coin: Asimov's story is built on the idea that lives and histories are 'adjusted' by operatives who can shuttle back and forth in time (but not space). It could make a good movie too."

I purchased it because it was on sale, and it was a sci-fi, thriller, romance with Emily Blunt and Matt Damon with 7.1 stars on IMDb. I figured it had to be good. This movie is more theology than sci-fi, and I assume the message is as offensive to the faithful as to those who do not subscribe to any faith:<br/><br/>""Selfishly follow your heart at all costs and everything will work out in the end even if it requires God to change His/Her master plan. Angels are nothing more than old, tired, bumbling idiots with magic hats easily overpowered by smart humans. Angels cannot prevent accidents, but can create circumstances that force the impulsive, brainless idiots who inhabit this planet to make adjustments in their lives.""<br/><br/>To the faithful, such notions of God and angels should be offensive. To those who do not subscribe to any faith, the message seems to be, ""We do not have freewill. There are masters of our fate. The only way to gain freewill is to ignore logic and act on impulse."" This message seems equally offensive.<br/><br/>Unlike a well done science fiction story, the movie was never able to suspend my disbelief. Each plot twist was so far fetched and unrealistic that it just irritated me more. The resolution increased rather than absolved that irritation.<br/><br/>Everything else about the movie was first rate: the acting, editing, special effects, etc. Therefore, I felt compelled to give it more than a single star. However, all the audio visual candy in the world cannot make a poor story worth watching."

Unfortunately there are forces that seems to be angels dressed in suits and hats who do whatever possible to keep them apart. Director George Nolfi handles much in this film and is given an intriguing visual appeal. The downfall is that the spiritual elements are a joke at best. Damon is superb as Norris whose political loss leads to love for which he is forbidden. He encounters her five years later thus alerting the mysterious beings who become threatening. Emily Blunt plays the woman in question, Elise whom charms the potential Senator yet feels a distance when Norris is constantly avoiding her at crucial times. An example arrives when she sprains an ankle during a ballet performance. He leaves her at the hospital after being warned again. These beings do not appear to be behaving like any angel from Biblical standards. They transcend through doors to altogether different places and cause havoc. Why they are keeping these two apart is just an excuse for lame romantic notions that are too dumb to examine. The whole idea of a kiss making a difference is another foolish element thrown in. Perhaps they should give up on these fairy tale notions and take a trip to reality. These angels need adjusted into a screenplay that takes it more seriously. Score: 5 / 10"

Unfortunately, despite the hugely extensive back story behind this fare, what it boils down to is a simple will they/won't they love story between Damon and the alluring Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>This development makes the repeated attempts at danger and suspense feel faintly ridiculous. I mean, would all the antagonistic characters - John Slattery, Terence Stamp, et al - really go to this level of trouble for something so, well, unimportant in the scheme of things? When the stakes are so low, the viewer just doesn't care.<br/><br/>There are good things in this: a solid turn (again) from Damon as a likable everyman hero for a change, well-handled direction and a lovely turn from the absolutely ravishing Blunt, but the attempts to meld old-fashioned thriller aspects with the romantic storyline just doesn't sit very well with me."

We get these all in the film but also much more, as we can expect from a film based on a short story by Philip K.

Actually there is a plan, a well organized plan and a quite big bureaucratic system with a well-established hierarchy which makes sure everything happens according to the plan and in extreme situations takes measures to adjust the disturbances. One of these happens to our heroes – the candidate senator played by Matt Damon meets accidentally and falls for the beautiful and talented ballerina played by Emily Blunt and they do not forget and search each other despite being separated for years and insist on getting together despite the plans of the great institution that was targeting the hero to become a future president, but a bachelor one for some reasons. In the antic tragedy the name of the institution was Destiny, Christianity and other religions call Him God, in this film his name is Chaiman, and his clerks have all very handy tablets which can be of help to a lot of things including shortcuts by secret backdoors in traffic-jammed Manhattan (sure, I want one, Apple, please!).<br/><br/>One does not feel at all that this is a first long feature film for director George Nolfi. However at some point I regretted this not being his second or third film – he has talent in telling a story, skills in directing the actors, if he only had dared going deeper in the direction of the dilemma and confrontation between fate and good will – we would have maybe received an even better movie.

The case workers tweak little things in order to guide David - not his personality, not his emotions, but with the purpose of keeping him on track so that he can achieve his purpose.

Now, looking at the average IMDb rating and the Rottentomatoes rating, I feel silly that I just saw this movie now. It was really, surprisingly good.<br/><br/>The main premise is intriguing enough that, for the most part, you're wondering how it's all going to end and how the characters are going to deal with their situations and the consequences. I found myself invested in the characters enough to want to see how it played out. I don't know if I'd go so far as to call it ""Inception-lite"" as some have described it, but its easily better than your average thriller though it does have less action. Coming from the guy who wrote the Bourne Ultimatum screenplay, I'm actually not surprised about the quality. Without spoiling anything, my 9/10 comes from the movie not only being a solid thriller, but from having two good overall messages that you just don't see in movies any more.<br/><br/>As a side note, this is the epitome of a perfect date movie. It mixes a great concept and thrills with a nice dose of romance that, in my opinion, didn't feel out of place one bit."

","I expected a high credibility movie on Mr. Damon's name alone, but only got a copy-paste no-brainer of a genre mix. As with ""Shutter Island"" it doesn't move me emotionally or intellectually- it just tries too hard to be intriguing by mixing genres.<br/><br/>Even trying to make the poster resemble that of ""North By North West"" doesn't recreate the unique thriller movie romance between Grant and Eva Marie Saint, neither makes Nolfi Hitchcock. And where Nolfi's idle running ""The Sentinel"" (2006) is carried through by solid acting(Douglas, Sutherland) as a more classic genre piece, Bourne, oops, correction, Damon and Blunt has not a quality mixed genre screenplay to work with.<br/><br/>Now, only ""Code 46""(2003, Winterbottom) or ""Blade Runner""(1982, R. Scott) can now erase my memory of a bad executed sci-fi romance. Even ""Minority Report""(2002, Spielberg) could do that, replacing romance with a level of development of Mr. Cruise's character.<br/><br/>2 for the sci-fi, 4 for the romance, 3 for the screenplay <br/><br/>9/11Truth- ask questions"

","This was a well crafted movie whose pacing seemed perfect. I won't go into details of the plot but Damon and Blunt were convincing as lovers who fight all the odds to achieve what we all wish for. It is fablesque, yet still well rooted in the modern world. It has a slight flavor of the darker movie, Dark City. Dark City was more sinister yet both had endings that affirmed life. <br/><br/>Matt Damon's image from the Bourne films help to give muscle to his characterization. And Emily Blunt is winningly real as the ballerina who gives his character's life new meaning and motivation. I enjoyed and recommend this movie."

"drqshadow-reviews","9","1","2","20 March 2012"," Excellent, Convention-Challenging Science Fiction
","An excellent Philip K. Dick adaptation that comes off as neither too cerebral nor too wantonly action-heavy. Matt Damon slides into the role of a brash, combustible young politician in the mold of JFK, whose chance meeting with his dream girl sets off a chain reaction that alters his perception of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he stumbles across the delegates of a shadow agency, who freeze time and bend reality to tinker with the thoughts and feelings of the population, all in the name of a precise global timeline. Damon, naturally, is immune to their tricks and bolts from the scene. As a science fiction twist on the cat and mouse game, it's a blast of fresh air with an admirable sense of restraint. In a perfect world these agents would do their jobs without being noticed at all, so their methods consist of a series of slick, downplayed visual tricks and slight tweaks to the natural order. That sensibility works for their own purposes, but also for the film's: the special effects are equally moderate, and as a result more believable. Damon and Emily Blunt click right away as a duo, so well in fact that it's no challenge at all to root for them from the get-go, and the agency itself is far from the black-and-white, good-versus-evil gang of naughty henchmen you might expect. A tense, creative adventure with perhaps a tad too much sentimentality, it's a raging, surprising, success."

","Stories involving time travel, alternate realities and dream worlds are usually enough to make your head hurt, but this one seemed to flow a bit more naturally than most considering the genre. The concept at the core of the story appears to be an examination of the concept of fate versus free will, and the writing for the picture can be quite clever at times. Others on this board cite ""The Matrix"" frequently in coming up with comparisons for this picture, and the thought occurred to me as well while watching. The Chairman could have been The One or The Force just as easily, but I also found myself thinking ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" when Richardson (John Slattery) related Man's mucking up things on Earth for the better part of history. Pictures like this done well can inspire, just as The Chairman was inspired to rewrite the programming for David (Matt Damon) and Elise (Emily Blunt). They can also create paralysis if one remains subject to the fates and resist exercising the free will that's an inherent part of humanity's makeup. I liked this one; like the principal players I felt recalibrated by the experience and never once was confused enough to feel like I had reached my ripple limit."

It's hard to understand how anyone would risk a career by participating in making it or wish to throw money away financing it. The scenes and the photography, however, are quite good. I'm amazed that a talented cinematographer would get involved in such a mess. It is in fact so bad that there is a fascination with seeing if it can get any worse as it progresses. It does.

After losing an election, he meets Elise in the bathroom and she inspires him to make a great speech, setting him up to run again. He gets her number, but then the workers of fate intervene. It seems, they let him meet Elise just to inspire the speech, but the Plan says they are not to be together. David works endlessly to change the Plan.

Sure it had an interesting plot and some minor buildup but the whole movie had a been there done that feel to it. Almost a paint by numbers ""Lifetime meets Syfy"" movie of the week with a bigger budget. And scenes that should have been thrilling and adventurous were ruined by it's artsy-folksy"" soundtrack. I felt no real chemistry between the leads. And it had about the cheesiest ending imaginable. And God did I hate the soundtrack. I think the Chairman missed correcting that mistake too.<br/><br/>Terence Stamp stole the movie with an almost phoned in performance. Of course the few moments he was actually on screen had me glued. A tribute to how talented he is. After all he was General Zod.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say the movie sucked but I did expect a lot more.

Was the adjustment bureau a fail-safe device for the grand creator to fix what once went wrong? Dr Beckett... Paging Dr. Beckett! Only in the end to figure out he was right, then wrong, then right after all? And to prove it he just changes the ending. Sadly these concepts were only lightly tip-toed on.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Philip K Dick novella yet so I can't compare the two.

"trevorruth","5","1","2","26 October 2011"," The Average Bureau
","From a sort of perspective, The Adjustment Bureau seems fresh in terms of plot, and the idea seems promising. However, I can't help but compare it to Dark City by Alex Proyas, which is a far superior film. The reason for this, is that Dark City reaches to high levels in terms of all storytelling methods. The Adjustment Bureau falls short thanks to Matt Damon's less-than-adequate acting, and the lack of development for the incompetent and somewhat ignorant antagonists. The film carries a dark tone, suggesting that it's meant to be taken seriously, which is hard when you face minor inconsistencies that you will pick up on the first viewing. The action scenes were dull, it just felt like they had to be there, and when you start to analyze it all, the idea seems somewhat ludicrous. Not to criticize Phillip K. Dick here, but a secret organization that was created to make sure that everything is perfect with the world, and their main priority is if two people fall in love with each other? Highly improbable. With that said, I do like the industrial scenery, the creative camera work, and watching the beautiful Emily Blunt is always a treat. But otherwise, I'd say this movie is alright, at best."

","It's excused if you didn't see The Adjustment Bureau in theaters. After all, adult hard sci-fi thrillers aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea. Ones that feature plenty of men in fedoras though, thankfully, are right up my alley. And seeing as this particular Adjustment Bureau is based on a Phillip K. Dick short story, I knew I would be in very good company.<br/><br/>See, what those guys wearing great head gear do is they open up their little nifty CG booklets and when someone does something they're not supposed to, they use all manners of tricks to get them back on course. Like a traffic tie up to cause you miss an important meeting you would have been made to look foolish for, only so that later during a reschedule you end up nailing a promotion. Or maybe during a chase, you'll slip and fall and lose sight of the one you are making eyes for on the train only to never see them again. It's a destiny vs free choice type situation, and I'm pretty well tugged in by Matt Damon's charismatic character.<br/><br/>He does end up having one of those moments when this girl is exactly what he feels he must have in this world. And, of course, those pesky people in fedoras keep trying to remind him, subtlety and then more aggressively otherwise, that not only will he not continue on his path of political fame if he peruses her, she'll miss out on her opportunities as well. So the question becomes not necessarily destiny vs free choice, but what's more important, goals and ambition or love sweet love.<br/><br/>Things get a little ripe and over the top the further down the rabbit hole Mr. Damon travels. We're given more and more world building and rules as we go along. Sometimes it feels they're just making stuff up to satisfy a plot, and I suppose that's mostly what such fantasy flicks are required to do. But it seems to much at times and I'm still not quite sure how much I'm falling for the romance angle that progressively gets harder to root for.<br/><br/>Still, one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Or a gift movie that's actually very entertaining throughout and provides more than its fair share of nail-biting suspenseful moments in the midst of good old fashioned adult storytelling. Characters are great, it's filmed well, and I'm so wanting to buy myself a fedora now."

The plot is separated by a few convenient flash forwards where the characters seamlessly pick up right where they left off. This gives the film a lack of flow and was probably a byproduct of lazy screen writing. The plot just never gets that interesting, even the chase scene's are short and uninteresting.The plot basically boils down to the love story between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's characters with the interesting Sci-Fi aspect as a framework. The relationship never seems to get to deep which left me not caring whether or not they ended up with each other in the end.<br/><br/>Matt Damon did a pretty good job considering the mediocre script. His character, however, was very flat. The dialogue is very uninteresting and the back stories are lazily pasted in in an attempt to give the characters some depth.<br/><br/>I thought this movie would at least succeed to entertain me with slick action and a mind-bending story line.

Surprised at what's happening to him, finding a girl in the mens-room, David is so impressed with Elise in what she tells him about being himself instead of the phony baloney that his political handlers made him out to be that he gives the speech of his now almost dead political career by being honest for the first time in his now defunct campaign for senator of New York State!<br/><br/>A few days later when David ran into Elsie on a NYC transit bus he mistakenly spilled hot coffee on her dress and offered to pay the laundry bill for it in order to get her both address and phone number. The trouble with all that is that the coffee spill happened 15 minutes after it was supposed to happen,at David's apartment, thus screwing up what fate, or the ""Adjustment Bureau"", had in store for him! And that was to change not only David's but Elise's life as well and put the ""Adjustment Bureau"" headed by head man Thomas, Terrance Stamp,into overdrive to correct it!<br/><br/>Based on a 1954 short story by science fiction writer Philip Dick ""The Adjustment Bureau"" delivers the goods to its audience in how the phrase ""Love Conquers all"" is as meaningfully now in an age of selfish greed and loose morals as it was some 60 years when it was first published. David was salted to not only to become a state senator but the President of the United States if he just played his cards right in going along with what the men of the ""Adjustment Bureau"" had planned for him.

The end couldn't come soon enough when both David and Elise were about to be lobotomized by Thomas and his fellow adjusters that the ""Big Man"" or the ""Chairman"", can you just guess who he is, came to their rescue in changing their futures, and lifetime book reviews, in order to keep them together not, like Thomas planned all along, apart!

"GenXer","6","1","2","26 June 2011"," Intelligent psychodrama -- perhaps unintentionally!
","There is plenty of evidence supporting the claim that this movie is a misfire: a feeble attempt to be science fiction and a love story at the same time, and failing on both fronts. But I think that from a different perspective, it is actually a smart and thought-provoking little film -- although Nolfi might not have intended it that way!<br/><br/>In spite of its good acting and engaging chemistry between Damon and Blunt, I did not enjoy watching this film. It made me angry, because I kept thinking that the Adjustment Bureau, as an entity, was far more important and pressing than being obsessed with a girl that one has met in the bathroom and has spent a grand total of 7 minutes with -- no matter how beautiful or charismatic she may be. When faced with the awe and grandeur of a superhuman presence who has steered the course of human civilization, all other mundane concerns shrink into insignificance. The fact that David Norris didn't get this simple concept showed me just how contrived and dishonest this movie was. I was ready to walk out in the middle of it.<br/><br/>What kept me watching it though was the possibility that this was precisely Nolfi's point. Here is a young man destined to assume a position of great leadership, and yet his life is marked by an endless stream of poor judgments and bone-headed decisions. From the fraternity prank, to kissing a strange girl he just met in the bathroom after losing a big election, to his senseless obsession with her, to his lack of curiosity about the greater notion of an Adjustment Bureaus, to hitting an elderly gentleman in the hospital waiting room ... This guy simply was not playing with a full deck. He was unbalanced, irrational, compulsive, and generally not very bright, and apparently not at all curious. Who wants to have someone like that in the White House anyway?! At the end, he gets the girl, and we get to breathe a collective sigh of relief that his life has been shifted away from the Presidency, and the danger has been averted! <br/><br/>I am giving George Nolfi a lot of credit here with this interpretation. I hope I'm right. If not, the guy is just an awful writer."

Yet if both join together against the organizations wishes, both will succumb to drastic changes to their own futures which David will not become president, and Elsie will not become a famous dancer. This film shows great aspects of how the human condition really see themselves. It causes a person to think, what if I turn right instead of left? Or what road at the cross sections do I walk down? David did not care, all he knew was how to love Elsie, and ignore how the fates dealt the cards. A wonderful story of true devotion, in the ranks of humans, and how even a few employees of the chairman can defy their own orders in the face of love. Fate is not always written in stone. We don't know what to chisel first. But that is the mystery. Excellent movie, highly recommended."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","21 June 2011"," Science fiction that places humanity above high concept
","The best science fiction is often the kind that doesn't feel like science fiction at all. Almost always, the genre's most lauded stories and films earn that praise for never losing their human qualities in the face of elaborate story structure, futuristic props and set pieces and stylish action. That's why Hollywood so often returns to the work of Philip K. Dick, a master of idea-based science fiction. Screenwriter George Nolfi makes his directing debut with an adaptation of Dick's ""Adjustment Team,"" a story that possesses a true human factor that Nolfi weaves up through the concept's intricacies and to the surface.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" lacks for any reason to be labeled an action movie. The ""action"" of the film entails Matt Damon running away and throwing a few punches. The only intensity comes from chase sequences. Perhaps ""romantic thriller"" would be the best way to describe the film, for at its heart, ""Adjustment Bureau"" is a love story whose obstacles have been manifest into science fiction.<br/><br/>Damon stars as David Norris, a young up-and-coming politician who seems a shoo-in for winning one of New York's U.S. Senate seats, but loses after an impulsive practical joke is caught on camera and affects public opinion. While writing his concession speech in the bathroom of the Waldorf, he bumps into Elise (Emily Blunt), a woman who captivates him instantly. She inspires him to deliver a candid speech that puts him in position for another run in four years, but disappears that evening without a trace. Days later they run into each other on a bus and David gets her number. All seems well, except that exchange wasn't supposed to happen. In fact, David and Elise are not meant to be together period.<br/><br/>That's according to the Adjustment Bureau, a team of men in fedoras that work for a mysterious Chairman who orchestrates the fate of all. The Chairman has agents working for him, such as Harry (Anthony Mackie) and Richardson (John Slattery) who see to it that things go according to plan. Harry, in particular, has long been assigned to ensuring David follows his path, as great things are in store for him. When Harry fails to make the one thing happen that will prevent David and Elise from reconnecting, David ends up seeing behind the curtain and learning the hard truth, one that he refuses to accept. He realizes he must find a way to outsmart the Bureau if he ever wants to be with her.<br/><br/>The classic ""fate vs. free will"" debate manifests itself quite poignantly in this film. Although overtly so at the onset, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" confronts the concept in a more direct way thanks to the brilliance of Dick's concept. What makes this film execute it right is the ever-so-critical lead chemistry. Considering the plot revolves completely around whether David has control over his destiny with Elise, creating the viewer's desire for the success of their relationship is Nolfi's most crucial task. Luckily, Blunt and Damon light up the screen, especially Blunt, who gives Elise an attitude and a foul mouth to go along with her elegance. Only down the stretch in the film's last sequence does their relationship feel forced or overblown.<br/><br/>As science fiction, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" manages to cover up issues of implausibility to make you understand how the Bureau itself works and functions and using what rules. They simply represent — in human form — that which we attribute to chance. They even have a fallibility to them, which adds a nice touch that few sci fi films open themselves up to, and it allows Nolfi to insert some humor to prevent the film from getting to self-serious. Some might desire to see the Bureau as a relentless and powerful group ala hard sci fi, but this film recognizes that not all science-fiction concepts can be so pristine and perhaps they can even benefit from a few scuff marks.<br/><br/>Not only does ""The Adjustment Bureau"" never lose sight of the human factor, but it also prioritizes it, which makes the film accessible to a wider audience. The film amounts to a story of love overcoming the odds, only the odds are guys in suits who can control the flow of the universe. The merging of these genres might lead to some sacrifices on both ends, but it makes for an enjoyable film with universal appeal.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","i cannot believe all the good reviews here. so not true.<br/><br/>the idea is good, but the realization of it is too poor to bother. <br/><br/>the movie is slow, boring and flat. there is no intrigue. the story is too obvious. there are no jokes, there is no romance, not a real one. the characters are not convincing, even if played right. neither one of them is even close to be alive. <br/><br/>what is this movie about? the things mentioned there: politics( not about them), manipulating people (nope), dancing (not even close), love (there is no love, even if they say the ""l"" word), fate vs luck (only my bad luck to watch this one)? this is not even about people directing your lives without you mentioning it. <br/><br/>the trailer was good though. too good if compared to the movie itself. <br/><br/>i feel sorry for the actors, seriously. they should be bored to death in the studio. it is a miracle they managed to finish the shooting. <br/><br/>it could be a good action movie or a good romance movie, or both, if written and directed right. shame it did not happen.<br/><br/>and you know how it end after watching the first 10 minutes of it, including the trailers and commercial.<br/><br/>bottom line: i feel bad about spending almost 2 hours of my life watching it. stay away, if you can."

Much like ""Inception"" this is a dramatic/sci-fi/thriller, and it seems like this may be a new genre and type of movie that will continue to be made. I am OK with that. A great cast adds to the enjoyment of the movie and this is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Overall I would say if you liked ""Inception"" you will love this one.

","As a European I can't help feeling a bit nauseated when I saw this movie. What first seems to be a story of impossible love turns out to be religious pro-American nonsense. What this movie basically says is that GOD is on Americas side. So much so that he/she/it takes a personal interest in a young and upcoming politician (Damon) and alters events in he's life so that he can be groomed into becoming the next president. Because America is SO important that if the right president isn't elected, the world will go belly up. I can think of a few other nations where Gods intervention would be more needed. Like N. Korea, China, Iran to name a few. Didn't the world get enough ""god is on our side"" crap"" when George W. Bush was in office? What's really sad is to see Matt Damon in this pile of crap."

","First off, Matt Damon portraying a suit & tie congressman, I didn't buy it and I was constantly aware of this throughout the movie, he never looked comfortable in his suit (and certainly not running in it) I like Damon but I think he was miscast in this movie. I would have gone for someone more charming, like Hugh Jackman, Ewan McGregor or Eric Bana.<br/><br/>The idea of the office angels and their adjustments was interesting, making them look and operate like a big firm with a chairman was kind of clever but in my opinion it took all the mystery and charm out of it. In a couple of warehouse type scenes I thought there were too many of them as well, just standing around trying to look menacing. The riot- cop-angel types I also found unnecessary and quite silly, they seemed only to be there for the trailer to look more like a Bourne action movie. <br/><br/>Terence Stamp was excellent as always. <br/><br/>So, interesting idea, and maybe if done differently, a little adjustment to the story, casting or directing, could have made for a decent film."

In other words, we think we have free will and we believe we make our own choices, but what if someone was making small adjustments behind our backs to make sure we followed a certain path? Those are the questions The Adjustment Bureau raises in this science- fiction romantic movie. Rookie director, George Nolfi (known for writing Ocean's Twelve and adapting the screenplay for The Bourne Ultimatum), does a great job at combining two unrelated genres such as science- fiction and romance and meshing them together to create this thought provoking film. <br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a young politician named David Norris, running for Senator in New York.

The Adjustment Bureau claims these ¨accidents¨ are actually planned most of the time and they serve to keep their subjects on the right path in order to fulfill their purpose.<br/><br/>The premise is good but the delivery poor, I liked the idea of a bureau that controls world destiny, but the dudes I saw in the movie could have been more slick more bad ass, when I finally settled down to accepting what was on the plate I realized half way through that nothing big was going to happen the story is simply about the bureau trying to keep Blunt's and Damon's characters apart. That was its main flaw. It din't have any twist at the end or anything BIG happening. And also the romance though its beautiful, I just din't understand how someone can fall in love so quickly so easily. These are the only problems with the movie.<br/><br/>Yet it is oddly enjoyable, since it is less a piece of science fiction than an old-fashioned romance between an aspiring politician and a successful dancer. Each of the leads is immensely watchable and genuinely talented and together they create real chemistry. <br/><br/>A pretty decent low key SF film. Nothing great, nothing earth shattering. But, if you want a break from all the action movies masquerading as SF, it's worth catching. I rate it 6 out of 10 for the original concept and performances."

","Especially in Science Fiction, to have a great idea is not enough. You have to build a story around that idea, cause if you don't, then the whole picture feels like it's out of place. I think this move was originally a great idea that didn't work just because they didn't find a good story to tell around it. As a result, when I watched it I felt it was too unreal. When you are in front of a good sci-fi movie, you really don't stop to think if it could be true, but you think yourself ¨what an amazing story¨. That doesn't happen here. Here, the guys with hats, the doors, and the whole fantastic environment around a real city feels like out of place. Feels like if in Driving Miss Daisy suddenly the car flies away. Good crazy ideas with great stories: Matrix, Inception, Stranger than Fiction, Cold Souls, The 13th Floor and Dark City (among others). The Adjustment Bureau is not in that group. A good idea in a bad story."

The Adjustment Bureau is without a doubt the best romantic film I've seen this year (and I never expected to be saying this after watching the trailers for this movie). The film is actually based on a short story written by Phillip K. Dick (who is better known for his other short story ¨Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ¨ which was adapted into a movie you might have heard of: Blade Runner). The movie is not perfect, but I enjoyed every second of it thanks to the great chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. There is just something about forbidden love that makes you root for both these characters because it somehow feels wrong that outside forces can be a factor in their lives. Any normal human being would understand that these two people were meant for each other.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a young politician named David Norris, running for Senator in New York.

He discovers that love after all does conquer all things. The success of the movie doesn't actually rely on trying to answer the question whether or not we control our destiny or if we are manipulated by outside forces, the true success of the film relies on the chemistry between Damon and Blunt.

"jzappa","5","1","2","21 May 2011"," Diet Bulworth and Manic Pixie Dream Girl Literally Outrun Fate with a Hat
","We open as Matt Damon, a surefire candidate for senator, is familiarized to us via a pretty uninspired hodgepodge that includes the as-themselves cameos we now wait for in politically themed films, to provide what might misguidedly be referred to as realism. But he loses his lead and, rehearsing his concession speech in a hotel restroom, discovers Emily Blunt hiding from security. Instantly attracted to each other, of course, they kiss before being interrupted, of course. But, inspired by this stranger's generic advice, he makes a truly candid speech that revitalizes his ratings. But he ends up falling for that fleeting woman, becoming increasingly distracted from his career, despite mysterious men collaborating to keep them apart.<br/><br/>Yes, they're agents of fate itself, so the lovers must either literally outrun it, or accept a predetermined path, which, ironically, the story unashamedly does almost from the get-go. And in due course, a characteristically paranoid Philip K. Dick tale about the easily broken textile of reality is reassessed as a comforting parable about true love's fortune and the correctness of the divine plan. This reassessment aspires to induce the intense visceral emotion of a high-flying romance that exceeds time, space and the natural order of things, but George Nolfi's writing is short of the crisp, relevant impact such material needs, which it isn't anyway when you already have a brilliant Dick story there's no legitimate worldly reason to substitute! And yet, the film still uses Dick's name, basically as an advertisement. Nolfi takes Dick's idea and runs, letting go of pages along the way, until he's left with only a torn title page, and a strained adjoining of two reasonably agreeable, remarkably featureless individuals that rouses none of the profound, awe-inspiring excitement essential in a storyline so deep in philosophy and metaphysics. Their rebellious romance never even moves much past the convention of the contrived encounter of two potential lovebirds in serendipitously unusual circumstances, followed by the contrived interval of mopey separation. It's but one de rigueur element of a script that grapples for a consistent shape, even resorting to Magical Negro and Retro Chic clichés, to significantly be about more than beautiful people fleeing from badass-looking bureaucrat-style villains through an expressive cityscape.<br/><br/>After the initial disappointment in the film's resorting to manipulative schmaltz, its social implications are no surprise. Whenever Blunt and Damon are broken away, he takes for granted that, unless he can find her again, he'll never see her again. Sure, it's hard to find a woman in NYC when you know nothing more about her than her first name. It's a comparatively trouble-free achievement, however, to locate a superstar Senate nominee. But regardless of the movie's depiction of Blunt as an independent, progressive chick, she never takes any enterprise in any way to reconnect with the love of her life, nor does it ever dawn on anyone that she could. When Damon loses her number, she sulks for three years! When he's forced to forsake her in a hospital, she waits, brokenhearted, for 11 more months. This one-sidedness is made unmistakable when a divine courier praises Damon for his determination against all chances and then praises Blunt for, well, going along. This rare dud in the fight-the-system disposition of films portrays itself as a tribute to forging one's own future, provided, namely, that you happen to be a guy.<br/><br/>But the point is that Dick's musings on celestial formalities have a mischievous, sardonic tone, and Nolfi's gratuitous revamping is less effective. The trilby hats, which grant extraordinary powers when worn by the members of the Bureau, and later the hero, are particularly difficult to take seriously! They're incapable of crossing interdimensional doorways that convey them instantaneously across Manhattan unless they're wearing, yes, their hats. But to be fair, on the whole, the script forces gullibility not with its offbeat imagination but with its dull particulars: We can't buy that security is in dogged search of this clearly harmless uninvited guest, nor, to name another plot point, are we persuaded that Damon's career would be wrecked by media hype about him mooning his college friends. If you're going to botch Dick, at least be as consistent as Dick.<br/><br/>This movie is for those who want to have their fate both ways. The movie sustains the notion that an omnipotent ""Chairman"" has a plan for our existence, yet this plan is not so inflexible that it excludes freedom. And yet when we seem to bring that self-rule to bear, we find we're still sticking to a master plan, one so vast even the ""adjusters"" working at Earth level can't keep a handle on it. Deus ex machina performs such a key function in the way events resolve that it's challenging to leave feeling anything other than resentful, like a potential piece of brilliance has been unkindly run off with."

It's a Wonderful World (1939), Mr. Destiny (1990), Retroactive (1997), The Family Man (2000), Serendipity (2001), Primer (2004), Next (2007), Push (2009), Inception (2010) and The Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003). They're all science fiction movies, you say? Close but that's not the answer I'm looking for. <br/><br/>They all are Hollywood surreal stories, metaphors of one or another 'good over evil' or 'true love truncates all' artsy fartsy production we love so much. Matrix trilogy is the mother of surreal metaphors, in my book, and Inception has got to be the one pushing the envelope of ""are you following this?"" scenario, aside from being visually stimulating. European metaphor movies tend to take a darker more sinister path and thus are not as ideal for selling junk food as Hollywood ones are. The latest in surreal metaphors is this one, ""The Adjustment Bureau"". It rates a pretty steady 7 among sites that comment and rate (my usual sources) movies. As I'm a fan of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt (loved her ""Sunshine Cleaning""), I warn you readers that I'll be biased here. <br/><br/>The IMDb storyline is quite good; I suggest you read it. What makes this movie novel and interesting for me is the way the sci-fi characters are written to be so earthy. The bureaucratic like, sort of angels, expression to paraphrase Anthony Mackie's character Harry Mitchell in the movie, are written to be quite unpretentious. The writer even use the expression 'case file' when referring to Damon-Blunt lives. The concept works well and the writer Philip K. Dick has an excellent track record with this sort of sci-fi themes. The roles are well cast; the experienced Terrence Stamp and John Slattery acquit themselves very well in their roles as 'case managers'. The Adjustment Bureau's role is well outlined to the audience by Slattery's character, Richardson. Doing that, explaining the Adjustment Bureau, was not just performed well, it was necessary and the timing, when to deliver that explanation, was as close to perfect as can think of. <br/><br/>All Mat Damon's fans will love the movie and those who are not fans of any actor should also like the movie. I think Damon, who just recently starred in ""Hereafter"", should give those themes a break and I see by Damon's list of films in production that he's doing just that. I enjoyed it and will be recommending to my friends."

","I know how revered Phillip K. Dick is among the sci-fi community, so I'll not offend, other than to say I wasn't taken in. Based on his short story, 'The Adjustment Team', this film follows other film adaptations of his books, notably 'Blade Runner' and 'Minority Report'.<br/><br/>Prior to going on stage, David Norris (Matt Damon) encounters Elise (Emily Blunt) in the gents. She's an unauthorised guest at his campaign rally (he's running for Senate) and is hiding there. The pair hit it off immediately. Minus a parting kiss, their interaction is non-physical, but deliciously seductive. Beguiled by Elise's sweet- nothings, Norris ignores his carefully rehearsed, meticulously researched speech and speaks from the heart. And it's a cinematic sucker-punch.<br/><br/>Thing is, they weren't supposed to meet. That's where the sci-fi kicks in. The Adjustment Bureau are God's angels, although they are coy about saying so. They busy themselves ensuring that every person's plan – that's their life plan – goes according to plan. They intervene whenever it seems someone is going off plan by making 'adjustments'.<br/><br/>For servants of the Messiah, the Bureau's powers are dubiously limited and conditional. They're a bunch of Inspector Clouseaus. They don't even have good dialogue ('It doesn't matter how you feel', one Bureau member says to Norris, 'What matters is what's in black and white'). Good Lord! <br/><br/>AB members live 'a little longer than humans', can't exact too many adjustments, can't exact any adjustments near water and can't even answer Norris when he asks (many times to allow them to confer and get back to him) why they are so interested in his plan. When AB head Terrence Stamp finally answers, we're so unconcerned that we want there to be an adjustment to end the film.<br/><br/>Beneath all the bull, like the ramblings on free will, there's tenderness. Damon never stops searching for Elise, never stops overcoming the hurdles the Bureau put in front of him. He's like Indiana Jones whizzing around New York via special doors, accessible by wearing a Bureau fedora. Damon's chemistry with Blunt recalls the chemistry he had with Vera Farminga in 'The Departed', but with a higher bonding of electrons and neutrons.<br/><br/>If 'The Adjustment Bureau' is sure it's a sci-fi film, it should be taken with salt. Watch it as a rom-com instead - that's where the real fantasy lies.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"
"Otterman_MK2","7","1","2","21 March 2011"," It's not Inception, but it's pretty good.
","I've always been a fan of high-concept films, Inception being my favourite of the lot. I love the originality and brilliant new ideas the script writers put forward. The Adjustment Bureau puts forward a brilliant idea that raises questions, but the film's story does not quite live up to the potential of the brilliant ideas put forward.<br/><br/>The basic bulk of the story is a simple but satisfying love story. The real fun begins when a group of mysterious suit-wearing gentlemen show up interfere in the life of the protagonist. Their arrival raises questions as to how much choice we really have as human beings, if history is written, and even goes so far as to suggest the existence of god. In the end, who or what the (adjustment bureau) are is a matter of the audience's opinion and interpretation. My only real gripe with this movie is just as it starts to get deeper into the concept itself, we are still left wondering, with only a few questions answered.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I thought Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both played their roles perfectly on screen and the chemistry between them was great. In fact, I personally couldn't find any bad acting here.<br/><br/>It's well worth a watch, and 7/10 does feel a little harsh. I just really wish I could have discovered more about this mysterious organisation...."
"ddelamaide","6","1","2","21 March 2011"," Silly movie
","The plot of this movie is just plain silly, though the stars and the production quality make it a watchable kind of silly if that's what you're in the mood for. <br/><br/>Philip K. Dick has written some genuinely intriguing stories made into movies (Blade Runner, Minority Report), but this isn't one of them. In the Hollywood version, it has some trite metaphysics to distract from the banality of the romance. The script and the sight gags display enough wit to further mask the fact that this is ultimately a very unsatisfying ""toying"" with the mind. Since most of the comments seem to be positive, I suppose that those whose votes are weighing down the average simply aren't taking the time to articulate their disapproval."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","18 March 2011"," Second Foundation
","My two-word summary line demands elaboration. The greatest sci-fi author ever, late Isaac Asimov, published his Foundation Trilogy in three consecutive years starting in 1951 and culminating in 1953 with ""Second Foundation"". Interesting to note that the source of the screenplay of this movie, Philip K. Dick's short story ""Adjustment Team"", was published in 1954. While the two piece of fictional work have very different backdrops – the former set in millenniums in the future while the latter (and the movie inspired by it) is contemporary (i.e. the time of their creation) - there are remarkable similarities.<br/><br/>Second Foundation is a team of mentalist with a quest to keep on track a master plan (the ""Seldon Plan"") to ensure the survival and well-being of humanity. They have power to adjust human minds and events, but only at a minimum level lest the ripple effect leads to serious, adverse unintended consequences. This is exactly what the ""Adjustment Bureau"" does. While ""Second Foundationers"" come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, members of the ""Adjustment Team"" are uniformly male (insofar as the movie goes) similarly attired in banal business wardrobe topped with a feroda.<br/><br/>While there certainly must have been temptations to render the movie into a lofty dissertation of free will versus predestination, director George Nolfi wisely leans towards the other angle – a romance, or even rom-com if you shift your focus a little more to the witty rapport between high-potential politician David Morris (we're talking eventual presidency here) and super-talented ballet dancer Elise Sellas (potential leading world-class choreographer). According to the Adjusters' ""book"" they are not supposed to meet, but against all odds (or should it be ""with the help of all odds""?) they meet by pure chance, not only once, or twice, but three times over a span of three years. Once the sparkle is ignited, no amount of intervention from the Adjusters can pull them apart in order that they can each follow their predestined path to lofty achievements. This is basically the plot.<br/><br/>In romance genres like this one, everything depends on the two leads and if they fail, nothing else can salvage the movie. Here, we have two that don't (fail, that is). Emily Blunt portraying Elisa does not have too big a challenge as the character is completely unaware of the plot complications. But she needs to be convincing as a young woman who falls in love at first sight and follows through with utmost devotion. With her fragile vulnerability nested in a bright, playful persona, Blunt is beautifully convincing. Matt Damon is at his best as the indomitable bad boy politician with a sympathy-earning underdog childhood. The scene of their first encounter is vital, a foundation upon which the credibility of the romance is built. Don't get distracted by the somewhat unorthodox venue of a men's restroom (which some critics make too much out of) but watch the pitch-perfect timing and delivery of the well written dialogue. Watch for the ignition of emotion and mutual attraction underneath the outwardly flippant exchanges. Blunt and Damon cruised through this vital scene effortlessly.<br/><br/>There is a fantastic trio of support of the three Adjusters. Playing Harry (The Good) is Anthony Mackie who gained general recognition with his performance in ""The hurt locker"". Always recognizable is John Slattery playing Richardson (The Ugly), not a bad guy by nature but simply a typical civil-servant type following orders and excelling in dealing with problems by ""kicking them upstairs"". ""Upstairs"" is my personal favourite Terence Stamp, ever since his performance as a young sailor in ""Billy Budd"" in 1962, that is, three years before his signature performance in ""The collector"" (1965). In ""The Adjustment Bureau"" he plays Thompson (The Bad), who is high up in the hierarchy but not quite at the top. The three of them add significantly to the pleasure from watching this movie."

","Yes, if not for the wife being a huge fan of Matt Damon, I don't think we would have bothered to go and see this movie. We saw a few reviews comparing it to Inception, which we both thought was awful, but finally decided it just couldn't be that bad, so off we went. Boy, are we glad we did. Just goes to show that comparing one movie to another can sometimes, and more often than not is, the wrong thing to do. We loved this movie. It's got romance and the spark between Damon and Blunt was amazing. It's got intrigue, suspense, lots of action, a few laughs, and is very entertaining, the way all movies should be, but so few are. This is definitely the best movie to come out so far this year, and if you don't see it, then you're just cheating yourself out of some solid entertainment."

But it wasn't as mind-blowing as 'Inception' was, though.<br/><br/>I'm glad that the movie lived up to the promises of action, thrill and romance that was shown in the trailer. The people who decided what to put in the trailer should also be given props. Not much was given away, but the audience got the gist of the movie. I was surprised at many events that happened during the viewing. All trailers should be like this one, not like those overly long trailers like 'Charlie St. Cloud' where they practically reveal everything. This movie had a great trailer that attracted lots of expectant viewers to a great movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where it feels like the events could actually be happening in real life. What if all those little times when we had a blackout or when the TV screen becomes static-y or when we drop our things, were all planned to somehow alter our course in life? It made me wonder.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. I would have given this movie a perfect 10 if I hadn't got brainwashed by some of the posts in the discussion board.

","Finally, an original take on the over done love story about boy meets girl, boy can't be with girl, boy does what ever it takes to be with girl. There is a twist this time around concerning an uncontrollable higher power as boy redefines the meaning of giving up everything. Writer Director George Nolfi (Writer, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") creates another thrilling screenplay with its roots coming from a short story called the ""Adjustment Team,"" written by Philip K. Dick starring Matt Damon (""Hereafter"") and Emily Blunt (""The Young Victoria""). Damon plays a party hard young man named David Norris who grows up to become a very famous politician with a heartbreak past. Norris is destined for greatness, however, after leading the senate race for New York state he loses leading him to the one place on earth that he can relax and be alone, the bathroom. After practicing his losing speech supported by very well crafted film editing, he meets a woman named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). After kissing her he is inspired to give the best speech he has ever given making him the front-runner for the next election. He feels as if he is destined to be with Elise, but does not have anyway to keep in contact with her. He tries his hardest to see her again, but what he does not realize is that there is a greater force at power concerning a group known as the Adjustment Bureau. Why can't he be with Elise and how far will he go to be with her? ""The Adjustment Bureau is a supernatural, spiritual, religious thriller about mastering ones fate at any cost.<br/><br/>Besides being very well written and original ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is just a really cool movie. It is a love story that guys have no excuse to not go to with their girlfriends, because it is much more than that. First of all Matt Damon, the king of thrillers most well known for the ""Bourne Trilogy"", stars in the film in which he is essentially on his own against fate. The ever so talented Emily Blunt is lovely to watch on screen as well with her good looks and superb acting ability, making a very well acted film. The Adjustment Bureau itself was very well depicted revealing just enough of their secrets, while leaving room for plenty of mystery. All of them also look awesome with because of their characterization and costumes (hats and overcoats). A simple yet very complicated and deep film is produced leaving you to even understand your life a little better.<br/><br/>The shortcomings in this film can be attributed to minor details. The film does its best to be simple, but at certain points unexplainable incongruities appear that contradict other explanations. However, these shortcomings aren't big enough to hurt the film. Other complaints may stem from the films preachy religious ending that may be a let down for some audiences.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a part of a release weekend marking the beginning of good 2011 films. It is a different kind of love story that does not necessarily have a bad guy and a good guy simply about a man and a woman who want to be with each other. Is it fate? After leaving the theater you may even think that you were meant to see the film."
"music_freak8","9","1","2","15 March 2011"," thumbs up for this one :)
","I Recently went to see this movie and I thought it was brilliant. I like the idea behind it. I am not a huge fan of Matt Damon but after seeing him in this movie I have changed my opinion. The acting was great and the love between the characters seemed genuine and not fake like in other movies I have seen. What I took out of this was the extremes that people are willing to go to for love.It wasn't too over the top and it terms of love and romance, it was real. Aside from the romantic side, the action was good and you were always on the edge of your seat hoping that these 2 characters would find a way back to one another and defeat the people who are against them being together. A great movie for people of all ages."
"3xHCCH","7","1","2","14 March 2011"," A Film that Goes Beyond Shallow Entertainment
","This was a movie that I watched without any preconceived notions about it. I thought at first that it was a political film as Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) was on his campaign to be the youngest Senator of New York. Then I thought it was a romantic film when Norris meets a charming mysterious girl in a men's restroom (Emily Blunt), and gets hit with love at first sight. However, the script makes another turn and introduces us to the agents of the Adjustment Bureau, whose job is to make sure the lives of each person goes according to the Chairman's plans. Whoa, there is a supernatural dimension to this movie, as well! <br/><br/>I felt the movie was very interesting. You will get into the flow of the story and be very entertained. A big part of its connection with the audience are the very appealing performances of both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as the star-crossed lovers, David and Elise. Their chemistry was charming and electric! Despite how the story was going, you will want to root for the two of them. I must admit you will have an inkling how everything would end up, but still you will want to follow the story up to the very end to see how it goes. The special effects of the case books and the opening doors add to the thrill of watching.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie though, you will be thinking about your own life, religion and fate. The ""Chairman"" is a none-too-subtle reference to God. There is God's will and Man's will. The movie suggests that man can get around God's will when he intently wants to make it happen. As Catholics, we believe we should leave our life all up to God's will. ""Your will be done, not mine."" Therefore, when personal religious beliefs come in, a film like this can go beyond shallow entertainment. I enjoyed watching ""The Adjustment Bureau"" as a suspenseful love story, although I may not necessarily subscribe to its inherent philosophical premise."
"quinnox-1","6","1","2","13 March 2011"," Good story but lacking chemistry
","The adjustment bureau has a pretty interesting story based on familiar science fiction themes however the main plot revolves around a couple who are supposed to be madly in love with each other but this isn't reflected on screen. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play the lovers and the lack of chemistry between them is awkward and uncomfortable. I never felt they even liked each other let alone being crazy in love. In fact, it seemed to me Emily Blunt's character actively disliked Matt Damon's character in many scenes. Since this love story was very unconvincing and is the main focus of the movie as the story develops it takes away from the fairly intriguing story of Matt Damon accidentally stumbling into a hidden world of a Matrix-like dimension.<br/><br/>Terence Stamp plays a powerful chief enforcer type character and I thought he was excellent in this role. By far he had the most interesting character in the movie. Another problem is there are too many celebrity cameos in the film. Well known news people like James Carville and CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Mayor Bloomberg, all these appearances are brief but still make the movie feel artificial. I'm trying to watch a movie not CNN political news.<br/><br/>The story is a good one, if a little unoriginal and too familiar of other more successful movies in the past such as The Matrix. This movie is worth seeing but the two actors at the center kind of let down the story line."
"KnightsofNi11","6","1","2","13 March 2011"," A cool concept produces a boring story
","So what all can be said about The Adjustment Bureau? Honestly, not that much. This film wants to offer a lot, but overall it is just glaringly... average. It opens excitingly with the introduction of Matt Damon's character, David Norris, who is running for New York Senator. He is projected to be the winning candidate due to his immense popularity amongst the young voters. He has a sure victory lined up for him until a story about his rowdy college days surface. This article causes him to lose the race. While preparing to give his losing speech he meets a girl named Elise, played by Emily Blunt, in the restroom. After a brief romantic moment with her she leaves. David doesn't see her again for months until one day he happens to meet her on a bus. This time Elise gives David her number before he leaves. He goes into his office, only to discover that all of his coworkers are frozen in time and they are being ""adjusted"" by mysterious men in suits and hats. He learns that these men are adjusters and they control what humans call fate. After filling him in on their operations, the adjusters let David go and he then goes on a persistent quest to find Elise, the woman he is madly in love with but was never supposed to meet more than once.<br/><br/>The best adjective to describe this movie would sadly be... boring. It starts well and ends decently depending on how you look at it. But the majority of the movie is just plain dull. Not much happens throughout the middle of this film and all the story lines are drawn out too much. The characters are likable, but not terribly interesting. For the most part this film lacks any kind of interest or excitement until the climax which definitely will draw you back in.<br/><br/>The concept of this film is very neat and I enjoyed all of the subtle sci-fi aspects of the film. There's nothing glaringly sci-fi about it. The adjusters all look like normal people and they don't use any kind of exotic looking technology to do their work. They aren't dressed up in some bizarre alien garb and instead they wear suits and hats. The most sci-fi thing they do is travel between various points far away from each other through doors around the city. The unfortunate thing is, the actual plot that comes out of this intriguing concept is a pretty basic and lackluster romance story. The concept of this film can be related back to films like Dark City (1998) or The Matrix (1999). Those films tell vastly more interesting stories than the dull romance The Adjustment Bureau presents. I can't say that anything about the plot itself was horribly constructed or poorly done, it just wasn't that interesting. There are too many possibilities to go along with this concept to choose the one in this film.<br/><br/>About two thirds of the way into this film Terence Stamp's character Thompson is introduced. This is when the movie really starts to kick off again. Some important things are revealed along with Thompson's arrival and that made the film start to become a lot better. After Thompson is introduced the film rises and falls a few more times before it ends with a climax that is done very well for what it's worth. By that I mean it gets about as interesting as such a dull movie can get. It has an odd ending, but I think it worked for the most part. It wasn't terribly memorable (I say this because I'm having trouble remembering exactly how it ended right now) but it's about what you'd expect.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau isn't a terrible film by any means. It's not great either. The filmmakers could have done so much more with this, but they refrained, and the result was a very boring film. This is not something I would ever watch again and in fact I don't think it is something I'll remember ever seeing in about a week. This is just one of those films that had a lot of potential but fell short and ended up being something that isn't painful to watch, but it isn't an exciting watch either."
"PWNYCNY","7","1","2","13 March 2011"," Potentially good movie saved by excellent acting.
","There's a saying: keep it simple. That applies to movies too, especially Hollywood movies. This movie violates that principle, hence the movie stalls. The theme is great. How much free-will do people have? Are the directions of our lives shaped by forces beyond our control? These are deep questions and when Hollywood attempts to answer them, the results could be messy. It's challenging enough to put together a coherent story but when nebulous elements that not fully explained are added to a story, then one of the worst things that can confront the audience occurs: trying to figure out what the movie is about. Matt Damon is as usual excellent as are the rest of the cast, especially John Slattery and Terence Stamp, and their performances save this movie from crossing the line into clunker land, but even their presence cannot undo the damage caused by the story itself. Keep the story simple; entertain the audience."
"branley","6","1","2","12 March 2011"," Solid concept, good acting, poor writing, major plot holes
","I've been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I loved the concept of it. It was reminiscent of my favorite episode of Twilight Zone, ""A Matter of Minutes"". You can read about the episode on Wikipedia. I'm not sure there is any way to see it, but it's a classic.<br/><br/>While the concept of Adjustment Bureau started out in the right direction, the longer the movie went on the more the movie got lost with it's direction and goal. The writer had setup a world with rules that he was not able to keep the story within. Once a writer breaks the rules of the world he's constructed, the plot holes start to appear, and this one got out of control. New rules had to be added, obvious solutions had to be ignored.<br/><br/>There were great opportunities here to discuss personal freedom versus destiny or the will of God, but the ending was completely anticlimactic. It came across as though the writer and director didn't realize they were going to end up where they did, and had no creative solution for how to handle it.<br/><br/>It got a bit too slow and I lost interest half way through, until the story picked up the pace toward the end.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't recommend the movie. The characters were all very likable and the acting by Emily Blunt and Matt Damon was excellent. I have a hunch many will overlook the fact that the entire movie is absurd in favor of the romance, and perhaps if you are able to do that going into it, you'll enjoy it more than I did."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","2","10 March 2011"," You may just want to choose this one
","David's political(his stance is vague, if it does lean towards the progressive) career is on the fast-track. Then he meets Elise. It seems like a perfect match... then again, it goes against the plan. Whose? The Adjustment Bureau's. They make sure things happen as they should. Their exact nature is kept vague, if the religious allusion(""are you angels?"") is clear(and acceptable, as well as inoffensive... and I am not someone who believes in a higher power). This never takes itself too seriously, as even the work of these ominous men in black is treated to a bit of self-irony. The humor tends to work, and feels as natural as our two leads. Are they ""perfect""? No. They're real, they're charming and we want to see them together. This is ""love at first sight""(and it is the focus(if it is also a science fiction movie)... still, you really get into these people and feel for them, and that's speaking as a guy who isn't that big on romantic pictures), and that does hurt the overall product... in essence, the ""Hollywood"" of this brings it down a tad. However, it does make you think(and Norris' decisions do change, he does consider the alternative) and ponder philosophy, questioning the idea of fate, the choices made, the concept of free will. I have not read the short by Philip K. Dick(I'm getting to it, I love the guy... R.I.P.), so I can make no comparisons. Every character is credible, and no one is black and white. We feel for the ""bad guys""! One of them has a guilty conscience, and the others are also as human as their physical appearance. The acting is great for all concerned. Stamp has gravitas(note that he's only in about half of this), Blunt is cute without being boring, and Damon... well, I'd say that having him ""guest"" on The Daily Show a couple of times in this has us forgetting that he's not appearing as himself, then again, he's kind of like that for the rest of it. He's rather likable, and you find yourself wanting to grab a cold one with him. The climax is fun and this does have fast-paced chase scenes, but it is not an action flick, albeit it was advertised as such. There are hardly any FX, no fights and nothing gratuitous. The dialog is good. While this concept is more or less a spelling out of the defiant ""I will do and get what I want"" cliché typical to Western films, the exploration isn't bad. The conclusion bears marks of having been hastily redone, though it doesn't go where I feared it would. Nolfi does well in his directorial debut, and penning the script worked out well, too. There is brief strong language, some sexuality and a violent image in this. I recommend this to anyone who finds the idea of this intriguing, and goes into it with realistic expectations. 7/10"

","David Norris (Matt Damon) is a young, charismatic politician on his way up. His sometimes impulsive nature leaves a wake of incriminating moments that work against him during his campaigns. Being in front of people helps placate the nagging emptiness he feels in his life. He seems lonely despite his success. One day, during a dark moment in his campaign, he has a chance encounter with Elise (Emily Blunt). The circumstances for their encounter seem odd, and yet the chemistry is instant and unforced. Their brief encounter inspires him to give concession speech that raises eyebrows and puts him on the political map again. And here, is where things get interesting. They have a second chance encounter. This time, they weren't supposed to meet. Not according the the 'master plan' set forth by the Chairman of the Universe. Because a case worker from the Adjustment Bureau fell asleep on the job, events don't get nudged in the right way, and something with apparently far reaching consequences, which isn't supposed to happen, does. Now a certain kind of unpredictable gravity has been created between the two. And it fights against the master plan.<br/><br/>The movie becomes ingtruiging as it explores the concept of free will versus pre-destination, or fate. If your belief system dictates a predestined future, what's the point of free will? Why make choices if you will be nudged in the direction of a predetermined future? At this point in the movie I sat up in my chair. Finally! A Sci Fi movie with depth! Then, a moral dilemma is introduced, which adds even more complexity: Sacrificing your personal happiness, possibly for the rest of your life, in exchange for the greater good of the people around you. It felt like the movie was about to do something really bold here. At one point, I held out hope that it might be going for a very unconventional (un-Hollywood) ending. Unfortunately, I think they lost their nerve. Maybe it was the reaction to a focus group? Or perhaps they caved to a greedy, pushy Hollywood executive more concerned with the bottom line, than with the integrity of art? (Nah, that's a bit far fetched.) Whatever the case, I would love to see some earlier drafts of the script. I'll bet they were probably more intriguing and intelligent that the final product. <br/><br/>Movies dealing with fate and time travel will always have some kind of paradox, or gap in logic. I don't think there will ever be a way around that. So picking apart the movie solely on those grounds is pointless. As long as a movie make an attempt at covering them plausibly, I'm okay with that. Despite all of the inherent gaps, this movie covers most them competently. That's not my problem with the 'Adjustment Bureau'. My problem with the movie is that it raises such intriguing questions, only to leave them unanswered. The few that are answered are approached flippantly. Maybe they lost me because I expected more than what the screenplay intended to deliver. They seemed to promise an existential drama, but delivered a cliché laden romantic date night movie (boy gets girl, it's us against the world baby, love will keep us together, etc. etc.). I walked out of the theatre feeling like a victim of bait and switch. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible movie. Damon and Blunt are excellent. You can really feel the the easy rapport, and eventual electricity between them. The direction keeps things moving along at a brisk pace without sacrificing character development. Another plus: So many movies nowadays rely heavily on CGI flash to hide thin storytelling skills. The Adjustment Bureau doesn't make that mistake. But still, I can't shake the feeling of disappointment when walking out of the movie theatre.<br/><br/>Maybe the problem isn't with the movie. Maybe the problem is with me. I'm becoming a bitter and crotchety old man in my old age. Naah! By the way, TURN DOWN THAT MUSIC AND GET OFF MY LAWN!!!"

","That's 'wind' to rhyme with 'mind', non-UK readers. There's a whole lot of running around, and pseudo-theo/philosophical bilge, and 'will-they-won't they' romancing, only to end up with 'The Chairman' (presumably God) changing the plan to suit Matt Damon and Emily Blunt because he can.<br/><br/>In scriptwriting 101 that's called a 'Deus Ex Machina', from the ancient plays that ended with God descending on a stage lift to sort out all the mess that the mere mortals had got up to. You know - 'it was all a dream'. It was never a good way to end a drama in 200BC, and it's no better now.<br/><br/>And the trouble is that TAB, for all its paper-thin characterisation, is (fairly) engaging and watchable to start with. This is why it winds you up. Where you start to think 'shouldn't I be sorting my laundry?' is when John Slattery, the hard-ass chief of the men in hats, is replaced by Terence Stamp, the even-harder-ass chief of the men in hats. There's no dramatic logic to this - they simply replace the bad guy with a badder guy halfway through.<br/><br/>Also from script school you will note that the 'Magic Negro' trope was alive and well in 2011. This is the black man with amazing powers whose sole dramatic purpose is to aid the white man hero to succeed in the end. See 'The Green Mile', among others.

","I am always intrigued that my favorite time of year for movies in the last few years is the brief time right after the Academy Awards when some amazing and surprising movies suddenly emerge. I skipped Black Swan, True Grit and the rest because the whole thing just bored me to tears. The award show itself was amazingly and shockingly an utter snooze. But wait- get out of the house and the studios are releasing films that got bumped by the pompous pap of award season and are actually fun, entertaining and real cinema experiences. Which brings me to The Adjustment Bureau. I saw this in a packed theater full of people hungry for a real movie, and they were not disappointed. Even though the MATRIX and some other blockbuster type sci-fi films have attempted to kill the genre completely with their bombastic special effects over kill, nothing should stop you from enjoying this little gem of a film. Shot in glorious color, the film uses NYC as a setting. This in itself is a cinematic tour de force that will keep any true movie fan glued to the screen, trying the guess the actual settings. And even though a number of elements are slightly off kilter including the chemistry between the two leads, there is a quiet and beautiful poetry to almost every scene. What it boils down to is that you have to admire the guts of a movie that can go this route in the wake of similar films with massive budgets and a lot more techno blitz. This film can take a simple scene in a parking garage and meld it to a plot line that has just enough Dickinson twists to make it all worth our time. I just have to say ""praise the lord and pass the popcorn."" One more award season is shot to hell and now the fun begins. If you miss this you miss the true ""awards"" real cinema fans live for. This is best little film that is a blast without bombast."
"jrbmangus","9","2","7","4 March 2011"," Powerful underlying statement-> *Minor Spoilers*
","I went into this movie expecting a solid film, but it ended up inspiring me. First, it deals with philosophical themes such as fate, choice, and god's plan which made it intriguing. At the same time, a love story takes place. This may seem cliché to some, but i thought it was done very well. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are both perfect for their respective roles and make the journey a believable one. <br/><br/>During a speech by Norris, he referenced how everything from his blue tie to his scuffed up shoes are picked out for him. This suggests our freedom of choice is an illusion and makes the viewer really question their own existence and lives. Are you satisfied? Do we go to our jobs or school because it's ""what I'm supposed to be doing? Or are we afraid to let go of our fragile existence because we are ultimately afraid of reality? I think it's an important topic because thousands of people let their lives become dictated to them, and its important that we have constant reminders about our freedom of choice, so we don't squander it. <br/><br/>The Acting was believable and by the end of the movie i actually cared about the outcome. Matt Damon, Anthony Mackie, and Emily Blunt all stood out in their roles. You could argue the film was a bit preachy at times and the concept was very broad, yet i thought the subject subject matter warranted this. <br/><br/>Overall, depending on what your looking for, the Adjustment Bureau could make for a great evening of discussion and entertainment. However, if your looking for a very thrilling movie, or don't enjoy love stories, you might want to look elsewhere."

","Have you ever wondered how your life might have turned out if you had made certain decisions differently in your life, such as taking a job, moving to another town, taken the second streetcar instead of the first. This movie explores those possibilities in the context of higher powers and our own free will and how much of it is free. The protagonists, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are the stars of this entertaining film and they immediately light up the screen and the storyline when they meet by chance in a New York hotel. Damon and Blunt go together like gin and vermouth, and they make this sci-fi story much better than it has a right to be. The rest of the cast is good, including Mad Men actor John Slatterly as one of the ""adjusters"". If you like comedy/drama mixed in with a love story and science fiction, this may be the movie for you. It is a movie men and women will enjoy and is a great date night movie. It doesn't hit on all cylinders for the entire movie but the times when Damon and Blunt are together make up for that. There are some interesting twists in this movie which add to the entertainment value. This movie also features most of the scenic attractions in New York City which is an added attraction. And as with any science fiction movie you need to suspend logic at the door when you walk in the theater, but nonetheless, this is a well put together story with a logical ending for a sci-fi flick."

"name99-92-545389","2","1","3","25 October 2018"," Extremely disappointing -- on multiple levels.
","Every so often a movie tries to be GRAND, to tackle MEANING. And this pretty much never turns out well. The skills of a prophet, or even a great novelist, are not the skills required to make movies, and even if the original script has some hope, that's dead by the time the endless compromises of actually shipping the movie are made.<br/><br/>And so we have here a movie that tries to tackle theodicy. Lord knows, zero theologians have done so successfully, but the people behind this movie thought they could achieve the impossible. And of course they fail, fail miserably and pathetically. Their story is exactly what you'd expect from comfortable modern Americans, with absolutely zero of the grandeur that we recognize (regardless of our beliefs) in true investigations of theodicy. We don't get serious hard choices, rather we get speeches about the importance of hard choices. We don't get an honest consideration of the tradeoffs between the needs of the many and the needs of the few; instead we get the comforting claim that we, each and every one of us, is the center of the universe and should live our lives in a way that's purely best for us (or at best ourselves and one other person). We don't even get an honest investigation of the tensions of theodicy, just a shrug of ""I dunno; that's just the way it is"".<br/><br/>So that's the large scale disappointment. The small scale disappointment is that you can rely on a Hollywood movie to imbue even the grandest discovery with idiotic and childish emotion -- there are even fewer rational people in movies than in real life. So, for example, our hero learns that the entire world operates totally differently from what he's been led to expect. And is his response awe and wonder, or asking how this larger world works? Of course not; what he's upset about is how this affects his relationship. Does he re-evaluate anything about humanity or the universe? Not at all.<br/><br/>Now, maybe that's realistic; after all the response to monotheism throughout history (again, regardless of whether you are a believer or not, this is just history) is for people to say ""OK, God; rules the universe, master of everything, got it. So what can he do for me right now? Like maybe roll these dice a certain way?""
But I don't think this is at all deliberate, a knowing nod to the realities of how most people live monotheism; rather I think it's the product of the same simple-mindedness that came up with this conceit, ie an inability to truly imagine any sort of grandeur, or even any sort of appropriate response to grandeur."

"joker-4","9","1","3","2 July 2012"," I Will Choose Free Will
","A mash of sci-fi, fantasy and rom-com, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU works as a fun film, and actually works quite well as a suspend-your-disbelief narrative goes, mostly due to the believable chemistry between likable stars Matt Damon, a senator-to-be, and Emily Blunt, an NYC dancer.<br/><br/>Writer/director George Nolfi chose not to go easy with his first-time outing and decided to adapt a Philip K. Dick story, a tale in which every event in life is mapped out – and policed by fedora-wearing caseworkers – but two lovers meet as a result of a cosmic accident and, as if a modern-day Hitchcockian duo, decide to run against fate. The resulting genre flick is a meeting of the overlord concept from DARK CITY and the rebelling-against-prophesy ideals from the MATRIX, both of which parallel the age-old ordeal of the existence of free will. Damon does it with his Boston smile, Blunt with her accent.<br/><br/>Nolfi keeps the pace moving lightning quick, complete with a piano-heavy Thomas Newman score, and offers just enough exploration to keep the wow- factor accelerating giving neither the characters nor the viewer a chance to fully take a deep breath and put together the sense of it all. Is it truly to be believed that spilling your coffee is a planned event akin to the election of a president? However, the delivered world of the film is one of fun make-believe where impulsive choices are the best, properly-worn fedoras are still magical and Matt Damon takes the bus - daily. <br/><br/>Another theme that helps complete THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU story is the empowering choice to write your own ending. True, Damon and Blunt's David and Elise, may have had their destiny already assured, at least by the viewer, but that classic sci-fi theme that states the future is wide open, that destiny has not already been written, needs to be affirmed for the next generation, which is who, perhaps, Dick was writing to. Nolfi has helped with that vision."

Minnie is great as usual. Matt is starting to look a little chubby. He looks like Tom Hanks younger brother. I loved him in Team America: World Police. Here it's kind of a wash. IMDb says the movie had a budget of 50M. Judging from what you see on the screen they must have spent the money on hats & funny notebooks (ipads?) There are no special effects that I can see. What you see are Matt & Minnie running around NYC followed by cameras. It gets very tiresome. The dialogue is mumbo jumbo. Poor Terence Stamp - he keeps getting all the crappy parts Malcolm McDowell turns down. Don't waste your money but if you do - ask for your money back. It's not even worth the price of a rental"
"Urantia","9","1","3","28 January 2012"," My Thoughts
","I found this movie to be an inspirational tribute to the ""one God and Father of all, who is above all and in all"" as well as being a good reminder that the sovereignty of God is unlimited. The universe was not inevitable. It is neither an accident nor some self-existent entity of ethereal proportions exploding upon the empty stage of nebular nothingness. The universe is a work of creation and is therefore wholly subject to the will of the Creator. So it is no mere poetic expression that exclaims: ""The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."" ""He removes kings and sets up kings."" ""The Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men."" In the affairs of the hearts of men and women, the Universal Father (better known as GOD) may not always have His way but in the conduct and destiny of a planet, the divine plan prevails...the eternal purpose of wisdom and love triumphs! And unlike any documentary that may have attempted to encapsulate portions of these philosophical mysteries in a few condensed scenes featuring talking heads that move their lips in a rapid succession of lingual fireworks but who fail to say anything spiritually significant, this fun-filled flick was supremely entertaining in addition to being a cinematic fountain of intellectual fascination and cosmic enlightenment."
"oneguyrambling","5","1","3","28 December 2011"," Creative mediocrity involving time-travelling c*ck-blockers.
","There were so many things going for The Adjustment Bureau that I wracked my brains to work out why I just didn't think much of it.<br/><br/>I finally decided upon a two word descriptor: creative mediocrity.<br/><br/>The leads Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are both likable and attractive, the cast solid and effective and the plot is clever but not so much that you lose track or interest. But as the credits rolled I thought that as an entertainment experience The Adjustment Bureau existed more than it thrived, and given that the film had some pretty direct similarities and parallels to the superior Source Code, Déjà vu and of course The Matrix this can't be deemed a good thing.<br/><br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br/><br/>It turns out that the Powers that be have loosely scripted existence so that for the most part things run a certain way. Of course with any rough draft there are a million things that could happen to prevent Person A arriving at Destination B. An unexpected illness or accident. An inopportune red light. Locusts. A spilt cup of coffee So Destinations C, D, E etc are marked just in case. Call them contingency plans. As long as Person A arrives at one of these things will turn out the way they planned When this doesn't happen they call upon a group of nattily dressed men wearing 40s era hats to perform the necessary adjustments, to make sure things remain on track.<br/><br/>David Norris (Matt Damon) is a maverick young political aspirant seemingly destined for bigger things yet hamstring by a checkered past involving one too many alcohol related follies, one of which cost him a vital election.<br/><br/>It is while he is preparing his concession speech that he runs into Elise (Emily Blunt) – in a men's restroom no less – and the resulting impromptu meeting leaves quite an impression on them both. David is inspired enough to scrap his tailored speech and give a painfully honest and decidedly non-political version to his waiting crowd, the feedback from the ad-libbed concession is almost universally favourable and garners him more attention.<br/><br/>But all David can think about is meeting Elise again After another chance meeting is interrupted by an 'accidental' coffee spill, thus separating he and Elise once again. After which David meets with the strange well groomed men who have performed this unwelcome sci-fi c*ck-block, and he learns much to his horror that he and Elise are not destined to be together.<br/><br/>Not only must David refrain from seeing and pursuing this woman, and attempt to do so will result in 'severe consequences'.<br/><br/>Now it doesn't take a genius to gather that David won't accept his fate gladly, and the hour or so that follows moves along at a nice pace without ever really blowing your skirt up. There is a lot of running, some breathless plot exposition, and a guy named Harry shows up as David's 'case officer' to help move things along a couple of times.<br/><br/>I wanted to like The Adjustment Bureau. I really did. I even started typing this paragraph with the ""I liked parts of"", before realising I really didn't. I took nothing away from this film aside from the fact that all the films I mentioned earlier in this review were far superior to it, and that there was a lot of running while holding hands. And the fact that both Blunt and Damon are likable doesn't change that I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. Maybe next time with a few adjustments this film might turn out better. Where are those guys with the nice hats when you need them?"

Instead, we have a bunch of guys running around with hats on trying to prevent this liaison.

"GLanoue","Null","1","3","12 November 2011"," The great mystery of life, for dummies
","This movie is supposed to be provocative and thoughtful, with its references to the eternal struggle between free will and an omnipotent God. Who's the boss? could be the subtitle of this movie. In fact, it debases the central question that has forever plagued eastern and western philosophers alike. In the end, it has little content beyond what we would hear in a high school debate. There are too many shortcuts and just not enough fleshed-out ideas for a movie that claims to be tackling The Grand Mystery of the Universe, but it takes itself way too seriously to be Monty Python-esque about it and come up with credible answers: the angels are supposed to be the enforcers of a master plan, yet they have hobbled powers; they have to wear stupid 1960s Mad Men hats in contemporary Manhattan; couldn't God have just given them key cards to open doors? Not to mention that the secret of their power is that they twist doorknobs counter-clockwise to enter their secret realm. Who would have thought? The two main characters are always conveniently single whenever they meet over the years. More importantly, John Slattery is not so believable as the head field agent in charge of making sure people stick to The Master Plan. He comes across as a little too slick, too corporate, and too efficient but without any passion. In fact, the whole Plan thing is presented along those lines: the Adjustment Bureau personnel seem to drive Miami CSI style SUVs, they are headquartered in a huge warehouse, the minions seem hard at work on The Plan in a large retro-style library. It's a little like watching Jack Lemmon's The Apartment, but colorized. Perhaps the most important thing is that Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have no believable chemistry when they are together, so it's hard to accept that two young and attractive people are saving themselves and avoiding romantic entanglements for seven years so they can eventually be together and buck The Master Plan cooked up by God Himself. Plus, it irks me that the whole movie reduces what could have been an interesting idea played by otherwise good actors to the tired American cliché that Love Will Find a Way and Triumph. Really? Two people are only mildly attracted to each other at the level of a first date (Blunt even tells Damon, at one of the climax points, that he doesn't know anything about her) in a cinematically unconvincing way, and this is supposed to be enough to come to the attention of God, halt the machinations of dozens of angels working on the case to set things back on track, and rewrite the master plan for all of humanity? Somebody seems to have given Damon novocain in his morning decaf, because he shows as much passion as a mushroom, and Blunt, while acting credibly, is just given too many bad one-liners that alienate the audience. We don't know if she's just bitchy, flippant or wary of Damon stalking her. She's supposed to be a dancer that changes the world of dance, yet the dancing we see looks like it was choreographed by high-schoolers; Damon is supposed to become a President that will change the world for the better, but the only evidence of his acumen and grit is a clichéd concession speech in which he admits to the image manipulation that lies behind political campaigns. Wow. I'm stunned. They hire consultants so his shoes can match his ties? So it's not about ideas? Thanks, Matt, that's a major revelation, which encapsulates more or less what's wrong here: we're continually told to be on the lookout for something earthshaking, and it's just, in the end, a case of lust. Yuri Zhivago pursuing Lara across Siberia, across wars and revolutions, writing poems that survive Stalinism, and in the end dying for her: that was earthshaking love. This? Pfft."

No Explosions. No wild car chases. No jet-planes crashing. No Ammo-loaded Shoot-outs. And they are reacting accordingly with normal disappointed disgust.<br/><br/>So fair warning-- if you are looking for an uncomplicated Bang-Bang Boom-Boom Friday-Night or Saturday Night Action Thriller, 'Adjustment Bureau' is NOT what you think it is. Matt Damon is NOT reprising the Bourne saga. Mind you-- when I say this, I'm not looking down on someone for seeking a straight-up action flick-- I was looking for the same thing! Having said that. . .If you are willing to sit back and just let the actors do their thing and tell the story, you will get a nice little puzzler about Fate, Love & the Question of Free Will. And as an extra bit of spice, you get the added dimension of another view of Religion that will touch on Heresy for the truly religious.<br/><br/>Yes-- the Story is Predictable. There is only One End that we want to see, after all. What matters is HOW the Characters struggle against the Machineries of Fate. And Why they and we should do so.<br/><br/>Haven't you ever wondered about God and Angels and Such-- The Bible says that Lucifer was Cast from Heaven. . .But no-one has ever told us WHY? WHAT was the Argument about? Exactly WHAT was Lucifer Rebelling AGAINST? If you Read Graphic Novels like 'Sandman' or 'Lucifer', even as a guy, you should like this movie, because those are the types of questions posed as the foundation of the entire story.<br/><br/>If you've read even just one page of the reviews here, you already know what the plot is, so I won't add to it.<br/><br/>But on the light Sci-Fi side of it-- The Plan Notebooks as the COOLEST THINGS in the movie, accentuated by the fact that they are purposely so ORDINARY LOOKING! 'Ordinary', until you notice that the ink is moving like an unfolding schematic. That alone accentuated the notion of Heaven as a Vast interlocking set of cold Bureaucratic Machineries that lends a special chill to anyone who thinks about it enough.<br/><br/>This movie is in a class by itself. And it requires a level of maturity to properly enjoy it. 100% Girlfriend-Friendly and a good choice for a slow Sunday Afternoon."

Was it predictable at times? Yeah.<br/><br/>OK, so maybe I don't know why I liked this movie. Matt Damon is Matt Damon, you can sort of tell that he's acting. He has a square head by the way, according to my GF.<br/><br/>So Matt falls in love with a ""dancer"", sheesh, could it get any worse? And yet, somehow, I didn't hate the movie. Not-so-mysterious men walk around with magic hats that take them through magic doorways, a familiar plot device in Hollywood, and yet, I didn't hate this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is either ham-fisted or more subtle than most people realized. OK, they could have played the paranoid angle up a lot more, but IMO that would be a boring cliché'.<br/><br/>What's interesting here is that nothing is really that big of a surprise to the characters, Matt Damon's character and his love interest both seem weirdly OK with everything that is happening. Maybe I'm reading something into it that was unintended, regardless, I see their moderate reaction to everything as representative of our constant awareness of things. You know, the sense that things are wrong or OK, that gut feeling, and when it turns out you're right it's less of a shock. If a bureau were constantly mussing in our lives I think we would develop a sense that maybe things aren't as they should be, or that something outside our control exists.<br/><br/>It's not a brilliant work, but it's not a pile of trash either, it's actually a very skillfully handled movie that unfortunately has left a lot of the movie going public missing the subtlety and not connecting the dots.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 for skillful handling."

From what I've read, it seems like the movie was just an excuse for some pro-religious propaganda, underlining the fact that men will never be able to exercise their free will without the supervision of a higher authority, understand God. Frankly, I wish the movie had at least the guts to go as far as what this criticism implies; it would have at least the merit to be quite thought-provoking. What I saw was a well-made special effects driven movie about the power of love and destiny, and a timid cinematic essay about a supernatural force governing our acts, but it takes more than that to be called a propaganda.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings regarding 'The Adjustment Bureau', and I can't exactly put my finger where the movie went in the wrong direction and I know it did at some part. First, I was baffled by the succession of cinematic clichés that were thrown at me. Matt Damon playing David Norris a young political go-getter with a debatable charisma, but I suspended my disbelief for the sake of my enjoyment. Then the bunch of men with funny hats, I wondered if I had to take them seriously, I tried but God it was difficult. But the icing of the cake was the encounter with Elise Sellas, Emily Blunt's character in the men's room. Now, that scene was quite uncomfortable to watch, I hoped, I sincerely hoped they wouldn't be kissing at the end, and  Bingo! I guess Matt Damon is too damn handsome, no girl would resist. And I guess the girl is so beautiful that if she puts your cell phone in a coffee, you'd be laughing you ass because it's just so damn cute. Anyway, to the credit of the film, all the clichés happen in such a short span of time, you still have one hour to give it the benefit of the doubt. And rightfully, as the movie gets more interesting after a awkward start.<br/><br/>Nolfi's film, yeah, I had to name the director, goes straight forward, and doesn't embarrass itself with nuances, it reveals right after Damon comes earlier in his office and finds our funny-hatted friends scanning his buddy's memory. He learns that he shouldn't have come earlier and the mission of Harry Mitchell, Anthony Mackie's character, was to spill coffee on Norris so he could miss the bus, come later to the office and certainly not meet the girl. Why? It's all part of a mysterious scheme that I don't want to spoil for you  nah, just kidding. The point was that Norris was destined to become a successful politician, and it's strongly implied that he would be the next President of USA. But there's a ""but"", Elise would be an obstacle to his ascension, because she would cover the gaps in Damon's life. And Damon understands that the death of his brother and father, was part of the big 'scheme' that was meant to be the pivotal moment in his decision to become a politician. His mother died too, but that was bad luck, it happens you know.<br/><br/>And just to show that the film is very gettable in the first viewing, I also know that Blunt's character was meant to be a great and famous dancer but her romance with Damon wouldn't be helpful for her career. So, why are they so strongly attracted to each other? Because they were the perfect match, and were meant to be together. Well, after all, the 'Big Boss' has the right to change his scheme, who's the Boss for His sake? But now, that we know that Damon meeting Blunt wasn't just an archetypal plot device, but part of the 'Big Plot', we're able to forgive the script. The story moves then into the obliged Damon-esque cat-and-mouse thriller. His objective, getting Elise, even under the threat of a lobotomy. These guys mean business, especially when the file was transferred to Terence Stamp's character. But Damon conveniently finds help in Mitchell who initiates him to the teleportation power of the hats, that can open any door if you turn the knob to the right.<br/><br/>Why right? Why the hats? Why not? Everything works for pure script convenience, have we been so interrogative with the treatment of Damon's family background story. No, we're just ought to believe him, so let's not be too technical. At that point, the film becomes a romantic tribute to the power of love where Damon decides to exercise his free will and takes a consenting Blunt with him. Aren't they lovely? The cat-and-mouse chase end up in the top of the building where they're surrounded by the baddies who're not here for kidding, you better believe it. At that point, I was wondering how the script would have concluded after this culmination. Well, since everything is part of the scheme written by a God-like figure, we have one of the most blatant but surprisingly satisfying dues ex machine in a film. Basically, David and Elise proved their love and touched God so much that he decided that finally they were indeed a perfect match. You would think that God has more serious stuff to handle, considering the situation in the world, no, he had to fix this Norris-Sellas issue. After all, maybe a Nuclear Holocaust had just been avoided, who knows?<br/><br/>The movie ends with a beautiful speech about our free will, and our capability to determine our choices and responsibility in life just as if the movie was some kind of existentialist masterpiece. Well, it made me question many things about the possibilities of life, and what would I have been if I did this or that in the past, or what would have the movie been if it had been more thought provoking in the script and less lazy in the writing department. Entertaining fun, but nothing else ."
"XweAponX","10","1","3","27 June 2011"," Very good film based on a Phillip K Dick work
","Not as close to the source material as was A Scanner Darkly, in this case the story we have here is loosely based on the short story ""The Adjustment Team"" by Phillip K Dick. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt spearhead a great cast including John Slattery and Terence Stamp, at first you don't really know what is happening here, just a hard-luck story about a guy, loses an election due to bad luck and nosy Republican media, meets a girl on Election night, but although it would seem like this is what is happening, it is not.<br/><br/>Instead, the very Fabric of Reality is ripped... Who are these guys with the Hats... Cousins of The Watchers in ""Fringe""? What is great about this film is the connectivity between a science fiction story and a religious story, except that this film is neither, although aspects of both are present.<br/><br/>This film joins the ranks of other reality-questioning films like The Matrix, The 13th Floor, and Dark City - Except that this is not a world-construct, it's simply the world. And so concepts that might be more suited to a science fiction or religious film are brought into the grasp of people not familiar with either genre, it is simply a film about people, and these things that are going on are not supernatural or of alien design, it is more like, ""This is how the world is constructed"".<br/><br/>Matt Damon goes up against the masters of time and space and beats them. So rather than say, ""Foreknowledge vs Predestination/Freewill vs Determinism"" you can say ""Freewill AND Determinism"" - As Damon shows when he asks, ""What about Free Will?"". Actually the entire premise of this film is that we do actually have Free Will and Choices... Regardless of any entity which may have knowledge of future events.<br/><br/>This is a wholly NY Movie, filmed in NY, by people in NY and as such is in my list of top NY movies. It looks good, it is acted well, it is directed very well, and a lot of my favourite Character actors are here, including Anthony Ruivivar and John Slattery - Although this is more of a breakout film for Anthony Mackie, who does his job very well here... Starting out as a minor character, his importance is made evident later."
"DonFishies","6","1","3","23 March 2011"," Another example of why science fiction and romance rarely mix
","Forgive me if this sounds hopelessly derivative: a rising politician named David Norris (Matt Damon) meets up with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt) by chance on the night of a major election. They part ways, but David cannot seem to get her out of his head. By chance they meet again, and David remains smitten with this mysterious woman. When he enters his office, he finds an odd group of individuals who call themselves the titular Adjustment Bureau. Apparently they are a group who ensure people act according to a plan that is predetermined for them. And a relationship between David and Elise is not part of the plan.<br/><br/>Going into The Adjustment Bureau, I only knew of the short story by revered sci-fi icon Philip K. Dick. But going by the track record of successes, failures and cult classics based on his work, I assumed this film would at the very least be worth a look just because of the legacy of films his writings have created. Sadly, going by the plot synopsis I described above, I am certain you can guess which category this film falls into fairly quickly.<br/><br/>When The Adjustment Bureau is focusing on the concept of people's lives being pre-determined and how free choice adds to the mix, it delivers in near remarkable fashion. Seeing how the ""Adjustment Team"", who are referred to mainly by their last names, works and how omnipresent they are in people's lives is downright thought-provoking on the same level as Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report, and just as intriguing. This is the kind of material science fiction has always worked best on, and some of the things that happen are just as fun and unique as you can imagine. I would have loved to learn more about the notebooks these team members read like gospel, and would have greatly enjoyed significantly more emphasis on these elements.<br/><br/>What also impressed me was the lack of obvious special effects used throughout the film. There are a few scenes which looked blatantly enhanced by CGI, but the majority looks practical in nature. This can be chalked up to the fact that the film is not one that needs to be drenched in effects (unlike so many other science fiction pieces), but the simplicity and nuances of opening doors to other places and the use of real sets was something I felt worthy enough to be mentioned on its own. If only more films could follow the production examples set by this one, we would have more natural looking big-budget films.<br/><br/>Sadly, it is the romance that wins and drowns out almost every instance of science fiction-esque explanation (minus the initial reason for why the Bureau exists in the first place). It seems like writer/director George Nolfi was merely intrigued by Dick's story, and decided to build an against-all-odds romance around it. But it feels stale in comparison to the ideas surrounding it, almost like an afterthought. The familiar and clichéd romantic beats are all here, but Nolfi never takes them anywhere exceptional – they merely stay grounded in the ordinary of whatever freakish form of reality the film takes place in. There is more than enough room for development in some scenes, and others could have become instantly more exciting if there really was something more to it.<br/><br/>I would be a little less harsh on the romance, except it leads to one of the most ridiculously uninventive endings of the last decade. The film takes on its own liberties in the quest between David and Elise for ultimate happiness and free will, and forsakes and ruins anything intriguing and worthwhile within the plot (namely the explanations on how the Bureau acts and reacts to situations). The film's release was delayed and I think the final act may have been what was tinkered with the most in the ensuing wait. It feels choppy, weak and just not all there, like there was something more to it, something that helped make all of the romance easier to swallow by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>But sadly, as one moment passes into the next, each more outrageous and near farcical than the next, the horrible ending unfolds. I want to say it is the kind of movie that would benefit from ending ten-twenty minutes sooner, but even that would not help make it any less preposterous than it quickly becomes. There is a scene stuffed in here between Damon and one of the ""adjusters"" played by Anthony Mackie, where Mackie looks delirious and incredibly baffled by the words he is saying to Damon. I am fairly certain I had the same look on my face trying to comprehend the inane and downright silly turn the story takes at that exact same moment.<br/><br/>Much like he always does, Damon delivers the best performance he can with what he is given. He is never one to back down from a challenge, and he makes David a compelling character at all times. You really do feel for him, even when so much is going wrong around him. Blunt has the unfortunate task of being the beautiful background character, one that gets very little to do outside of eliciting a reaction from Damon. She looks great while doing it, but does not offer all that much here. Mackie is great when the film wants to use him, and Terrence Stamp is so deadly serious that he feels like he belongs somewhere else. But did they really need to completely undercut and make John Slattery be so useless? <br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is greatly enjoyable in parts, but is never able to maintain the right focus. It is worth a look, just to see what it easily could have become, before squandering it away on melodramatic romance.<br/><br/>6/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"MBunge","6","1","3","8 March 2011"," A Care Bear Stare ending can't ruin this movie
","The Adjustment Bureau succeeds on the strength of an intriguing premise, the attractive pairing of its two leads and an interesting supporting character, overcoming some fairly serious plotting issues and a Care Bearish ending to craft an endearing sci-fi romance.<br/><br/>David Norris (Matt Damon) is a young Congressman who's running for Senate when he meets a feisty young dancer named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). The two of them connect like they were always meant to be together, until an enigmatic organization called The Adjustment Bureau tells David he can never see her again. Made up of shadowy men in magic hats and their helmeted soldiers, The Bureau nudges human beings back in line with The Plan. When you spill coffee on yourself and miss the next bus, when your cell phone dies and you miss and important call, when you can't get a taxi to make an appointment, that's The Bureau shepherding you along according to the designs of The Chairman.<br/><br/>The Plan says David and Elise must not be together. When David learns of The Bureau and its influence on his life, however, he rebels and sets out to be with Elise no matter what the cost. With the help of a Bureau agent (Michael Kelly), David and Elise run hither and yon until the Bureau gives up and they live happily ever after. Seriously, that's the way it ends.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is like a great idea for a TV series and a lot of this movie plays out like the pilot episode of such a show. While the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is the best thing about this film, John Slattery as the harried Bureau agent desperately scheming to keep them apart is a very close second. Like a mix of Sam Becket from Quantum Leap, The Phantom Stranger from DC Comics and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Slattery's character and the other Bureau agents are a clever take on the concept of a secret conspiracy that's running the world. To the men of the Bureau, it's just a job with the same office politics and pain-in-the-ass personnel issues as any other.<br/><br/>Damon and Blunt are both excellent, creating a compelling enough love affair that it could have sustained an entire movie by itself without any sci-fi trappings. When that relationship is endangered by the machinations of The Bureau, the believability of it generates a decent amount of dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Now, the story does have some whanging big plot problems. For example, when David learns about the Bureau and its power over human existence, the film jumps forward three years and the audience is supposed to go along with the idea that David could find out this mind blowing information, then just go back to living a normal life like nothing happened. That's pretty silly. And after letting the audience get invested in Slattery's character, the movie brings in a different Bureau agent for the last half hour or so to be the main obstacle for David and Elise to overcome. It's completely unnecessary and, while the new agent is meant to be a greater menace, he doesn't do or say anything that Slattery's character couldn't have done and said. Instead of being a contest between two sides with the audience torn between who they want to succeed, injecting a never-before-seen character into the mix ruins that dynamic and makes the story so emotionally one-sided that it loses its edge.<br/><br/>And then there's an ending that's on par with the Care Bear Stare when it comes to lameness. This is literally how it goes<br/><br/>""You must follow The Plan!""<br/><br/>""But we're in love!""<br/><br/>""Oh. Okay then, do whatever you want.""<br/><br/>Even with serious flaws, The Adjustment Bureau is an enjoyable and slightly thought provoking motion picture. It'd make a great TV show, though."
"eschetic-2","8","1","3","6 March 2011"," Strong, Satisfying contemplation on The Nature of God
","I splurged yesterday and went to the movies: THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (based, as a surprising number of satisfying sci-fi films have been, on a Philip K. Dick short story). The film proved to be a delightful romantic comedy adventure companion to Arthur C. Clarke's contemplation on the nature of God, the 2001 Space Odyssey series. This one's much more down to earth and does indulge in a dizzying mid-film chase sequence which will strike some as INCEPTION-lite, but even then, what a delight to see films again where the words (from writer/director George Nolfi) actually matter - when characters talk to each other we can care what they say because it's so well said. The romantic relationship rings true without ever risking cliché or sticky sweetness and details of the action are scrupulously foreshadowed and set up as well as in the best down to earth mysteries - right down to the importance of which way you turn a door-knob when using special ""doors"" engineered by ""higher powers."" <br/><br/>Matt Damon is a successful young politician who has lost all his blood relations years before but who has developed a caring and very tight ""official family"" over the intervening years, and who meets and becomes fascinated with a delightfully off-center young ballerina, Emily Blunt, on the evening of a stumble in his upward political career path. They seemed destined to be together until odd engineered barriers seem to be moving heaven and earth to keep them apart (engineered to involve the smallest possible ""footprints""). Maybe they are ""meant"" to be together. Maybe they were but something changed? Is there a ""plan"" for our lives? Is it immutable? The film takes these deadly serious issues and plays with them in a warm, romantic action comedy frame that actually makes them more fun to think about.<br/><br/>If the film ultimately ends in an almost too pat ""uplifting"" resolution, it's one that goes down well - and one the audience is almost certainly pulling for for the last half of the film (is it possible we're reluctant to respect the film *because* it ends the way we hope it will?). Over all, it is VERY satisfying piece that will leave you thinking about the issues it uses for days afterward - if you want to - or simply entertain you for a wonderful hundred minutes if you're not in the mood for deeper thought. Either way, you WILL be entertained, and your intelligence will not be insulted.<br/><br/>I recommend it highly if you like Philip K. Dick's work (films of BLADE RUNNER, TOTAL RECALL, MINORITY REPORT, PAY CHECK and others started in his fertile imagination), Matt Damon's or Emily Blunt's (the female lead who dances FAR better than Natailie Portman ever managed in BLACK SWAN and has a perfectly lovely chemistry with Damon). Even the city (Manhattan), its sub- and superstructure, becomes an active character as Damon's life is turned upside down and he tries to right it. John Slattery is not only practically perfect as the mysterious, slightly slimy ""heavy,"" but when revealed as essentially a mid-level functionary who doesn't necessarily know what's going on, adds a wonderful level of comically mystified humanity - if, in context, that's the proper word.<br/><br/>THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is ultimately probably too ""small"" a film to be Academy Award fodder, but you WILL have fun. It's something of a delightful surprise in that how many romantic comedy sci-fi speculations on the nature of god actually come along? Decidedly recommended to anyone with a mind who enjoys playing with it occasionally. If you loved INCEPTION, you won't want to miss THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU - if this one is not the great one that was, it's in the same ball park."

The bowler hat guys are the worst because they have nothing of interest to say, in fact they all behave the same way, It's like they are there to make you think something is happening, when nothing really is. I don't see the romance between the two main characters, if anything the intimate moments between the two made me cringe.

The direction of movie is quite good and I loved the Cinematography. The script as well is well written and is consistent. the romantic factor is very much appreciating as it do connects emotionally. Damon and Blunt both have done great and its surprising for Damon fans to see him in a romantic and passionate avatar and do so well. Both share a sparkling chemistry. Its imaginative, refreshing, innovative and things are explained in a decent manner. George Nolfi surely takes credit for rewriting the short story of Philip and presenting it in a quite well manner.

","Barrack Obama made a joke about The Adjustment Bureau when it was released. He said,"" I like Matt Damon... but he doesn't really like the work i've been doing recently. Well Matt, I recently saw The Adjustment Bureau, and the same can be said to you"". I doubt that he actually saw it.<br/><br/>It took me a while, but I finally saw it. And despite mixed reviews, I had to see it. And it was worth the wait. The Adjustment bureau, I think, is the best film of its unique kind this year. I'm not saying that its the best film of the year. I'm not even saying that its up there with Inception. But it's better than Source Code, which I thought was very good also.<br/><br/>Damon plays a politician who meets a woman(Emily Blunt) by fate in a bathroom. But the people controlling his fate, who are sort of like angels, are trying to make it so then they won't meet.

I really liked The Adjustment Bureau. Sue me, I don't care. It's not a perfect film, but what I like about it is the story.<br/><br/>The story is nice. It's a romance with thrills, and its a lot of unique fun. First time director George Nolfi is trying for an Inception, and though he can't quite get there, it's a good try. I mean, thats going to be a tough job.<br/><br/>Damon and Blunt give great performances and they share a lot of chemistry. You almost never feel like its scripted. It all feels improvised, but in a very good way. The dialogue just clicks with these two. In short, they are perfect together.<br/><br/>I also like how they kind of bring religion into it.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","1","4","30 July 2011"," Cute enough little movie.
","Can't really call this movie an impressive or spectacular one in any way but it sure remains a good and enough movie, if you know what to expect from it.<br/><br/>It's not a movie that is being mostly about its thriller or science-fiction aspects but more one that leans more toward its romance. You could be fooled perhaps and expect a totally different movie from watching the trailer and other advertisements by the movie but really, this is what the movie mostly evolves around. You could even say that the movie is being more concerned about coming across realistic, rather than simply trying to be tense or mysterious. And yes, that is sort of the downfall and disappointing aspect about this movie.<br/><br/>Of course nothing wrong with movie taking a romantic approach but in this case that approach probably wasn't the best or most interesting and effective one to pick. So here we have a concept of a so called 'adjustment bureau', who are there to ensure that everything keeps going according to the 'big plan', by controlling and if needed, interfering with people's faiths. There are plenty of directions you could take with such a subject but all this movie its main premise is Matt Damon and Emily Blunt falling in love with each other, while this was never supposed to happen according the adjustment bureau's book (and literally, they have a book with the people's planned out future in it) and they do everything (well, not really but that's a whole other problem I'll soon get to) to set things right and try to prevent them from ever seeing each other again. Sounds romantic, that despite all things the two of them wanting to be together but it just doesn't make the movie always a very interesting or exciting watch.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I still was really into the movie at first but the whole premise starts to get a bit tiresome after a while, especially since there really isn't that much happening in this movie action-wise, or any other stuff that tries to prevent from these two failing in love with each other. It's because of the concept of the movie, that is heavily flawed. Really, the adjustment bureau has so much control and power over humanity and all of their their actions and can alter- and do so many 'magical' things but yet they have a hard time keeping an eye on two individuals and besides don't do an awful lot to try to set things straight. I mean, they apparently can even alter thoughts and completely reset human brains, why not do any of that with the Damon character? It's not like Damon was a powerful character that could take on a bunch of guys and he also wasn't armed at any time throughout this movie. There is never really any sense of danger in this movie because of that. It's just a sort of soft and light type of science-fiction thriller, that is lacking much excitement and other aspects among those lines, to make this movie an interesting and compelling watch throughout, while all of the potential was really there up for the grabs.<br/><br/>So the movie instead mostly builds on the romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt and while they have good chemistry together, that just isn't enough. It just doesn't feel like these are two people who are madly in love with and are made for each other, even though the movie tries to imply that. Their chemistry together is more like a very strong flirtasious one, like they are two people who could have a very hot romance for a couple of weeks but then soon start to realize they have far too little in common for a serious relationship to work out between them two. It also doesn't make it very convincing that the Matt Damon character is trying to be with Emily Blunt, no matter how much stuff gets thrown his way and gets made apparent that they just aren't meant to be together. You just want to say to him; move on after all those years and forget about her! It's too much trouble for one girl and a man in his position could had found new love within an instant. But of course that isn't the romanticized message that the movie wants to send out. And this very same approach at the same time also still ensures that this remains a cute and harmless movie.<br/><br/>Still a good and original enough movie with its genre, that just isn't the most exciting or interesting movie around to watch.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The premise is fascinating: the ""bureau"" is a team who influence/adjust the timing of events so as to lead mankind toward a predetermined future.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays David Norris, the rising young star in New York politics ... that is until a college prank is revealed and scandal ensues. On election night, prior to his concession speech, he meets Elise (Emily Blunt), the girl of his dreams in the men's room. I was struck with just how few times a man meets his dream woman in the men's restroom. Their charming banter and immediate connection lead Norris to make a heartfelt speech that thrusts him right back into the hearts of the voters.<br/><br/>When David and Elise meet by chance on a bus, a mysterious force begins to reveal itself. David is exposed to The Adjustment Bureau and told to stay away from Elise, lest he ruin both his dreams and hers. Of course, this isn't really a sci-fi thriller in the traditional sense. It's much more a love story ... a love story for two people who seem pre-destined to be together. And that's the conflict.<br/><br/>The story is really a debate between fate and free will. Does destiny lead us down the path or do we make our own way? The Chairman of the Bureau is clearly a reference to a God-like power, but his ""angels"" have powers limited to shortcut door portals, slight adjustments to thinking patterns, and looking good in hats.<br/><br/>While writer/director George Nolfi creates a pretty interesting to look at cityscape and an usually smart romantic film, it actually falls a bit short on overall effectiveness when it devotes so much running time to the explanation of how the bureau works. I would have much preferred more debate and examples of how adjustments affect free will and maintain the path to destiny. Instead we get a crash course on the inner-workings of this odd team. That said, there aren't very many better faces and voices than that of Terence Stamp, who plays The Hammer for the bureau. He is a fixer who uses less than forthright tactics in his moments of influencing David.<br/><br/>I am probably being a bit harsh on this one considering that it is quite a bit more clever than the average studio release, but I can't help but believe it was capable of so much more."

"dee.reid","10","1","5","7 July 2011"," An engrossing, edge-of-your-seat... love story? ""The Adjustment Bureau""
","""The Adjustment Bureau"" has been advertised as a sci-fi thriller about the mysterious behind-the-scenes machinations that may or may not guide our everyday lives as part of some Divine Plan. While it is essentially a science fiction parable about fate-vs.-free will (based on the Philip K. Dick short story ""Adjustment Team""), at its heart, really, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a love story, and a very gripping one, at that.<br/><br/>Dick (who passed away in 1982), you will remember, has had several of his works adapted posthumously into big-budget science fiction classics - the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" became ""Blade Runner"" (1982), the short story ""We Can Remember it For You Wholesale"" became ""Total Recall"" (1990), and the short story ""The Minority Report"" became ""Minority Report"" (2002). ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is the latest Dick adaptation to feature stellar performances and intelligent subtext that asks the ultimate question: Is it possible to deviate from a Divine Plan in favor of one's own personal destiny? What happens when we pit ""What could be"" against ""What will be""?<br/><br/>These are just some of the big question facing David Norris (Matt Damon), an aspiring New York congressman running for the U.S. Senate. After a crushing defeat his first time running, he retreats into brief despair to practice his concession speech. Hope comes in the form of a chance meeting with the lovely, free-spirited ballerina Elise (Emily Blunt). The two thus hit it off immediately, but soon Fate - in the form of the fate-controlling Adjustment Bureau - intervenes and reveals to David that he has a big future ahead of him, a future that could include a bid for the White House. To David, that sounds great. The problem: his future doesn't include Elise in it. And the big theatrics in this film feature David using his Free Will to deviate from a Big Set Divine Plan to make his own destiny with the one great love of his life.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is the first truly great film of 2011 I've seen so far. After seven months so far of films that have continually failed to capture my interest, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is finally a film that not only captured my interest, but thoroughly engrossed me in its story, characters, humor and carefully-plotted revisionist universe of a world controlled from behind-the-scenes by mysterious, dapper, fedora-wearing Men in Black Overcoats who manipulate things big and small to ensure that things stay on-track according to The Plan. And, trust me, the mysterious Adjustment Bureau pulls out all stops to ensure that the plan succeeds, and sometimes these machinations can be quite humorous. But David never ever gives up, despite the many Rube Goldberg-style stumbling blocks put forth by the Bureau to keep him on his pre-determined path in life.<br/><br/>Perhaps more than any other Dick adaptation in the last 30 years, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" has characters and situations that are easily identifiable to everyday folks like you and me. While previous films were mostly set in dystopic futures, this film is set in the present, more or less, so there's no loss of time or space. What's more, how many of us have ever wondered if the set course we're on in life is what is truly meant to be? How many of us have ever wondered if mysterious forces are working behind-the-scenes guiding our every move? Will we ever meet ""The One""? (This latter question is especially relevant to everyday people, in my honest opinion.) If so, can it be God (or for you spiritualists, agnostics, and New Ageists out there, a Higher Power?)? Allah? Buddha? E.T.? ""The Chairman""? Who really knows?<br/><br/>Matt Damon has never been better as the high-strung politician trying to outrun his destiny at every corner (many times, literally, as proved by this film's climatic ending foot-chase through the streets of New York). He takes his role seriously and is quite superb, as is his love interest played by Emily Blunt. The actress is equally important here not just because she's the love interest, but her heartbreak as the forces manipulating their lives trying to keep her and David apart really make you hope that they're able to overcome any pre-determined paths in life and wind up together. From the second they first meet, there's an instant burst of chemistry between them, which is something that is rarely achieved in movies these days. And what's even greater is that throughout the thick & thin of the plot, that chemistry remains intact and never folds.<br/><br/>George Nolfi wrote and directed ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and while I'm not sure if this is his debut film and if it is, it's an impressive debut. Nolfi definitely has a future in the thriller genre if he chooses that route; what does Fate have in store for him, I wonder? I was thoroughly on the edge of my seat the entire time throughout this picture, which ultimately seems like a cross between Dick's own ""The Minority Report"" and a high-concept (is there anything else?) Hitchcockian-style thriller. I think that debt is owed to Nolfi's confident writing and directing, and the sure-fire performances of the two leads.<br/><br/>""The Adjustment Bureau"" is very easily one of this year's best and smartest films. Its being largely ignored at the box office only baffles me.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Directed by George Nolfi. Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Anthony Mackie, Michael Kelly, John Slattery, Terence Stamp, Donnie Keshawarz, Anthony Ruivivar. (PG-13)<br/><br/>New York politician Damon has a ""meet cute"" with winsome dancer Blunt and an infatuation sets in; however, the powers that be (in this case, a mysterious, otherworldly group called the Adjustment Bureau) cannot allow him to pursue a romance, and will do whatever it takes to keep them apart. Intriguing setup, with a well-matched pair of likable performers in Damon and Blunt, though the script often glosses over the most stimulating aspects of its existential premise to get back to more conventional storytelling devices--metaphysical implications be damned so long as two attractive people fall in love. Despite some nifty camera tricks and special effects allowing Damon to get from Yankee Stadium to the Statue of Liberty in seconds, the climactic chase lacks the visceral excitement and/or the colossal weight of free will decision it ought to have tried achieving. Liberally adapted from the Philip K. Dick tunnel-under-the-world short story ""Adjustment Team."" Several famous faces make cameos, including Jon Stewart and James Carville; Richard Ashcroft of the Verve fame contributes a couple of songs (""Future's Bright,"" ""Are You Ready?"").<br/><br/>66/100"

","Story wise this movie has got a very odd combination of a sci-fi / mystery story, an action story and a romantic story. In the end it is nothing in particular and it is a bit of everything. Still a pleasurable watch though. The story? Well, Matt Damon falls in love with Emily Blunt, but a certain futuristic organisation specialised in mindcontrol wants to prevent these 2 from falling in love with each other, because it would cause a ""ripple effect"" in history. Will they become lovers anyway, despite the odds against them, or wont they?<br/><br/>Yes, I know, this story sounds silly and it is and I had my trepidations, but this rather silly story is executed in a reasonably enjoyable fashion. And what appears to be silly or weird at the beginning, starts to make sense in the end. (Cant reveal any spoilers). I guess this movie was marketed at a younger audience, because of the lovely romantic story AND because of the lack of any violence or swearing.<br/><br/>End conclusion: mixed bag. Certainly not bad, yet nothing terrific either. It toddles along nicely, entertaining me from beginning to end. Some might find the story ridiculous and annoying. Others (hopefully) will find enjoyment in it as a sweet and romantic action story. Best not raise your hopes up high for this movie, it will prevent disappointment. Suited for family viewing, young and old, because there is no gruesome violence (besides a punch here and there), there is no swearing etc and the story is very lovely in nature."
"peeedeee-94281","6","0","3","30 September 2019"," This Movie Could Have Used An Adjustment
","It's a twilight zone episode that doesn't quite seem to work as a full movie. The problem is that it's a simple love story wrapped in a sci-fi/fantasy narrative. Unfortunately, this strange world needs to have a set of rules for it to work. In the beginning, it seems like those rules are working, but by the end, there doesn't really appear to be any. If a normal person can just start going through doors without training, and even making to the top, then how special are these 'adjustment' makers? All they needed was a hat?! And if they need all these doors to move around, how come they just disappear into thin air when Damon and Blunt kiss?
I'm surprised nobody has pointed out that these special beings are all male. No explanation as to who they are, why they are here, or why they care about adjusting things. And where are the women? Do they procreate, or did they spontaneously created? And are they only interested in helping people who are going to be rich and powerful?
The love story could have been made better if, say, Matt Damon was one of the adjusters and he falls in love with regular human Emily Blunt, then it's a Romeo & Juliet type story. Perhaps at the end, she would end up being an adjuster as well.
Just something that could have spiced up this rather basic story."

That one and only who really makes us feel like we don't need anything else in the world. That is perfectly shown in this movie, it shows how unpredictable we can act when we are afraid about ourselves and even more how we are afraid to hurt person who we are falling for, how sometimes we can be afraid that we can stop each others dreams from happening just by being together. But also it shows that together people can change each other's dreams of life. Change what we want and prove that love can show that there can be also other dreams, dreams that can make You forget what actually maybe other people would really were expecting from You. Instead of that You can always follow Your heart and there are tons of paths that can be completed together. Fantastic characters with good backstories. Beautiful, thrilling and positive.

","We all have our own A' list of movies we're happy to watch over and over.
These days we can load up a movie and pretty much instantly skip to the scenes, even the exact lines, we most love.
When Matt Damon and Emily Blunt first meet is one of those scenes, for me.<br/><br/>There's nothing unique about The Adjustment Bureau - it is after all a take on a great 60's sci-fi short by Philip K Dick.<br/><br/>Zero body count, zero swearing, a couple of punches, and lots of men wearing very cool Trilby hats. It's entirely family-friendly (apart from those punches if that's a thing). It does question God, but in a way that's understandable.<br/><br/>It's also superbly cast. Damon, Blunt, Stamp, Mackie and Slattery all make their parts consummately believable.<br/><br/>But the key to it all is the chemistry between Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.
The scene where they first meet is superbly shot, despite its ridiculous setting. I've watched the whole movie maybe half a dozen times, and that scene never fails to get me. It's one of those ultra-rare moments when I think ""No, they're not really acting. They can't be.

"jormatuominen","9","0","3","6 December 2017"," Is everything planned? Really?
","You know how it is. When someone tragically dies, you are supposed to think that it was God's will and we do not understand his plans. Or if you like, we can't understand the big picture, but there is a meaning behind all the suffering. In the Adjustment Bureau, the protagonist has the courage to ask if it is morally acceptable to make people suffer against their will, if it is your power not to do so. Shouldn't the plan be better? This is a pretty daring question in a theological context and would easily have led the questioner to lose his life in the past. Some would call it blasphemy even today. The short stories Philip K. Dick wrote back in the 1950's are a bit dated by now but they still inspire the best in American film making just as his novels of the 1960's do. The superior being who adjusts things on the ground to comply to his plans is called the Old Man in the original story, in the film the title is more bureaucratic, so it 's not clear if we are dealing with God, an AI or some other entity. It's your call. Einstein said that God does not play dice. But in the story and the film he certainly does so as his adjustment agents keep on tweaking the odds to keep his plan going. The first time around I didn't really like the film as I was having a hard time deciding if it was a sci-fi or a religious film or simply a romantic comedy with an unusual amount of action. So I decided to give it a second chance and the film began to make much more sense. Besides asking the viewer a lot of very difficult questions the film also incorporates a mighty romance. Normally I do not go for the romantic comedy genre, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt act the parts in a Casablanca kind of manner. It's hard to define but if you have seen the film you already know what I mean. I never knew Matt Damon could be so intense. The scene where the couple accidentally meet in a men's rest room is absolutely thrilling to watch. As far as adaptations of Philip K. Dicks groundbreaking work go, the Adjustment Bureau has to be one of the most imaginative."

This time it was love action with persecution but no shooting. Ideas were also present. Such as floating one on the surface to bottom fishes. This is why we throw the hook for bottom fish.<br/><br/>The movie was a criticism of careerism, human irresponsibility and failure of liberalism and democracy. Fate - one of my favorite topics. The angels of destiny steer the course of history because people do not do well with this task. Well yes, but the chance prevented even the angels and love (of course) wins at the end. Here is the place for a light criticism of the female part in the film with its simplicity and ultimate romance. I can not miss to mention the striking resemblance between the bride fugitive's maid of honor and my acquaintance! Generally quickly showed us everything but successful and interesting.

","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU revolves around a heady, far-out concept conveyed in simple everyday terms. The concepts/conflicts are all explained away to young maverick aspiring senator David Norris (Matt Damon) by the ""Adjustment Men"" who oversee the destiny of the world and everyone in it. This, of course, kills this film's potential as a think-piece that many might want but makes it accessible to a more casual audience. Somehow, it all works splendidly, mostly because of the fine acting by all and the solid human interest story of Norris's love for ballerina Elise Sella, memorably played by Emily Blunt, a relationship that goes against the plans of the mysterious ""Chairman"" who makes all the rules and plans our lives for us.<br/><br/>This film is the most realistic sort of fantasy. . .or is it really fantasy?. . . that one can imagine. It's also good science fiction, even for people who generally hate science fiction. Finally, there is excellent social satire regarding politics, civilization in general, and all sorts of other things. While THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU takes what it has to say seriously, its mood is light-hearted and funny, without any need for serious violence or gore.<br/><br/>As Einstein said, ""If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough."" That being said, the creators of this film, based on a short story by the inimitable Philip K. Dick, knew exactly what they were doing."

They are cosmic humanoids with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who like to micro manage the fine details of human lives without them finding out about it who think of themselves as angels. Rather than evil, they are more like meddling aunts. The plot is reminiscent of Men In Black though not quite so silly. David Norris never figures anything out on his own.

They use real-life political commentators like Jon Stewart, Wolf Blitzer and James Carville in a completely realistic way.<br/><br/>The movie can be interpreted in an religious way.

"robert-temple-1","9","0","2","30 June 2013"," Getting things straight
","This intriguing film is based upon a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick entitled 'Adjustment Team', which alas I have not read. Several of Dick's tales have made it onto the screen, including BLADE RUNNER (1982), TOTAL RECALL (1990), and MINORITY REPORT (2002). He is a very cinematic author. Lest anyone get the wrong idea about his surname, it does not mean what you think, but is the German word meaning 'thick'. However, Dick was not thick either. So perhaps we had better drop that line of discourse. He must have been teased enough while he was alive, and why should he have to endure it now that he has been dead for 31 years? (He died at the age of only 53, a great loss to science fiction.) Here we have a film where the lead, Matt Damon, is allowed to do more than merely run, jump, shoot, and flee. Here he gets to do a bit of acting too, always welcome. And at his side is the sleek, alluring, and let's face it rather mysterious Emily Blunt. How and why can she be so different? Let's hope she never gets 'adjusted' and remains an elusive dryad, which is how she comes across. (I wonder if these Blunts are descended from the famous Blounts, Sir Henry being one of the great pranksters of the 17th century, and his nephew Charles stirring things up even more by publishing books about reincarnation, to drive the clergy wild with frenzy and rage, always a fun thing to do.) And those of us who are MAD MEN addicts (see my review) can only be thrilled to see one of our favourite actors, John Slattery, slatterying his way through the film with his inimitable style (I won't call him a dryad, but he too is one of those people who is different from all the others). How did Slattery perfect his droll style? An interesting subject for investigation. As for the story, well, anyone who has watched all five seasons of the amazing TV series FRINGE (see my review), will be familiar with observers in hats who come from another dimension. Of course, Emily Blunt comes from another dimension too, but that's a different kind of dimension, known as the Indescribably Fascinating Woman Dimension, which is not parallel to but is orthogonal to the Male Dimension (males and females forming two axes at right angles to each other which occasionally intersect, or so the mathematicians might try to convince us, though I myself doubt it and think that an asymptote is the best we can ever hope for.) It seems that there are these higher powers who want things amongst us humans on earth to go according to 'the Plan', and they occasionally have to make slight adjustments and intervene in our affairs. Matt Damon, scamp that he is, catches them doing this one day and they tell him that if he ever blabs, he will be toast, since humans aren't supposed to know about what goes on behind the scenes like that. Damon was supposed to be with Blunt, but then 'the Plan' changed, and she was written out of the script by the men in hats. But Damon is having none of that. (And what sane man would?) So he just won't give up and keeps pushing and pushing, insistent that he loves Blunt, or to be Blunt about it, cannot live without her. This makes life hell for the men in hats, one of whom turns renegade and assists Damon, just like the character called September in FRINGE. The film is really excellent, well done, and the silly things like the hats are accepted because the whole thing just sweeps you along, and what difference does a silly hat make when you are really concerned about Damon and Blunt, freedom, true love, and all those things we hold dear, not to mention holding Blunt and calling her 'Dear'. And aren't those amusing doors that you can open in this film and step through and enter what they call 'the Substrate', so that if you are in New York, as all these people are, you can go direct from 5th Avenue to 10th Avenue in an instant (not that any sensible person would ever want to go to 10th Avenue, much less the sub-acqueous 15th Avenue which is beneath the Hudson River and most people don't know about except those with gills) simply by stepping through a kind of wormhole. Funny how John Wheeler's wormholes have entered into public culture like that, so that even Matt Damon and Emily Blunt can pass through them as easy as you please in order to try to defy 'the Plan' and stay together. Will they succeed? How can they possibly do so with all the paranormal forces arrayed against them? Or can True Love truly conquer all? This film really is a 'good 'un'. Oh yes, and the director is George Nolfi, who also wrote the screenplay. It was his first film as director, so let's see lots more, please. Apparently his next will be about meeting a mysterious woman on Facebook. And speaking of which, I just did a Facebook name search and there he is. I propose to coin a new adjective: nolfacious, to describe a Nolfi film. Let's hope that all his films from now on will be relentlessly nolfacious, blunt, and with a matt finish, and will all have a MAD MEN star. What about Christina Hendricks next time? She's prettier than Slattery and just as droll. She can contact me on Facebook anytime, and I promise to 'friend' her without delay and reach out to her through a wormhole, defying time and space in both nolfacious and a dickian manner. (Which reminds me, one of Wheeler's collaborators on wormholes was R. H. Dicke, but he was also no thickie.) In order to appreciate movies nowadays, you must study geometrodynamics."

"sddavis63","6","0","1","30 October 2012"," Some Reflections On Free Will & Predeterminism
","""The Adjustment Bureau"" has some interesting reflections on the idea of human free will, couched in a quasi-religious atmosphere, and it is at times thought-provoking if not, in my opinion, all that deep an exploration of the subject. Essentially the first question is whether there are limits to free will and, if so, what the limits are. The answer is that of course there are limits to free will. The fact that I have free will is somewhat limited by your free will. I may be able to make choices, but to some extent my choices are going to be dependent on your choices. Our free wills both complement and challenge one another's. So, there are obvious limits to free will. From the movie's perspective the question is of both free will and ""predeterminism"" (the idea that all things are planned; that there are no coincidences.) The movie doesn't go that far. It acknowledges that there are small matters over which we do have free will (such as what kind of toothpaste we use) but it also makes clear that our lives are part of a larger plan, and that adjustments will be made to our actions in order to ensure that the plan gets carried out.<br/><br/>There's the obvious religious overtone to this. Who's in control of the plan? In the movie it's ""The Chairman"" - assisted by secret agent, ""Men in Black"" looking types (represented primarily by Anthony Mackie and Terence Stamp.) The question is ""who's The Chairman?"" The obvious answer might be God, with the ""agents"" then being angels whose job is to ensure that whatever the cosmic plan is gets fulfilled. I wondered, however, from a fairly early point whether this was some sort of computer simulation game, with the Chairman being the programmer and the agents being a sort of anti-virus component that repairs the program is it gets messed up. The movie never really makes clear what's going on in that respect.<br/><br/>That decision to leave a lot of things up in the air is probably the movie's biggest weakness. What was going on was never really resolved. Overall, though, I liked the movie. It wasn't particularly fast-paced, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were likable leads who worked pretty well together. I would think of this movie as a diversion far more than a masterpiece. (6/10)"
"mfisher452","7","0","1","27 August 2012"," Pretty good except for the Idiot Plot problem
","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is nothing new, so its success depends on how well it's done. The butterfly-effect genre, of which this film is an example, is based on a concept in chaos theory that relates the sensitivity of outcomes and recurrences to initial conditions. There are of course 3 movies with that name, but the genre predates the development of chaos theory; it goes all the way back to It's A Wonderful Life. Other examples include Sliding Doors, the TV show Sliders, possibly The Asphalt Jungle, and countless time-travel pieces including Timecrimes and Back to the Future. Ray Bradbury's classic short story A Sound of Thunder, based on (literally) the butterfly effect, was made into a film in which the original story is almost unrecognizable. The Adjustment Bureau conflates this with the conspiracy-theory hidden-forces-at-work nobody-really-knows-what's-going-on genre, which was the explicit motif of Men in Black and is also a theme (major or minor) of The X-Files, Rubicon, Area 51 and Roswell and most UFO stuff, the Alien films, Fringe, The Prisoner, Independence Day and on and on.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau has the advantages of a big budget and major actors. It's set in New York City rather than Toronto doubling for Chicago/Boston/Seattle, etc. (although I don't know, these days you can do practically anything with CGI). The supporting actors are competent, especially John Slattery as Richardson. Matt Damon is almost but not quite convincing as Brooklyn-born New York politician David Norris, and Emily Blunt is captivating and irresistible as aspiring ballerina Elise Sellas. Blunt is 13 years younger than Damon, but there's a lot of that in movies and on TV, and their chemistry is undeniable. David runs for the U.S. Senate and at the moment of his defeat, he encounters Elise. He accidentally witnesses the activities of The Adjustment Bureau, which is a shadowy organization of seemingly superhuman operatives run by The Chairman (you're supposed to infer that The Chairman is God). He learns that there is a Plan that includes literally everyone and everything, that he and everyone else have their assigned roles in the Plan, and that sorry, according to the Plan, he and Elise are not meant to be together. If he doesn't like that, well, it's just too bad. If one's free will conflicts with the Plan, the Plan wins. Oh, and if he tells anyone, he'll be ""reset,"" meaning brain-wiped. The rest of the film is about his attempts to find Elise and to keep the Bureau from separating them again, all the while working on his political comeback. The story is generally well told, although the narrative is a bit jerky and uneven in places.<br/><br/>However, The Adjustment Bureau, for all its great qualities, suffers from a fatal Idiot-Plot flaw: If you were David, and a woman just sort of materializes and Kismet whacks you across the face like a 2x4, wouldn't you ask her name? And then later on, when you meet her on a bus and she tells you her name, what kind of idiot NYC resident wouldn't ask her for her last name? And what kind of idiot woman wouldn't give it? Yes, I have lived in big cities all my life and I know about women who are reluctant to give out their last names to people they've just met, but good grief, she gave him her phone number. You watch this film and you scream, either mentally or out loud, ""For heaven's sake, ask her her last name!"" and ""For heaven's sake, tell him your last name!"" but to no avail. Also, the deus ex machina ending (literally, not figuratively) is a bit too neat."

","Adjustment Bureau begins quite well, with Damon persuasive as a charismatic politician having a seemingly chance encounter with a charming Emily Blunt. After this politico-romantic start, the movie shifts into fantasy territory when Damon discovers that mankind is living based on a plan by ""The Chairman,"" and implemented by men in suits who are probably angels.<br/><br/>So far so good. Damon is told he can't tell people about the Adjustment Bureau, but only told he won't meet Blunt again, and there the angels are wrong, and the film is essentially a cat and mouse game between Damon and his heavenly kibitzers. <br/><br/>It's a cute idea, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is phenomenal; you really believe the whole meant-for-each-other thing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after setting up the premise the movie doesn't seem to have any idea where to take it. It's a short movie, and yet it feels listless and slow, lacking dramatic tension or serious plotting and just sort of wandering along to a rather predictable end after a few predictable turns.<br/><br/>It's watchable."

Further to that, the mechanics of the bureau are played out via a love story, taking place between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, that threatens to derail the bureau's predestined plan.<br/><br/>In watching the movie, I honestly battled with the believability of the plot line and found that rather than adding to the overall script, it detracted from it due to its sheer lack of plausibility, which for me at times bordered on the ridiculous. <br/><br/>It is not the first time an all knowing agency has been used as a plot element on the big screen, other notables include Dark City, and the Matrix, however, what those movies are able to do is to create a whole world independent in its laws and physics wherein the characters are developed in such a way as to be believable within those confines. <br/><br/>I must admit that the only reason I watched the entire movie was because of the chemistry between Damon and Blunt's characters, and the hope in the back of my mind that the director would eventually succeed in making me understand and believe the bureau's role in the overall plot. Alas, while for some parts of the movie I was able to suspend my belief, ultimately the film did not do enough to convince me.<br/><br/>In the end, it felt like the writer was looking to make a love story which asked pertinent questions regarding the balance between life, love, and career but couldn't think of a clever way to do that so they just threw in the adjustment bureau bit. <br/><br/>I feel like The Adjustment Bureau would have been a better love story had they only focused on the the relationship between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.

Shots were planned in advance with storyboards but changed often during shooting to fit the conditions of the day. The visual plan for the film was to keep the camera-work smooth using a dolly or crane and have controlled formal shots when the Adjustment Bureau was in full control, with things becoming more loose and using hand-held cameras when the story becomes less controlled.[12] The final scene (on the rooftop of the GE Building in Rockefeller Center (""Top of the Rock"") was filmed four months after the rest of the film had completed shooting and has a different ending than the original."

Even when one becomes aware of the situation it still works really well. Towards the end of the movie the pace slackens and the story becomes rather hackneyed, leading to a damp squib of an ending. Maybe hanging the whole story on the romance rather than the political angle should have been switched around and it really could have gone somewhere.

Perhaps, in a reversal of the postmodern revisiting of the 1960s in Mad Men this is Roger Sterling (John Slattery)'s tinkering with the future? No, really, it's just another tepid Philip K Dick adaptation. At its time of release (this week) it's fashionable to say its Bourne (the Damon bit) meets Inception (the magic realism bit). However it bears resemblance to others too - Vanilla Sky (noumenal New York), Minority Report (more Dick), The Thomas Crown Affair (hats), The Matrix (predetermination) and even Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (sci- fi romance) to name a few (oh, go on then - Orson Welles' The Trial is also in there).<br/><br/>Like many mongrel films it ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Though Damon has charisma and John Slattery injects some realist ennui into his deus in machina role, damp, compliant phone-ins from Emily Blunt and Terence Stamp shackle the show.

","I had mixed emotions after watching this. I had anticipated a movie along the lines of the ""Bourne"" series or ""Total Recall"". This movie had a lot more of a romance flair to it which ended up working very well between Damon and Blunt. The first half of the movie was written very well and set a great stage only to fall a bit flat during the last half.<br/><br/>The direction seemed to lose its sharpness in some of the silly details revealed in the later parts. Especially the hat the door knob props. It also felt like the ending was rushed a anti-climatic. I never did understand the ridiculous reference to the ""Chairman"".

","I had high, high hopes for The Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are both among my favorite actors, and early inklings of the plot made it seem similar to Dark City in all the right ways. Two desperate lovers being kept apart by a shadowy, powerful group that seems to hold the reigns of fate, itself.<br/><br/>Those high hopes were not realized. The Adjustment Bureau is by no means a bad movie, but it's just so ordinary and unimaginative that it comes off as a watered-down love story/thriller instead of the exciting, tense struggle it could have been. Damon and (especially) Blunt aren't really given anything substantial to do. There's an interesting sequence or two near the end, but the rest of the movie is so pedestrian that the fantastical premise is mostly wasted. <br/><br/>See it if you are a fan of the leads, but don't expect more than a very standard thriller with little sense of tension or depth."

","Basically, I didn't' know what was going to happen in the plot, I thought it would be another one of those tiring political thrillers, but it's completely upside down, I didn't expected that it would be so different and that the next minutes of watching this film would be another great experience. This film is plain fantastic. This is an outstanding romance/sci-fi film, without being too romantic and too science fictional. It isn't perfect, there might be some plot holes, but I just got tired of finding one in this film, because it appears all my questions had disappeared right after it ended, and when I though about it again my questions were answered when I tried to investigate deeper. Just one question remains, were they that advance in technology during early times, were they using those notebooks way way back then. But that question is just for being curious. But if you find one or more plot holes, I will remind you that there isn't a perfect plot, especially if it's a complicated one, so why spend so much time finding a smudge in a plot when you can't even start up your own beautiful idea. This film reminds me of Wings of Desire and Bruce Almighty, and a little bit of Dark City. I love fantasy or science fiction films that doesn't detach itself from reality, for example Nolan's Inception, these kind of films can build up a notion in your mind that maybe it's real, it's not impossible in a world like this, yes it can be true, but no one knows, and it's more likely to be impossible but it can be possible nonetheless. Now, The Adjustment Bureau is a heart-pumping suspense thriller too, it goes so far for being an adrenaline rush without using any type of guns at all, which is unusual in action movies. But can it be called an action movie, I wouldn't call it one, but it's far more exciting than trigger-happy action movies. The running scenes are far more better than car chases. I will not elaborate the story, but it does have a religious blend. But what I like about it very much is, it didn't advertise nor did it destroy one's faith. It's just fair. It's engaging, moving, affecting, sometimes a bit hilarious, and there is a point that it's a bit depressing too, it's an edge-of-your-seat thriller, and it is insightful too, all these great things in one film. I love the story, the plotting, the writing, and directing, it's not the greatest film, but why should I not rank it among the best. I will not let any critics or friends influence me in the way I rate a film or a movie, I'm going to be honest from now on. I love this kind of work, it rejuvenates my soul, it makes me smile inside, it's a relief from a hard life, and the stress is gone for a while. I love great films. I can't, I wouldn't let anyone stop me from watching films."

","I was looking forward to seeing this, but was very disappointed when I finally saw it.<br/><br/>Damon is a pretty good actor, but in this he was like a wooden doll. The love scenes were as though the lady was kissing a mannequin. The reason I note this is because most of the reviews talked about how romantic this movie was. (I'm glad real romance isn't this bad.) And not to pick on Damon too much, but did anyone see him run? We burst out laughing at the way he runs. He's runs like a robot or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie made no sense whatsoever. At one time the members of the bureau said they were kind of like angels, but never said any more about what they were. They weren't human, but there was never any explanation as to what they really were.<br/><br/>They were definitely fallible, so angels or messengers from God would be out of the question. So we still don't know.<br/><br/>Actually, I loved Matt Damon in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' where he played a very creepy gay guy, but in this he seemed to be phoning it in.

","Movies that sticks with you and makes you think for a while is always good, no matter what they are about really. The Adjustment Bureau raises the topic of fate and free will, with agents hidden among us, stealthily nudging us in the right direction so everything goes according to the Plan. The movie is about David Norris a congressman running for Senate that by chance runs into Elise, a promising dancer. They click, but they being together does not agree with the Plan, so the agents are sent in to correct it. But love fights everything, and David can't let Elise go, hard as he tries. Finally he decides to put everything at risk and challenge the Plan, just to be with Elise.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau is a thriller with a philosophical edge. Do we really have free will, or are we constantly adjusted? If it goes as in the movie, most of us will never know, and therein lies the thrill. It poses a lot of ""What If?""-questions that stuck with me at least. So even though when neither Damon or Blunt was at their best, the plot rescued the movie. Originally a Phillip K Dick idea, it is strong and vivid, as many movies based on Dick's stories has proved to be. The best acting is instead made by the agents, especially Anthony Mackie as Harry, but also John Slattery and Terence Stamp.<br/><br/>I really liked the movie. Not for the action, not for the acting, but for the bright and inventive idea that is the basis for the plot. Exciting and entertaining through and through.<br/><br/>8/10"

But enters into the scene, a bureau,the Adjustment Bureau, as mysterious as it can be, who is hell bent on keeping them apart.<br/><br/>The story is gripping and has the right balance of intrigue and suspense mixed with a correct proportion of give-away of the story without laying it out absolutely. It also gives plenty of food for thought and throws questions which mystify you and you have to go beyond the realms of rationality and shake the very foundation of your existence in order to find the answers.Only thing is that there could have been a little subtlety and the climax could have been dealt with a bit more intelligence only to make it better.<br/><br/>But having said that the movie notches up high points for being unique and spontaneous.

","Well, I finally saw The Adjustment Bureau and I'm very happy to say it went above and beyond my high expectations. I was hoping it'd be really good, and it was better than great! Matt Damon stars as David Norris and is immediately a likable character simply because he has faults and flaws that he doesn't let ruin him. He picks himself back up and is honest and open to everyone. This is easily my favorite character and role of his.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is the love interest, and she makes for a very quirky, fun character that has great chemistry with Damon. I know the movie is written that way, but it's still great chemistry between Damon and Blunt that you almost forget that they're acting.<br/><br/>Terence Stamp plays Thompson, a brief character, but is easily almost the star of the movie. Stamp is known to me for his Jor-El portrayal on Smallville. He is so good in his scenes with Damon, that you can dismiss his dialogue as being villainous and just being truthful.<br/><br/>This film isn't great because of the acting, although it helps. However, the real golden piece of this film comes from the opening slingshot that is pulled back so hard the viewer is forced to leap into the story and not even care to understand everything going on. Instead, you just follow along and just wait for the next unexpected thing to happen.<br/><br/>It has simply stunning visual and special effects that I was in utter awe. When the Bureau open doors to baseball stadiums, museums, downtown New York and more but when normal people do it, it's nothing extraordinary. It's quite a spectacle to see.<br/><br/>Tack on some witty humor that hits your face so quickly with a splash, this movie has a profound lasting appeal. It will be with me for a long time and I can tell you that the wait was well-worth it. This movie rocks! It is one of the best of 2011."

","On a very surface level, I liked this movie. On a deeper level, I don't. It's another movie that reflects the modern way of thought: 'God makes mistakes, too.' - 'God doesn't know best, I know best' - 'It's all about me' - 'I'm going to have things my way (my way or the highway)' - 'I can defy God because I have free will' - (and the list goes on). When we are given precious knowledge and insight into the way God works and is moving, and we STILL demand on doing things our way, we are in a very serious danger zone. What caused Satan to fall? Pride - by thinking that he could do what he wanted apart from the Almighty - then acting upon it. It's movies like this that seem to have such a strong-hold on so people's minds, that if you cannot be with the person you want to be with - not even life itself is worth living. How many suicides occur each year because someone broke up with someone and they felt they could not live any longer? Love stories that convey those things are indeed dangerous on the young and weak in society. Stories that convey defying, disrespecting, and distrusting God are indeed dangerous to everyone in society. The end message is 'If you push Him enough, He'll give in and give you what you want' - 'God actually does want you to fight against him and fight for your free will because its a gift worth fighting for' - Can you see where these are serious twists on truths? Very serious twists. Watching this movie reminded me of one of the very first novels I ever read when I was a teenager, called 'Heaven, Hell, and the Megas Factor'. It's basically the same principles - or lack thereof. I don't recommend watching this movie for those purposes, but if you did like the movie, you would like the book 'Heaven, Hell, and the Megas Factor'. I really did love it when I was a child, but I've grown a little bit older and wiser since then."

","Quote what Emily Blunt's Elise Sellas rightly said in the film ""I think I'm not a romantic type"". So am I, adapted from a short story from Sci-Fi mogul Philip K. Dick, The Adjustment Bureau is a more lovey-dovey type than a Sci-Fi saga, maybe in another term, it is a straightforward romantic-chick flick camouflaging with a soft Sci-Fi shroud, (compared with it, SOURCE CODE 2011,is way more hardcore and theoretically compelling).<br/><br/>It's kinds funny to see all the hat-men from bureau engage themselves into the break-up mission with meticulous deadpan, which against the fact that the director clearly has no intention to elaborate the so-called butterfly effect or chaos theory plan. (Thompson, Terence Stamp's character, states that the bureau has been manipulated the globe since thousands years ago, WWI and WWII are the exclusive gaps when they were experimenting on human beings to run the world themselves, what a portentous bluff! We all should thank bureau to stop the war and question what the hell is the 2012 doom then?). <br/><br/>One merit pops up is the strong affection between two leads, despite of Matt Damon's wooden face, neither Matt nor Emily excels in playing lovebirds (cf. Matt Damon in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES 2000, with an alluring Penelope Cruz). This time, with the help of the random doors, their engagement intensifies and we are not allowed to ruminate during a spate of space travels (not so original though, cf. JUMPER 2008). <br/><br/>As a novice in the director field, the screenplay writer of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007) George Nolfi took the thorny task to both direct the film and write the screenplay, the result could be worse, I must say, with visual swiftness and an Utopian concession to romantics, at least he has aimed right on target."

"daenhudspeth","Null","0","1","1 August 2011"," I want my 2 hours back! – My review on Adjustment Bureau
","To paraphrase one review ""God and his angels are no match for two Americans"" in love.<br/><br/>Contrived plot save your time and earn your 2 hours back (minus the time to read this of course)<br/><br/>Theory of Destiny does not require a higher power to need help with the plan from anyone. Within the true theory or doctrine of destiny, destiny or predestination is already set. There are no adjustments needed you don't have control because everything is already planned out. You don't have choice because everything is already planned out. <br/><br/>It is all predestined. This is why this doctrine is false we do have agency. But this review is not a discussion of destiny– it is a discussion of the movie which contains a plan for all people and the world given by a chairman. The chairman is an unknown being with very limited powers, although he intends to keep the world on track according to his plan, which by the way, does not seem to have a purpose. BTW, why does the chairman have limited powers?  Water affects his ability to read peoples intents – or something - Why does water affect the angels and chairman? Silly, plain silly. That would have to imply that the chairman did not create earth, so he couldn't be God. What is the extent of the chairman and the angels power  He clearly doesn't know what is angels are doing  Clearly only has influence on the people of the world himself through the angels, so how did this world come into existence and he end up the chairman<br/><br/>If the 'angels' are helping further the plan, and have some special powers, and can't die, how is it that one could fall asleep? This is how the whole thing starts. If the angel knew he needed to have the main character spill coffee to stop him from meeting the girl, why not do it once he realized it and not 5 minutes after chasing the bus. Why not have another angel have her spill coffee too, doubling your chances of them not meeting. Why not 'adjust' her and him, why only him? Once they meet and get frisky, why not adjust him with a spell of ED so they can't have sex? ;-)<br/><br/>Also, how is it possible that between the chairman and the angels, no one knew he would end up seeing them 'behind the curtain' show at the office. Why couldn't the angel following the main guy notify the others that he is 'off plan'. <br/><br/>The main character wasn't much different from us, except the angel fell asleep and he saw behind the curtain. Before that, he was a drone like everyone else. <br/><br/>If those guys could sort of freeze the show to 'adjust' that character 'behind the scenes' then why not 'adjust' the main character or the girl. End it sooner<br/><br/>Why not make him miss the next bus where he sees her on the street and they meet again? Why not 'adjust' her and the guy she was engaged with so that they get married and are happy by the time the main character meets her again. Why not adjust the bus driver or the other thousands of people around. <br/><br/>When they finally are starting to get together, we find out that they were supposed to be together two times in the past, but the plan changed (more than once), why not change again? Why not 'adjust' their lives (and the other people necessary) so they still achieve their potential? <br/><br/>At the end they discuss how we are supposed to follow the plan, for the greater good, but that we, somehow, can still choose. There seems to be a lot of focus on the importance of sticking with the plan and every day we are adjusted to make that happen. These two characters transcend the plan through their love. So clique. Not only that, the chairman is touched clearly not a very connected chairman, and clearly everyone else in this world is more like a robot – so easily manipulated. So most of us must live a lifeless life - being easily adjusted all the time At the end we are told we all we have is our choices something I do believe, but according to the movie I am left to think – we have choices, and supposedly the chairman really doesn't even want that since he has a plan that shouldn't change - even someone as committed to going against the plan as our main character, the chairman and his angels are working hard to thwart it."

","Trust Hollywood to take a perfectly good Phillip K Dick short story and totally butcher it. Well, the movie wasn't that bad, but from when I first saw the trailer I knew that it was a Phillip K Dick story, but after discovering that the movie is about how manipulative force is attempting to keep the two protagonists (who have fallen in love) apart is typical of a Hollywood butchering.<br/><br/>Granted, I have argued with my friend as to whether Dick does write romance into his stories or not, but with this film, it is irrelevant, because the original story was not about a romance, but rather about a man who accidentally stumbles upon a department whose job is to subtly adjust the events of the world to send it on a specific course, which in the end will be beneficial to humanity.<br/><br/>In this film the question of whether we are in control of our life, or whether external forces control us, is explored. However the insinuation is that the head of the bureau is God, and the people that perform the work of the Bureau are his angels. This question is asked of them, but it is given a very coy answer.<br/><br/>However, the theme of this film is the question of freewill, and whether free will is good for us. Of course, the main characters are fighting against the bureau to make their own choice, which is against the plan of the bureau, and the climax has them being given the gift of freewill as their determination to create their own destiny.<br/><br/>Is the desire for free will good or not? I guess that is the point the movie tries to way, and it says that it is, however it is only good in the hands of responsible people. Everybody else is simply not mature enough to be allow to make their own choices, because if they do, then disaster will arise.<br/><br/>Free will is a theme that the bible explores, but does not give us a real answer as the who idea of free will is caught up in the idea of predestination. We are free to chose to become Christians, but then we are also told that we have been selected since before time to become Christians. This whole concept, though, is caught up in extra-planar ideas that are so far beyond us understanding that it is a concept that we will not be able to grasp until such a time as we are freed from the chains that bound us."

","The ""Adjustment Bureau"" is an abstract movie. In the same way that an abstract painting leaves the viewer to ponder its meaning, so too must the viewer conclude what this movie is really all about. <br/><br/>To some it will be a modern love story, to others a fable on the frailty of human nature, and the terrible costs some sections of society, and some might say our planet itself, have had to pay due to the idiosyncrasies and whims of those in positions of power. <br/><br/>Others still might relate it to their religion, with the ""Chairman"" perhaps being their God, and there are many, many other interpretations too numerous, and unknown, to mention.<br/><br/>To me it is a clever and intelligent fantasy sci-fi movie carrying a very uplifting message. I tend to look to the main character of the movie, David Norris (the ubiquitous Matt Damon) as inspiration for my interpretation, as it is basically his tenacity and stubbornness that win the day (and the girl). Emily Blunt is, as always, enchanting as the understated and slightly quirky English dancer, Elise Sellas and it is David's obsession with Elise that drives the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie plays Harry Mitchell, an unlikely Cupid whom ultimately strings David's bow with the desperately needed arrows. And it is really Harry Mitchell's retort towards the end of the movie that resonated with me, and provided the final piece of the jigsaw. He says something akin to ""we wouldn't need to plan for you at all if you could plan things properly yourself"".<br/><br/>And therein lies my take-away from this wonderfully enigmatic movie. If you think about it, each and every one of us probably features in the plans of others, whether they be individuals, groups or organisations and whether we know them and their plans or not.<br/><br/>This movie tells us that when someone has a plan for us, we don't necessarily have to go along with it, even when it appears to be the mother of all planners - the unseen ""Chairman"" – in whose plans we feature. <br/><br/>We all have choices and it is David Norris' final choice, to turn the door knob anti-clockwise - which he'd been warned not to - that finally sees the ""Chairman"" allowing a replan that has David and Elise together. <br/><br/>So if we all want a happy ending we should ditch the plans of others, and make our own choices in life.

","I was writing another review of this and the internet blinked. I think it was the Bureau reprogramming my review. I am trying again here before this one joins Area 51 like the last one.<br/><br/>This is a romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt that is considered taboo by the Bureau, the power of fate which determines everybody's life. It is old fashioned in that Blunt is presented as the helpless woman who can't pursue Damon but he has to come after her to get what they want.<br/><br/>Of course the Bureau is behind her not being able to pursue him. The first guy of the bureau who is predominate plays Roger Sterling on Mad Men. Then they kick it upstairs to Terrence Stamp. The supporting cast is pretty solid in this one. Jon Stewart plays himself in this one.<br/><br/>The music adds suspense, and the pace of the film is good. Those things It is a above average suspense thriller. If you buy into a romance film, you will enjoy it."

","This is a very disappointing film, with many unanswered questions. There have been many almighty and angel stories in the past. Despite good location shooting in New York, this one does not work. It is a story of angels (never named as such, though strongly implied) keeping the world straight, on advice from their superior, who turns out to be whoever and whatever you believe him to be. Sound familiar? Mankind had been saved by divine intervention over the years. This time the hero, Damon, (character Norris) was tagged to be a good and wholesome president and these angels were going to make sure he got there. The love interest in his life, Blunt, (character Elise), was getting in the way, though it is not made clear why, so they had to be kept apart. I won't spoil the ending. It is a vehicle for special effects, though none of them are very spectacular. Some scenes are rather slow. Dialogue is poor. How Damon, Blunt and Stamp were ever persuaded to participate in this is a mystery.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original story by Philip Dick, but knowing his work, this was a travesty of the quality of story he wrote.<br/><br/>I fear this is a disturbing kind of pseudo religious message that is being foisted on our youngsters. Be warned."

","OK! I agree with many comments here. The movie lacks lots of explanations and it attempts to confuse some of the religious believes and philosophical concepts related with 'Free Will'. But what to expect from a science fiction movie? People need to learn how to watch and like such genres. You don't need all the 'Explanations' to be accurate and correct. You just watch them for the pace and creativity, and yes, this movie has that pretty good.<br/><br/>I won't tell much about the movie that can spoil someone's interest to watch the movie. I will say that the movie is more of adding Sci-Fi and Thriller concepts into Romance. If you watch it with this concept, you are indeed going to like this movie. The movie is fast, and keeps your interest intact. One thing there though. The movie being into Romance, it needed little more Character building and love chemistry. From Sci-Fi and Thriller point of view it is good.<br/><br/>7/10 is very good rating from my side (best rating every given is 9). Must watch it if you like Sci-Fiction movies."

","The Adjustment Bureau is a breath of fresh air for me. Watching it was quite a different experience then watching usual today's movies. It works well both as a melodrama and as a pro sci-fi complex drama. Damon and Blunt are both very good in their roles and good old Terence Stamp delivers another pretty memorable role.<br/><br/>The Adjustment Bureau are a sort of guardian angels of this world, except they are not really angels but more like otherworldly beings that direct and shape everything that's going on in the world. They decide a man's destiny, at least destiny of important men. And women. David Norris is one of these men and he is an ambitious but depressed young politician who is looking to find himself again after getting lost in the maze of his political career after 8 years. He's also still coping with the loss of his parents and brother. A chance meeting with Elise, a beautiful and spirited ballet dancer, makes his dream come true. He feels something again. But the Bureau will not allow this to happen to him, in order to make him continue with his career. And her with hers.<br/><br/>This film is about love, love that can't be destroyed. Elise is the only thing that is not programmed in David's life, the only thing that really makes his life worth living. And no matter what steps the Bureau make to prevent them from meeting again, they always do. Because they are bound together, meant to be. This film really touched something in me and I think everybody feels something when they watch it, they feel hope and they feel what love is about. Love can sometimes be the only escape out of a difficult and painful situation in life and it can guide us back into light.<br/><br/>Wonderful film with 2 very important talents Hollywood has today. Emily Blunt shows again why her career has taken off like it has. She has charm, delicate beauty, talent and above all believability. She's 100% authentic in her part and so is Damon. Terence Stamp is perfect in his role that represents FATE, the one we try to get away from. At least in this movie we succeed."

","An affair between a politician and a dancer causes a time ripple that must be put back on track by fate-like angels of the Bureau.<br/><br/>Miss-sold by a misleading trailer and a quote 'Bourne meets Inception', The Adjustment Bureau shares more with Two of a Kind (1983) starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton- John with a smudging of Dark City (1998) and the look of the 'Rat Pack'.<br/><br/>Directed by George Nolfi it has some small but well executed effects, doorways that open onto other streets when wearing a hat, time frozen moments and so on. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are on form but ultimately it's a great concept wasted on a cringe worthy love story. Because of this Terence Stamp and the rest of the cast appear wasted as much as the intriguing premise. <br/><br/>If modern romance is your thing and you like science fiction there's enjoyment to be found. However, considering this is based on a Philip K. Dick story don't expect something in the vain of previous film incarnations of his work or you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>Sadly even as a romantic yarn it's very average and The Tourist (2010), Serendipity (2001) or While you were Sleeping (1995) it is not.

","Matt Damon is David Norris. He seems destined for a long and productive political career. When he was only 24 he was elected as a Representative in New York, and now is favored to win a Senate seat. But as the movie opens things get derailed for him.<br/><br/>As things are going bad, quite by accident he meets Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas. In fact she is in a stall in the men's room, hiding out, as David is there also, formulating his concession comments. They meet, they kiss, they separate, with no plans to meet again. But they are stuck in each-others' minds.<br/><br/>The story is a modern-day fable, where a supreme organization is called the Adjustment Bureau and to avoid any religious references, the head guy is called the Chairman. In a religious terminology we might call this God and his angels. The grand plan has changed, David and Elise are no longer supposed to end up together, but since they do meet, in this city of 9 Million, the Adjustment Bureau is thrown into a panic mode to make things right.<br/><br/>Clever story, not to be taken seriously, and very engaging. As are the main actors.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Even though David and Elise are perfect for each other, with David destined to be President of the US, Elise also can become a world-renowned dancer and then choreographer. But if she and David marry she will have to subvert her career. David learns this, even though he is not supposed to, and sets about defeating the ""fate"" that the Bureau has for him, and to end up with Elise anyway. In a subordinate idea, it is explained to David, humans once had ""free will"", but that resulted in 500 years of the Dark Ages, so the Adjustment Bureau was formed to get humanity back on track."

Damon and Blunt have such a chemistry on screen that their instant attraction anchors the fantasy/science fiction plot. He is placed with her for a brief encounter that will inspire him to rebound from an otherwise devastating political defeat, by someone called the adjustment bureau. They are never to see each other again, except that he is so taken with her that he spends the next couple years trying to find her.<br/><br/>She meanwhile, calls off an engagement because of her brief but truly memorable experience with him.<br/><br/>The bureau's ""plan"" does not call for them to be together, in fact, it specifically calls for Damon to be without her, so that his political ambitions flourish.<br/><br/>Damon has other ideas, and he is eventually assisted by a bureau ""man in black"" with a conscience that the bureau is not used to. The rest of the movie concerns whether he is able to reunite with her.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie, and I think you will be surprised at the outcome."

","Warning Spoilers!!! I am not saying this is a great film. I was disappointed a bit, but this film is still good. First off, I want to set a few things straight on here. When David lost Elise's phone #. He rode the same bus day after day after they destroyed her #. One commenter said he rode the same bus 7 years to find her (claimed that was too unbelievable), then he happened to see her on the street. First off, this commenter is WRONG, it was ONLY 3 YEARS. He took the same bus the day he met her, so perhaps it was on his way to his and her work anyway????? (I've run into a few people in Manhattan on random days, I live on Long Island, so, I'm not there every single day like them). As to why they keep meeting up, it was not just ""chance"". As that poster claimed. If you paid any attention, The ""Adjustment Bureau"", ""Angels"", or even ""Aliens"" (not mentioned who they are exactly), whatever you wish to call them finally realized they ""made a plan"" several times, for them to meet MANY times in the past. In these other ""PLANS"", they were mean't to be together, until ripples from other plans, caused new plans and they were decided to finally be apart by the ""Chairman"". This is why they have a strong connection, and keep finding each other. This movie could have been a deeper. But, they made it all pretty clear. Plus the Chairman is always someone knew, so the one who helped him I believe was the chairman.... he gave Matt his hat, yet still ended up on the rooftop with closed doors. If they can change entire paths all over the world, they can help them both achieve their goals if they wanted. I believe that man who helped David, was the chairman and will help them with a new plan. But posters, please don't change the story, like him riding the bus for 7 years instead of really 3, and pay attention, like how ""they"" realized David and Elise are constantly drawn together from all the previous plans. One more thing someone mentioned the hats were corny, yet if you paid attention at the end, the guy Harry who was helping them said it changes from hats to other things, right now it's hats that opens the doors."

","The Adjustment bureau, I walked into this movie thinking that it was going to be a nice SCI-FIwith its great reviews and then after a few minutes I felt that this was going to be a copy of the Master SCI-FI film, ""Dark City"", but no, there was an unexpected twist. Instead of the expected forces that shape higher destiny, this movie focused on an emotion that can destroy the best laid plans. Love. Love and this movie had oodles of it, and some real powerful performances by Matt Damon not fighting with weapons, but with his heart. Wow, never thought that I would enjoy such a movie, that even mentioned the Holocaust and that made me nauseated for a few minutes, but then the movie just kept coming, and I loved it. The tech and its seamless integration into the movie was sensational. Awesome low cost ideas that looked far better than any Ipad tech out there. This movie was all about Human Endurance. Spirit and chance encounters. The film was fascinated with chance and free Will and I think that it plays out very well for this film. This movie does break new ground, and is a pleasure to watch brilliant performances by everyone.

Norris finds fate standing in the way their developing love in the form of a strange gang of trilby-wearing men called the Adjustment Bureau who are working according to a plan that certainly does not include Norris falling in love with Sellas.<br/><br/>The film screamed of so many things taken from other films. The Adjustment Bureau agents were very similar in function and design to the Agents of the Matrix and the Strangers in Dark City. The chase through the doors was like the scene with the key-maker from The Matrix Reloaded and Thomson's (Terence Stamp) rant about humans was very similar to Agent Smith's misanthropic rant in The Matrix.<br/><br/>The main difference with this film is that Norris is purely driven his love for Sellas and this film is mainly a love story. There really is very little suggest any global significance of Norris's personal battle to change his own fate. There also some very heavy hints about the identity of mysterious unseen Chairman, the author of the plan though that would be exactly what Agents of The Matrix would want people to think since it would be useful belief for enforcing control.<br/><br/>The film was entertaining despite constantly reminding me of better films.

","Sic-fi isn't quite my thing and much of this movie had me thinking of the several related cinematic reference points along the way (for starters, ""A Matter of Life And Death"", ""Terminator 2"", even TV shows like ""Heroes"" and ""Sapphire And Steel"", all of which adapt the notion of circular time to re-write the future. The difference here is that, in this film, our destinies are apparently controlled by peripheral men just out of our vision, wearing hats.<br/><br/>Trust Matt Damon's rising young senator to buck the tend by falling coincidentally for modern dancer Emily Blunt, thus rewriting the future time-line of his would-be presidential character as well as Blunt's ascent to the top of her chosen profession as a top choreographer. Their love affair isn't part of the plan you see and the film posits the age-old question ""can true love conquer all?"", although to be fair, the ending is never really in doubt.<br/><br/>There was some stuff I liked in the film, the two leads, Damon and Blunt seem to bind together effectively, the story skips along pacify and some of the shots of modern day New York are impressive.<br/><br/>Against this I wasn't quite sure with which story the director was happiest, the romantic drama of Damon and Blunt's burgeoning romance, the race around town at the end as Damon seeks to avoid having his mind erased of all his memories or just the trip around NewYork's major tourist attractions, entered through every different door the fleeing couple run through.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film could could have implied the danger-factor more to give a bit more reason for all the running around - Damon must cover as much ground here as Tom Cruise did in the Firm.<br/><br/>All in all though, the movie was an entertaining diversion, reasonably imaginative if lacking a little in tension to make it more compelling."

","I saw the trailer for this film at least five times, and it sounded like a relatively interesting concept, so with some opinions I had I decided I should give it a chance. Basically New York congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is the ambitious politician and candidate trying to win a seat in the U.S. Senate, but he has so far been unsuccessful. One night he is practising a speech in a hotel bathroom, and he meets ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) who is hiding for crashing a wedding, and they quickly find themselves kiss each other, before she runs away, but he is inspired to give a more well received speech. A year later we see David has not still yet been successful, we also see men in long tailored coats and hats who work for an agency, The Adjustment Bureau, they are responsible for making sure that things happen according to plan, essentially agents of fate. One of the agents, Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), is given the job to cause a coffee spill to stop David getting on a bus, but he does not get there in time, and as a result David is pleasantly surprised to see Elise again, and she gives him her phone number. However David is taken almost hostage by the secret agency and told that he was not supposed to see her again, and he should stay away from her, and obviously not talk about the men in hats to anyone. He ignores this and tries whatever he can to find and reunite with Elise, and he will not be stopped by the deliberate distractions by the agents, this search lasts for three years. Eventually David does manage to find her after all these years getting on the same bus every day, and he says that he lost her number which she accepts, and they seem to be back in love again. Some of the agency records say that David and Elise are destined to be together, but most of the agents, especially Richardson (John Slattery) are insisting that their original plans to keep them apart are right, and they have not succeeded so far. Therefore Thompson (Terence Stamp), one of the big minds of the agency, has a real talk with David, telling him that if he stays with Elise, fate will turn on both him and her, he will keep losing his candidate bids, but he is more devastated that she may not become a star dancer. David decides to take this on the chin and leaves her alone for eleven months, he is devastated to find out that she is getting married to guy she dumped years ago, and agent Harry feels guilty, and gives him the chance to change fate. He gives him his special agent's hat, which unlocks all the doors all over the city, so he runs to find Elise, and with agents chasing after them they go all over the place to stay together. Turning a door knob the opposite direction however takes them to the agency headquarters, and it looks like they will be trapped on the roof by Richardson and others, but Harry helps them. In the end the fates of the couple have been rewritten by the Chairman, so David and Elise are allowed to stay together with no consequences, and only nods from the agents, all in hats. Also starring Michael Kelly as Charlie Traynor, Anthony Ruivivar as McCrady and The Daily Show's Jon Stewart. Damon as always is reliable and stern in many moments, as well as charming, Blunt does well as his kind and nervous love interest, they make a good couple, and some of the individual agents, including Slattery and Stamp are sometimes spooky, the premise of fate and changing it certainly engages you, especially with a love story in the middle, the pacing might be a little up and down, but overall it is a rather enjoyable romantic science-fiction drama. Worth watching!"

I'll admit the plot was rather linear, followed by a seemingly pointless chase scene and a hard to believe first kiss, but I felt that the movie had so much heart and charm that the rest was easy to forgive. I loved the premise and the idea that people could be controlling our destinies, and it really made for an interesting movie. I did feel at times that Matt Damon's character was more in love with the idea that he couldn't have her, rather than that he felt some undefined, intense connection with Elise, but their scenes together were so charming that I couldn't help but giggle and grin from ear to ear.

","Are we in control of our lives, do we leave things to fate, do our choices determine the course of our lives, or are we a miniscule part of some unfathomable plan? Though found in bits and pieces, this movie is an astounding answer to at least one of these questions.<br/><br/>New York Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is a serious contender as the youngest politician in a campaign vying for a seat in the US Senate. As a charismatic crowd pleaser, he is loved by the media and the masses alike. His greatest strength is the high level of transparency he is known for. Needles to say, transparency and politics have never gone hand-in-hand but this is why he is loved as a politician. On the flip side, David's tendency to react on an impulse also gets him to the front pages, but with diminished fervour. After one such incident and a chance encounter, David meets Elise (Emily Blunt), instantly igniting a spark that draws them together. Unknown to them, there are forces at work, arduously preventing a further union. When David questions their authority, he is faced with alarming consequences that could jeopardise his relationship with Elise. As a result, David is left with a choice where he must never see Elise again or risk destroying his and her aspirations in life; this includes his rise to power and her becoming a famous ballet dancer.<br/><br/>Written for the screen and directed by George Nolfi, this directional debut is affluent in creativity and intelligent story telling. Prior to trying his hand at directing, Nolfi wrote the scripts for ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (both starring Matt Damon). It is no surprise then, why this works for Nolfi. The concept alone is thought proving enough to engage the viewer from start to finish. If you have ever wondered why things don't go according to plan or why life sometimes throws a nasty curve ball, it is because a shadow organisation is ensuring we (as humans) do not deviate from a pre-existent, albeit, almighty plan. Conceptually, this is the film's profound message and is plausible in the way the plot unfolds. As the title indicates, agents from the Adjustment Bureau personify Heaven's angels or ""Case Officers"" as one agent calls himself. All case officers enforce instructions or 'adjustments' as written by ""The Chairman"". Playing some of these agents are Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp, in order of hierarchy. While Mackie's character tries to help David, Stamp's Thompson is an ominous force to deal with.<br/><br/>Although this is a plot driven film, what really makes this a 2011 standout is having Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as love truck leads. More than just a love story, the concept here relies on bitter-sweet romance compounded by mystery and uncertainty. What makes this a must watch is the cheer chemistry between Damon and Blunt. While David tries to stand in the way of an omnipresent force, his screen time with Elise is few and short. This adds to the overwhelming feeling of wanting them to be together. If you are hopeless romantic, a box of Kleenex should help suppress those tears.<br/><br/>Coming back to Nolfi, and since this is his first film as a director, I am left with nothing but praises for his attempt at putting together an off-beat romantic thriller. While I can place the film somewhere between ""City of Angels"" and ""The Butterfly Effect"", The Adjustment Bureau holds its ground in creative thinking. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes towards the end, while the build up of suspense and mystery is rewarded by a low-key climax. But considering everything else this film has to offer, Nolfi can be given the benefit of doubt with as much as an applaud for his efforts in producing what will be considered unforgettable and unconventional.<br/><br/>Come Oscar season 2012, I won't be surprised if this film is nominated for an Academy Award."

Looks like the Museum of Natural History to me. otherwise the movie was very good. emily blunt character seemed to represent good and the adjustment bureau - evil. but i vacilated several times as to which was which and the movie did not really answer this for me. watched this with my niece who is much younger than i and she seemed to feel the same way. we revealed our suspicions to each other near the end of the movie. it was a really good movie, we both enjoyed it, just wanted to point out the blooper about the museums and the website does not offer that option. this is the only option to give my view."

","I've read a few comments saying that the story was ""augmented"" by a silly love story. If you think that you're really stupid. This is not SyFy its not Inception IT IS a love story.

","Philip K. Dick's stories have been treated badly (take I-Robot). But, at least I-Robot had it's betterment as an action thriller. The Adjustment Bureau is neither an action thriller nor drama, it's blindfold romance where the couple seems to be separated by a group of mysterious men in hats. Here's my first question: Why pick out a NY senator and a ballerina? And can't you find a guy whose life is much more thrilling; like James Bond or even an astronaut for example. Somehow, Nolfi, the director, and Nolfi, the screenwriter don't make a connection. As a screenwriter, Nolfi saw the film as a post-modernist representation. But, as a director, he fails to bring that out. And what's with the awful acting? Blunt loses track of her dialogues thinking that a plunging neckline will distract the viewers' attention. Seriously, Blunt should consider better acting like she did in Young Victoria. Matt Damon can be called a misfit in this film. It's just because, he has been labeled as Jason Bourne, and seeing him not jump from buildings is a downer. This film has a concept which it fails to convey."

","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU – CATCH IT ( B ) The Adjustment Bureau is a difficult & different. It's not a usual sci-fi movie with lots of special effects and action, its Romantic sci-fi where the hero is fighting with the time/faith to get the girl he loves. It won't be wrong to say that the studio & director has tried their best to make the movie as simple as they can, because even in first 20mints when the bureau appears you understands their method about keeping people on their path so they can be a great help to the world. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt share electrifying on screen chemistry. I've never been Matt Damon's fan though I've always admired his work since ""Good Will hunting"" to ""Ocean Eleven"" & ""Jason Bourne"" franchises to recent note worth roles in The Informant & True Grit. Even with all those big and noteworthy movies, I can never imagine Matt Damon as romantic lead but he still did impress me. Emily Blunt is gorgeous & very talented. Emily Blunt's unlikely pairing with Matt Damon and somehow it work wonders here. Their first meeting in the gent's bathroom is brief but their chemistry just electrify the screen and you can believe why he fight so hard for her. The only thing heavily disappoint in the movie is perfect ending. The ending came off dopey & made the whole experience sort of disappointing. Well they say sometimes the happy Ending ruins everything. Overall, just before last 5mintes the whole movie is immensely enjoyable."

","The Adjustment Bureau, The question is can you change fate? Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both give a great performance which i thought made the movie all the more engaging. their feelings between them is the focal point for the majority of the movie, as their relationship is truly tested. the Bureau is willing to do anything to keep them both on the 'plan' as they watch almost every move they make.<br/><br/>A slow beginning turns into a wild chase of another dimension, which ultimately ends with a choice that will change their fate forever. the Adjustment Bureau is a well designed and created concept that pushes the boundaries of what is actually guiding us all on our paths day after day. the acting between Damon and Blunt is amazing. there is definitely great chemistry between them that makes for a very believable story.<br/><br/>visually the movie is great, with the effects being subtle and very convincing. as the plot thickens, you start to discover what the Bureau is and why they do what they do, and how they do it. although you tend to guess the ending soon into the film, you find yourself engaged in the visuals and the methods behind the Bureau, and waiting to see just how they find their way through.<br/><br/>Overall, i thought this movie deserved a 7/10. it was good thrill ride and i loved the chemistry between Emily bunt and Matt Damon. the chase ends with a decision and a ending which you can see coming a mile away, but nonetheless, you find yourself watching to the end.<br/><br/>Luke."

","I saw this as an in-flight, and I usually don't like to review something that I can be sure was edited, but I don't think the airline version is all that different from what played in theaters.<br/><br/>This is a good, solid film. When Damon first broke through, I thought he'd be a lightweight, but he's proving to have some gravity (not to say that he gets the Oscar for this, but he does turn in a good performance). I like Blunt more, each time I'm exposed to her work (she was great in Sunshine Cleaning, and her appearance on The Simpsons made for a good ""Lisa episode""); here, she is an appealing, bohemian sophisticate. No actor's effort steals the show, but everyone did a fine job.<br/><br/>The various members of the Bureau themselves convey an enjoyable blend of (1) the agents of the Matrix films, (2) the angels of City of Angels, and (3) the exhausted functionaries of the MIB, or a le Carre spy novel - I thought that the screenplay did a pretty good job of preserving their mystique.<br/><br/>The story itself was intriguing, and the sort that I always enjoy (the ""hidden reality behind reality"" films, and the ""free will vs. fated"" stuff). I would have liked to have seen more rumination on the free will vs. fated, but with that, I guess it gets boring for the masses. Also, I thought that there were minor logic lapses (but when you have the main characters in your story go through the looking glass, you get to dictate how/what they'll think/do). The end wraps up neatly. Maybe a little too neatly?<br/><br/>All in all, it's a good one. See it."

","The Adjustment Bureau The Adjustment Bureau is a 2011 supernatural thriller directed by George Nolfi. It stars Matt Damon (Oceans series, Good will hunting) and Emily Blunt ( Wolfman, The devil wears Prada) Before I begin I would like to add that this was the first time I ever went for a movie without knowing what it's about or who is in it. I just bought the ticket to escape the heat and was hardly expecting anything spectacular. The fact that I was actually surprised came as quite a bonus considering how I was actually planning to sleep off the entire viewing time.<br/><br/>So anyways the movie started off as a typical political thriller with its intense moments indicated by the music and an entirely huge collection of men in suits, all looking grave and serious. In fact i was half expecting it to be something on the lines of Michael Clayton if only half as good. It was only after 15 minutes into the film that the scenario completely flipped . From men in suits carrying books and files to time taking a halt and notebooks with digitally moving parts to even sets changing from one location to another through weird doorways. It was then that i realised that this movie was going to be anything but boring.<br/><br/>The movie starring Matt Damon and Emily blunt is a romantic science fiction thriller and we all know how rare that is. It follows the life of David Norris (Matt Damon) who is running for the Senate. Due to unexpected circumstances he looses his lead in the election and is thus at a point where he has to deliver his final speech before the final results come in. Here is where he encounters a girl who in 5 minutes changes his prospective on things after which he decides to change his rehearsed speech and delivers something spectacularly honest and offbeat. Even thou he loses the current election his unorthodox move puts him as a favourite for the next elections.<br/><br/>All through this we witness strange men in overcoats and hats watching and monitoring his entire move. The next day he runs into her again on a bus even thou we are told that certain people were trying their level best to make sure he misses his bus. From then on it sets off a series of incidents which according to the men in hats was never supposed to happen. That is when they intervene and introduce themselves as the Adjustment Bureau. A group with extraordinary powers who follow the orders of the 'Chairman' (a synonym of angels following the orders of GOD) . They inform him that he is supposed to be very important for mankind and his further association with the girl might jeopardise the entire 'Plan' Their job was to make sure that things move according to plan. They have maps which charts out the path of every human being. They can change and arrive at any location instantly through a series of doorways. They can cause incidents on their own will and they were willing to put all their resources to use to make sure these two never meet. Bizarre as it sounded he agrees to their conditions. But a thing like love and curiosity is a lethal combination. From there on the movie turns into a roller coaster ride as we follow every step of Norris to discover how things unfold.<br/><br/>As a movie it surprised me to a great extent as I never actually believed that it would be this entertaining. This being the first directorial venture of George Nolfi , whose writing credits include The Bourne Ultimatum and Oceans Twelve, he did quite a fine job in doing justice to the plot which in itself could have gotten quite convoluted and confusing . Instead he introduced a certain smooth flow to the entire plot where no scene seemed unnecessary and there were hardly any blank or boring moments. One could say the concept came a little close to being like City Of Angels only with less mush and a more solid story line. The performances of both the leads as well as the side characters were believable but nothing spectacular, for after all it was more of a story driven movie rather than performance. We expect good things from this director in years to come.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5/5 Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com"

","I just watched the movie and I was quite impressed with it. What a message this movie carries, and how people just doesn't notice. <br/><br/>The movie is about God or the ""Chairman""as they call, and how he is a dictator in peoples lives. The message of the movie is don't listen to what is written in the book from God (Bible), but rather create your own rules. This actually pleases God. There is an evident parallel between ""Harry"" (Anthony Mackie) and Lucifer the fallen angel, since Lucifer before his fall was a guardian angel, and later on decided to rebel against God, because he didn't agree with God and wanted to be like God, dictating the rules. The plot makes you cheer against Gods Will, so the couple can fall in love (with the help of Harry), but they also portray a God that took away free will, which is a lie. <br/><br/>And here is the most interesting part of the movie. The place where they get to contact the ""Chairman""is through the ""Statue of Liberty"" and once they get inside they get to the house of god which is at no less than the Rockefeller Center Building. OK, no big deal, but just do one thing, search on you tube for the words ""Statue of Liberty Secret Symbols"" which is a documentary by the History Channel. And make your own conclusions."

","Do we control our destiny, or do unseen forces manipulate us? Matt Damon stars in this thriller as a man who accidentally comes across what his future has planned for him and realizes he wants something else. To get it, he must pursue the only woman he's ever loved across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York. On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris (Damon) meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt)-who he immediately falls in love with. But just as he realizes this, mysterious men (the adjustment bureau) work to keep the two apart for the sake of the plan. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path I've been waiting for a movie like this to come out for years. If there really is a plan for me, why is it necessary to factor in a 15-minute period where I can't find my keys or I spill coffee on myself and I have to go home and change? What's the point of it all!?! This flick gives you a fun theory as to why; a highly improbable one, but also a thought provoking one. When I watched it, I kept asking myself, ""How did it take so long for a movie like this to come out?"" Sure, it's a little far fetched, but fun never the less! Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have great on-screen chemistry, and this truly makes the rather sloppy narrative more believable. This film's got it all—romance, mystery, drama, and even a wee bit of comedy, but I feel the romantics will love it the most. However, I was rather disappointed with its unchallenging ending. Despite God's plan, maybe, JUST MAYBE, love conquers all."

","This is a good Matt Damon film. Not as good as the Bourne Trilogy, but its pretty good. I never knew who Anthony Mackie was until this movie. I remember him in We are Marshall and this was a good role for him. This movie really makes you think about the Butterfly Effect Theory. it also makes you think about what angels are and what kind of impact they have on society. Anything is possible and I wish that everyone who watches this movie keeps an open mind. It's kind of like what we think of when we watch What Dreams may Come, except not so gay.

Is there to wonder why we are so upset with Scientology? They seem to compete with our own structure of indoctrination by offering another type of indoctrination! That is dangerous! We have so many beliefs that we acquired in our society that any threat to this beliefs system has to be handled forcefully! Of course, a love story is an easy vehicle to peddle idea which are not easy to have accepted and in that respect, I acknowledge the producers and scrip writer for using a narrative which, even if the viewer does not make the connection with the topic of indoctrination, will still deliver a powerful message that we can create the life we choose!"

","My rating: 7.5/10<br/><br/>I have never been the biggest Matt Damon fan. His acting seems the same in any role he plays. The best actors are the ones that can be the most diverse, and I don't believe Matt Damon to be among them, but that does not mean the actor has limits.<br/><br/>This film has something that newer movies seem to lack, an original and interesting plot. Its good to see a movie with some intelligence hitting theaters. Why do you think Inception was so popular? People like to have their minds blown. It's hard to watch this film without stopping to ponder on what just happened. I don't think I will ever look at a person in one of those hats the same way again.<br/><br/>The chemistry of the two main characters was quick but definite. The sparks were flying from the start, which I still cannot decide if that was good or not. Although, from the aspect of the story, it does seem to fit well. It never seems hard to make a character likable, so it seems difficult to give credit for that. Nonetheless, I can't say I wasn't rooting for them all the way.<br/><br/>The ending was VERY predictable. With just watching a few trailers, you're sure to figure it out. But, It's not always the predictability of the ending that is important but how you get there. We've all seen movies that happen to be a bore, but with that certain twist at the end, it may have bumped it from a 2 to a 4 in our rankings. There are some interesting things in this movie but nothing very twist-like. To make another Inception reference, the ending left you wondering. It had one of those epic twists. But, there is nothing like that here to bump it up a notch. That saddens me.<br/><br/>As I said, it's not always the predictability but the path you take to get there. All in all I actually really enjoyed it. I like movies with some intelligence and originality and I think this movie really has it. I would recommend it to any of my friends, and probably will.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Some of us believe that there is a higher power. Not necessarily a religious higher power, but a power that watches over us nonetheless. So what exactly is their job description? What are they supposed to do and see and control? The Adjustment Bureau makes an attempt to leap into the world of the higher power. The world of ""It's out of our control."" So what if you met someone you fell for at first sight? You know when people ask ""Was it love at first sight?"" What if it was? And what if you clicked with that person from the moment that you met them and suddenly they were jerked away from you. This higher power, this force, this group of beings that control everyday ""happenings"" they take that person away. They tell you that you are not meant to be with that person and they are not meant to be with you.<br/><br/>What do you do? Especially if that person is Emily Blunt looking gorgeous Do you cut and run? Or do you stay and do everything in your power to figure out why these ""people"" won't let you be with the one that you love and adore? The Adjustment Bureau is a romantic science fiction thriller. A movie that takes a politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), and shows what can happen when even the smallest tidbit gets out about someone running for office, and it shows us his life after a failure. Then he meets the alluring Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt).<br/><br/>Blunt is hypnotizing in this movie. She is so attractive and so seductive how could David help himself? He sacrifices all that he has going for him to be with Elise. I love a good love story. This is a good love story. He puts everything on the line for this woman even though he has Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) breathing down his neck.<br/><br/>Appearing as if he's just stepped off of the Mad Men set and onto the movie set, Slattery plays the role of the man who appears to be in charge of this whole operation. Not that it is laughable, but the fact that the men in this group wear fedoras makes it possible for them to walk through a door and have it take them anywhere but where it is supposed to take them. It's kinda neat I guess. It certainly adds to the sci-fi aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Ah, the movies Putting a science fiction title on this movie gives it the believability it needs to thrive. I loved the movie. I loved the chemistry between Damon and Blunt. So often we see on-screen couples who appear as though they've just met in every scene. In The Adjustment Bureau, we have a scene where the pair meet up some time after the first meeting and they are just as charismatic with one another as they were when they first laid eyes on each other.<br/><br/>Excellent chemistry, good plot, and some interesting turns make The Adjustment Bureau one to see.

","""The Adjustment Bureau"" theorizes that the Earth is being controlled by a race of superhuman middle-aged men in magic fedoras. This premise could be absurd or frightening, but the movie plays without a trace of whimsy or horror. Instead, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is like ""City of Angels"" and ""Ghost Town,"" a romantic fantasy about benign supernatural forces interacting with humans in New York (I'll let someone else make the facile pop-psychology analysis). The cosmology of the film is explained in a couple of quick expository scenes, and therefore not that interesting, and the special effects are pretty mundane -- the producers seem to have budgeted more for high-profile cameos (John Stewart keeps showing up, and Michael Bloomberg drops in for a montage) than CGI. And the acting is competent but for the most part unspectacular. Still, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" has its charms.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a young New York congressman with no apparent party affiliation who discovers the Adjustment Bureau, an omnipotent but generally benevolent supernatural bureaucracy which guides human affairs -- kind of like a less malevolent CIA or more intrusive Google. How does Matt respond to this staggering metaphysical revelation? By obsessing over the fact that he's being kept from the girl of his dreams. And in fairness, that girl is pretty damn adorable -- Emily Blunt, as a charmingly impudent ballet dancer with a knock for short skirts and sharp quips. The hyper-romanticism of the plot makes it difficult to take ""The Adjustment Bureau"" all that seriously, and the epic scenes of men in suits and hats running through downtown Manhattan get a little boring after awhile. But Damon makes for a watchable if slightly inert man on a mission, like a less annoying Tom Cruise or slightly more animated Harrison Ford, and Blunt is outstanding as the unattainable object of desire. A bit more Blunt and ""The Adjustment Bureau"" could have been mesmerizing, but as is it's an okay movie that's worth adding to your Netflix queue if you like romance."
"tsettles98","10","0","2","1 April 2011"," The most beautiful film ever made... In my opinion.
","The main reason why this is such a great movie is because how far Matt Damon's character is willing to go to be with the love of his life, Emily Blunt's character. The acting in this movie is also amazing. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's chemistry was great and needed to be great to make the film make sense. Terrence Stamp's big monologue scene was awesome and literate, making George Nolfi officially one of my favorite writers of all time (along with Aaron Sorkin and Ehren Kruger and some others). Anthony Mackie needs to be in more movies, proved his acting is great.<br/><br/>There's also the cool thing that this movie is the most non-violent thriller film ever made! There are no guns even shown in this film! That is new! The only violent parts that I recall are two punches and one scene where Matt Damon trips violently. That's it! The rest of the movies is just big bad-ass chase sequences.<br/><br/>It's a romance movie too that is tied in with an extremely cool and original sci-fi concept written by the greatest sci-fi author of all time in the 50's, Philip K. Dick. I plan to read the short story soon, and from all the bad comments (which amaze me!) must be completely different from this movie. Maybe there's no romance or something. I personally thought that it made the film more intriguing and it fit well. I liked it.<br/><br/>This is the date movie of the year! (Avoid Beastly) And, it is a date movie that girls AND guys will like. That almost never happens! The last time I saw that was in The Fountain.<br/><br/>Okay, I take back what I said in the summary.

I suspect that many churches will be upset about this (ever heard of The Life of Brian?). It leaves some thoughts in your mind as you are lying down in bed trying to go top sleep. Tohmpson of the Adjustment Bureau says that they started off very involved, but then introduced free will. The Dark Ages then took place. Then they (The Bureau)step back in and bring the Renisannce and the Revolutions (Science, Industrial). They stepped back and WWI and WWII plus the Great Dpression. It puts a Thriller (not ACTION thriller), romance, and some comedy all rolled in one. The Adjustment Bureau gives you a four out of five stars adventure you can't miss!

","Before I state my points about the Adjustment Bureau, I want to state that I enjoyed watching the movie for its entertainment sake. My purpose here is to compare the movie to Christian theology. This movie makes no pretense at being a Christian film, so I am not faulting the film-makers. Rather, I wish to alert Christians in the audience viewing the film how this movie strays from the reality of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Christian reviews of movies are usually trivial which focus almost solely on nudity, violence, foul language. They never really address the world view expressed in the film. The closest comment on the world view I found from Christian movie critic, Ted Baehr, said: ""there is one slightly ambiguous, theologically false ""Joan of Arcadia"" comment toward the end about God appearing in different, personal ways to individuals that can lead people away from Jesus Christ,"" - a thought that crossed my mind, as well.<br/><br/>Jewish critic, Michael Medved, had nothing but praise for the film. His review is fine for me, but I know that many Christians listen to conservative talk shows without considering the host's world view, blithely assuming it is Christian, too.<br/><br/>Here then, are my concerns. We are led to believe that the Adjustment Bureau are angels working for God in assuring that the lives of people follow the plan of God. At one point, David Norris (played by Matt Damon) is told that he and Elise (played by Emily Blunt) have to be separated because he is supposed to become president someday, and she a great ballerina and choreographer. This won't happen if they are together. It is true that God has a plan for our lives. And for some, it is to be in positions of worldly authority. But the plan of God is for us to know Him through His Son, Jesus Christ, first. Such worldly goals are on the bottom of His list. Discipleship means dying to self, not pursue worldly acclaim.<br/><br/>Ted Baehr points out the main premise of the film is whether or not we actually have free will. The film leaves that answer ambiguously. There are Christians who believe that we do not. They are Calvinists. So for Calvinists this film will be agreeable to their world view. But, the ambiguous answer of the film, is a little close to the truth. We have free wills. God does not plan our sins. But the divine will works with our choices according to Romans 8:26 - ""all things work for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose."" The problem I have with the Adjustment Bureau is that their actions are more characteristic of demons than holy angels. The chairman is implied to be God, but, in my viewing was more easily identified with Satan. It is Satan who offers us power and prestige in this world, not God. God seeks to humble us so we may follow His way, not the world. These cold-hearted agents of the bureau cause accidents to redirect our paths - spilling coffee on us, causing auto-wrecks, interrupting us with phone calls, and so forth - these are actions of demons, not angels. Angels edify and encourage, not distract and bump.<br/><br/>So, while I enjoyed the movie for its entertainment value, I disagree with the world view presented. For me, the highlight was Emily Blunt. I found her portrayal of Elise to be charming and captivating."

","If you enjoy repartee that is razor sharp, funny, charming and endearing as well as excitement with chase scenes and stunning special effects this film has it all. It doesn't over-play it's hand, it stays within the confines of almost believability and doesn't think it's audience is dim- witted. It makes you think, yet pulls you along in excitement and constant changing scenes that will take your breath away. Enjoy the ride, bumpy, shifting, like watching oil change in a pool of water.

","I found this movie to be entertaining, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt was excellent. The plot was fresh, and I really enjoyed the anticipation the main characters brought, waiting to see if they would finally meet again, or if they would ever get together. The concept of people overseeing our lives, and following a script for each one of us was something that makes you think. I think they could have made the ending even better by showing a caption 5 years in the future and a secret serviceman calling Matt Damon to his seat in the Kennedy Center, saying,the first lady is about to start her performance Mr. President. Then Emily Blunt would come out on stage and start her dance. You need to see the movie to understand this premise. It would have made the movie a real feel good ending for me. See this movie.

","David Morris (Matt Damon) is a rising politician for New York. From humble roots in Brooklyn, he is now a state representative and running for Congress. Unfortunately, near the end of a successful campaign, a raucus incident from his past resurfaces and, on election night, David loses. But, his disappointment is somewhat mitigated when he meets a beautiful lady, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the MEN'S ROOM at the campaign hotel. Elise, a ballet dancer, is hiding from security, as she crashed a wedding on the upper levels for a free meal. Supposed to be writing his concession speech, David has a definite connection with this graceful and captivating woman. However, he doesn't get her name or number. A few weeks later, David is catching a Manhattan bus for his new business job when, dumbstruck, he spies Elise on the vehicle, too. This time, he manages to ascertain her name and all of the important information. Fate, unfortunately steps in. Not only does the slip of paper with her number get lost, David finds himself locked in a parking garage with the ""men in hats"". There, they tell the young politician that are in ""charge of the world"" and that he is not fated to be with Elise. If he pursues her, bad things might happen, to her and to him. Calling themselves The Adjustment Bureau, these men try to persuade David that only on their intervention is the world avoiding a few hundred mushroom clouds. Therefore, he, David, is going to be elected senator and, possibly more, in the future but Elise is not for him. Stunned, David is torn between his love for this lady and his own aspirations. Only one of the hatted men, Harry (Anthony Mackey) seems to understand his heartache. Will Harry buck the bureau and ""re-adjust"" the fate of the young couple? First, the premise of the film, a story by the incomparable Philip K. Dick, is truly fine but, perhaps, a bit dated. One can see the action as more relevant to the fifties and sixties, where nuclear war was on everyone's minds and politicians were still viewed as folks capable of uplifting a nation, rather than the more depressing circumstances of the new century. Also, the tale runs out of steam about a third from the finish, dampening the spirits of the audience. Its too bad. Not at fault are the two main actors, Damon and Blunt, for they are very great. One can only wish there were politicos like Damon and Blunt is rapidly becoming a favorite, for she is beautiful and brainy, both. The supporting cast, including Mackey and Terence Stamp, is nice as well. Lovely, too, are the beautiful sets, costumes, photography and effects. Yet, as the script is a letdown, so is the direction, for it doesn't build to a powerful ending or ""mix it up"" enough to sustain a high level of relevancy. So. If you are fan of Dick's other film translations, such as Blade Runner, Paycheck, Minority Report, and Next, you should probably get a ticket for this one, also, or grab the DVD when it arrives. Despite its weaknesses, one finds oneself pondering its ideas after the cinema lights go back up. Or, if you like Damon or Blunt, you should make time for it, too. But, although it hurts to write a less than glowing account, this flick doesn't hit the ""wow"" factor."
"andy-933-696608","7","0","1","13 March 2011"," Broken Destiny
","It's crazy enough for me to accept. Its concept of fate, and the actions of free will challenging those very predetermination's are interesting enough to be moved by the love shared by two human beings. It was love at first sight as New York Senator David Norris (Damon) had gone to the men's room in the wake of his latest defeat. His personal moments are easily interrupted to his own good fortune as he meets and strikes up one hell of a first kiss with a mysterious woman named Elise (Blunt), leaving him with the unending thought of seeing her again. The conversation was filled with enough chemistry to spark that first kiss with as much passion as it brought to the very bond these two individuals share through their brief moments together. Like I said it was love, however to the Adjustment Bureau, a group of guys dressed in suits, carrying the powers to move from door to door at the clockwise turn of door knob, it was mistake. Their interference in David's life reveals their own purpose as the guys who manage the fate of everyone. When someone falls off their predetermined plan they have to fix it with a couple turns. Their intentions to keep the 2 love birds from meeting, other than that one time cannot have been more than just a basic slip of the plan. I can't really stress on how crazy it was as the more compassionate member of this team of destiny repairmen (Mackie) stated that in some ways they have been revered as angels, and I just thought hey, maybe wings are out of fashion, and they just suited up. A style Barney Stintson from ""How I Met Your Mother"" would no doubt be proud to call an awesome form of religion. They even refer to the man who runs all of them as the chairman. Whether or not they're talking about God, I think director George Nolfi brings an interesting point, as well the fact that he mentioned the whole purpose of this was to raise questions. Angels in suits would've been more of humorous way of describing these guys. But were not here to talk suit. I'm talking about fate instead which can be a real bitch when the very concept of free will is more of an illusion for us to believe, rather coldly revered by the words of one of the bureau's top guys Thompson (Stamp) as they get desperate into telling David just how detrimental it is that he and Elise stay apart. They can see the value of their love, as well their very compassion towards one another. However they can see the very devastation of that connection, shattering their dreams as well their hopes of reaching their full potential. In David's case, despite having a previous bad boy background in his years of youth, has a shot in the White House, as President in fact. Elise, with the beauty and rhythm of her nearly flawless dancing has a chance to go pro and really make a name for herself. These revealed secrets only torture and push David into a corner, as he contemplates on whether to decide if life is truly better with or without Elise. The first 3 years of not seeing her, up until the moments they reunited were tough for him, but what was more painful was the last 11 months up until he prevents her pathetic attempts to marry a man whom she feels absolutely no happiness whatsoever. He even gets a little assistance from Harry, who apparently reveals that they've got feelings. In an all night cram session, David's new powers take him all over Manhattan, finding and surprisingly convincing Elise of his dilemma, despite some heated feelings from their last moments together. I can't say leaving someone in a hospital all by themselves is a good way of breaking up with someone, but it sure beats the cold and even slimy method of text breakups. Needless to say, after challenging destiny, and even risking a complete and inevitable fate similar to being lobotomized, the 2 lovers are touched by the hands of fate, the word of the chairman becomes very clear, of a change plans. The power of love can conquer all. Despite challenging the very notion of destiny, these 2 characters spent most of the movie thinking about one another endlessly. They cherished, and fought for every moment they could be together. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is crazy, leaving several questions to be pondered at a level of amused curiosity. As a Catholic I've been raised to believe that Angels resemble figures with halos and bird wings. Don't get me wrong, I found the idea of the suits, as well as the more technologically advanced procedures they took to be intriguing. The transporting hats, the immobilization gadgets, and the plan books. How do we really know that Angel's really resemble the way they've been told? I'm not going to say they're suit wearing, door opening destiny officers. But the film's approach with that idea is telling us that maybe there are other possibilities with the Adjustment Bureau with it's officers and Chairman as synonyms for God and his Army of Angels. Above all the religious complexity, the film is impressive with the performances of its leads. Matt Damon, portraying a politician, with both Charisma, and even a history traumatic enough to serve as his inspirations and even to reach his goals. Blunts' character interesting in the chemistry she shares with David, as well as her reactions towards the whole issue of the being revealed a complete super natural elements. The scene where David transports them to Liberty Island, shows a reaction that relies on not to much exaggeration of her reaction, displaying very convincible panic expressions.Director George Nolfi has brought movie viewers a thriller with enough romance, intriguing forms of insanity, and even a reason for us to never allow our free will to go to waist."
"themoviemavens","8","0","1","12 March 2011"," Solid Action/Romance with a Few Forgivable Flaws
","I must admit – I was a little intimidated with the prospect of seeing director/screenwriter George Nolfi's 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Fresh off the heels of my 'Inception' experience a few weeks ago, I was fairly well convinced I would leave the theater a quivering pile of confused brain mass, too ashamed to reach out for answers. But 'The Adjustment Bureau' did not go the way of 'Inception' in that its sole purpose was apparently not to play kickball with the viewers' sense of reality and leave you so befuddled you'd be questioning your ability to make rational judgments for weeks to come. No, 'The Adjustment Bureau' (A/B) was a kinder, gentler foray into the genre of reality-bending thrillers. Truthfully, to call The 'A/B' a thriller would be about as accurate as calling 'It's a Wonderful Life' a Christmas film. It will undoubtedly be categorized that way, mostly for the sake of categorization, but at its heart, it's an unapologetic romance. Matt Damon (David Norris) and Emily Blunt (Elise Sellas) star as two hapless souls who may or may not be destined for one another – if they could only have a moment's solitude to figure that out. They're besieged by a mysterious group of men in hats who call themselves The Adjustment Bureau, and they've been charged with keeping David and Elise apart for reasons of which they themselves aren't really sure. Loosely explained, The Adjustment Bureau functions as a kind of metaphysical CIA – they exist to ensure that the actions of human beings go according to plan. The way it's explained is that human beings have free will about the inconsequential things, but for matters of great import, well, those decisions are much too weighty to be left up to chance. When Norris reminds one of the Bureau members that the world is plenty screwed up even with their intervention, he quickly retorts, ""If we left it up to you, there would be no earth at all."" So David and Elise spend the entirety of the film attempting to shirk the influence of Fate Personified. These men in menacing dark suits and ubiquitous fedoras possess limited abilities to control the physical world, and are able to intuit the next logical action their subjects will take without having the ability to read minds. They are all in possession of little black books that chart out their subjects' life maps in real-time. Which is why it's confounding that in the first 15 minutes of the film, Matt Damon's character, innocently enough, manages to give them the slip, and stumbles upon some secret information about their organization that puts both he and Blunt's characters in peril. Suffice to say, The A/B needs better security. With so many resources, and help from 'on high', how, oh how could they be so easily foiled by someone who's not even attempting to acquire behind the scenes knowledge of their organization? I couldn't help but think that mistakes like that must happen all the time in a secret organization where employees haven't quite figured out how to lock doors. For reasons that were never explained, The A/B only seems to be concerned with the activities of those residing in New York City. Apparently, there are very few fate-altering decisions that are made outside of Manhattan proper. Go figure. There also seems to be a lack of enforcement of the Celestial Equal Opportunity Employment Act (assuming such an act exists), being that there are apparently no women who can be entrusted with guiding the decisions of mankind (or womankind, if you will). Nevertheless, The A/B has a lot going for it. For starters, its star, Matt Damon has enough charisma to carry the film from start to finish. He and Blunt work well on screen together, although I never felt truly invested in their romance. The A/B seems to suffer from the same ailment that plagues so many psychological dramas – how do you keep your audience informed about the premise of the film, while still leaving room for the human elements that cause the viewer to make an emotional investment? I'm not sure that The A/B has quite solved that conundrum. I found myself rooting for the Damon/Blunt characters, only because I knew I was supposed to – not necessarily because I 'believed' in them as a couple. Likewise, there were times where I felt as though the premise was being hastily explained to leave room for plenty of drama/romance/action. As Oprah likes to say, ""You can have it all, but you can't have it all at the same time."" That fact becomes quite evident when a film like The A/B tries to cram so much 'film' into one film. Thankfully, screenwriter Nolfi didn't resort to 'mile-a-minute' dialogue to cover more ground than he was capable of covering in the film's 1 hr, 39 min. runtime. What we're treated to is a genuinely earnest film that encourages the viewer to believe that in the end, love really does conquer all. David and Elise are repeatedly ripped apart by Fate, only to continue making an effort to find one another again. I have to admit that this sort of film is right up my alley. Scripts that play around with concepts of reality/fate/truth/the afterlife/time travel in an intelligent way tend to speak to me without having to say very much. As long as I'm not able to drive a Delorian through the potholes, I'm golden. If you're a fan of films such as Men in Black, Sliding Doors, Serendipity and even Monsters, Inc. and Wizard of Oz, you're likely to find yourself in welcome territory. Sure, the film veers off into some corny/preachy moments towards the end, but overall, I was captivated, interested and entertained. What more can you ask from a drama/action/thriller/suspense/romance film?<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 *"

The film moves slow at times but does provide a spark and it's one that is worth watching. I really enjoyed the ending too although I thought the start was going to be a lot better than it was. Id recommend this."
"blacklist-1","6","0","2","9 March 2011"," Great acting and lovely romantic chemistry, but the story and screenplay brings it down.
","The Adjustment Bureau has received mixed reviews on here so far and I am not surprised. The trailer has been marketed deceptively to the audience of an science fiction, action thriller and it only has one of the three. The thing is I knew specifically what the film was as one of my friends who saw it told me, a romantic drama. My rating for this film wasn't as high as I wanted to be as for a while I was internally struggling whether to award this a six or seven out of ten, but I decided on a six in the end.<br/><br/>The plot consists of young man David Norris (Matt Damon) who is running for senate in New York. He ends up meeting a beautiful ballerina Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the men's bathroom whilst practising a speech. They hit it off immediately and meet again on the bus, but a mysterious group of men dressed in hats are tailing him and he eventually finds out that they are part of a mysterious bureau that control the choices that humans make due to the past historical atrocities. One man called Thompson (Terence Stamp) tells him. The bureau helps certain people get to the ""top"" to help keep the world in order. They try to keep David and Elise apart as David is destined to become down the road the president of America and him being with her would ruin that.<br/><br/>But he refuses to heed them and threatens to expose their existence so they do everything they can to stop him, which includes using some sort of magic with their hats, which enable them to walk through doors that lead to different locations. David with help from one of the bureau Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) helps him get Elise back and outrun the rest of the bureau.<br/><br/>The main reason to see this movie and what keep it afloat is the great acting from the two main characters. Matt Damon gives a surprisingly touching performance of a man torn between his career and love for Elise. He is even convincing as a man running for the senate. Emily Blunt is even better with a terrific performance and has a wonderful charming charisma that won me over. The chemistry between her and Damon is superb and convincing and you do feel as though they love each other. They are a charming couple, which make them likable and you want them to be together. The supporting performance from Terence Stamp and Anthony Mackie are good and lend decent support to the main cast. The script has it moments of sparky wit particularly in the first couple of scenes between Blunt and Damon and the cinematography of the scenery is mesmerising. <br/><br/>The story is also interesting to an extent of choices, fate and love, but it dosen't go far enough in depth and just brush strokes over it and there some plot holes and unanswered questions like how was the bureau created and when? And the ending was rather silly. As Harry explains to them, they are allowed to stay together because the chairperson changed the plan, but why didn't they just change it to that in the first place? Why put everyone through that? Harry mentions it might be a test and that the chairperson was won over by their determination to be together, but it is too vague and apparently the chairperson can take any form. How? Of another person? Animal? If they can take the form of any person, did their decision to change the plan alter because of the ""person"" they took have different opinions on things? It's never explained and as a result the screenplay just feels empty with huge voids that should have been filled.<br/><br/>It's a good film and I recommend seeing it, but it isn't all it's cracked up to be with even the action it had being of little excitement. Damon and Blunt's acting and their romantic chemistry though carry this film afloat, but it was disappointing as it did have the potential to be much more than it delivered. All the same I enjoyed it from beginning to end and if you want a nice romance film then this is for you."
"kgprophet","6","0","2","7 March 2011"," Not as much of a Thriller as I Hoped
","I had deliberately not read any reviews for this film, hoping to watch it with fresh eyes and be given a chance not to know any spoilers. All I knew was that this film had a twist on the time travel theme. For some reason, I was expecting a thriller movie, instead I discovered it was a romance movie. I had not read the original short story by Philip K. Dick, so I don't know the original plot. In this case, a man is not given a choice between a career in politics or stay with the love of his life. He wants to stay with his soul mate, but the powers that be try to steer him toward becoming President. It reminded me of another romance with a little science fiction thrown in, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". ""Eternal"" had a similar premise where a device is used to keep apart two people who seemed destined for each other. ""Adjustment"" could have worked as an intriguing thriller, with the ""plan makers"" having a more darker influence on the main character's life. The only element of danger is a threat to our protagonist that his memory will be wiped if he doesn't accept the career path chosen for him. For the most part, however, it seems the filmmakers needed to keep the tone much lighter, with virtually no violence and mostly non-threatening action sequences. This tone is reflected in the music by Thomas Newman, which contains the familiar feel-good light arrangements, queuing the audience that everything will be just fine and our main character is not in any dire predicament. I kind of wish more jeopardy was prevalent in this story, than just be about the power of love. This lack of jeopardy made the third act much less compelling, and resolution all but certain.<br/><br/>The adjustment bureau's premise is still interesting, and it is engaging to learn the ""rules"", of how the ""agents"" operate. There are some smart moments where the agents discuss among themselves the meaning of it all. The screenplay also does a good job of keeping just enough of the greater plan a mystery so we the audience aren't being dumbed down with a lot of textbook exposition. Indeed, a lot of exposition is still necessary in order to connect the dots, but the story rolls along with a decent pace. What keeps this film from being mechanical is the good chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, with sparkling dialogue that almost seems improvised. The filmmakers knew that this chemistry was critical in order for the audience to invest their time and emotion into film's plot. Our desire as the audience to see these two people together made us willing to invest our own emotions into the story. So the screenplay, acting, and editing are to be acknowledged in what makes this film succeed. It is only the intended lightness of the story that keeps the third act from having any real gravitas. The potential to have more thrilling elements could have improved the story without losing the romantic core of the plot."

","I love Philip Dick and his Sci Fi novels and short stories, but this movie doesn't do him justice. There's a lot of Matrix and Men In Black action going on, and it's simply not believable.

When we're children, our parents probably are trying to arrange or manage our lives, so this film becomes a metaphor of (misguided)parental control. In any case, I feel compelled to point out that the ending of The Adjustment is virtually the same ending as Defending Your Life, the amazing and wonderful movie w/Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. OK guys- your love of each other exceeds your fears, so the ""master plan"" will be altered to allow you to be together.
