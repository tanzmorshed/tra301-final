"Tom Murray","9","164","181","16 June 2009"," Thoughts To Prepare You for Watching the Film.
","Since Ingmar Bergman's 1962 film, ""Through a Glass, Darkly"", the 2009 film ""The Soloist"" is one of the two most accurate portrayals of schizophrenia, from the point of view of the mentally ill person and of people who want to interact with the ill person. I speak from experience. David Cronenberg's film, ""Spider"", is the other. <br/><br/>I was disappointed in my two favourite critics, James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert, each of who gave ""The Soloist"" only 62½%. <br/><br/>Berardinelli says, ""The Soloist is afflicted with a lack of passion. The story lacks a strong trajectory; it meanders, seemingly unsure of precisely what it wants to do and say and where it wants to go."" Actually, that is the reality of schizophrenia. One never knows what is going to happen next. There are many setbacks. He also says, ""The soundtrack supplies multiple, overlapping voices. The objective is to invite the viewer to participate in the unhinging of Nathaniel's mind, a first-person perspective of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, it feels artificial and contrived."" I have taught seven NAMI* courses on mental illness. One episode in one of the classes involves requiring class members to perform certain simple tasks while being bombarded by random voices from behind. Many class members find that to be the most unnerving, and illuminating, of all the activities in the course.<br/><br/>Ebert misses the point when he says, ""Yes, mental illness can be like that, but can successful drama? There comes a point when Lopez has had enough, and so, in sympathy, have we."" Dealing with a mentally ill person can be devastatingly frustrating. Must we always be entertained? There is a place for grim reality in drama. Otherwise, how can we learn?<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" is as accurate a representation of schizophrenia as you could experience without becoming mentally ill yourself. If you keep that in mind then the film will be rewarding; if, however, you are looking for a film that makes sense easily and progresses from point to point in a logical manner, then look for a different film.<br/><br/>If you choose to watch the film and absorb the reality of mental illness, then you will learn much. You never know when that knowledge will be of great value to you. Then again, you may be spared, and never need it.<br/><br/>The film introduces a very important idea: mentally ill people do better if there is someone, whom they trust, who takes an abiding interest in them.<br/><br/>It also poses one very important question: should mentally ill persons be forced to take medication to stabilize themselves? Different states, provinces and countries have different laws concerning this. Some feel that mentally ill persons should be forced to take medication if and only if they are likely to harm themselves or others. Mentally ill persons are often unaware that they are mentally ill, and cannot be convinced otherwise. Would they have more freedom to decide correctly for themselves if they were first medicated until they become sane? The film addresses this question but does not attempt to give a definitive answer. You will have to think out that question yourself, keeping in mind that different people have different reactions to the same medication. There is no universal answer, but for each individual, there is probably a best answer but not necessarily a good one.<br/><br/>The film captivated me from the beginning to the end. I did not miss the common devices that some movies use to make them exciting. There was excitement enough for me in the growth of the principal characters and in the learning that I did, and in the thinking that I was forced to do.<br/><br/>*NAMI is The National Alliance on Mental Illness.<br/><br/>P.S. Schizophrenia has absolutely nothing to do with having multiple personalities, or of dichotomies (apparent contradictions). The split in the expression ""split personality"" is the split between the personality and reality. Unfortunately, the word is misused far more often that it is used correctly."
"MalcolmJTaylor","8","85","99","28 April 2009"," A solid drama on a human scale
","After catching snippets of the lackluster reviews (two-stars in the Globe and Mail) I was dis-heartened. It's been a few months since I'd been moved by the trailer. However, the film never came out. I thought it might have been shelved.<br/><br/>I was glad to see it was indeed playing. In spite of the reviews, I persevered on the strength of the trailer. It seemed to me there was too much talent and pedigree involved for it to actually suck. And you know what? it's a terrific film with a poignant story. Perhaps lower expectations propped up my perceptions of it, however, it still stands as time well spent.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story involving a top columnist at the LA Times, Steve Lopez, played with grace by Robert Downey Jr., who becomes invested in one of his more colourful subjects, Nathaniel Ayers, an accomplished musician overcome by mental illness, now living on the streets of LA portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who rambles his way to a convincing performance.<br/><br/>The film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn't lose it's direction. It doesn't pander to it's audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It's a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.<br/><br/>It resonates and strikes a chord."
"LAKERS34","10","141","176","23 April 2009"," Uplifting: Finding a Golden Needle in the Haystack of Urban Blight
","First off, I should say that I am personally familiar with this story, having worked in downtown L.A. for the last 19 years and seeing Mr Ayers and his cello many a time around 3rd and Hill Sts. I've also read Lopez's columns in the Times for years and followed this one with interest and satisfaction. Making a film about a tale like this restores my belief in Hollywood beyond the mindless bunk it churns out year after year.<br/><br/>Downey Jr and Foxx play a newspaper columnist and homeless man who come together in a most unusual way. Downey is a newspaper columnist looking for something original and interesting to write about. He finds it when he sees Foxx beautifully playing battered stringed instruments along 3rd street in downtown L.A. Foxx has been there for years but on this day grabs the eye of the columnist because the columnist himself is experiencing hardship and doubt related to his own position. He begins to write about this talented but troubled man who fills the stinky air around him with harmony. They become friends but keep in mind this is not fiction. The friendship hits many bumps that continue to this day. Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx's character) may be a brilliant, educated musician, but he suffers from bouts of schizophrenia that manifest at any time. Downey's character accepts this as it adds more intrigue to his columns. Then he accepts it on a personal level. Their friendship ultimately becomes real and meaningful. You sense that Downey's character needs the friendship even more than Foxx's homeless man does. In the end, Downey's Lopez can see the positive effect his work has brought to the plight of the homeless, yet he wonders personally how much better he has made Nathaniel...? His reflections make us think also.<br/><br/>Downey Jr and Foxx play their characters to near perfection and the film masterfully takes its time in developing the relationship between the two. Great to see director Joe Wright telling a contemporary tale just as effectively as he has in previous works. The film makes us wonder how many other Nathaniel Ayers are lurking out there on the streets? Life being what it is, of course we will never know. The beauty of the film is that is shows what can happen when just one Nathaniel Ayers is found after being lost for so many years. There's no sugarcoating; Ayers doesn't magically get better and rejoin mainstream society. Instead, the mainstream accepts him for what he is and what he offers and begins integrating him as best it can. This film will certainly pop up at award time next year."
"Lechuguilla","7","91","115","24 April 2009"," A True Story About Urban Homelessness
","What makes this film watchable is that it is based on a true story. A caring Los Angeles reporter named Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) tries to help a homeless man named Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx).<br/><br/>Ayers suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. But he once attended Julliard, and he still lives and breathes the music of Beethoven. Ayers, with his shopping cart of possessions, walks the streets, playing his violin amid the noise of the freeway. He's content, in his own world.<br/><br/>That unusual behavior grabs the attention of Lopez, no doubt as a human interest story for his own column. But as Lopez gradually becomes more genuinely concerned about Ayers, their relationship encounters frustration, anger, and emotional pain.<br/><br/>It's a poignant, gritty story, full of realism. The film manages to be compassionate without being patronizing. The film does a terrific job in portraying the harsh, depressing reality of the boarders who live at a large shelter where Ayers goes, at the insistence of Lopez. <br/><br/>Technical elements of the film are good. The visuals are thematically impressive. Production design and costumes are detailed and realistic. Acting is credible. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a fine performance.<br/><br/>The main problem is the plot. Too much time is spent on Lopez and his trivialities. Somehow, the compelling Ayers story morphs into a weighty examination of Lopez and his distress in dealing with Ayers. The script is to blame here. I think if the main character had been Ayers, instead of Lopez, the film could have been quite inspiring.<br/><br/>Even so, the film clearly calls attention to the plight of the urban homeless. As such, the film deserves viewer support."
"KissEnglishPasto","9","7","7","2 August 2016"," Anything but Typical: Tells an Extremely Interesting and Unusual Story Which Refuses to Conform to Formulaic Conventions!
",".......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL<br/><br/>True Stories are my favorite genre. The SOLOIST was a real eye-opener and gave me a real ""Ah-Ha"" moment! Typically, despite being true stories, (or a good facsimile) the genre is rather formulaic, when you come right down to it. Person A has problem X, (Some seemingly insurmountable disease or injury or condition or adversity or a confluence of 2 or more of the above!) and through inspirational effort and persistence, defying all odds, Person A manages to overcome problem X and we ALL feel uplifted in the end! <br/><br/>The SOLOIST is anything but typical. It tells an extremely interesting and unusual story which refuses to conform to the formulaic conventions to which we have, unfortunately, become so complacently accustomed. There are three factors which contribute to creating false expectations for SOLOIST.<br/><br/>First, the title itself is somewhat misleading. Watch the movie, and you'll see for yourself! <br/><br/>Second, the trailer is edited so as to create expectations geared to coincide more with the genre's formulaic audience comfort zone. The very thing the movie so painstakingly avoids! <br/><br/>And third, the very same set of entrenched genre clichés we have already mentioned, in other words, the baggage viewers bring with them into the theater! <br/><br/>****Possible Very MINOR SPOILER Ahead!****<br/><br/>Putting all of this aside, SOLOIST derives its tremendous energy and appeal from the undeniable on-screen chemistry of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jamie Foxx. Their interaction is a joy to watch. The story does provide the standard genre buzz-wordsUplifting, Inspirational and Motivationalbut for reasons that would be virtually impossible to predict before experiencing the film itself! <br/><br/>Oh, and the music is sublime! Classical music Lovers are in for a veritable treat! There are elements of SOLOIST that will make some viewers squirm. Third world neighborhoods, right here, in downtown Los Angeles, for example. Scenes from SOLOIST have been ricocheting around my brain since yesterday!<br/><br/>9.5*STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! <br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
"claygoul-1","10","51","68","3 May 2009"," Music Menanced By Madness
","Within a one-week period, I saw my second screening of this powerful movie today. I am mystified by some of the ""bilious-type"" reviews found here, seemingly driven by an anti-Joe Wright campaign. I found no cheap sentiments in the story line and I was awed by the high-octane performances of Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey, Jr. Nothing being perfect in an imperfect world, as ""adult"" entertainment, ""The Soloist"" did not once insult my intelligence. I marveled at the complexity of the screenplay and the realization of it by its gifted director and the camera-work of Seamus McGarvey. The gifted Dario Marianelli is credited as the film's composer, anecdotally, in the gigantic shadow of Ludwig van Beethoven. Mental illness, genius, homelessness, journalism and music has rarely been so well presented as an ""entertainment."" Yes, Mr. Ayers is depicted as experiencing a ""light show"" when attending a rehearsal of the L. A. Philharmonic. At least we didn't see pink hippopotamus in tutus or dinosaurs on a rampage in a prehistoric setting. Being so accustomed to televised concerts, I expected the camera to focus on the instruments themselves in this sequence. And, ""clapping pigeons."" Great idea that works. A brave film directed at a ""non-art house"" audience. I also want to cite the wonderful work of Nelsan Ellis who plays David at LAMP. So much compassion comes off the screen with his presence. There is no way we can make ""light"" of the tragedy of the homeless, so many with mental illness. Thank you Mr. Steve Lopez for introducing me to Mr. Nathaniel Anthony Ayers. My life is richer for the experience. LisaGay Hamilton, as Jennifer Ayers, Nathaniel's sister, deserves recognition in a small, but pivotal role that brings dignity and catharsis to a heart-wrenching experience."
"bw11","10","57","77","12 May 2009"," The Truth about Schizophrenia
","I sometimes work clinically with schizophrenics. This film shows us the truth about working with severely mentally ill people. David, the man who runs the shelter for the homeless honestly spoke the truth with his stance that is opposite of what the Pharmaceutical Industry, most of psychiatry and the legal system try to make us believe. David was my hero in this movie.<br/><br/>All though the movie goes quickly over Jamie Fox's childhood trauma and losses -- it's still there, i.e. no father and the truck on fire represent some of the traumas that created his illness. Homeless people with mental illness did not come from healthy childhoods. Almost all came from repeated childhood trauma.(see New Zealand Psychologist John Read PhD and colleagues, the ACE Study from the CDC, and Charles Whitfield's book The Truth about Mental Illness, 2004).<br/><br/>Hollywood did not cover over the painful truths in this story. Jamie Fox's character's mother and his sister were good people and that comes through but they couldn't prevent his wounding. At the end of the film, we are told ""90,000 Homeless people in Los Angeles."" We walked out of the theater overwhelmed with that figure and uplifted by this true story.<br/><br/>If you're really interested in the truth about schizophrenia there is an excellent DVD documentary called Take These Broken Wings: Recover from Schizophrenia without Medication by Daniel Mackler"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","26","34","26 April 2009"," ""The Soloist"" Will Carry You Home
","Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in Joe Wright's ""The Soloist"". Downey is powerful, and embodies such humanity and compassion. His performance is never self-conscious, all about the character and the story. There is a quiet scene where Downey's Steve Lopez confesses to his ex-wife Mary (wonderful Catherine Keener) about Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), ""He's got a gift"" But Steve is at the breaking point in his efforts in helping the disturbed former child protégée. Keener consoles, ""You are not going to cure him All you can do is be his friend."" ""The Soloist"" is brilliant in its catharsis and simplicity. Director Joe Wright (""Atonement"") literally orchestrates powerful and touching performances from Downey and Foxx. Screenwriter Susannah Grant does a virtuoso translation of Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez's book. I loved ""The Soloist"". ""The Soloist"" is so compelling in its humanity.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, ""The Soloist"" tells the story of Steve's (Downey) friendship with Nathaniel (Foxx). By accident L.A. Times writer Steve Lopez meets Nathaniel Ayers on his lunch break in the park. The homeless Nathaniel is playing Beethoven on his two string violin. Nathaniel admits to Steve, ""I've had a few set backs."" Steve sees a potential story in this—for him. After initial research, Steve discovers that Nathaniel was a student at Julliard, who mysteriously dropped out in 1970. Through Grant's narrative we learn that the musical genius Nathaniel may have battled schizophrenia since childhood.<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" follows Steve's journey to salvage Nathaniel's life. Wright and Grant also make us aware of the plight of the homeless in Los Angeles, and the efforts of such noble causes as LAMP. They also provide insight into the pain and suffering of the mentally ill and challenged. To that end Jaime Foxx is defined authenticity. As Nathaniel, Foxx brilliantly stays the course, because his character will not change. That transformation is left to Downey's Steve, who must deliver on their partnership. Downey astounds. He is so believable and compelling as the good and decent man doing his best, and at a loss as to what to do. At one story arc, Nathaniel tells Steve, ""I love you."" That is not what Steve wanted to hear, because now he is responsible for another. He confesses to the LAMP director, ""I don't want to be his only thing!"" <br/><br/>The most astounding thing about Downey's compassionate performance is displayed when he is listening and in his silence. There is a breathtaking scene where Steve gives Nathaniel a cello, and eyes widen as he listens to Nathaniel play. He and Foxx have a touching screen partnership. I was in awe in a scene where Downey and Foxx sit together and listen to a Los Angeles Symphony rehearsal at the Disney Concert Hall.<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" at times is off paced and is distracted by some narrative turns. However, it has great heart. Jaime Foxx is compelling and true. Robert Downey Jr. is electrifying. This is truly his movie—he is awesome. In the words of Downey's Steve, ""Being his friend will carry you home."" See ""The Soloist"", and allow yourself to be moved."
"zetes","8","53","76","26 April 2009"," Wright, Downey and Foxx are good enough artists to lift this above its Oscar bait plot
","This film was supposed to be a major competitor for the Oscars last year, but Paramount bumped it to a few months later. Despite the mixed reviews the film has received, I believe it would have been a major contender. I honestly think Paramount's decision not only ruined its chances for Oscars, it gave the impression that there was something wrong with the picture. There isn't, really. The subject matter does scream ""Oscar Bait"", with Robert Downey Jr. playing a newspaper columnist who writes about a schizophrenic genius musician (Jamie Foxx) who is homeless on the streets of L.A. We all remember Shine. Shine was pretty good (if entirely made up, as we later discovered). The Soloist is probably a little better. I think it's stronger because of its exploration of the relationship between the two central characters. Both Downey and Foxx are extremely good; both are award-worthy. This material could easily have been cheesy Oscar bait, but director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice and Atonement) is a virtuoso himself. The way he uses image and sound move the story along beautifully, not allowing the clichés to clog up the film."
"Ramascreen","10","43","61","19 April 2009"," Nathaniel only has one thing going for him,.. a friend
","THE SOLOIST is a powerful, heartfelt, emotionally moving, human drama with two incredibly talented actors who give their all. It is every bit as wonderful as what it promises. Definitely one of the best films of the year. If you're looking for... an inspiring story, well then look no further. This is another accomplishment by Director Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement) I've always known Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. are two great actors respectively but the mix of two is like combining two different formulas that compliment each other and create an atomic chemistry only described as something that no one else will ever manage to replicate. They can try but won't come out as good as these two.<br/><br/>This is Jamie Foxx's best performance since Ray, and I'd vouch for a second nomination on the horizon. Robert Downey Jr. proves that he's versatile, that he's more than just Tony Stark and he still got pieces of greatness from when he played Chaplin years ago.<br/><br/>We can't really compare the two characters with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man because unlike that movie, in this one, Downey's character, Lopez, doesn't try to take advantage of Jamie's character's, Nathaniel's musical talent. In fact, Lopez thinks that by fixing Nathaniel then maybe he could fix his broken marriage, he thinks that by fixing Nathaniel, he could fix L.A., he thinks that by fixing Nathaniel, all his writing and columns and accomplishment could mean something. But the problem is Nathaniel doesn't want to be fixed.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the only way to heal somebody is just be a good friend in need. Sometimes we gotta accept the fact that some things can't be fixed and that being there for someone speaks louder than our aimless effort to turn them into something they're not.<br/><br/>Nathaniel's love of music is his only connection to what's left that's good in his life, in the midst of chaos and confusion. A friend makes that connection even stronger.<br/><br/>That's what I love about this movie, the story.<br/><br/>Joe Wright's directing is superb, he understands the plot and how the actors should respond to whatever conflict that may surface. The locations chosen or how a scene would play out, his vision of it all is borderline perfect. The portrayal of the skid row and how the camera moves from one homeless guy to another and take us on this view of the forgotten little kingdom is quite humbling. Those of us who've seen the real LA would not find this to be an exaggeration. Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey should definitely be nominated again for the Cinematography, which is absolutely brilliant --Rama's SCREEN--"
"MovieCriticMarvelfan","10","21","29","23 April 2009"," The Soloist a great movie not to be missed!!!
","Saw this movie at a screening last year, yet this movie stuck with me back then as it still does now (Many spoilers follow below): <br/><br/>Based on a true story and a book The Soloist is a special movie that might end up getting serious Academy Award attention (don't know why it got delayed last year when it easily could have been nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Supporting actor at this year's Oscars). This story takes place in Los Angeles and has a lot to say about LA (Namely dirty politics, the homeless problem specifically in Skid Row but can be attributed to the whole state, and mental illness) it was a must see. The fact that there were two great actors in the lead Jamie Foxx (Ray)and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) was enough for me to see it. The movie is about a homeless musician with schizophrenia. At least that's part of the story, this a movie that has a story within a story. We learn about the brilliance of Nathaniel Ayers Jr. played with stunning excellence by Foxx.<br/><br/>Ayers for whatever reason developed schizophrenia but was a brilliant cello and violin player with a love for Beethoven. LA Times journalist, Steve Lopez (Downey) does something that not many journalists do when he reaches to Ayers for help seeing his brilliant playing (not too mention the circumstances which he lives in which are to say the least inhumane but no one gives a damn about except the homeless shelter Ayers visits.) and hoping that he can fulfill his dreams of sharing his brilliant gift of playing music. <br/><br/>Lopez really doesn't know what he is getting himself into as Ayers schizophrenia often poses numerous problems not just for Ayers health but any potential rewarding job opportunities. Both Foxx and Downey play these parts great. They really are some of the best actors in the business today. Like I said a story within a story, we see the homeless problem in Skid Row (although really all of California like other states has a big homeless problem). We see REALLY NO ASSISTANCE for the homeless. Then the Mayor makes some speech promising to help the homeless but as with most politicians most of their promises are crap as we see a sweep (really a beat down of the homeless by the pigs, I mean cops of LA). This is something that is done in other cities for whatever reason (I guess maybe the mentality is if they get rid of the homeless and move them out of the area no one will realize there is a problem).<br/><br/>Anyhow, I really liked the director's guts (Joe Wright) to show not just Nathaniel's story but the story of other homeless people and poor people of the area. This could have been one of those garbage ""Hollywood ending"" movies where everybody gets saved but Joe Wright presents the real consequences and results of situations. Anyways, this is a great, great movie that is not to be missed. It's not a Shine ripoff!!! You know they throw around a lot of exaggerated phrases like ""this is the Best movie I've seen in years"", ""This movie is mesmerizing"",. "" It will tug away at your heart"", but really this is a movie that lives up to all that and more. <br/><br/>I've also started reading the real book ""The Soloist"" by Steve Lopez. I would also highly recommend reading the book as it will give your more details about Ayers and more insight from Lopez himself in learning about his new friend and what others with schizophrenia go through. It's a great book. This movie really is one of the best movies I've seen in a while by two great actors."
"doctorsmoothlove","4","14","21","16 June 2009"," The plot thinnens
","The Soloist has all ingredients to impress the Academy. Its director, Joe Wright, has already authored a best picture candidate. The leading actor, Robert Downey Jr., starred in a widely praised superhero film. Finally, the movie itself is a drama. When it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008, filmgoers and critics were baffled. Now that I've seen it, I assure you Universal didn't just delay this film to promote Iron Man-Oscar buzz. The Soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.<br/><br/>Downey and co-star Jamie Fox aren't to be blamed for this mishap. Joe Wright is largely at fault but even he can't save a Lifetime story. Many movies are too complex and alienate viewers. This one is unusually simple. It's a movie about a newspaper reporter, Steve Lopez (Downey), who befriends a homeless musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Fox). That's it. Ayers is schizophrenic and doesn't resonate with Lopez's traditional approach to friendship. The two become friends. They begin this movie as acquaintances and are BFFs by its end. Tension consists of moments like this: will Ayers let Lopez take him to the homeless shelter? This material would have been better suited as a made-for-TV production rather than a feature film.<br/><br/>Wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content. Lopez battles yard-defiling raccoons in what I consider a sub-plot. Do you remember when this happened in Atonement or Pride and Prejudice? Those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged. Ayers' back story is fleshed out when it doesn't need to be. Worst of all, these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals. It's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal. Nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing (I was too). This is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with Ayers when most of us already have it. He's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud! The movie somewhat conveys humanity's love for music, like Amadeus and Beethoven Lives Upstairs. It isn't as effective as either of those pictures, however. The entire film is hinged on Ayers' schizophrenia. It ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else. His being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including. The film doesn't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona. Take music out of Amadeus or Beethoven Lives Upstairs, and no film remains. The Soloist is more about friendship in general than music. Nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered.<br/><br/>This is only Joe Wright's third film, and his first that isn't a romance staring Keira Knightley. Let's hope this film isn't an indication of how limited his abilities are. There are stylistic nods to his earlier works but The Soloist is much weaker than either of them. In his defense, Universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture. This film seems tailored for Imagine Entertainment (distributors of Changeling). I wouldn't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release. Its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally."
"benjybass","Null","45","80","26 April 2009"," Interesting to know
","I am a musician and live in France, where the release date of this movie is scheduled for Sept. 2 2009. I obviously cannot write a review at the present time but have nevertheless read the book.<br/><br/>What no one mentions in all of the above comments is that Nathaniel Ayers was originally a Double Bass student at Julliard and NOT a cellist. That instrument-- along with the violin, trumpet, and piano, all came about later on. Put any instrument into his hands and he'll do his best to master it. <br/><br/>Having attended Yale university, I did not know him personally, even though we studied with one of the greatest bass teachers in the New York area at that time: Homer Mensch. Recently our paths did finally cross thanks to one of our mutual acquaintances, bassist and composer Joe Russo. Nathan likes to write down the names of his long lost good friends on walls, or any writing surface, and Joe's name is always there, scribbled amongst his favorites. This was where Steve noticed Joe's name and Googled him to look up his website. A new and close friendship resulted between them, and the many anecdotes that Joe pulled out of Nathan's past were worth their weight in gold to Steve, enough to devote the entire chapter 8 of the book to Joe!<br/><br/>To me, reading this book made me come to the conclusion that every man has his hour in life, and Nathan's time had come now. The chances of 2 men, one homeless and one not, being pulled together through the sound of a violin in a rush hour tunnel, were undoubtedly written in the stars. Through articles, a book and now a film on Nathan, Steve helped uplift a poor and abandoned part of society to a rank that it never imagined nor asked for, but morally deserved. We all know that the Internet is indeed capable of connecting and reconnecting people in the present, but only music can magically, throughout time, open the doors that connect all of us to one another."

Maybe this story(based on real events) just doesn't translate very well to the big screen.I think the film aspired to be great but felt short.On a more positive note, Jamie Foxx's performance was great and felt very authentic.<br/><br/>6/10"
"JungleBunnyBastard","3","26","50","26 April 2009"," Such high hopes have diminished into sheer disappointment.
","Made watchable through it's rich performances (especially Robert Downey Jr.) and it's beautiful music, but the film feels like it's trying to hard to cover too much ground while at the same time beating you over the head with humanitarian elements that really have no place or room.<br/><br/>A friendship is formed between a divorced writer and a homeless, schizophrenic musician when they have a chance meeting. What could have been a great story about friendship went heavy handed and up it's own ass in little messages that by the end of the film I, in a way, felt cheated. I felt like they were teasing me with a good story and actors but instead decided to give me pointless intersections throughout (don't even get me started on Nathaniel Ayers' ""flashbacks"" and ""thoughts"").<br/><br/>The film would have been better if they had concentrated on the point of view of Robert Downey, Jr.'s character and not try to dive into Ayers' psyche. That made it seem hokey and with the addition of what Downey's character said near the end made it that much more insulting. There was just so much stuff the filmmakers tried to cover and didn't elaborate very much on.<br/><br/>The performances, though, were brilliant. Foxx gets a little over-the-top with his ability to scene-chew, but Downey gives a down to earth, realistic performance. Even though they were all really good, I just kept feeling like Foxx was just trying to out-act Downey. With that said, he was still wonderful.<br/><br/>I don't know. Maybe I'm reading too much into it and maybe I'm just ragging on it because I didn't like it, but, oh well. I am a critic, right?"
"Anonymous_Maxine","5","16","30","29 April 2009"," Uninspired retread of well-known morals
","I'm hoping that The Soloist will come across as one of the most disappointing movies of 2009, because if we get anything more of a letdown than this it's gonna be pretty bad. I awaited the movie with enormous anticipation. Jamie Foxx has proved himself as a tremendously talented actor many times over, and Robert Downey Jr., long since one of my favorite actors, is at the height of his career with his work in movies like Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, as well as the upcoming Sherlock Holmes, Master Mind, The Avengers, and Iron Man 2. <br/><br/>Now, I hope I can say this without sounding like I'm really bashing the movie, because it is competently made and competently acted, but there were points in the movie where the pure badness almost approached camp. There is no doubt that the movie was green-lighted and cast with visions of Oscars dancing in the heads of Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr. and the movie's producers, but somewhere along the way there was a necessary element that just never made it into the final cut. The movie definitely has it's fans and it certainly is a moving story, but I can tell you with pretty strong certainty that there are no Oscars in The Soloist's future. <br/><br/>That being said, I should probably also admit that I had the hardest time putting my finger on exactly what went wrong. Maybe it is something as simple as a permeating lack of originality. Maybe the presentation of a mentally ill main character was handled without the necessary subtlety or authenticity. In Tropic Thunder, Robert Downey Jr. himself expounded on the dangers of an actor going full retard, maybe this is a case of what happens when you go 'full crazy?' Whatever the case, I am truly sorry to say that both stars have scenes where their performances come across as almost bizarrely cheesy. <br/><br/>Of course it might be just me, but I doubt it. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a Los Angeles Times columnist desperate for a good story, when he one day runs into Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a homeless man with obviously tremendous musical talent. There goes cliché number one. Through a muddled combination of personal interest and hope for the betterment of Ayers' life, Lopez makes it his life's to get Ayers off the streets, on medication, and into a successful musical career where he belongs.<br/><br/>It's hard not to be moved by such a story, but it's also hard to find anything original in it. It's based on a true story, even to the point of showing an incident where an elderly LA Times reader sent in her own cello, one she had been playing herself for decades, because she was so moved by Lopez's story about Ayers. The movie's presentation of this event is one of its simplest but best scenes. <br/><br/>But after thatwhat? I won't ruin the story for you, because while I found the movie disappointing, I would also say that it's not disappointing to the point that people shouldn't watch it. But it leaves you with a definite feeling that it should have been something more, or that the true story on which it's based simply doesn't have the ingredients for a successful drama. There is a point in the movie, for example, where Ayers utters the line, ""If I ever see you again I'll cut you open and gut you like a fish."" I appreciate the portrayal of paralyzing mental confusion, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest the majority of the audience is going to see that as a good time to turn your life- saving mission over to professionals who have some idea of what they're dealing with. <br/><br/>Then again, it's also exactly this kind of difficulty that has led to the most satisfying struggles against the odds in similarly uplifting movies, but The Soloist argues that friendship should be enough to overcome even the most insurmountable barriers, it takes us on this painful struggle with a damaged mind, and then, worst of all, it all leads up to one of those stupid, stupid voice-over speeches at the end that's supposed to tie everything up with a cute little bow. God I can't stand that. <br/><br/>Watch the movie when it comes out on DVD. It's not a complete failure, but it is much less than the sum of its parts and it gives that feeling that it is always just about to develop into something really great but it just never happens. It does a good job of approaching the difficult paradox of how far people should be able to go in efforts to force a better life on someone, but for all of the ambition clearly involved in its production, it should easily have forced out a much better movie."

","In Los Angeles, the reporter of the LA Times Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) writes the successful column Points West. After an accident with his bicycle, Steve wanders on the streets and hears a classic music being played by a homeless violinist with an out of commission violin. Steve starts a conversation with the musician fan of Beethoven Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr. (Jamie Foxx) and when the man tells him that he had studied cello in Juilliard, Steve researches his life and writes a series of articles in his column about the talented but mentally ill musician. He befriends the schizophrenic Nathaniel and brings him to the Lamp Community in Los Angeles. The work of Steve Lopez is awarded and he attempts to help the musician, but in his insanity, Nathaniel does not want to change his lifestyle. <br/><br/>""The Soloist"" is apparently based on a true story of a relationship of a journalist and a schizophrenic musician and discloses the other side of the American Dream in Los Angeles with 90,000 homeless people. In this regard, this film uses a different approach of Wim Wenders' ""Land of Plenty"" to slightly show the reality of homeless people in Los Angeles. The problem is that apparently the columnist wrote articles and was awarded, and wrote a book that became a movie, probably making lots of money, while Nathaniel Ayers Jr. is still on the streets and sleeping in a shelter. Please excuse me if I am unfair, but the film does not show a great effort from Steve Lopez to hire a psychologist to help Nathaniel to improve his life. Further, the screenplay is cold despite the choice of two excellent actors in the lead roles. The music score with Beethoven and Bach is a plus in this deceptive film. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Solista"" (""The Soloist"")"

","Yes, you can trust Joe Wright with your life, without bound for two hours.<br/><br/>Some parts of this are simply ordinary. There's the original sequence of stories which exploited the simple tension of discarded talent in a city that both worships talent and discards people wholesale. These were simple structures, headlines and patronizing prose. <br/><br/>There's the screenplay by a hack, with simple shape and essentially no movement. In other words, forget what people usually think a movie is about: the people and the story. Those parts are missing. There is no happy ending. There is no redemption.<br/><br/>But this has three things: madness, music and the marriage of madness and music.<br/><br/>I saw this right after ""State of Play,"" a traditional newspaper movie, with archetypal writer and editor. This is a modern version with two of our most folded actors: Downey and Keener. Their job is simple: define an edge between internal and external. The coupled acting here is not between Downey and Foxx, but between Downey and Keener playing a recently divorced couple. There's a quiet tension these two build around the absent son, whose place Foxx's character fills.<br/><br/>Foxx makes not a character but an phenomenon, an experience, this experience of madness in music. He is helped by being placed amid folks who we are told are ""real disturbed people."" What Wright has is a fairly vacuous notion of madness, but a sublime talent in expressing it cinematically. Some of his tricks are trivial when considered independently: a cutout of Ayers getting smaller and ""disappearing into"" the music; a cheesy light show to Beethoven; an attempt to conflate voices in the head to music in the head. This latter is very real but the expression is cheap.<br/><br/>While they seem trite individually, none are used heavily or relied on. And the effect when combined with more masterly things produces a symphony of excess. Downey's character remarks on the sheer depth, the love the penetration in describing just this very thing we see. It works. Music, indeed all real paths through passion are madness. Every adventure into commitment is a step outside safety of self.<br/><br/>Wright knows this. He feels it. He can show it. I can trust him with my life. Its madness to do so, but I recommend it to you.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"rupie","1","7","12","26 December 2016"," a poisonous message
","I really wondered what the point of this movie was, and about two-thirds of the way through the light dawned. This is a ""message"" movie, and the message is a poisonous one.<br/><br/>Sometime in the 60's we as a nation became revolted at conditions in our mental institutions, which were indeed horrific and grotesque. This is where society had warehoused everyone whose mental conditions were so extreme that even their own families could not cope with them. Government being what it is, it was never to be expected that these poor souls would get compassionate treatment.<br/><br/>So it was decided to grant these individuals their ""rights"" and release them all to the street. There was supposed to be a wave of neighborhood mental health clinics to look after them; that never transpired. As a result these poor souls now live in the street and often pose a safety risk to others. Jails and prisons are now the front line in dealing with the mentally ill.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a whole movement has arisen advocating for the ""rights"" of these people to live as they are, i.e. as mentally unbalanced people. The sad thing is that, with proper medication, many of these folks could be restored to some semblance of normality.<br/><br/>In clearly siding with the ""right"" of Nathaniel not to be medicated, this movie, in my view, sends a very toxic message whose upshot is that these people should be allowed to live their lives of misery and to continue to pose a threat to - dare I utter the word? - ""normal"" people. The issue of how we deal with our mentally ill is a complex and thorny one, but I don't think it's useful to maintain that it's just dandy not to treat them."

"b1lskirnir","4","14","29","24 April 2009"," Unexpectedly deep, but lacks focus
","Previews and marketing for The Soloist give a very different image of what the film actually is about. Watching the trailer, one would think, ""Oh, here's another 'feel good white-guy- meets-black-guy movie where the black guy is sincere but troubled and the white guy wants to help him but can't relate to him and has a short temper but it's okay because in the end they both learn from each others' differences' with a musical backdrop thrown in just for artistic interest- lovely! Exactly what I need to watch to feel better on a Saturday evening!""<br/><br/>The reality is in fact the opposite- the story ends on a somber note, occasionally plunging into melodrama, but the 'feel-good' market is indeed misleading. This is a movie that wants, tries desperately, to touch on some very serious issues, but unfortunately causes itself to become undone as a movie.<br/><br/>The story revolves around an LA Times columnist named Steve Lopez who stumbles across n eccentric and mentally ill homeless musician, Nathaniel, who is a musical prodigy and a Julliard dropout. At first obsessed with the story, Steve inevitably becomes involved in Nathaniel's personal life while dealing with his own issues with his ex-wife and his job.<br/><br/>That's all you really need to know, but even if I wanted to try to explain it further, that would prove rather difficult because the film itself doesn't even really know what it's about- is it about finding the kindness to be someone's friend, the homeless crisis in LA, dealing with people with schizophrenia, pursuing your dreams, coming to terms with not living your dreams, or even more basic, is it about Nathaniel or is it about Steve? The movie doesn't know as it bombards you with as much information as you could possibly need to know about any of that, whether its via flashback sequences about Nathaniel's past, moments where ""the voices"" invade Nathaniel's head and freak him out, overly dramatic scenes involving policemen arresting homeless people, an excessive amount of really irrelevant time in Steve's office and about a head injury of his, and multiple musical montage scenes to Beethoven, one involving helicopter shots and pigeons, and another involving an uninterrupted three minutes of color splashing across the screen rhythmically.<br/><br/>With that said, it's very well-acted. When director Joe Wright isn't throwing as many different things together in the editing room as he possibly can, Robert Downery Jr. and Jamie Foxx put together a fantastic on-screen duo that actually manages to defy the clichés that one might expect. Jamie Foxx especially makes the character his own to the extent that he is almost unrecognizable, both in speech, mannerism, and physical appearance from anything else he's ever done. The two of them together make the film memorable and it is their lack of ability to understand one another that essential makes the best drama of the film. Without it, everything else going on in Steve's life- the quest for the next big story and the problems with the ex-wife, falls flat of any real dramatic significance.<br/><br/>The film wants to be so much. It wants to be so much so badly it feels like it doesn't even care if it's a movie at all. It has moments of ingenuity, but it could've been so much more powerful if it were just a story about either one man's love for music or one man's choice to change someone else's life rather than trying to throw as many different punches as possible."

Taking every element of the classic ""how we hit the skids"" movies, borrowing very liberally from ""A Beautiful Mind"", taking the bogus ""feel good"" attitude of films like ""Rocky""-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie.

I am amazed anyone thought that scene would be visually entertaining or that it would 'add' something to the film.

","I went into the Soloist not won over by the trailer. Indeed I thought it looked like something that we see in Hollywood from time to time, which is a hyped-up story of an underdog with not all his screws tied up being inspirational to those who are down on their luck. It looked like, frankly, pablum. But I also thought that an actor such as Robert Downey Jr being in the film might mean some promise, something stimulating about the project that would attract someone like him, one of the best American actors working today. Turns out, this is not the case. <br/><br/>What attracted Downey Jr I can't say; was it the material, the true life story of Steve Lopez's chronicling of Nathanial Ayers Jr, or was it Joe Wright, the director of Atonement at the helm? All of these questions can be asked, but what we're left with is the film itself, and left to judge it on what is here. What the Soloist is is an overwrought, crammed-up and morally questionable presentation of a story that, frankly, doesn't give much uplift when the lights come up. The story of Ayers, a schizophrenic who happens to be a virtuoso musician living on the streets of LA and connecting somehow with a sympathetic columnist, is one where there really isn't hope, despite what the trailers and ads might say. <br/><br/>In fact, I believe, a moral of the story would be: ""yeah, try as you might to be a 'friend', whatever that means in this context, but these 'people' on the streets, whatever they're qualities and talents that are apparent, should be left alone and without much medication to get them in a better frame of mind if at all possible."" At the end we're given a tacked-on catharsis statement from Lopez on how Ayers affected him, but it's not very inspirational. It's just sad, and not in that fulfilling kind of way.<br/><br/>The makers of the Soloist probably thought they were making a grand statement on the power of friendship and connecting with the mentally ill. But there are so many other films that one could spend there time with, given all of the promising ingredients here. If you want to see a movie about a relatively normal guy and a mentally warped guy watch Rainman; if you want to watch good Downey Jr movies watch his output last year; for Foxx, 2004's output (especially Collateral); for classical music put to dizzying visual heights, Fantasia (which, I should add, Wright desperately tries to emulate in the scene where Lopez and Ayers see the recital and all of those colors flash through his mind ending with the pretentious line: ""Beethoven is in the room"").<br/><br/>On top of Wright crowding in FAR too much into making it a feat of the visual, even when it's not needed to express something about the story or the characters or mood (and an inconsistent one at that as it moves jarringly between flights of fancy like the shot careening across the sky with birds flying around to, yes, a documentary interlude on the homeless), Foxx goes way too over-the-top in his performance. There is nigh a shred of subtlety, and even if this is the point which it well may be I was never really convinced or drawn in to this real person, Nathanial Ayers, who apparently still is on the streets of LA mumbling and playing wonderful music. Downey Jr still does what he can with his character, and actually does pull us in with his conflict of his profession and his feelings for this man he looks after. <br/><br/>But one actor can't really save what is ultimately a heavy-handed story of inspiration that lacks inspiration or triumph-of-the-human-spirit element to make it worthwhile. It's simply another Hollywood vehicle for hope that tries too hard and not hard enough. Wright may be a talent to watch, and Atonement showed those sparks, but it's not here."

The film featured fantastic acting performances , but the lackluster gaps in this film, through no fault of the actors , I might add, kept this film from being spectacular. Nathaniel Ayers a musician, a brilliant one at that, never realized his dream due to mental illness. Being a homeless person, Steve Lopez, journalist from the L.A. Times smelled a story. Rather than being just another cold story to fill a column quota, Mr. Lopez, gradually became attached to Ayers, thus a human bond developed with true, friendship bonds and no ulterior motives for Lopez. Do not get me wrong this was a nice story and particularly the later part of the movie brought this film from being just an average film to a pretty good film. There were some heartwarming moments and tears but I never really felt a kinship toward the characters, as I usually do in some 'select' moving films.

","Both Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. have done nothing but star in big budget box office blockbusters lately. Obviously, the both of them felt that it was time for for something smaller, so that everyone could really see their acting talents, rather than the special effects or comedy that normally swirl around them. Hopefully with this true tale of a homeless man with a gifted talent could bring that about for both of them. The first thing that i must talk about is the acting.......because both Robert Downey and Jamie Foxx brought their ""A"" game to the table. Especially Jamie Foxx, because since his Oscar winning performance in ""Ray"", i really haven't seen too much from him.......but this movie certainly showed that he still has it. He should easily be nominated for best supporting actor. Now onto the rest of the film. Well.....it was a really good story, and in a way it was just as well........however, there were sequences that just dragged on, and scenes that were just plain boring. I think the reason was that they didn't really delve into the character development of Robert Downey Jr's role. I didn't really feel why he wanted to help this man so much, and they didn't fully explain the struggles that he himself was going through. To best sum it up, the movie is much like ""A Beautiful Mind"", but not told as passionately. I mean you could sense the struggle that Jamie Foxx's character was going through......but it just didn't ""GET"" you like you wanted it to. Bottom Line, the movie was good......but at times it just seemed to drag on waaayyyy too much.

"Hellrazr360","6","6","14","24 April 2009"," Solid Performances In a Weak Film
","As I walked in and sat in a seat at my nearby movie theater waiting to watch The Soloist, I was hoping to get what the trailers seemed promise: a strong, character-driven story led by two talented actors ultimately amounting to a solid film. What I got was half of this. The Soloist does well with some of the material it has, but there are too many missteps throughout the film (especially in the first act) to make it anything above decent.<br/><br/>The film's plot is fairly basic. Robert Downey Jr. plays a writer for the Los Angeles Times (Steve Lopez) who comes across a homeless violin/ex-cello player (Nathaniel Ayers) with Jamie Foxx filling in the character's shoes. Lopez sees potential for Ayers to make a ""comeback"" so to speak and begins writing a column for him in the newspaper. Of course not everything works out so well and several debacles take place throughout the course of the film. All of this unfolds with some fairly haphazard approaches and mixed results.<br/><br/>What really hurts the film is many of the choices made to progress the plot and emphasize the characters. The scenes which show the viewer what happened to Nathaniel before he became homeless come of as either perfectly adequate or inconsistent. Many of the film's scenes involve multiple voices saying/repeating lines/words over and over which, quite frankly, do get annoying before long. It also feels rather odd having a good few dialogue exchanges occur with both or all of the characters talking at once. Whether this was intentional or not doesn't detract from it feeling unnecessary and taking the viewer out of the unfolding plot.<br/><br/>What does work in the film is the performances by the two lead actors. Downey Jr. does a great job playing a conflicted newspaper writer and he also takes part in a couple...nasty scenes that make for good, brief comedic moments. As for Foxx, he manages to do an equally, if not superior job fitting into his role and, unlike the film itself, barely has any hiccups during his performance. While both put on great performances, don't expect them to be in the running for the Oscars since they come just a slight nudge below excellence in their screen time. Part of this (mostly in Foxx's case) can be attributed to the questionable style of development as mentioned above. For the first half of the film it's tough to really care much about what happens but the second half does help even things out with stronger scenes. In regards to the supporting cast, most of them are negligible and, other than those who have more frequently occurrences (which granted aren't that many), barely stand out.<br/><br/>The Soloist is a film that had plenty of potential to be a precursor to the film releases over the summer. Unfortunately, the film lacks a proper sense of pacing and direction to make it realize this potential. Foxx and Downey Jr. put on two great performances and during some of their key scenes, it's far easier to get immersed in the film. However, the film itself doesn't fare nearly as well and misses the mark just too much to be worthy of a full recommendation."

","""The Soloist"" proves once again that it's never a good sign when a movie suddenly gets pulled from the Oscar schedule. At the time Paramount said it had something to do with some new scheduling campaign. The truth comes out this weekend though and the final verdict is that it doesn't bode well for the Oscar chances of its two very talented leads or the movie itself this year either. The movie is based on a book by Steve Lopez about schizophrenic cellist Nathaniel Ayers Jr. I haven't read the book or watched any of the various news stories about the relationship between the two because I was hoping that the movie would capture whatever incredible true story happened here and I wanted to be surprised. Just unfortunately the screenplay by Susannah Grant (a talented dramatic writer responsible for ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""In her Shoes"") feels less like ""Shine"" and more like blah.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who while eating lunch notices a homeless man with nothing but a shopping cart full of crap and a violin with only two strings. He's playing it right in front of a statue of his hero, Beethoven. The man is Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who began as a young cello player. As a young boy his life became all about music, shutting out the world around him for the sweet sounds of Beethoven and his own dreams of becoming his equal. He attended Julliard School with hopes of becoming the best but instead he suffered a mental breakdown that sent him falling from grace and into playing music under bridges and on street corners. Lopez finds the story fascinating and writes a human-interest piece about him and soon he's trying to help Nathaniel get back on a right track again. But does Nathaniel even want to do that? Grant's screenplay likes to pat itself on the back for showing that a friendship such as this can exist. It's all very formulaic and slightly questionable. Is Lopez staying with Nathaniel out of care or because it would make for good continuing articles if Nathaniel becomes a success? Lopez, who's developed only up to the point of being an accident-prone divorcée, managed some notoriety out of this so it does smack of exploitation but I also have to imagine that the book and various stories on this subject did have more context to it, especially when it comes to the Los Angeles homeless, mental illness, and the subject of Ayer's redemption. The movie's best scenes show the despair of the Lamp Homeless shelter, the drug use and mental illness that plague society's cast-offs. These scenes are good because the people seem real, but once it switches back to Lopez and Ayers, its all phony uplift that doesn't really say much. It's crap, but it tries to trick you with beauty. During musical interludes, director Joe Wright follows seagulls as they soar through the air with the music and in the most blinding moment of the year so far, he stages a light show that's supposed to represent how Nathaniel sees the music in his head.<br/><br/>Both actors do their best. Foxx is very good here, finding the humanity that the screenplay doesn't. He's a hurried, agitated rambler, a man with a natural love for music, and a tragic genius cut down by his own brain. He brings both a free spirit and pained sense of claustrophobic entrapment by his illness, and one thing he and Joe Wright do very well is displaying schizophrenia as a haunting illness if nothing else. Downey has less to do but he manages to be as cynical and funny as always. Catherine Keener is also in this movie, playing Lopez's ex-wife, but she's very much underused.<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" is the second movie in two weeks, after ""State of Play"", to also bring up the fact that young people don't seem to be reading newspapers anymore. Human interest stories like this one are pretty solid ways to generate interest though and I'm sure at the time the articles were being written there was way more to the story of Steve and Nathaniel than this very Hollywood-ized treatment would have you believe."
"Morganalee","5","5","11","24 April 2009"," Strong performances, unsatisfying story line
","I was expecting much from this film and was disappointed. The fault is not that of the two leads, both of whom did well; I enjoyed Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as the reporter, and as the homeless man, Foxx may have earned himself another Oscar nomination. But the plot was lacking. Yes, it's based on a true story, and a glossy traditional Hollywood ending was neither wanted nor possible. But I think the story's focus was wrong. I expected, and wanted, to see the story of a musical prodigy whose talent was lost to mental illness; but this is the reporter's story instead, of his evolution from seeing the homeless man first as a story, then as a project, then as a human being. It's a familiar plot in fiction and non-fiction, and one not particularly well done here. I didn't get enough sense of who Foxx's character was before he landed on the street, of what the decades of his illness had been like, of what he and his talent had meant to his family. And we see almost nothing of his interactions with his peers at Juilliard. Because we don't see much of what his life was like before his descent into schizophrenia, we don't have the powerful sense of loss we should have when we're brought back to the present and see the broken mumbling man guarding his cart full of trash. Instead the film gets caught up in sensationalistic (and admittedly powerful) depictions of the squalor and ruined faces of skid row. But I've seen depictions of homelessness elsewhere. I wanted to know the story of this lost prodigy, and I didn't see it. The film even wastes time on silly touches such as the Downey character's fumbles with his cellphone at the public toilet and his getting coyote urine spilled all over himself as he tries to battle raccoons. Comic relief for adolescent boys, perhaps, but I don't think many of them will be coming to see this movie."

","(Per an advance preview:) JAMIE FOXX does a fantastic job playing a homeless guy in Los Angeles who was once a gifted musician at Julliard who later developed various schizophrenic & emotional problems as he wanders the rough streets. This film tells the true story of how a local newspaper columnist (finely played by ROBERT DOWNEY JR.) chances to meet Foxx, writes about his story, and his many efforts to try to make life EASIER for him-- by encouraging him to return to playing the cello, to find a safer and better place to live and to interact with other homeless people. Because of the difficulties inherent in Foxx's psyche, his ramblings & recurrent departures from reality, Downey has a frequently tricky and demanding time in dealing with him and others in his life (including his ex-wife & co-worker CATHERINE KEENER). The film effectively portrays the young Foxx, his growth and his later descent into a life filled with problems. It's not always easy to deal with, but it's uplifting seeing the progress that the homeless and otherwise disadvantaged can make."

","A journalist searching for a story comes across a homeless schizophrenic, Nathaniel, who, as it turns out, is also a classically-trained musician. The journalist befriends him, allowing him to play his music, while writing articles about him that force a showdown of sorts in their relationship.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this film pushes most of the right emotional button, but suffers from an unavoidable comparison with Shine. Bromance versus romance aside, there is too much overlap in the stories, even if they are true, robbing The Soloist of any freshness. Foxx is excellent, albeit in that actor-after-Oscar mode that seems to draw certain performers to play mentally diminished characters. Downey is as charismatic as ever, if a little more clipped than usual. The extras are in fact real homeless people with real mental infirmities - faced with that, Downey seems to have opted to play it a little more sombre than usual. At one point, he reacts to a stream of consciousness by one of the homeless people and we glimpse the man rather than the character. It is a fascinating moment - you realise that no matter how hard films try to approach realism, the real world will always prove more surprising.<br/><br/>One small triumph for me is the moment where Nathaniel gets to hear a full orchestra for the first time. He closes his eyes, and we are treated to an abstract light show representing his emotional elation to the music. Director Wright apparently shot that sequence with a whisky glass and a household lamp. In our CGI-infested times, that is refreshing.<br/><br/>In sum, not a bad film, and possibly more if you have not seen Shine."

"pyrocitor","8","2","3","10 June 2009"," Powerful and poignant in unexpected ways; familiar while thankfully side-stepping cliché
","Sometimes Hollywood continuity can lead to enjoyment of certain films being undermined by factors external to the world of the film itself. It is in this way that Joe Wright's The Soloist, like its protagonists, experienced its fair share of ""setbacks"". First primed as a surefire Oscar nominee released during November awards season, the film was subsequently held over until the following spring, leading to dubious speculations over its quality. Similarly, the unexpected juxtaposition with a sumptuous, unintentional inside joke proved difficult to shake: Hollywood satire Tropic Thunder, released earlier in the same year, left an infamous monologue (coincidentally spoken by Soloist star Robert Downey Jr.) regarding actors selecting roles involving mental illness for the sake of awards glory fresh in the collective unconscious, making Jamie Foxx's role as a schizophrenic musician a source of ridicule for many. As such, if anything stands testament to the quality of Wright's film, it is its ability, like its protagonists, to overcome such external setbacks with its dignity intact, a powerful watch peppered with unexpected moments of humour and poignancy, making it all the more compelling an experience. <br/><br/>From its very conception, the film marked an uneasy yet somehow functional interplay between the authentic and cinematically fantastic. Despite its ""based on a true story"" tag (despite taking certain artistic liberties, such as oddly enough portraying Steve Lopez, in real life still happily married, as divorced for the sake of parallelism with Ayers), the film could hardly offer a more familiar conceptual framework. Hearkening back to many similar efforts, Rain Man being the most famous, a superficial reading of the film would suggest yet another trite, pseudo-uplifting tale of personal growth through adversity and friendship. And while The Soloist does fulfil such narrative expectations, Wright is too clever to stop there, and instead subtly bends his focus past mere conventional playing to sentiment. In numerous sequences, Wright's camera slowly extends upwards to a bird's eye view of the entire city or dwells on lengthy montages of nameless impoverished masses simply living their desolate lives, as if quietly needling the audience that the scope of the concerns depicted extends far beyond the individual case represented. This intention is made all the more clear by the fact that the final pre-closing credits title does not pertain to real life protagonists Lopez or Ayers, but rather states ""There are 90, 000 homeless people in Los Angeles alone"". Similarly, fears of an overly saccharine ending are dispelled by Wright punctuating his climax with a voice-over by Lopez ruminating on whether his actions actually did help Ayers at all. Rather than caving to easy sentiment, Wright lets the mood of the moment build, only to undercut it with bleak realism, adding most expansive degrees of gravitas and poignancy. <br/><br/>Yet Wright is equally unwilling to let his film descend into the usual dour moralizing offered by other such films with ""social messages"", and peppers his film with moments of oddball humour (brilliantly benefiting from his casting the master of deadpan, Robert Downey Jr.) to provide endearing reprieves. Similarly, Wright demonstrates his true directorial prowess through moments such as daring to take breaks from the narrative and often just sit back and listen, allowing his audience to be just as captivated by Ayers' playing as Lopez is, and it is commendable indeed to have a mainstream film promoting the power of musical concerts. Even more magic and haunting (and familiar, oddly enough to viewers of Pixar animated film Ratatouille) are Wright's attempts to cinematically ""get inside"" Ayers' head, reproducing his auditory appreciation for music through a slew of dazzling colours and patterns. It is these fleeting inspired moments which lift The Soloist above the banal and the conventional, adding just enough unexpected or unanticipated moments to make the movie a captivating watch, no matter how familiar the premise. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, as with many such character driven pieces, it is the casting which ultimately makes the film. Continuing a spectacular recent comeback, Robert Downey Jr. delivers yet another testament to his being arguably the most watchable actor in Hollywood as jaded journalist Steve Lopez. His unique verbal style and energy helping to swallow up the most hackneyed of lines, Downey Jr. is superbly charismatic and believable, not only providing most of the film's welcome comic relief but a superbly realized dramatic backbone, never once faltering as a commanding lead. Despite Jamie Foxx, first plugged as the film's Oscar grabber, recently being under critical fire for offering an overly stereotypical portrayal of a mentally ill man, his Nathaniel Ayers feels every inch a real person without inappropriately milking sympathy or depression from the audience. Foxx offers a real haunting life behind periodic twitches and mumbles, careful to keep Nathaniel highly dignified and self-sufficient as well as cheerfully accepting of his position, proving highly inspirational, but in somehow a completely unexpected manner. Catherine Keener also delivers a terrific performance as Lopez's (in the film) ex-wife, measuring a sardonic and critical veneer with a truly resonant human side, her excellent charisma helping to carry a stale ""emotional support"" role. Tom Hollander is the most objectionable presence, feeling out of place and vaguely offensive as a snide, fundamentalist cello teacher working with Ayers, but Nelsan Ellis counterbalances him as a warm, measured and wryly humorous relief worker. <br/><br/>While using words such as 'powerful', 'resonant', 'touching' and 'uplifting' to describe The Soloist might only suggest the film's worn out, superficial premise being realized, Wright somehow manages to stay a step ahead of the game. Extracting such emotions at unexpected moments or times while maintaining a final impact which is not only daringly bleak, but also quietly truthful without ever becoming excessively sombre and dour, Wright's film remains unexpectedly fascinating, and worth seeing even for those skeptical of the film's initial presentation.<br/><br/>-8/10"
"zardoz-13","8","2","3","8 May 2009"," ""The Soloist"" Will Bow You Over
","I saw ""The Soloist"" the other night when there was nothing else on that I hadn't seen. I wound up at one of those special showings where nobody else showed up for the movie. It was just as well that nobody else showed up. ""The Soloist"" is what callous critics label as a tear-jerker. Although I'm a guy, I don't mind crying at movies. The best movies make you cry or at least they make me cry. Sometimes you cry a lot because it is really a tender, sensitive movie about many sweet souls who endure travails that nobody should suffer from, and you'd have to be an ogle not to weep. And then there are those movies where you laugh so hard that you cry.<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" qualifies as the first kind of weep-a-thon. A real-life Los Angeles newspaper columnist, Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr. of ""Iron Man"") discovers this guy, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx of ""Miami Vice""),living out of a shopping cart but who plays the violin or the cello. He can be found virtually anywhere and he's playing classical music. He plays Beethoven so well that Lopez is drawn to his plight. Anyway, Lopez has led a pretty screwed up life. His wife (Catherine Keener of ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"")serves as his editor at the Los Angeles Times where he writes, but they are divorced and manage to co-exist. They have a college-age son that Lopez never talks to and she has all these important news stories that she wants him to follow up on. Instead, Lopez decides to investigate this homeless African-American who plays classical movie like a genius. He discovers that Nathaniel dropped out of Julliard and now lives on the streets of L.A where--according to the movie--90-thousand homeless people live. <br/><br/>Lopez gets Nathaniel strings for his musical instrument and struggles to get the guy off the streets. The life of homeless people is depicted as dreadful. ""Atonement"" director Joe Wright pushes all the right buttons without pushing them to heavily. These desperate people--many of whom are insane--get harassed by everybody simply because they are vulnerable and have nobody to protect them. Lopez begins to behave like a parent and wants to control Nathaniel's life. He wants to get Nathaniel to see a doctor and get medication, so he can come to his senses and join the rest of grieving humanity. The homeless guy worships the ground that Lopez walks on without question.<br/><br/>Meanwhile,the thick-skinned people that run a homeless shelter try to convince Lopez that all the do-gooder things that he wants to do for Nathaniel are wrong. They tell him just to be the guy's friend. Wright strikes the right balance between being a hopeless liberal and restrained conservative. <br/><br/>Every time that you see Jamie Foxx, you want to cry because he is so vulnerable and his life is so wretched. Lopez is haunted by Nathaniel's predicament and Lopez starts climbing the walls with anxiety, and you want to cry because he is going through so much grief to help Nathaniel but Nathaniel is so spaced out on planet Nathaniel that he doesn't seem to care. In fact, at one point, the Foxx character turns vicious and threatens to kill Nathaniel. In an effort to lighten things up, Wright works in a wacky subplot about the problems with raccoons that Lopez is dealing with because these critters are excavating holes in his lawn and a pest specialist assures him that the secret to running the coons off is to use coyote urine.<br/><br/>Basically, ""The Soloist"" is an ode to homeless people. Homeless people must be treated with dignity. We shouldn't try to help them by making their lives more miserable than they already are. So there I sit soaking up this saga, crying for the existence of the poor homeless guy because it is a miracle that he survives each day and watching the poor journalist going through hell because he genuinely wants to make a difference. Foxx and Downey are both nothing short of brilliant. These roles are the kind that actors live and breathe for because the characters are so out of the box. Catherine Keener plays Downey's ex-wife and boss and she is still looks sexy even though she is no longer a spring chicken. She spends most of her time ridiculing all of her ex-husband's best efforts.<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" is an art-house movie. Popcorn munching maniacs on a date are not going to put up with this somewhat tragic film. Yes, there is a happy compromise ending. And there I sit with tears streaming down my face between of my sympathy for the plight of the homeless while I'm crying for laughter at the conflicted journalist because he tries so hard to make a difference and doesn't realize that he has made a difference.<br/><br/>The real surprise is that I'll probably go back and see this nonsense again because of the acting and the storyline. It is a very meaningful movie with a lot of irony. I think that the message is that we are all our brother's keepers, but we don't need to turn into crusaders. It is like when somebody has a problem. You don't try and solve their problem because they will get resentful because you are butting into their life. However, if you sit and listen to them, they love you. You have to have a sense of humor."

","It was a rainy day and a good day to go to a movie. I'm not a fan of the action ""franchises"". I prefer what I call ""people"" movies- movies that are about human beings, their lives and relationships. I'm willing to check them out whether or not they got great reviews or won awards, (which they often do because they stand out so much against the video-game dreck). ""The Soloist"" has gotten some very negative reviews from some sources but I decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in years.<br/><br/>The key to it is that it doesn't try to be sentimental. There is a cello but not much violin music and that seems symbolic of the approach: it tells the story and presents the characters without sentimentality or lectures. The film allows us to determine our own reaction to it. Robert Downey Jr. gives his best ever performance as Mr. Lopez, the reporter who starts out looking at Mr. Ayers as a way to fill a column but comes to realize he was exploiting him rather than trying to be his friend. He then realizes that to be his friend he has to accept him as he is rather than forcing him to someone else. Jamie Foxx, who is amazing in the way he loses himself in his roles, avoids overplaying his part or asking for sympathy. He just acted what he saw. Together they are the best movie acting tandem I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly made, with just a hint of what Mr. Ayers has gone through trying to sort out reality and imagination and his triumph over the tragedy by finding a way to keep playing his music even if he was unable to continue his formal career. The editing is wonderful, jumping back and forth between Ayers and Lopez's stories without ever being confusing.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but compare this to ""A Beautiful Mind"", which also deals with schizophrenia but is full of inaccuracies. That was a good film despite that but this is a much better one."

","I heard quite a few things about this film before seeing it, not all of it was good. Now I've watched it I can see why. It's based on a true story from a book written by journalist Steve Lopez who is portrayed in the film by Robert Downey Jr. He has a column on the L.A. Times where he writes about characters he meets on the streets.<br/><br/>Out cycling one day, journalist Steve Lopez comes off his bicycle and ends up in hospital. Whilst recovering from his injuries he hears a violin being played. He eventually finds a down-and-out man playing a two-string violin. They get talking and the man, Nathaniel Ayers, tells him he went to Julliard, which is at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Lopez checks up on Nathaniel's story and discovers that he started there, but never graduated, his speciality was the cello. It is clear to Steve that Nathaniel is a schizophrenic, but he refuses to accept any help. After writing his first article, a reader sends Steve an old cello that she can no longer play due to rheumatism. Steve takes it to Nathaniel but tells him he cannot keep it on the street, instead he can play it at the LAMP homeless shelter. Allowing Nathaniel to play it one time in the street, Steve is really moved and realises just how good a musician he is and how much he loves to play. The film then goes on to tell us more about the backgrounds of both Nathaniel and Steve and how a friendship grows between them. How Nathaniel developed his love for music and how his schizophrenia affected his career. We also learn about the past relationship Steve had with his boss, Mary Weston. But I'll end my short synopsis here, don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>As you can probably tell from my short synopsis not a lot really happens in this film, and that's the problem with it. I found it very hard to gain any empathy for any of the characters and so, to me, it all felt a bit flat. The performances from both Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey Jr. as Steve Lopez were fine, but the material just didn't work. I should also give honourable mentions to; Catherine Keener as Mary Weston, Tom Hollander as Graham Claydon, Lisa Gay Hamilton as Jennifer Ayers and Nelsan Ellis as David Carter.<br/><br/>Over all this was quite a disappointment, I thought it would have been better than it was. The cinematography was fine, the performances were fine but it was all let down by a rather poorly put together script (IMO).

","This movie could have been magnificent. It could have soared, could have portrayed the shattering tragedy that is the epidemic of homelessness and abject poverty of the inner cities, and it could have equally conveyed the conflictual relationship between the comparatively well-off but shallow everyman reporter and his beautifully flawed subject.<br/><br/>But it didn't, and it wasn't. Despite extraordinary musical sequences, a touching and accurate performance by Foxx and some very creative camera work, it feels forced, shallow and bitter. The directing was glamorous and sappy, and the film seems to fawn on itself and it's own significance even as it drowns in hopelessness, confusion and despair. The only real saving grace of the movie aside from Jamie Foxx's acting is the all-too-brief sequences showing what life as one of the forgotten members of society is really like -- the junkies and crazies, abandoned to subsist in filth and squalor on the hideous underbelly of Los Angeles. That, the film did well. And only that.<br/><br/>Downey, usually electric and charismatic on-screen, is completely unlikeable and frantic as Steve Lopez, a wayward reporter thirsting for a good story. I realize I may garner a great deal of dissent from his powerful fan-base, but I found his portrayal to be inconsistent, cynical and (most distractingly) incredibly strange -- scenes which should have been emotional and riveting are sadly hilarious with Downey's bizarre facial expressions and eccentric mannerisms. His way of speaking is so peculiar he's at times difficult to understand; his reactions so uncalled for and inappropriate it's difficult to imagine anyone, even a homeless schizophrenic, being desperate enough for his treacherous and self- centered ""friendship"". His nervous energy and off-key interactions become increasingly painful to watch as the movie becomes steadily more serious, and the only emotion in the entire film he manages to summon are weepy doe-eyes that feel obviously manipulative and an utterly besotted, love-struck, soppy smile that he sends Foxx's way in a feeble imitation of what was in real life a touching heterosexual male relationship. He fluctuates rapidly between what appears to be an ardent, homo-erotic adoration of Foxx to a vicious, whiny rejection. Downey's is one of the most unsympathetic performances I've seen in a long, long while. <br/><br/>Foxx, conversely, portrays to near perfection the anguish and innocence of a disabling mental illness. His character is a homeless, schizophrenic former Juilliard musician who wanders the streets of LA with his shabby violin and constant self-narration. His acting is haunting and real, and what may oft be misinterpreted as aloofness on Foxx's part is in fact a realistic portrayal of the flatness of schizophrenics. It's faintly ridiculous to see such talent as Jamie Foxx paired with such shallow madness as Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>Overall, the film becomes an unwittingly parallel to the man it set out to portray -- like Nathaniel Anthony Ayers himself, it started out with remarkable potential and deteriorated into an aimless entanglement of its former merits. <br/><br/>A tragic fable, indeed."

","Depressing film dealing with mental illness and genius. Just another of those films that press the point about genius and insanity being separated by a very fine line.<br/><br/>Ironically, Downey Jr. takes on the Lopez role, the writer for the L.A. Times who takes an interest in a homeless, mentally ill person, who is quite talented musically.<br/><br/>At first, one thinks that the Jamie Foxx role is one of someone being autistic. Look, he was nothing more than a homeless person, who is musically gifted but at the same time is quite a nut job.<br/><br/>The film seems to be as erratic as Foxx's behavior. There is one scene where he looks like a character right out of James Cagney's 1942 rendition of Yankee Doodle Dandy.<br/><br/>Following his outburst and violent scene, the uneven script has Foxx in a home and quickly improving.<br/><br/>Films dealing with mental illness are so hard to depict on screen. A case in point was Olivia De Havilland's 1948 ""The Snake Pit."" At least, you knew there why the De Havilland part cracked up. Not so in the case of this film. Unevenly told, you don't even have sympathy for the character that Foxx is trying to depict."

","A Los Angeles newspaper columnist, Steve Lopez, hears a homeless man play a violin that only has two strings. Mr. Lopez is intrigued by the man that is attempting to play with such an instrument. The street person is asked about some names painted on a tree, the reporter is impressed to learn those were Julliard fellow students. If Steve is correct, this man, Nathaniel Ayers, has been formally trained in the New York's most prestigious music school. His curiosity makes him check out to see if there is any truth in what Ayers had told him. To his amazement, he learns that yes, Mr. Ayers had gone to Julliard, but didn't graduate as a cellist, not as a violinist.<br/><br/>The lives of these two men become intertwined in ways neither one expected. Steve Lopez decided to help get Ayers on his feet again, something the homeless man didn't know how to deal with because his mental condition. However much Steve Lopez tried to aid Ayers, he always got a negative reaction from this man whose evident schizophrenia doesn't let them deal with reality.<br/><br/>In flashbacks we get to know the progression of Nathaniel Ayers' mental disorder as he goes from a talented young cello player, to being granted admission in Julliard. From a somewhat poor environment, Mr. Ayers arrives in New York, a big and cold place, to make a life for himself while receiving a musical education. Something in his mind didn't quite respond to the emotions he was feeling. The result was a total breakdown for Nathaniel, who resorted to a life on the streets. It is not made clear how did he end up in Los Angeles, a cruel place where some 90,000 homeless men and women live in squalor.<br/><br/>This was a film with impressive credentials. Joe Wright directed ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"", so we were looking forward to his new work. The film was co-written by Steve Lopez and Susannah Grant, of ""In Her Shoes"", and ""Erin Brokovich"" fame. Naturally, our high hopes didn't quite pay off because the tragic figure of Nathaniel Ayers plight doesn't involve us the way he should.<br/><br/>Basically, and this is something we noticed when we saw the trailers, Jamie Foxx's characterization of the mentally disturbed Nathaniel Ayers leaves us cold. Granted, the actor has to receive direction in order to bring out his character, but one never feels Mr. Foxx is that man, but an actor impersonating that tragic disoriented individual. On the other hand, the main reason for watching the film is Robert Downey Jr., one of our best actors working in movies these days. Mr. Downey Jr. captures the essence of Steve Lopez convincingly. There was no chemistry between the actors.<br/><br/>The excellent Catherine Keener, always a welcome presence in any movie, shows up as a Los Angeles Times editor, Mary Weston, who was Steve's former wife. Tom Hollander is also seen as a musical instructor trying to help Nathaniel. Lisa Gay Hamilton also has a small part."
"southbase","6","2","4","3 May 2009"," Reporter finds music on the streets-movie version loses the point
","Arrestingly-filmed yet oddly distanced dramatization of LA Times columnist Steve Lopez's (Robert Downey, Jr) series of articles regarding his befriending and increased sponsoring of a failed classical musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), now begging for change near several of the city's musical landmarks and during his investigations becoming forced to explore his own societal and interpersonal biases & fears. Lopez appeared to accept from reader reaction that Ayers--swerving between trilled spouting of information and history and self-dangerous descents into violent rage--came through the reportage more believably and immediate when the two went into action together--touring old haunts, enduring rehab, abandoned family members like Ayers' sister Jennifer (Lisagay Hamilton) reintroduced to him yet the encounters brim with recrimination. Yet through the patient and increasing level of support not just from the uncertain Lopez (almost driven to drink or career distraction without the knowing, cheeky support of his ex-wife and editor (Catherine Keener) but from an unexpectedly diverse range of contributors in LA and around the US who register their remembrance of Ayers or admiration of Lopez' remarkable patience and dedicated journalism, the film winds everything through a completely overburdened halfway house in the second half where Ayers himself will make the film's climactic decision on whether to embrace the help of esteemed classical musicians and a stable household or destroy himself in the immense miasma of the LA slums. THE SOLOIST refuses to either take sides or provide easy answers, and to a degree director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) looks like he could pull the film version's ethically unovert conditions off successfully. Downey and Foxx throughout the film compete with Wright's excessively willful, almost smothering stylization--very hard key lighting and light source spillage, minimalist background staging, profile close-ups and crowded two shots whipped away by breathtaking location zoom lensing, all topped off with a breathtaking hi-fidelity sound mix (the orchestra scenes sound like the mikes were placed right into the bowstrings), alternating with reassuringly traditional lighting and designing of scenes of Ayers' childhood and early education at Julliard. Downey is particularly impressive, seeming to get steadily greyer and more anxious as he guides and controls Ayers' naive remembrances and stocky musical technique into repicking up his beloved cello permanently. As Ayers, Foxx packs a generally believable punch playing a street urchin who was capable of much more, and as the relationship developed I noticed Susannah Grant's screenplay devoting an inordinate--some might say unbalanced--amount of time to both Ayers and the wonky lot of the city's environs, creating understandably large amounts of audience empathy yet tottering a little too trustworthily into the comfort zone of a $60 million dollar big-star vehicle lecturing America about the poor. The result is that Foxx's zombied character conception (the fault may be more Grant's than his, though) lacks either the leavening humor, sociopolitical complexity, and symbolic gravitas (the film version cannot decide if its supposed to be a docudrama or a riveting psychological examination) to humanize him against Lopez and make them a representational force of both their adoptive city or their career frustrations. THE SOLOIST in the end does make for a occasionally striking and formatively well-acted drama but its arch technique and lack of severe social reverberation fails to take detailed advantage of two very fine actors and only partly captures the playful yet deeply haunting contact of an American journalist to a specimen/victim of America's obstinate focus on success and what an 'artist' should be."

","In 2005, the Los Angeles Times published a series of articles by reporter Steve Lopez profiling a classical music virtuoso he found living - and playing his two-string violin - on the streets of Skid Row. After spending many hours with his subject, Lopez learned that Nathaniel Ayers' promising career as a musician was cut tragically short in the early 1970s when he fell victim to schizophrenia - he began hearing voices that crowded out his ability to think clearly and function in the real world - while still a student at Julliard. Inspired both by the human interest potential of the story, as well as by a sincere desire to extend a helping hand to a fellow human being in need, Lopez touched an emotional chord in his readers, shining a spotlight on the very real problems of homelessness and mental illness, while, at the same time, turning Ayres into something of a household name.<br/><br/>With selected passages from the articles serving as voice-over narration, ""The Soloist,"" adapted by Susannah Grant, features Robert Downey Jr. as the well-meaning writer who, in the midst of his personal crusade, comes to question just how much good one human being can do for another when the object of those intentions is either already too far gone to be successfully reached or simply unwilling to accept any proffer of assistance from a caring stranger. Jamie Foxx plays Ayres, the mentally ill prodigy who speaks like Rain Man yet plays the cello like Rostropovich. Both actors are excellent in their roles, with Foxx, in particular, avoiding the temptation of overplaying his hand in a part that seems tailor-made to garner critical acclaim and award nominations.<br/><br/>The performances are certainly the best things going for ""The Soloist,"" for, without them, the movie might well have ended up choking on its own sanctimony and noble intentions. Joe Wright, who did much better by ""Atonement"" a few years back, here tries to gussy things up with a plethora of fancy directorial touches - birds soaring to the music, endless helicopter shots of the city, laser light shows serving as visual correlatives to the classical pieces being played - but no amount of showiness can keep the drama from remaining frustratingly earthbound, pedestrian and plodding. Luckily, the screenplay avoids becoming as syrupy and sentimental as it clearly might have given the Humanity-of-Man nature of the material, and the story itself is interesting enough on its own to overcome the rather indifferent treatment it receives at the hands of the filmmakers. Moreover, the movie does bring out into the open the shamelessly overlooked plight of the homeless and mentally ill in our urban centers. For that reason alone, it serves a salutary purpose."
"dbborroughs","6","2","4","26 April 2009"," Stunning performances are done in by directorial touches that under cut the magic
","After a spill on a bicycle a recuperating Steve Lopez heres music playing on the street and makes the acquaintance of Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man and musical genius, who is playing music on a two string violin. In the course of writing about Ayers for his LA paper Lopez a friendship forms between the two men that changes both of them.<br/><br/>Uneven based on a true story tale about how friendship can alter the way we behave and see the world. The problem is that there have been so many stories like this that some of it comes off as clichéd. What isn't cliché is the performances and the very real bond between Robert Downey as Lopez and and Jamie Fox as Ayers.Say what you will when the pair are on screen together there is a good chance that the film will transcend any other problems it maybe having.<br/><br/>Let me try to explain where the problems in the film come from. There is this moment where Lopez brings Ayers a cello, his original instrument of choice. Lopez wants his friend to go to a shelter to play the instrument but he refuses. They argue and Lopez allows Ayers to play the cello one time before taking to the shelter. Ayers begins to play... and magic happens.As the music happens the camera focuses on the faces of the two men and from the facial expressions alone we know the magic of music. No words, no images are needed beyond that. Unfortunately director Joe Wright doesn't trust the images and he goes for the stereotypical birds flying to illustrate what we are seeing in the faces of the two men. In another seen we see music as color. Why? Why go for the easy way out when everything he needed to do was just show the faces. For me the film's spell gets broken each time and just as I started to well up I groaned in annoyance. There are several instances where this happens, where Wright goes for the the ""cliché"".(The flashback scenes of Ayers early life seems to be all cliché.) This isn't to say the film is bad. Its not. Its one of those annoying ""solidly good films that really should be a great one"". I kept watching because the film repeatedly soars, unfortunately it also usually makes a bone headed choice that drops it down a point or two. Personally I think the film is worth a look especially if you are a fan of the two leads or just like great acting.<br/><br/>Somewhere over 6 out of 10 over all, with moments that are way above it."
"kenlee_kp","6","2","4","26 April 2009"," ""The Soloist"" could've been better with right directions; hence a better film.
","Well, first, I would like to say that this film isn't bad or horrible. If it would've been easily predicted that such a film like this one would suck horrendously as the Happening(2008) did, I wouldn't have bothered to go see this movie in theatre. However, I couldn't leave the seat without a feeling of abrupt disappointment and somewhat bewilderment as to just what had happened toward the ending of the film. I am not here for typing to rapaciously disparage the hard working film crews of this film, but rather remonstrate for my own opinions about its possible flaws I find as the reasons for why I came out a lot disappointed after the end credit rolled. Like other erudite pundits or critics mentioned, this film has the great lead roles by Jamie Foxx who had won an Oscar, and the other Robert Downey Jr. who has been gleaming recently through his action hero(Iron Man)'s impact burgeoning since last year, which will especially continue to glisten more as the sequel to the action hero comes out in 2010.<br/><br/>It seemed to me, for the most of time the film was running, the director didn't seem to either try hard for delineating its real core of emotional sentimentality to the max between the characters or couldn't at all with such milieus subsisting against its own schizophrenic-esquire plots or the whole screenplay. Maybe, the director, Joe Wright wanted or intended partially to make his own film to be somewhat reflective of its main illness, schizophrenia, to even further make the audiences to somehow feel more related and sympathized toward the character, Ayers', though it would be too pointless to put the audience into confusion or dissatisfaction for them to comprehend and vicariously feel in the shoes of the characters depicted in the film.<br/><br/>In short, everything seemed disparate and incongruously edited to an extent where something doesn't click too well or attach deeply enough to the main theme of the film which the director is supposedly trying to express about: the sentimentally uplifting and serendipitous story of Ayers' success. The word, shallow, describes this film at the best. I hope, I don't sound too dismal on this work of film, which I don't hate it but wish it could have been better built with more solid directions added with more lucid and creative pizazz that would make it a little more tear-inducing sentimental work of art.<br/><br/>Because, as it moved toward the ending, I was so totally expecting something big and huge as its climax I was supposedly waiting about right until the end credit didn't show up as I made myself itchy in brain to even conjure up myself Jamie Foxx playing the famous Beethoven piece blaringly aloud at the hall, consequently making Mr. Lopez whom is called also Nathaniel's so claimed god, soaked with nascent tears with his ex-wife sitting together watching. I think that would have been a better ending so to make its ending as the main climax which I don't think I found while watching, though this could be totally just me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was okay depicting the close, but not so deeply engaged in realistic manners, relationship between the two lead roles. To me, the movie moved around too much hastily and haphazardly, putting not enough deep emotion or feeling with either of the main characters, though some of the acting by the leads were good but not as deep as Joker's from Dark Knight or even Will Smith from the Pursuit of Happiness. Like, for Lopez, instead of him just going after Nathaniel's traces, showing him more intimate by contriving his efforts to get in the close bond with the gifted genius at the beginning would have made the character Lopez more humanely close to or attached to the audiences' perspective. I think it was too fastly progressed without showing much of the real deals that could've made it somewhat better as a whole."
"CinemaSerf","7","0","0","18 May 2020"," Foxx is terrific...
","This is a truly super performance from Jamie Foxx as the virtuoso musician (Nathanial Ayers) who lives his life on the streets of Los Angeles. He is ""discovered"" by LA Times journalist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) who is seeking a theme for his column - and his subsequent probing into his new subject discovers that Mr. Ayers suffers from a acute form of schizophrenia that renders his ability to rationalise his thoughts and or skills into anything that could enable him to use his musical talents to escape his predicament all but impossible. As ever with RD films, the pace of the dialogue is frenetic and here is actually quite distracting from the subtle and poignant efforts from Foxx - the story works best when it is told from his perspective, and though I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the actual effects upon the real man, the fact that it is based on a true story does incline me to consider that this representation of Ayers' battle against his own demons could be a true reflection of the actual difficulties faced by a man of such magnificent talents, but with so many equally mammoth psychological problems. The score from Dario Marianeli serves to accompany the mood of the film - at a variety of paces - magnificently, too."

","12 June 2009. This movie bursts with music and creative photographic snapshots while provided suggestive reflections from 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY (1968) and even KOYANNISQATSI (1983). This adult version of AUGUST RUSH (2007), brings to the screen a strong relational movie about mental illness and musical brilliance. More importantly, this movie avoids any necessity for the use of the major twist that A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) and instead allow the focus to be strictly on the cinematic presentation of mental illness, to even greater affect. There are a few minor weaknesses where Robert Downey Jr.'s own on-screen persona almost overtakes his character even though its played down quite a bit, there is a slow paced section a little ways into the movie, a sort of interesting biographical gap about how Nathaniel Ayers is able to get into Julliard in the first place, and a sort of jarring, unexplained, almost out of character scene with Robert Downey's character's ex-wife as she's drinking. Overall, this drama plays out very well, the characters are presently powerfully and even the element of mental illness is portrayed with sensitivity and humanity. There is almost no melodrama, the ultimate pacing and storyline becomes stronger, more intense without having to resort to overly dramatic acting, and the soft landing at the end transforms this movie more about people and their potential for humanity more than anything. This is a powerful movie with a strong and vibrant message that doesn't preach. 8/10."

","With an interesting subject matter, two talented actors starring, Beethoven (one of my favourite composers) featuring heavily in the soundtrack and an impressive trailer, 'The Soloist' had enough to make me want to see it.<br/><br/>Joe Wright is somewhat hit and miss for me. 'Atonement' and 'Hanna' especially of his films are great, also liked 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Darkest Hour'. 'Anna Karenina' didn't do it for me though and 'Pan' was a big misfire. 'The Soloist's' mixed reception admittedly created some uncertainty on my part, but the interest points mentioned in the first paragraph were enough to check it out anyway. Seeing it, 'The Soloist' is somewhere in the middle of Wright's films in ranking.<br/><br/>Not one of his best, not one of his worst either. Better than reputed, but considering the potential a better film was in there somewhere that didn't quite materialise. <br/><br/>'The Soloist's' biggest strength is the two leads. Robert Downey Jnr. especially is riveting in a performance full of vigour and heart. Jamie Foxx had the more challenging role, and while not as subtle as Downey his acting is incredibly emotionally committed and touching. Catherine Keener also fares well. <br/><br/>It's a good looking film too, polished, gritty and elegant. The music is magnificent as one would hope. 'The Soloist' does have its fair share of powerful, poignant and uplifting moments, the chemistry between the two leads strikes all the right notes and the scenes and portrayal of the homeless have a lot of power. The portrayal of schizophrenia, a very complex condition that has been prone to a lot of misconceptions and misinterpretations, is not too inaccurate.<br/><br/>However, Wright's direction is fairly unimaginative and sometimes chaotic. While there is nothing amateurish about his images (apart from some over-eager/clever editing) not all of them serve much of a purpose. The script does tend to ramble, even in Foxx's dialogue which is at times slightly annoying, and be too ham-fisted.<br/><br/>Similarly, the story is somewhat too thin and tries to cover too many themes and ideas without exploring some of them enough. Consequently, some of the film gets unfocused and over-crowded with a tendency to get melodramatic and be erratically paced. The rest of the acting barely registers, which is a shame because the two leads are so good.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad film but could have been more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Times reporter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) discovering Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) a cello prodigy whose mental illness has pushed him into homelessness. It is a heartwarming story of perseverance and a reminder that amazing people can be found in the most unexpected places. It is also a portrayal of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, and the struggle it can create, both for those suffering from it and those who care about them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those two impactful themes are not blended together well and the transition between them feels harsh and undermines their impact. There is also a focus on the homelessness problem, but it is not fleshed out well and doesn't have the impact it could. They also added the fictional subplot of Lopez having gone through a recent divorce, but still working with and being close with his ex- wife (Catherine Keener). This really doesn't add much to the story past giving a reason that Lopez throws himself so much into trying to help Nathaniel.<br/><br/>The problems ultimately boil down to underwhelming direction from Joe Wright, which is disappointing given his excellent work on ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice.""

","Interesting based on fact film directed by dyslexic British filmmaker Joe Wright. Wright seems like an odd choice for this film considering his success with high caliber romantic and literary movies like ""Pride and Prejudice"" '05 ~ ""Atonement"" 07 ~ and ""Anna Karenina"" '012. Perhaps, the at times uneven style of ""The Soloist"" harks back to Wright's earlier days as a Video clip director but might also be partly due to Susannah Grant's screenplay. Somewhere between the two, this production has a couple of seemingly disjointed scenes that to some, could seem misplaced. <br/><br/>The story is a powerful one, with Jammie Foxx perfectly cast playing the mentally afflicted and volatile Cello prodigy Nathaniel Ayers. Ayers, while living on the mean streets of Los Angeles playing broken down instruments, attracts the interest of L.A. Times columnist Steve Lopez - Robert Downey Jr delivers one of his more sincere performances as Lopez.

","'The Soloist' is one of those movies that pieces you together. I came across this title on reading Robert Downey Jr's biography. This is one of his most sincere portrayals. <br/><br/>This is based on a book written by Steve Lopez. Downey plays Steve Lopez. The chemistry between Downey & Foxx is mystical. Both come together in the most unusual way. <br/><br/>The movie explores one of the most debated topic; does a mentally ill person need medications to get better, is love and emotional support not way more powerful? Both characters feed off each other's friendship, making each a better person. <br/><br/>The film puts forth a pertinent question; how many other Nathaniel Ayers lurk around, clueless and lost? Life is unpredictable. We may never truly know the answer to this question. However this movie is all about a gem found after being hidden for ever so long. This is by no means a fairy tale movie. Ayers does not get better in a jiffy. However his find, road to recovery & his attempt to refit into the society, not just helps him but Lopez too. <br/><br/>Worth a watch. Does your heart a great good! :)"

","The Soloist (2009): Dir: Joe Wright / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jamie Foxx, Catherine Keener, Tom Hollander, Lisa Gay Hamilton: Musical drama about two loners whom connect through common ground. Robert Downey Jr. plays a L.A. Times reporter bent on helping a schizophrenic violinist played by Jamie Foxx who doesn't want to be helped. We know where this is headed and despite the presence of two worthy leads, the material is about as old as rocks. Directed by Joe Wright with terrific music and location shots, which is the one positive highlight. Wright previously scored big with the award winning Atonement, which went beyond its actors and involved them in a compelling plot. That is unfortunately not the case here. Downey Jr and Foxx are two terrific talents that do their best to elevate stale material. We can see the outcome to this twenty blocks away from the theatre we are heading to in order to witness this dread. Catherine Keener and Tom Hollander are underused in supporting roles that really play like space fillers. Keener's character is the ex-wife of Downey Jr whom he now works for. The best element of this film is the two leads, which is great since supporting roles are bland. Despite familiarity the film celebrates music, talent and the graceful presence of friendship that invades the solo lifestyle. Whether that saves the film, is an individual choice. Score: 5 / 10"

At first when I was assigned to watch this, movie it seemed a little odd. It didn't really relate to my project topic, but we still watched it anyways. After watching this movie, it made me believe to never give up on our dreams even if you fail the first time around. Steve is a writer for the LA Times and is currently going through divorce. Nathaniel Ayers is a homeless man skid row who has an amazing talent. He is a phenomenal violinist who attended the Juliard School of Music but had to leave because of his struggles with his mental illnesses. When Steve Lopez first meets Nathaniel, he comes across him in a park in Los Angeles playing the violin. Nathaniel seems very intelligent but there are clear sign of an illness. We soon learn that Nathaniel has schizophrenia. He decided to write an article about him in the paper. Steve wanted to learn more about Nathaniel for the article so he contacted his sister. He learned that Nathaniel is a cello prodigy. After one of Steves readers reads about this in the paper, they kindly give Steve a brand new cello for Nathaniel to play. Through out the movie Steve is constantly pushing for Nathaniel to get help for his conditions and for him to get back up on his feet. After an Innocent where Nathaniel loses his temper, he blows an opportunity for his music. Steve arranges for Nathaniel to get help but Nathaniel things he is doing it on his own. When Nathaniel learns that Steve is apart of it, he blows up at Steve and tells him to leave him alone. After Steve speaks to his ex wife Mary, He realizes that not only has he changes Nathaniel's if for the better but Nathaniel has also changes Steve in ways too. My favorite scene was when Steve gave Nathaniel the cello. It really stand out as a token to their friendship and the love someone can give to someone without even knowing them. The movie is about how to build good relationships with the people around you. Treat other how you would like to be treated."
"Gideon24","8","0","0","10 April 2015"," An effective drama that sacrifices a little too much realism for the drama.
","A compelling, fact-based story and a couple of powerhouse starring performances ignite The Soloist, a 2009 drama which attempts to put a human face on some hot-button issues, but, at times, seems to sacrifice the reality of the situations presented here for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>The film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Steve Lopez, a writer for the LA Times, who happens upon a homeless man playing the violin and after a tentative encounter, learns that the man is named Nathaniel Ayers and spent 2 years studying the cello at Julliard, but did not graduate. Lopez finds himself drawn to the man, not to mention deciding that his story would make great material for his paper, but struggles to connect with the man, whose obvious mental health issues make it very difficult for Lopez to help the man, despite the fact that the series of articles he has written about Nathaniel are garnering attention and acclaim for him.<br/><br/>The film is an emotionally charged look at Lopez' tireless obsession with making a personal connection with this gifted musician whose life went astray at some point and his frustration with the fact that he is powerless to help Nathaniel in the way that he needs the most help...help with his mental issues, that from what we've been shown, could be anything from autism to schizophrenia. The problem is that like a lot of people with serious mental issues, they are unaware that they have mental health issues and as long as they are not a danger to themselves or others, they cannot be forced into psychiatric treatment or medication that could help them and this is an issue that this story completely nails. Lopez' desire to help Nathaniel is the core of this story and the fact that he is powerless in securing this kind of help for the man, it doesn't matter that he actually finds the man a place to live or even gets his talent as a musician recognized, as long as his mental issues aren't properly addressed, he can never be a whole person again, something Lopez has difficulty accepting.<br/><br/>Flashback sequences provide a peek into Nathaniel's past and we do see the beginning of his mental decay during an orchestra rehearsal where Nathaniel starts to hear voices in his head, but we are provided no further insight into the man's mental decay, which I found kind of aggravating.<br/><br/>There is also a scene where a worn out Lopez appears to be giving up on Nathaniel and Nathaniel's response is to start asking Lopez personal questions about his own life, which just rang totally false to me...most mentally challenged people are in their own world and not prone to reaching out to others. I also had a problem with the idea of arranging for Nathan to actually give a recital. I had a hard time believing that Nathaniel would agree to such a thing but his reaction to being onstage legitimized that.<br/><br/>What does ring true though is Jamie Foxx's brilliant performance as Nathaniel, which totally nails the character's delicate mental sensibilities...the way he constantly talks and you think he's not listening at all, but he does catch things here and there and the way he remembers everything he learned about Lopez during their first meeting when they meet for the second time, an ability which made me think there might be some facet of autism involved in Nathaniel's condition. He's in his own world but certain facts do register and lodge in his memory banks without ever exiting his personal mental orbit of which he is a virtual prisoner.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. matches Foxx note for note with a vivid performance that is so human that you almost don't see him acting. The performance is also a wonderful acting study in reaction and playing off the actions of another actor. Watch him when he takes the cello out of Nathaniel's arms that he received as an anonymous gift for Nathaniel or when Nathaniel gets physical with him at the end of the film. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't make a false move here and it is easy to overlook his work in the midst of Foxx's flash. I have a feeling that a lot of the direct communication between Lopez and Nathaniel was enhanced through Susannah Grant's screenplay for heightened drama rather than realism. Communicating with the mental ill, especially those with schizophrenia or autism, is a lot more difficult than depicted here. <br/><br/>Bouquets to Catherine Keener and Lisa Gay Hamilton for bringing substance to the thankless roles of Lopez' editor/ex-wife and Nathaniel's sister, respectively. <br/><br/>This film is a sobering indictment on the plight of the homeless and the mentally ill that even though slightly-over dramatized, pushes a lot of hot buttons and will definitely gnaw at your emotions."

","The Soloist is one of those films I remember not living up to its hype, especially when it came to Oscar season. Perhaps that is why I skipped that film until now. It's really not a bad film at all, led by two central performances from Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Granted, the film moves at a snail-like pace at times, but this melodrama brings to light some important issues such as mental disorders and homelessness. These two subjects should not be said in the same sentence, but in the case of Nathaniel Ayers, it unfortunately is the case. <br/><br/>Based on a true story, Joe Wright's film is about a LA Times reporter named Steve Lopez who has a chance encounter with a homeless schizophrenic named Nathaniel Avery, who is incredibly gifted with the cello. Steve decides to use him as a story topic and in the process, a friendship was forged. <br/><br/>The film is well-acted because of the two incredibly gifted actors in the lead. Jamie Foxx showed dramatic acting chops in 2004's Ray, and now he does so again in the Soloist. This may not be the best portrayal with this subject (Russell Crowe was better in 2001's A Beautiful Mind), but it was still a powerful performance nonetheless. Robert Downey Jr did a great job as the reporter who introduced this man to the world. <br/><br/>Overall, The Sololist is a solid melodrama, although it's nothing special. The performances were excellent and I liked the story itself. The screenplay is a little weak and a little confusing at times, so thank heavens for Foxx and Downey! Poverty has always been a big issue in LA, but it seems like LA is the homeless capital of the world. A very important theme of this movie. A good, watchable melodrama. I rate this film 8/10."

Outside of that, I don't think the movie really found any focus, which I see as it's biggest problem.

","The Soloist is the real life story of Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez and his friendship with the homeless, mentally unstable yet exceptionally talented musician Mr. Nathaniel Ayers. Steve Lopez covers the story of how a Jilliard dropout with such exceptional music gifts ended out on the streets and while covering the story, Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., develops a special bond with the musician, Nathaniel, played by Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>The movie shows the tragic, disease-ridden and crime –afflicted world of Los Angeles streets. It shows how this world has been completely abandoned by the authorities, by the hospitals who do not care about the sick, the police who do not care about the well-being of the homeless and also by the work-oriented populace of the city who do not stop even for a second to listen to the talented musician playing Beethoven on the street.<br/><br/>The story presents a view point of how people need to move away from the socially accepted strands of ""normalcy"". The movie says that one need not always think about how to ""cure"" a mentally challenged person but instead should just accept them for who they are and be their friends. Friendship with the journalist actually helps Nathaniel while his every step to try and fit him according to the socially accepted behavior goes in vain, to say the least.<br/><br/>The film also deals with the power of friendship and how it has the power to make each one of us into better human beings.<br/><br/>This is a movie for the modern mind.

","Another film about life with a damaged mind. Films of this sort often deal with mathematical or musical minds so that we can find in the apparent mess not just a handicap, but a reaching out and capacity for order and beauty. Focusing on genius however kind of obscures what's really at stake. In simple terms, if the protagonist of Shine wasn't a child prodigy would there be a film about him? <br/><br/>The film is open about this motivation, selfaware, by having the snappy journalist, a surrogate for the filmmaker himself, drawn to the schizophrenic homeless musician among thousands of a similar fate because this one makes for an enhanced story.<br/><br/>What matters for me though is what kind of salvation are we drawn to find. This is worthwhile in many aspects. The inspirational beauty comes less from any extraordinary playing, there is no triumphant final performance as in Shine, and more from the fact of his complete immersion in music. We get to see both the damage, the voices and paranoid storytelling inside the mind, and the enhanced capacity beyond: music as abstract color vision, the rapture of the immersion itself.<br/><br/>The final realization is that nothing matters more than simply being in reach for another person, a gently skiing support instead of any patronizing panacea.<br/><br/>I like all these things here, but at the same time it's a matter of evoking it as awareness. We perfectly sane minds of the audience (right) want to rediscover this capacity for immersion that eludes us in the outer shell of normalcy, it's why we watch films among other things. We need to be reminded that normal life has no logical purpose of its own without the commitment to someone. All this means that we want to experience film as madly as Ayers experiences music, the distance into which self dissolves into insight (this being narrative depth); but come out whole, lucid.<br/><br/>But there's no distance when you simply tell us; no value. In Ice Storm we get the same realization of holding each other into place but layered and visual. Woman Under the Influence is the real masterpiece in this vein: even more gruelling life with a schizophrenic than here, but enlightens by asking of us as viewers to experience the commitment and immersion, and this being the most important thing, one as the other, in other words we can immerse ourselves in the film and find value only if we commit to being a part of that life, nothing less will do. In the marvelous end, the gentle support doesn't have to be announced, it's there in two people simply taking care of the same house before going to bed.<br/><br/>This cries on its skin, enlightens in words, asks only the appearance of commitment."

","Two terrific performances by Downey and Foxx in this based-on-real-life look at the relationship between an LA reporter and a schizophrenic homeless musician. Watching the interviews with the real people the film portrays, I was even more impressed with how the screenwriter and actors had caught the dynamic between the two, the speech patterns of Ayers, and the inner world of the schizophrenic. I loved what Ayers sees, with closed eyes, during the performance of the Eroica, an abstract synaesthetic wonder.<br/><br/>This film could have been made specifically for me. I love Beethoven, for one thing-- so the score is a pure delight. I've usually had pleasant interactions with street people. I like schizophrenics. I never assume when such a person says to me that they can see/hear something I cannot that I am right and they are wrong; I often suspect they are seeing something I'm too limited to see and just having a hard time putting it into words I can understand. And the ones I've connected with are smart and interesting and insightful; they're a delight to listen to. There's nothing here of the errors of Beautiful Mind, no simplistic pro-pharma,drug-the-genius-out-of-them worldview. And yet the schizophrenia is not innocuous here; it is sometimes a danger to Ayers and others. This is real mental illness, not Hollywood mental illness.<br/><br/>I suspect that is why the film has a low rating. Filmviewers--American in particular--want a clear simplistic story that matches the false narrative they get on commercial TV, the simple metanarratives they hear on talk shows (sponsored by big pharma, in part, but people aren't very good about applying critical consciousness to facts like that). They likely don't want their limited worldviews shaken.<br/><br/>This is happy story, though it doesn't provide a Capraesque treacly ending. The uplift here is that one human being actually *saw* another human being and accepted him for what he is. This is a rare enough event in human interaction it qualifies as ""weird news."" As novelist Irish Murdoch said, ""Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real."" This film is a moving portrait of real human love, not a love that seeks to change the other, but that accepts the beloved.<br/><br/>That this is rated lower here (and even by many critics) than typically awful horror films or comic book-based movies is a tragedy, yet is unsurprising. Perhaps the film is rated low because it subtly tells you, you can make the world a better place by behaving like Lopez, but it isn't easy, and the work never ends. You have to work on yourself too. The film challenges you. It doesn't say there are clear bad guys; it doesn't say the mentally ill and homeless are ""them"" and we're safe over here on our side in our difference. It says, everybody is a person, equal in his worth. It's a revolutionary message."

Although I am a scientist, music has always been a part of my life. It has given me joy, comfort, power and peace when I was in the ups and (especially) downs in my life. I understand how powerful music can be.<br/><br/>This movie is about how music can save a person when he is in the deepest hole you can imagine in life. Jamie Foxx is marvelous in this movie. I've never really liked him before I watched this movie. His music background certainly helped. My only small complaint is that when he is playing with the orchestra, you actually can tell he is not really playing. His arm motion and body expression is certainly out of place when compared with other cello players. But when he is playing violin or cello by himself, it is very believable. You would think it is really him playing what you hear from the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The biggest lesson I learned from this movie: every homeless people has his/her own story.

","One trick I truly dislike when a movie is promoted is when the label 'inspired by a true story' is placed into a too visible place, especially when it comes to true stories and to characters which I could in theory at least meet on the street (well, on some streets). I am confused by mix of documentary and drama that are not frankly labeled as such but prefer to disguise in fiction movies resorting the 'inspired by ' label only when in artistic or credibility trouble, and I do not buy easily the theories about life exceeding melodrama. After all what counts for me in a film is the artistic truth, and there is a credibility of emotions and situations that does not necessarily go at the same pace as plain reality. For plain reality I have the real life, and I have TV news, Internet and written press. I am looking for something else when I watch a fiction movie.<br/><br/>One of the problems with The Soloist is that while director Joe Wright uses all the tools of the great studios films, the story does not gather neither enough 'meat' not enough 'steam' to sustain the whole film. The story of the Julliard drop-out who becomes a homeless to be accidentally discovered 30 years later by a LA Times reporter can make for a good article in the LA Times, or even a good series of articles or a book, but not for a whole film. One of the reasons is that the script writer does not seem to have fully investigated the case, or maybe decided not to bring the whole material to screen. I confess that I did not understand the reasons of Minnesota-born cellist Nathaniel Ayers leaving school – we have flashbacks that bring indications about childhood problems, some words about a big-handed father (maybe child abuse?), other flashbacks hint to racial pressure at Julliard or just the pressure any young artist experiences in such a competitive environment, and other words speak about his need for RESPECT – so what is the conclusion? The director does not let us know, or I did not get it.<br/><br/>There are many artistic qualities in this film. First the superb acting of the two lead actors – Jamie Foxx is troubled and vulnerable and the efforts to break the wall of non-communication he built around himself make it to the viewer. Robert Downey Jr. provides the interior strength and the humanity to make us love his hero, and believe strongly that there must be a place for investigative journalism and its true heroes in our future lives. What causes The Soloist not to be the good film it aimed to become is the lack of decision in choosing the right tone while throwing away the overweight of moralization. While saying emphatically that it is based on the realities of our days, the film dares not adopt the documentary techniques, but emulates them using the traditional tools of Hollywood. It is just that good acting and splendid music are not enough in this case."

","In the park, the columnist, Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.), of Los Angeles Times heard the sound of a violin. He was looking for the source of the voice, and then he discovered the homeless. There were people walking pass and gave their money to the homeless who was playing a violin. Steve, who is in love with the music, was bewitched in sound of the violin. The columnist didn't hesitate to talk to that homeless. Then he found out that Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), the owner of the music on the street, was a musician student. Nathaniel got dropped out from school because he had a mental problem. It was a big changed for a talented student who became a homeless street musician in L.A. <br/><br/>Because of what the writer saw, the conversation on the street that day made Steve Lopez have inspiration to write the article. It is a story about him and a homeless street musician, and was published in the newspaper, L.A. Times. The article was admired by people in L.A., and there were fans that were looking forward to reading the article. DreamWorks, an American film studio, wanted to tell Steve's story on film when he planned to publish his story as a book. Joe Wright is a director of the movie. He directed movie ""Atonement"", and it was nominated for an Oscar Award. You should watch this movie because the film is about how talented in music and a friendship. <br/><br/>I have seen people like Nathaniel before. It seems like people who are so talented in something, but luck and chances don't want to go with them. The only thing that they have is the heart. Their hearts never give up and try to stay with something that they really love. As a former musician student, Nathaniel's dream is to play in Walt Disney Concert Hall, but he got sick and collapse from his illness. True musicians never choose a stage because they have music in their souls. Grand concert hall or sides walk, the way musicians see is the same thing.<br/><br/>However, this film is trying to emphasize and show how wonderful a ""friendship"" that Steve wanted to help Nathaniel. But what I like the best is just a little spot in the movie. Lopez tried to persuade and convince Nathaniel to play on the stage, but he confirmed to play on the street, in the tunnel, and the park. It wasn't stubbornness that he didn't take the opportunity, or his illness that he felt bashful in public. I think Nathaniel truly understands himself ""where"" the place that makes his heart happy. As long as, Nathaniel feels relieved to play his violin against the cars on the street, a big stage seems to be completely useless.<br/><br/>In fact, Nathaniel has change to move to an official stage more and more, but he has to be ready. In the mean time, Nathaniel chooses to stand where his heart feels comfortable. I think the writer, Steve Lopez, made something small in his life, but it becomes a big opportunity for him as well.

It would show you how talented of street musician and a friendship between a homeless and a journal writer."

","As someone who has worked with mental ill adults, someone who has some empathy for their plight, and who thought this was a rare reflection of the human condition and how important being validated/valued is for anyone. I thought this was a 10. This is an example of the highest form of movies. A friend recently told me about ""Temple Grandin."" Other great movies in this genre include ""A Beautiful Mind"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" ""Shine"" ""I Am Sam"" etc. Robert Downey and Jamie Foxx killed it in their individual roles.

The story was told in a respectful and yet crude manner, without hiding the odds of mental illnesses .. Is is eyeopening and questions what our societies are doing about the mentally ill.

","The Soloist was clearly an Oscar bait film, a film based on a book and a true story, has the issues of classical music, homelessness and mental issues, stars two very respected actors, set in Los Angeles and directed by a director with a growing reputation. But it did not pan out that way for the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times looking for a story. By a chance encounter Steve meets Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a homeless man but a gifted musician despite only having a two string violin. Steve investigates and finds out Nathaniel had dropped out of Juilliard. It is obvious that Nathaniel is suffering mental illness and Steve sets out to help the man whilst writing about him for the newspaper. Steve's columns start to pull the heartstrings of the city and bring the issues of homelessness and the LAMP Community Center to the attention of the city's authorities. But as Steve gets closer to Nathaniel it is clear that Nathaniel is unstable.<br/><br/>The Soloist best feature is the acting and Downey and Foxx have excellent chemistry. Foxx does the best job, making Nathaniel having a calm but erratic speech pattern. He is a man who looks deep inside and does not really want to face the world: Steve is the only person who makes him. Foxx also has to show when Nathaniel turns and being more aggressive. Downey is of course a gifted actor and you can believe in the friendship between the two men, but I do not like the way his character was written to be a bit of a klutz. It's not Downey's fault but it was like they wanted a cheap laugh.<br/><br/>Joe Wright is of course a director with a future and as I write this I am personally looking forward to his next film Hanna. The Soloist is obviously an attempt for Wright to step away from his confront zone, period English drama. He does attempt to make The Soloist more visual, with tracking shots (but you really do not want a tracking shot over a load of toilet cubicles. But many of these visual tricks felt a bit forces, almost like look at me, whether it was looking at a papier-mâché globe with a hurricane and it turns into TV footage of Hurricane Karina or when Nathaniel is in a concert hall and he can see the music. I personally preferred the more grounded stuff set in the Los Angeles inner-city, showing how homeless people are suffering from their addictions. They stuff had a bit more bite to it. I do like some of the references to Amadeus, with the young version of Nathaniel practicing the cello with his arm and you could hear the music in his head. There is also great classic music as you would expect from a film like this.<br/><br/>One of the major issues is homelessness in America. In America it is clear that quite a lot of homeless people have mental health issues and since state and federal does not do anything to help them. In Europe or anywhere else in the industrialised world people like that would be put into care and given the treatment they need. The America healthcare system was a real joke, where you only got decent care if you could afford it, not based on need, a system that only profits insurance and pharmaceutical companies is put ahead of the care of the parent: a system fully supported by the Republican party! Rant over.<br/><br/>Within the film there is flashbacks about Nathaniel showing he was a child prodigy and his time in Juilliard as he descents into madness. To me that would have been a very dark and interesting film about how he became homeless and his only outlet was classical music. But that's just me."

","Recap: By coincidence Steve Lopez, a journalist for the LA Times, meets Nathaniel Ayers Jr. a homeless man. What strikes Lopez as peculiar is that Nathaniel plays the violin, and he does it really well, despite the violin having just two strings. Lopez starts to do some research and finds out that Nathaniel was a prodigy, accepted to Julliard. But a mental breakdown forced him to quit, and has now left him homeless. Lopez and Ayers strikes a bond, builds a tentative friendship.<br/><br/>Comments: Based on a true story, the story of Nathaniel Ayers and his friendship with Steve Lopez is a peculiar one. Their friendship got its bumps, but that is natural, them coming from two extremely different viewpoints. But ultimately it is a story about beauty. Their friendship is beautiful, and the music that Nathaniel plays is beautiful. But if the true story is a peculiar one, the movie is pretty ordinary.<br/><br/>Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are both good, solid veteran actors. And they give solid performances, what you could expect. But they do it individually, I don't really feel the real connection between them, as it must have been between Lopez and Ayers. And I think that is what carries this movie,, the bond between the two of them. And the movie becomes as good as I as a viewer can feel their bond. And it was good, but it wasn't much more than that.<br/><br/>What disturbs me a little is that this most unusual story is still told in a usual way. The movie takes its standard steps. The beginning, the tentative start, a brief period that goes well, a little honeymoon so to speak. Then comes the inevitable setback and at the end the resolve. Many, many movies uses these steps. They do for a reason, because it is safe, and moderately successful. But it seems unnecessary that such a unusual story like this should feel the need to use them. A little more inventive a creative narration would have been welcome.<br/><br/>Six cellos out of ten."

","When this film originally showed trailers I was dying to see it. I didn't get to see it for a very long time and just kept putting it off but it was always a film I really wanted to see. Finally I picked it up on blu ray and sat down to watch it. For all that build up and expectation the film did not let me down. I think a big part of its success should be attributed to the two stars who are both Hollywood stars and very talented actors. Still the based on a true story aspect certainly doesn't hurt as it is a moving and powerful story. The film uses music as its core character as Nathaniel is passionate about nothing more than his music. Whether or not, as some reviewers discuss, the film is an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia it certainly sheds some serious light on the illness. Incredibly though it doesn't drag the film down. One of the best parts of The Soloist is the fact that it isn't dark or heavy handed but instead has this light hearted feeling that leaves you feeling good. I mean the content means there will be a little darkness to it but considering this is a feel good film at its core.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. has quickly been one of the biggest stars in the world and he has talent to back that. His performance as kinda self involved Steve Lopez. I say kinda but he really is a good guy right from the beginning. The best part of the character is that he's just a regular guy. He isn't over the top one way or another and he becomes attached to Nathanial. Nathanial is played by Jamie Foxx, another Hollywood star with talent to back. The chemistry between Foxx and Downey Jr. is amazing. Foxx plays Nathanial with such heart and passion and you will become as attached to him as Lopez does. The passion he displays pays a great homage to the real person I am sure. Catherine Keener is Lopez' ex-wife and colleague. She is decent and her and Downey have good chemistry, even great at times but her character is a little low key compared to Foxx and Downey and she sort of gets buried in the overall scheme of things. The supporting cast including Tom Hollander, Lisa Gay Hamilton and Nelsan Ellis are all very good.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright doesn't have a lot of credits to his name but he does have some powerful and well made films to his credit including Atonement and Pride and Prejudice but I think The Soloist is really his first main stream film and he does wonderful at it. I'm sure directing was easy enough considering the great leading cast. The story is well written and well adapted from Lopez's actual book about the situation. So to sum all of this up The Soloist is a feel good film that might seem like it has some really dark content but it is handled by all involved so well that it actually turns in a light and fun story with real emotion behind it. Definitely recommend this for a Saturday night movie night. It might not have been a critical hit like it could have been but it will entertain and move you. 8/10"

","For anyone curious about the mentally ill, especially Schizophrenia, I think this is a VERY good film. My daughter suffered terribly from the disease. When you are sick, your brain tells you to go to the doctor. When your brain is sick, what do you do? The feelings portrayed by the musicians was well presented by Hollywood. I am sure it was not a truly accurate depiction of events and it is truly sad if none of the proceeds from this film went to help the mentally ill. I know many people look at dirty homeless people with disgust. They should at least get their act together enough to work at McDonalds, right? At one time, I thought like this. Then when my own talented, beautiful girl got sick.....couldn't eat...people were poisoning her.....voices were yelling at her.....bugs were crawling on her.....my perception of everything changed.

","I do not fully understand why this movie is so underrated. People seem to be stuck in the morality of the movie, feeling that Downey's character didn't really do what he was ""supposed to"". I think that it is irrelevant, the story may not unfold as people expect or want it to unfold, but it is still a powerful story. Not only as a story of one man, but as tale about how life often unfolds. <br/><br/>The movie revolves around the life of Steve Lopez, a journalist who, while searching for his next story, happens upon a homeless man, Nathaniel Ayers, who is playing a violin with only two strings. Lopez becomes interested in how Ayers, a very gifted musician and former Juilliard student, ended up homeless on the streets of LA. While writing his articles, Lopez starts trying to help Nathaniel to escape his life as a homeless man and to help him ""become good again"", as a musician. <br/><br/>The two become close friends, but Nathaniel, suffering from mental illness, refuses Lopez's help. All he wants to do is play music on the streets, and, in the end, he ends up helping Steve by enlightening him, spiritually with his music and his character. <br/><br/>This movie has some outstanding elements, most important of which are the performances and the score.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is brilliant as the schizophrenic homeless man. He manages to be convincing as man who, even down on his luck, finds happiness as he loses himself in music.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. proves again that he is a great actor who can flawlessly portray a troubled, dramatic character. <br/><br/>The musical score of the movie is like a cheat. For me at least, being a lover of classical music, the score sold the movie completely. The tracks are perfectly chosen for each scene, transmitting feelings of happiness, despair, friendship and love in a way that no other genre of music ever can.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for everybody, but especially any lover of classical music."

And to think that he almost completely went off the (acting/movie) radar ... Luckily he didn't and luckily for us, Jon Favreau got him back to the big game with Iron Man.

","First thing, let's get out of the way the alleged genius of Jamie Foxx. This is the second time we see Foxx playing a gifted musician with an affliction. As Ray (Charles), Foxx was barely adequate. Here, as the mentally challenged Nathaniel Ayers, he is almost just annoying. Foxx makes the movie frustrating by engendering not one iota of caring or sympathy for his character. He also has virtually no chemistry at all with his co-star, Robert Downey, Jr.<br/><br/>Downey, Jr. does a fine job with the character of Steve Lopez, a newsman trying to help Foxx, while using him in a series of articles. Downey steals every scene he is in, which is no small feat, as he is not the 'extraordinary' character here. Alas, Downey cannot carry this picture alone. And, since there is no real progress in Nathaniel Ayers' life or condition, the movie drags and depresses.<br/><br/>Adding to the depression is the long graphic looks at the plight of LA's homeless, with the unspoken caveat that their lot will not improve either. Here, we are slumming, as Downey is, but with less incentive to do so. Oddly, if perhaps metaphorically, the director has Downey fall in urine twice during the movie! All in all, without any explanation of schizophrenia, without any information as to how Ayers developed it, and without any upbeat tales of Ayers' overcoming (or just contending with) it, the movie is just one long not too convincing diatribe on the lot of the homeless.<br/><br/>Downey makes this picture tolerable. It is worth a look, if only for his performance."

","It's a pretty neat title, ""The Soloist."" Jamie Foxx is a homeless schizophrenic on the streets of Los Angeles who happens to be (or once have been) a brilliant musician. Now, a mentally ill bum, he plays a violin with only two strings on the sidewalk -- an instrumental soloist. And schizophrenics don't form any social bonds to speak of. They live in what some psychiatrists have called ""the schizophrenic no society."" They're social soloists too.<br/><br/>A few years ago there appeared a movie about a young woman who is a dance instructor and finds a terpsichorean genius on the street. It turned out he could do MTV riffs and the moonwalk like nobody's business and this was celebrated as a talent that led to his apotheosis on television. I was afraid this would run along the same dismal gutter.<br/><br/>Nope. It's derived from Steve Lopez's (Robert Downey Jr.'s) no-doubt slightly polished book about his discovery of Nathanial Ayers, the challenges the two of them face, and their finally settling into a life style that is satisfactory in the way that most human adaptations are -- incomplete but (shrug) okay.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a scene of four people sitting in an auditorium listening to music -- Foxx and his sister (Lisagay Hamilton), and Downey and his friend and colleague (Catherine Keener). Foxx's eyes glow with pleasure but he's still psychotic and he's dressed something like Apollo Creed before the championship bout in ""Rocky."" In reality, there may have been scenes like that but I doubt they were common. A widely-read columnist at the LA Times is unlikely to spend much time with a schizophrenic who lives in a shelter. Not because of any prejudice but simply because of the absence of many shared interests.<br/><br/>The film presents itself as the story of Downey, mostly, who first sees Foxx as not much more than an interesting column in his paper. After all, the guy was a student at the Julliard School of Music, which wouldn't look bad on anybody's resume. I mean, Miles Davis went there too. Downey tries to promote some healthier adaptive styles in Foxx. He gets him a cello, for instance, and tries to install him in an apartment. Foxx considers Downey his ""God"" but then rebels and throws Downey around bodily. Then they shake hands and go to the concert. An epilogue tells us that Foxx's character still lives in the shelter but now plays many different instruments. You don't just shake off schizophrenia as if it were a bout of influenza.<br/><br/>The performances are decent. Downey isn't shown as especially tender-minded towards Foxx. He's matter-of-fact, sometimes comic, sometimes fed up. Foxx does what he can with the role and it's not bad as written. Foxx has features that are brutal but hint at the sensitivity beneath, or the other way round. Keener has a face that seems made for the camera. If her cheeks were any higher they'd be eyebrows. And her throaty giggle is coarse and compelling. Nelsan Ellis plays the young supervisor at LAMP, the homeless shelter, but he paints an extremely satisfying portrait of a man who is resigned, practical, and understanding. He's not written or played as some kind of saint of the streets either. That's one of the nice things about the film. Nobody's perfect. The supervisor disagrees with Downey's desire to get Foxx doped up. ""We can't COHERSE him into taking drugs,"" he says mildly, getting the verb wrong. It's obviously a word he learned from pamphlets about the responsibilities of the job. The guy is perceptive but he's not an educated or articulate man.<br/><br/>Above all, there is Beethoven's semi-divine music, and there's nothing pompous about the way it's presented. In one scene, his first chance at playing a cello in many years, Foxx's eyes close dreamily as he saws slowly away at the piece, all by himself, the rough notes apparently spelling out no melody. Then we hear the full orchestra inside Foxx's head as it gradually swells and Foxx's solitary strings melt into the more general. There's a visual trick to show us what Foxx sees when he hears music, and it looks like what might show up on your monitor if you use Windows Media Player with a CD.<br/><br/>Not that you're pounded over the head with the music. If you want to hear snatches of the life-affirming chorus from Beethoven's ninth symphony, you'll have to listen to tooth paste commercials on TV. The selections we hear are subdued and thoughtful. There are also pop songs and ""May the Circle Be Unbroken."" All in all, if you're patient, if your mind is open, if you're not expecting a lot of fireworks from either the story or the director's way of showing it, this ought to slowly gather you in."

","The Soloist disappointed me in many ways. The performances are not a problem, Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are both absolutely tremendous, but the movie itself is good at best. When this 1st arrived on the scene, I think a lot of people expected awards and nominations for best actor for both, but in the end it really didn't live up to the high expectations it had for itself. The main problem with The Soloist for me was it felt too cold a lot of the time. As much of the pain I felt for Nathaniel|Foxx| I had a lot of trouble warming up to him, and despite the fact that Steve Lopez|Downey| changes a bit neat the end, I also questioned his motives many times. I was also a bit frustrated that I didn't get all the background info I wanted for Nathaniel. I wanted to learn more, I desired more, and I suppose I shouldn't gripe too much but I wanted more with that. This movie is good, but if it didn't have the performances of Downey Jr. and Foxx, I truly believe this would be above average at best.<br/><br/>Performances. Jamie Foxx is one of the best working actors in Hollywood today, and he can chalk up another brilliant performance here. His ticks that he had, the little nervous rambles, the way he looked it was just amazing. My only complaint was I felt a little cold by his character sometimes. Robert Downey Jr. is great here. His suave characteristics and his charisma are hard to match these days, and once again gave an engaging show.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Soloist was a good, but underwhelming film in my opinion. It tries so hard to be Oscar worthy, that I think it tried too hard at times. It's well worth a viewing, but don't expect an Oscar worthy show.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The Soloist was a movie I had an inkling I would really like. And, as it turned out, I did. This was in no small part to the great performances the two leads, Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. Of course, the direction by Joe Wright (Atonement) was wonderful.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Downey plays New York Times columnist, Steve Lopez, who in the search for a juicy story, comes across a homeless guy (Jamie Foxx) playing a violin in the park. The guy tells him that his name is Nathaniel Ayers and he used to be in Juliard. Lopez sees the possibility of a juicy story and decides to follow it up. Over the next few months, the movie traces how their relationship grows from merely one of a reporter and his subject to that of two men genuinely growing to be friends and caring for each other. Lopez, though always uncomfortable at Ayers placing too much of trust and affection in him, realizes that he too cares for him and tries all he can to help him out.<br/><br/>What marks the movie out are the way Foxx's characters dementia is handled and shown, as well as the bond between the two men. It seems so rare these days in Hollywood to see a true story of friendship and love between two guys in a totally non-Brokeback way. One of the few I do remember is that modern classic, The Shawshank Redemption. In the end, the movie is honest in portraying Ayer's condition, but at the same time, hopeful of the changes that love and friendship can bring about."

","'The Soloist' came as a pleasant surprise. For some reason, I thought it was an action film but what it turned out to be is a moving human drama. I love movies about unusual friendship and this one is based on the true story of an L.A. columnist, Goerge Lopez, and a homeless schizophrenic but talented musician, Nathaniel Ayres. Joe Wright does a splendid job as director. With stunning cinematography, he gives raw glimpses of the L.A. streets and the alleys where the homeless, addicts and criminals reside. He avoids sugarcoating the story and mainly stays focused on the two friends. Lopez is in search of an original story and his lackluster attempts just get him more frustrated until one day he suddenly hears a beautiful piece of music played on violin by a homeless man. George's encounter with Nathaniel inspires him to write Ayres's story which gradually touches the lives of many. We also see the growth of a beautiful friendship and this affects George as he becomes determined to help treat Ayres but when his attempts fail, he is frustrated with himself for not being able to do anything. I loved the soundtrack, especially the pieces played by Ayres. Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx deliver very natural performances by playing their parts with utmost conviction. Catherine Keener too does an equally standout job. The only flaw to me was the ending which I felt was a little too rushed. 'The Soloist' is an impressive study of character and I'm glad that it did not turn out to be an action film but instead something bigger and richer."

","As I'm listening to the reporter spell the schizophrenic's name to the nurse, I'm thinking, ""This is just like Mr. Ayer's spelling his name to the reporter."" This was a continuing thought as we progressed through the movie....the similarities between the life of the insane and the sane.<br/><br/>I learned so much about mental illness. The explanation that the schizophrenic's synapses get his thoughts mixed up in his auditory system was quite revealing. But then, what causes the 'voices' that dictate murderous actions? How much poetic license was taken in this excellent movie? The burning car early on in this boy's life made me think that he was hallucinating then. Allowing the homeless to take part in the movie was great. This was a wonderful way to bring insight into the minds of some of the homeless. Each one has his own story. I sometimes volunteer at the ARlington Street church in Boston, serving meals. The conversations I have with their clients are much like the conversations I have at work with my fellow software engineers. ""But you're seeing them on their meds"", says an old hand. Why wouldn't a sick person take those meds? The homeless lady gave us the reason: ""Those voices comfort me. On my meds, I don't hear them."" A fantastic movie and a great plug for Los Angeles. To think that someone could be so claustrophobic that being inside a house would freak them out is a revelation to someone (cest moi) who considers herself claustrophobic. The comment by the mental health worker, ""There is no such thing as insanity"" really jibes with Dr. Laing's opinion that insanity is a culturally defined condition. But how do you deal with the violence-producing convictions brought on by paranoia, as we saw Mr. Ayers turn on both the reporter and the cello teacher at the 'recital'? It's hard to think that an intelligent, sensitive man such as that cello teacher wouldn't know enough NOT to bring in religion, which for many of us has nothing but negative connotations because of the evil effect perversions of Christianity in our early life in Alabama had on us. This just brings out the fact that everyone of us saw a different movie, as we traveled both men's journey, and experienced the sensitivity of the insane soloist and the insensitivity of the sane reporter.<br/><br/>The acting by both Foxx and the actor who played the reporter deserve Oscar nominations, if quality of acting rather than superior publicity machinations is more valued this year. What is so chilling is that for about $16,000 a person, we could get this problem solved, but then we'd have to truly be a compassionate nation, instead of pretending we are, wouldn't we?"

I haven't seen a movie about music for a while, especially about classical music so I decided to give this film a try. And the story follows the simple formula of a chance encounter changes a man's life. But this film just drags and drags to the point you feel like falling asleep, what they did was take a simple story and made it run longer than it should have. Cause you could simply tell the creators was running out of ideas, cause it didn't go anywhere. Just a white man constantly trying to a help a black man, but the black man is ungrateful cause he hits the black man for trying to help him although black man says stuff along the lines of loving him even if he has schizophrenia. Even if this is based on a true story, it is very difficult to buy into Robert Downey Jr's character and why he is trying so hard to help Jamie Foxx's character.

","If there were ever any doubt that Robert Downey Jr. is one of our best current actors out there, then this film should put them to rest. Still having doubts? Check out his more current resume: KISS KISS BANG BANG, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, IRON MAN, and his amazing TROPIC THUNDER. And these are just a select few that I've cherry picked. This isn't to say that Jamie Foxx (DREAMGIRLS) didn't do a great job. It's just that Downey Jr. is showing up in some awfully great roles and performing them to perfection, as witnessed here in THE SOLOIST.<br/><br/>This is a story close to my heart. Similar in theme to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL, this story doesn't circle around a town coming together to help one man's psyche. This story is about two men who orbit in entirely different galaxies and how a passing swipe ends up creating a lifetime friendship. Yes, there's the mental illness aspect to it and Foxx plays the role of Nathaniel Ayers exceptionally well. His schizophrenia is obvious, and living on the streets hasn't helped. And when newspaper reporter Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) tries finding a story to write about, he stumbles upon Nathaniel's past as a Juilliard Music School drop-out. Nathaniel plays a violin with only two strings, and as Steve Lopez writes about his newfound friend in the paper, a donation comes floating in: a beautiful cello.<br/><br/>This cello has multiple draws for Nathaniel, and some of them aren't good. The positives are that Nathaniel can play a beautiful instrument beautifully. And that he finally starts forming a friendly tie with someone (anyone!) It just happens to be Steve Lopez. Steve starts showing him around the current musical scene. But with Nathaniel's reawakening comes the remembrance of his past and how he got to where he is. His mental breakdown comes crashing back into current memory, even as Steve, his new friend, tries to help him out more and more.<br/><br/>The side-story of Steve and his wife's reconciliation (Catherine Keener, AN American CRIME) is pretty much fluff for the movie/story and doesn't add much. It is the touching and powerful story of a friendship forming amidst a respect for one another, a love of music, and facing the challenges of an oft-times debilitating mental illness that drives this wonderful film.<br/><br/>And the music ain't too shabby either."

A child prodigy of cello, Ayers seemed like a musical miracle waiting to ascend the starlit skies. Accepted to Juilliard and ready to take on the world, he is instead struck down by an imbalanced mind. Steve Lopez, the writer for Los Angeles Times just stumbles on Mr Ayers one fine afternoon and a friendship which empowers both of these opposites of society unfolds. Foxx has shown time and again that his talent in acting is no fluke. This is another film in which he literally embodies the character. Based on a true story."

","This movie has two of my favorite actors playing the two primary roles. So I would have found it interesting no matter what else it may have had. But I am also a musician, and fact-based stories about musicians always grab me and hold on.<br/><br/>Instead of a blockbuster movie this could well have simply been made into a documentary, using the real homeless musician and the real LA Times reporter who brought his situation to the attention of the rest of the world. Since they chose to make a movie with actors I suppose there is a fair amount of dramatization added to the bare facts. In a short DVD extra where the musician and the reporter speak, they each seem a lot more ""normal"" that was portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed it greatly. Jamie Foxx is Nathaniel Ayers, formerly in the 1970s at Juliard, but he left in his second year. He has become homeless, living where he can, and playing music on an old violin with only two strings.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is LA Times reporter Steve Lopez who appears to be running low on good story ideas. When he happens to encounter this man, playing a 2-stringed violin, he decides it would make a good story. At this point he had no care for the man, just for himself. However as he found out more, and got to know the man he began to take a more personal interest.<br/><br/>Good movie, and much more complex characters than it first seems. Foxx is superb, in another award-quality performance."

","THE SOLOIST is a difficult film to review. First, the subject matter: a newspaper writer of a human interest column for the LA Times, with personal problems of his own, encounters a schizophrenic homeless man who spends his days playing classical music on a two string violin and provides fodder for a new human interest column - an accidental encounter that develops into a friendship and challenge and some semblance of change in the personalities of both men. Second, the cast: performances by Jamie Foxx as the gifted homeless Julliard trained cellist Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled and frustrated but kind hearted writer Steve Lopez turn in very fine and credible performances. Third, the message: calling attention to the plight of the homeless and their need for simple acts of kindness is well portrayed. Fourth, the music that serves as a character in the film: the cello solos are played with grace and style by LA Phil cellist Ben Hong and the LA Philharmonic as conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and present in the background and on the screen with in the grandeur of Disney Hall create as solid a film score as possible. Fifth, the supporting cast: with Catherine Keener in a thankless role as Lopez' boss and ex-wife, Marcos De Silvas as LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Tom Hollander as a cello instructor make the best of the poorly developed roles they are given. <br/><br/>So what goes wrong here? For this viewer the problems lie with the screenplay by Susannah Grant, an acceptable adaptation of Steve Lopez' novel, but so loaded with LA Times promo and info and mawkish sentimentality that the story all but drowns. Director Joe Wright seems to take the stance of letting the story flow on its own, the only relief being the use of flashbacks that attempt to explain the mental and physical state of Nathaniel Ayers. This is a film that longs to be loved, but in the end it is only a passable human interest story. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"hobbes3","9","0","0","8 August 2009"," What happened??
","The Soloist is a beautifully crafted film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. is, as always, wonderful as LA Times columnist Steve Lopez. There is something about his own well worn face and expressive eyes that imbues his portrayal with a truth that another actor would not have been able to bring. The script does not gloss over Lopez's flaws and turn him into a refugee from a TV Movie of the Week, and all of those flaws are visible thanks to RDJ's performance.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, in my humble opinion, proves that ""Ray"" was not a fluke of casting. Even more than his nearly note-perfect portrayal of Ray Charles, his Nathaniel Ayers, Jr. says this man is a truly multi-faceted actor. (Frankly I hope more people see The Soloist and reach that conclusion. It might help his next scheduled release ""Law Abiding Citizen."")<br/><br/>I think in the hands of director without the deft touch of Joe Wright, this could have been heavy handed, treacly, feel-good pap. Despite the fact that this is a true story, the audience is allowed to go on Lopez's journey with him. Nobody's holding up flashcards and telling the viewer what to feel next.<br/><br/>Here's what I want to know: What the h*ll happened to this film's marketing campaign? (or should I say the lack thereof). It was pushed back twice and finally released in April of this year w/almost no press and was quickly forgotten. That usually means it's crap. In fact, it sends the message that it's crap. I've heard rumblings that the scheduled release last fall (which would have put it in awards contention)was nixed because of the country's economic downturn, and who wants to see a movie about homeless people? Are we really that fragile? This movie deserves to be in awards contention,probably at least as much, if not more than some that were.<br/><br/>The argument could be made that with the expansion of the Best Picture category to ten slots that it has a better chance this year. The April release date, however, is probably still a handicap. And it would be a damn shame if this were overlooked. Foxx, Downey,Jr. and Wright all deserve consideration."

","The Soloist is a decent movie, but it has one huge flaw. It tries way too much to win an Oscar. Someone should tell the director that heartstrings cannot be pulled by force.<br/><br/>There are two main reasons I wanted to check out this film, called Jamie and Robert. The two dudes give good performances, but I wouldn't expect nothing less from these guys. The problem was the narrative and the way it was presented.<br/><br/>There can only be so many classical music montages before they start to get old fast. Insert some doves in the mix, and you are fast treading into the corn territory. Additionally, I was interested in the contemporary versions of the characters, and when the movie suddenly started to throw lame flashbacks of the young Nathaniel in my face, I was underwhelmed.<br/><br/>All in all, as dramas go, there are many worse movies out there. However, I can't seem to shake the feeling of lost potential. This could have been a great piece of cinema with some minor changes. Heck, it probably still is for many people, just not me.<br/><br/>And hey, I recognized Esa-Pekka Salonen as the conductor of the orchestra scenes. Finland represent!"

","Got a chance to see the Soloist the other night. It wasn't something I planned on watching. In greater Raleigh, there is still a $1.50 theater, one of those grand places where you can catch a cheap flick on the big screen. The group I was with picked The Soloist as the film to see, and I was fine with paying $1.50. I had heard some not-so-good reviews of the film. Some said it had no point. Some said the thought the movie had no hope at the end. I found that I enjoyed the film and totally ""got it."" I thought this film showed in a concrete way that you can't force someone to change unless they are ready.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story, and it's believable. Steve Lopez (Robert Downy, Jr in another great role) is a cynical journalist. He knows how to find the good story out of the most mundane circumstances. He isn't above interviewing anyone if it means he will get some readers to enjoy his column. He makes a personal bike accident sound thoughtful and provoking, as he rhapsodizes about the state of a neighborhood hospital.<br/><br/>One day he comes upon Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) , who is homeless and rambles when he talks. Yet he tells Lopez that he used to attend Julliard. After checking out his story, Lopez takes a special interest in Ayers and decides he would make a good human interest piece. Lopez interviews him and listens to him play, but it's all word related---at first. Then he starts to get involved in Ayer's life, and he begins to take a genuine interest in Ayers. Lopez sees the talent in Ayers and he wants to see that talent get used. Here is where I think the movie flopped in most people's eyes.<br/><br/>We all love an underdog story. We want to see that homeless person defeat all of his monsters and settle down in a nice, normal life. Lopez wants him in an apartment, possibly giving concerts and sharing his music with the world. And if he (Lopez) gets some of the credit for bring this talent to light, well that's quite all right with him. In the traditional film, Ayers would have pulled himself up by his bootstraps and live happily ever after. We like that.<br/><br/>What happens instead is much more realistic and true. I won't spoil the ending for you, but we don't get the happily ever after ending. We do see hope in this film, and a life is changed, but I would argue that the life most changed is Lopez himself. He's the typical cynical, hardworking journalist. He's worked hard all of his life and managed to push all of his meaningful relationships away. Robert Downy, Jr. is the right combination of rugged, cynical, selfish, and flawed to play this role. Jamie Foxx gives a great performance as a mentally ill man with demons in his past and a child's heart. When he listens to music, his eyes shine and we want to feel what he is feeling.<br/><br/>Besides the acting, the most notable thing about this film is its portrait of the homeless community. Lopez tells Ayers if he wants to play the cello that a reader donated, he will have to play in the homeless shelter. Ayers is terrified to go down there. To get to the shelter, you have to dodge drug dealers, panhandlers, prostitutes, and more. The shelter itself is run by a kindly man (Nelsan Ellis) who sees through Lopez's ""good deeds"" to his conditional love for Ayers. There are some beautiful scenes that take place in this shelter where Ayers plays his cello for the homeless residents. And it's like a soothing balm.<br/><br/>I have been to feed the homeless events, and I saw the faces of the people I had fed as I watched this film. Sometimes it's hard for us to understand why many homeless don't take advantage of the services available to them. I think this film shows that it's not always easy to get to those places, first of all, and even when you arrive, there is often mental illness that stops people from getting the help they need.<br/><br/>I recommend this film. It's well worth a rental."

","When you pick a movie I hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society. When a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do I want to support that behavior)? In this case Mr. Foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. Mr. Foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from. Saying sorry does not get him off the hook. It will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. No longer see anything they are part of.

"bob the moo","Null","1","2","17 February 2010"," A solid and engaging film in the main that only hurts itself when it does give way to sentimentality (although this is not too often)
","When it came out in the UK (which was sometime after it came out in the US) there was still some lingering talk of Oscars which is sort of par for the course in any film where a famous actor is playing a character with a mental illness etc. As it transpired, the film wasn't there when the names were called and in some areas (acting) I think that is a shame because while the film has its problems it is actually a very engaging piece. The plot follows a journalist (Steve Lopez) as he finds a homeless man (Nathaniel Ayers) playing violin on the street with a skill far in excess of that which his appearance would suggest him capable of. As he tries to help this man and get a story out of it, Lopez finds out more about the plight of the homeless in LA.<br/><br/>The film never quite becomes as smug and curt as my potted plot summary makes it sound but I will say that there is an atmosphere of hand-wringing to the film that it never totally loses – it is not overpowering but it is in the air and you never forget it is there for very long. This manifests itself in the nature of the telling as we very much have Lopez as the main character but it also comes from the unnecessary excesses when it comes to the wider issues of homelessness. This is most evident in the terrible clips over the end credits (talk about overegging the cake) but it is also in the main film when it goes all hand-wringing over ""what's to be done"" and also visually and audibly gushes over the healing power of music. It is a shame because otherwise the film does maintain a fairly even keel and manages something close to restraint, particularly when the scenes are squarely in the hands of the lead two actors – scenes where director Wright actually does well to be as matter-of-fact as he is.<br/><br/>Ignoring the liberties taken with the fact (which will not even occur to most casual viewers – myself included) we actually have a very solid story in this odd relationship. The characters are not excessively polished and nor are the performances pushed out in the hope of an award. Credit to Jamie Foxx because this is the sort of thing where it could all be played out over soft music and where there could have been several ""big"" scenes where the Oscar clip is in the mind. On the contrary, Foxx is restrained and convincing and you feel for his character all the more for it, he doesn't have one ""big"" scene where everything is laid out but both he and the film are better for it. Downey benefits from the material not leaving Lopez as either a blank plot device or as some sort of saint, rather his motives are always questionable and his ability to do anything is not exaggerated. This gives Downey more to play with and he does very well with it – again he is never showy or give ""one big moment"" but he is consistently good and he works very well with Foxx. Keener has a small role without too much to do (but still manages to be a quality presence as ever) while Hollander and Hamilton are both good but also rather odd finds for viewers of The Thick of It and True Blood respectively.<br/><br/>Overall The Soloist ironically may have been more successful had it really turned up the sentimental music and gone the whole weepy route, but it would have been a lesser film. As it is, it is not perfect and does give way to sweeping generalisations and slight sentimentality when it comes to the music and the wider issues, but in the main story it is sturdy, reliable and quite emotionally balanced. It is also helped a great deal that both Foxx and Downey are happy with this approach and pitch their engaging performances accordingly. Not a brilliant film but certainly one worth seeing."
"ShrinkSteve","9","1","2","12 February 2010"," Delicate and brilliant portrayal of Schizophrenia...
","As a psychiatrist, and a person who has spent his career working directly with individuals with severe persistent mental illness, I found Jaime Foxx's portrayal of Nathaniel Ayers, a Julliard drop-out struggling with life on the streets of Los Angeles, and with schizophrenia, to be nothing short of brilliant. Mr. Foxx opened a window into the complexity of this fascinating but troubling disorder, while leaving Mr. Ayers', and by association, all those afflicted with schizophrenia's, dignity intact. In some ways he even elevated these ""lost"" members of our society to a much more human status than they are often given by the media and Hollywood. Robert Downy Jr.'s character, the columnist Steve Lopez, is also brilliantly played. His struggle with his own fallibility, and his self-doubt that has obviously grown from past failures, is palpable, but subtly presented so that he does not appear a tragic character, but a real man struggling with commitment and fearing his own inability to meet the expectations of others. Watching him re-attach to others out of necessity at first, then out of a love for Mr. Ayers, was redemptive and hopeful, and sent a message that needs to be heard by men all over! My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that psychiatry's role is somewhat belittled in this telling of the real life story of Nathaniel Ayers. While there are reasons enough to be suspicious of my profession, it doesn't help when psychiatrists are treated as outsiders in the lives of their patients. (Fortunately, this movie did not take the path of making psychiatrists appear sinister, as is often the case in Hollywood fare.) In conclusion, I can say only thank you Jaime Foxx, Robert Downey Jr., Steve Lopez, Susannah Grant, Joe Wright, and most of all, Nathaniel Ayers, for letting us see into your world and for helping us understand!"

Nathaniel tells him he is a Julliard drop out, and Steve sees an opportunity to turn this into a story. He tracks him down and asks him more questions and when the first column comes out, a reader sends Nathaniel a cello, which is what he originally played. Steve gives him the cello and it leads to him trying to help Nathaniel get off the streets and get him involved with the local sympathy.<br/><br/>Foxx and Downey were good.

","Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters because it was in and out very quickly. I finally got a chance to see this, a couple of nights ago and I was thoroughly impressed. Jamie Foxx (who plays Nathaniel Ayers) and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Steve Lopez) are not my favorite actors, but both fit their roles very well. They have excellent chemistry, and I deeply care for their characters. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed how the film depicted schizophrenia. It isn't shown, as something the character understands like with Russell Crowe's character in ""A Beautiful Mind"", but rather a dark, mysterious presence that drives Nathaniel into violent mood swings and actions. It's hard to depict in film on what's going on in someone's mind, but the randomness and unpredictability of Nathaniel makes it unique. Though the movie's focus is on Nathaniel, our sympathy lies on Steve, as he at first sees Nathaniel as a source for helping his career, but later ends up caring for him as a friend. He has his limits and at times loses it, but it is something we can relate to, trying to aid someone in whom you don't know how to help and then lose patience due to that.<br/><br/>Aiding in the performances is some very beautiful cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (who helped Joe Wright with ""Atonement""). His choice of colors, lighting, and camera angles add a dark and abstract feeling to the film, which reflects the mind of Nathaniel. The film also has beautiful/authentic looking sets and crisp clean editing and Dario Marianelli's choice of music is mainly pieces of classical music, but like the cinematography, it reflects the mood and emotions of Nathaniel as well as the story.<br/><br/>We've seen this plot many times, as of the likes in ""Rain Man"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", in which the Oscars love to bait, but ""The Soloist"" is unique and different. It isn't syrupy or over-dramatic. It is a rock solid drama that is both enjoyable to watch and grabs your emotions. It also sheds light on one of this country's biggest problems, the injustice of the homeless. And I'm disappointed that this film hasn't received any golden globe noms and it will be unlikely to be nominated for something for the 2010 Oscars. <br/><br/>Though I enjoy this movie, the film ended too quickly and I felt it could have explained more about Nathaniel's condition. Yes, I love the technical aspects on how it reflects his mood with the cinematography and music, but it needed more plot to explain how he got it and how it affected his family. We know how it has affected him, but it doesn't show a whole lot of the damage it has caused the people around him, which have forced him to live on the streets of L.A. <br/><br/>Despite this small gap in the story, I consider ""The Soloist"" as one of this year's best films. I haven't seen too many spectacular ones this year, but this one is very good. <br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

I agree with earlier comment that there was sometimes too much dwelling and focus on the Downey rather than fox character.

","When movies address the supposed nobility of humanity (a fiction created by humans) we've got to look past the uplifting orchestration to the deep background on what is actually being sold.<br/><br/>With THE SOLOIST, we don't have to look too deep. It's the story of Los Angeles newspaper columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr), finding a story in a homeless Julliard-trained cellist, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx, foregoing smoothness on the outside for smoothness on the inside). Set in 2005 and based loosely on two real life characters, I kept wondering why Lopez insisted on trying to help Nathaniel off the streets and into a shelter, against Nathaniel's recalcitrance and downright ungratefulness at times.<br/><br/>Hmm, let's see: Lopez is a newspaper columnist. What could he possibly want? <br/><br/>Lopez discovers the homeless, scatter-brained Nathaniel near a Beethoven statue; later hears him playing violin and strikes up an uneasy acquaintance with him. He researches Nathaniel's tall tales of Julliard attendance, tracks down Nathaniel's family and writes about him in his daily column, whereupon a kind old lady bequeaths Nathaniel a cello.<br/><br/>Lopez continues to push himself onto Nathaniel and eventually gets him off the streets and into a homeless shelter called LAMP (Los Angeles Men's Project), situated one door down from Hell in Downtown Los Angeles. Skid Row, utter squalor, black people in aimless droves, smoking crack on the streets, fighting, sex, deaths... <br/><br/>Questions are raised as to how far Lopez can intrude on Nathaniel's life to ostensibly ""help"" him. <br/><br/>And we keep wondering: Just what is in it for Lopez?...<br/><br/>Downey is on top of his game, as if Foxx, but his cello miming leaves a lot to be desired - for portraying someone who is supposedly a virtuoso at the instrument. He doesn't do enough vibrato. (A violinist once told me, ""Just TRY and stop a string player doing vibrato!"") <br/><br/>Lopez wangles Nathaniel into attending a performance of the L.A. Philharmonic (with Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting, no less). And Nathaniel's listening experience is portrayed as euphoric explosive mind-colors - but - <br/><br/>How dare the filmmakers presume to show us how Nathaniel perceived the music? He was a schizoid personality whom Lopez battled constantly to keep focused. Nathaniel is portrayed as an overlooked genius purely for dramatic purposes. But he is not. He was not denied his time in the spotlight. He was a little crazy to begin with; he had his shot and he shunned it. Just because he happens to play a supposedly ""noble"" instrument doesn't mean he can't be as off-kilter as C.C. DeVille, the drug-addled guitarist of Poison, who is a great technician on his instrument, but batshit crazy nonetheless.<br/><br/>We discover Nathaniel needs meds to keep those Crazy Fluids in check. But he was never a ""genius."" How can I be so sure? Besides the inane babbling, moody indecision, and ragged unreliability portrayed by Jamie Foxx, we meet Nathaniel Ayers himself in the DVD Special Features.<br/><br/>While the real life Lopez and Ayers chat together, Ayers breaks into a Beethoven cello passage. Now, it may be his mental condition that keeps him from the recording studio or joining an orchestra, but it may also be that he's not very good. His technique is definitely that of a string player (he has that vibrato that Foxx lacks) but there are many, many notes that are quite, quite flat. And all the while, Lopez commends him on how grand he sounds! Which leads us to another surmise: that Ayers relishes his small pond (where he is a legend to his kennel-crazy fellows) and doesn't want to risk leaving it for a stab at responsibility, studied rehearsal, and getting lost amongst other mediocre players who don't regard him as King Pompous Ass.<br/><br/>So shuck off that whitey guilt that was creeping up yo spine. Nathaniel didn't end up homeless due to extreme bad luck; his own ""inner demons"" put him there. (Love dat ""inner demon"" euphemism bullshit - means we don't have to diagnose further or identify solutions.) <br/><br/>And we discover this film is ""from the book by Steve Lopez."" And all motivation comes clear. After his newspaper columns, Lopez scored a BOOK DEAL! <br/><br/>There are people in this world who genuinely seek to help others - news columnists are not those people. Steve Lopez's relationship with Nathaniel was similar to Truman Capote's with Perry Smith when he wrote In Cold Blood - academia curdling against humanity, friendship mixing uneasily with exploitation.<br/><br/>So though the filmmakers THINK their movie is focused on humanity's ""nobility,"" we realize that with Nathaniel still on the real life streets even after Lopez's publishing deal and this A-List movie - it is really about humanity's IGNOBILITY.<br/><br/>Lopez wraps the film: ""His mental condition and his wellbeing are as precarious now as when we first met."" Doesn't matter too much now - Lopez scored a book deal - every writer's dream. And I'm pretty sure Nathaniel isn't getting any residual points on it...<br/><br/>Nathaniel Ayers is not a genius in any sense of the word. Still, in Hollywood, you don't have to be a genius to make it - just have a story worth telling.<br/><br/>And that's something that Nathanial Ayers has in spades. Steve Lopez says so in his book.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","Steve Lopez is not the kind of hero Hollywood bores us with. He's a jerky loner who doesn't care for anybody and, let's face it, he's not a very good guy. He sticks to poor Nathaniel Ayers ""Jr."" just or mainly because he needs an article, then it's a few, when he gets his prize with all the rich & famous people around him we can see he cares little for him. But then again, who does? He did more for one lost sheep than most of us did in our lives. If his intentions are not very angelic, he wants to ""get rid of"" him many times, even once yells in front of the mental asylum inmates: ""I've got a job to do!!"" when he gets exasperated. Very comprehensible, for this film shows without wanting to how difficult it must be to deal with one schizophrenic. The best phrase is Katherine Keener's: ""You can't cure him. But you can be his friend, and be around"". A real shrink. And probably the most beautifully emphatic woman in her forties there is :)! <br/><br/>What they can show of poverty in LA is quite interesting given the idealization we foreigners have of ""the US"". The end credits stating it's 90.000 of them is also startling. Here in Lat Am, and probably in the rest of the third world things are far worse. There wouldn't be state/ ONGs delivering warm food every day, nor a nice mental health facility with cool knowledgeable personnel, and no, the major wouldn't show up to give 50 million dollars... If I am allowed to digress, the day we as a society cared for the 90 thousand other homeless, and not for ""the one that went to Julliard and at least was a genius"", then we'd be able to look ourselves in the mirror, so to speak. Music is important, but I expected a bit more. And not so much Beethoven! I liked Pekka-Salonen being in the movie, albeit briefly. I'd liked to know a bit more, how did he come to be a drifter from his Julliard past. We only get to see him suffering at one rehearsal, and attacking his mum. For a 120 minutes film, I'd have liked to know why the authorities didn't ""spot"" him as being mentally sick, instead of letting him basically die in the streets (I was about to throw a pun about the American health system, but I'll refrain :)). I'd like to know a bit more about the sister, how didn't she do much either. She must be on this film for about ... less than one minute.<br/><br/>Read Tom Murray on IMDb, he wrote a great critic because he's got experience treating this patients. Not having those credentials, I nevertheless understand what he says about the ""chaos"", jarring music, visuals, etc, is intentional, part of the effort of the film to make us ""be into"" a schizophrenic's head. At least a glimpse of it. At that it succeeds, much more than other films. I am thinking of Canvas (2006) with Marcia Gay Harden and others, which looks like a ""for dummies"" book compared to this one, that wouldn't be the DSM IV but maybe an abridged Kaplan, if you know what I mean :)."

","Journalist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr) happens upon down-and-out Nathaniel Ayres (Jamie Foxx) and discovers he is a superb cellist who has dropped out of society due to schizophrenia.

Downey plays the Cruise role of someone who starts off as, essentially, an unlikeable man with only his own interests at heart, but who becomes a more compassionate and caring person as a matter of necessity. Foxx plays the Hoffman role of someone who (ironically) would have been referred to by Downey's Tropic Thunder character as ""full retard."" The story is always interesting, although it is a little unsatisfying in that there is no formal resolution - a closing voice-over and titles inform us that Nathaniel is still just as mentally precarious as ever.<br/><br/>This is Downey's film - the Lopez character has a satisfying development arc. Conversely, while Foxx does well in delivering Nathaniel's speech patterns and sometimes there, sometimes not attitudes, the character doesn't change and is difficult to feel sympathy for.<br/><br/>And that is a flaw which lies at the heart of this movie.

","The Soloist is a good film with two strong performances. But something about it rubbed me the wrong way. It has to do a little bit with Jamie Fox's character. I got a little creeped out about his Scitzefernia. I know I sound a bit like an as*hole but the Scitzefernia with Jamie Fox was disturbing. Other than that, I thought the Soloist was a good film. It was originally predicted to be an Oscar nominated film, now that's far from it. I don't think the film would get nominated anyways. I had another problem with The Soloist. Jamie Fox played Ray Charles back in 2004. Now he's playing a Scitzefernic hobo musician. I think Jamie Fox wanted to be in this film so then he could get a nomination. To me, the best performance in the film is from Robert Downey Jr., who made a comeback with Iron Man and is sure to be back. I don't think The soloist has a chance of being nominated, but if it were, I think that Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Fox deserve a bit of something. Some may be disappointed, others may be overjoyed. I give The Soloist a thumbs up, though it goes a bit too much into the Scitzefernia and Jamie Fox may be trying to get another Oscar.

","And yet we have one more in a growing series of mediocre movies with lots of hype before release to get the public all excited (usually for naught). What is it with Hollywood and the drivel coming out with another not-very-interesting movie? Yet, the actual story about Ayers, and even Lopez, is interesting. Too bad that this movie did not, or could not, convey their story better. Or maybe this movie did portray exactly how the relationship was/is: Boring. But what got me, and is bothering me more and more, is the fact that actors are mumbling more and more. Downey has always been a fast talker, and mumbler, and Foxx, playing Ayers (with his associated psychiatric issues) portrayed a mentally disturbed individual fairly well, but if the audience cannot understand or hear (also because of too much or too loud background noise), what is the point of making the flick? Think I want to spend most of my time ""rewinding"" to a previous scene so that I can figure out what was just said? I say enough of this already. Pay attention to where the microphones are.

"matrixus-1","8","1","2","18 July 2009"," A wonderful movie about our common humanity
","Summary (Nutshell)<br/><br/>""The Soloist"" sets out to be the quest of an LA Times journalist Steve Lopez searching for interesting story. Not content with choosing from the plethora of mundane topics, he starts looking for the everyday person, worth writing about. He discovers a homeless man, playing his two-string violin under a statue of Beethoven, in the middle of Los Angeles. This brief encounter quickly develops into a more intricate relationship. Lopez finds himself sympathetic to help the homeless Mr. Ayers. Suffering from schizophrenic delusions, Ayers can only express himself through one of his many instruments, preferably the Cello. Lopez embarks on a mission to reintegrate Ayers into society, by facilitating his love for classical music; this proofs more difficult than he thought.<br/><br/>Comment: <br/><br/>As a fellow musician, I've found myself very compassionate with Ayers' love for Beethoven. When you close your eyes, the music floods your mind, dozens of instruments play at the same time, but instead of suffering from sensory overload, you form a unit with the symphony, resonating with every note, feeling the composer's love, anger and passion. By playing the piece, we are able to reconstruct and reunite with an indescribable beauty, so simple in nature, yet which will never fade, even when the meaning of words left us long ago. Ayers' offers a glimpse into a highly talented musician, who is confined by his social status and medical condition, but yet someone who is able to enchant his listeners when he plays. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jamie Foxx's performance was absolutely stellar. Jamie Foxx is an unbelievable actor, his performance in Ray was already phenomenal, but I believe he has outdone himself as Ayers. He seems to be able to understand the musical mind and can portray the forces that drive/restrict it. I highly recommend watching this music.<br/><br/>Our endless struggle for self-fulfillment is a struggle, we have to fight for ourselves. 8/10"
"dustdingo","8","1","2","28 May 2009"," A Great Film of Redemption and the Worth of a Human
","All life is valuable. If there is one message you will take away from the Soloist is that all created life is of value and has worth. It is a film not only about one homeless man's struggle as he is down on his luck but also of a man who is searching for meaning in his life. While some may argue that it is a film lacking direction and motivation, I would argue that it exists to tell the stories of two men and how an act of friendship leads to growth in each of their personalities. It is also a story of grace, forgiveness in spite of past mistakes and the realization that there is still worth even when wrong decisions have been made.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. plays Steve Lopez, a successful journalist at the LA Times. He is always looking for the next big story to tell and finds it in the homeless musician Nathaniel Ayers, played by Jamie Foxx. Steve begins to write a column about Nathaniel's talent and past all the meanwhile as he struggles to find his own worth in the world. <br/><br/>The film has numerous layers best outlined by Robert K. Johnston's adaptation of the medieval system of analysis - literal, allegorical, tropological and anagogical. Through these four layers the film communicates messages to the viewer that help to form the overall framework of the story. First off is literal.<br/><br/>The film tells the literal story of a man who is living on the street and down on his luck and how his life is changed by a journalist who wants to tell his story. It shows the redemption of both characters as they begin to work through their problems as well as their rediscovery of self worth. <br/><br/>Leading out of that is the Allegorical. This is what the film says, what message it is telling. The primary message of The Soloist is that all humans have worth, that there is forgiveness and grace for our past wrongs and that there is equality among humans. In spite of the different situations between the two characters there is a realization by the end of the film that there is a worth to both of them. As Steve begins to write his stories he always refers to Nathaniel by his first name all the while as Nathaniel calls Steve ""Mr. Lopez."" There is a certain respect level communicated by the simple way that they refer to each other. One of the main points where you know the realization of worth is in the end when Steve finally calls him ""Mr. Ayers.""<br/><br/>Knowing that there is worth to all people, this leads into to Tropological stage. The end of the film encourages people to get involved in other's lives. It shows the need for people to reach out to those in need and give them a hand to get back on their feet. Not only does the story in the film encourage this, the credits contain a URL pointing to a volunteering site and the main movie site has numerous resources for getting involved.<br/><br/>Finally the movie has a anagogical stage. This is where the film ultimately points to God. Outside of the numerous direct prayers made, including one powerful scene containing the Lord's prayer, the film encourages us to use the gifts that God has given us. At one point in the film Nathaniel is encouraged to use his gift that God has given him and that it would ""be a sin"" to ignore those gifts. At another point Steve acknowledges that Nathaniel's love of music and beautiful playing points to a ""higher power."" On top of this, Nathaniel views Steve as ""his god"" as Steve has extended down a hand to pick Nathaniel up and sacrifices so that Nathaniel may have grace in spite of his past mistakes. Finally, the film acknowledges the beauty in the world in the way that Nathaniel see's the beauty all around him and desires to keep things as clean as possible. He wants nothing to disrupt that beauty.<br/><br/>Ultimately, in spite of some of the flaws in the film, The Soloist is a great story of redemption, the worth of a human being as well meaning in life. With great performances from both Downey and Foxx, you will find yourself pulled into the beauty of the story and characters as they are underscored by the beauty of Beethoven and Bach. I would suggest this film to anyone who is interested in the worth of a human being."
"oscarxp25","6","1","2","27 May 2009"," Shows how great Wright is as a director
","The Soloist- *** This movie is a test in my eyes, showing how great of a director Joe Wright is, for those of you who were unsure. This is the man who brought us the fantastic 2005 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and 2007's wonderful ""Atonement"". With those movies, he was working with great stories based on best selling novels. Here, he is working from the source material of an author, but it is a story that is very cliché.<br/><br/>The author is Steve Lopez, who is played by Robert Downey Jr., who's life was changed after he meets a homeless man, Nathaniel Ayers, who sits in a traffic tunnel, with his cello, beautifully playing classical music. Lopez, in the film, is divorced, broken and lost. Even though the real Lopez is happily married and one of the L.A. Times most valuable resources, I understand why they made slight changes to the character. This is a typical Hollywood feel good story, right down to the forced moments of emotion with the instrumental music kicking in even more than usual.<br/><br/>This movie was supposed to come out in the Fall of 2008, upgrading its chance to garner some Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor and etc. Shortly before it was supposed to be released, the movie was puled from its date and placed in a spring time slot. When this happened, many questioned how good it actually was.<br/><br/>As stated before, the movie is not bad, it is actually well made for what it was, but it is all too familiar. The performances are even very well done, Downey Jr. and Foxx have great chemistry. Separately, they are even great. Downey, gives his character a vulnerable charm that comes across quite well. Foxx, who could of just made Nathaniel a one dimensional character, makes the role something worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>As I write this review, I have really no desire to go into it. I know I gave it three stars, but it is given because the movie would have been a disaster if it did not have talent behind it."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","21 May 2009"," Oscar glory might have passed by ""The Soloist,"" but no one else should
","It was about a year ago that ""The Soloist"" was an early Oscar prediction. With a proved commodity like Jamie Foxx in a role eerily similar to his Oscar-winning turn as Ray Charles and 2008 star reborn in Robert Downey Jr. as the co-pilot, this based on a true story about a journalist and a homeless musician forging a difficult relationship seemed primed for gold. Then, much like Foxx's character Nathaniel Ayers Jr. did, ""The Soloist"" fell from grace. Eyeing what would be a competitive awards season, Dreamworks/Universal decided to wave the white flag and push the film to April and litter Oscar season with early TV promos. A wise move? Perhaps. The hype might no longer be there, but if it had stayed, it would have been worthy.<br/><br/>The stars certainly carry this film. Foxx might seem like he's re-channeling ""Ray"" in the previews, but this character is and feels so different for him. Yet again he is transformative as a schizophrenic with a passion for music. Anyone has spent time talking with or who works with people with mental illness can attest that this is what it's like. There is a humble realism in his performance and in the choice to use actual homeless in the film. Downey Jr. also impresses with his ability to make Steve Lopez his without injecting too much of his own style: It helps keep this character separate from his others and is important in a film based on truth.<br/><br/>Most underrated in this film is the work of director Joe Wright (""Atonement""). Always a fan of lengthy shots and sweeping camera movement, Wright makes sure ""The Soloist"" reflect the appreciation for art that lies at the heart of his film and the book and news columns it was based off. He has a talent for setting a mood with his camera-work and can so easily heighten the drama or tone things back when the film becomes more about the music. The scene where we see splashes of colored lights to the music with the intent of putting us in Ayers' perspective might seem boring but it's brilliant. Wright makes the most of this script and does some beautiful editing to make it feel seamless. He's sure to direct a masterpiece in the future: ""The Soloist"" is a bit too gritty and real to completely take off under his direction despite his fantastic work with it.<br/><br/>The one weakness that would have kept ""The Soloist"" from Academy recognition had it stayed in the running was the fact that the script often suffered from the same condition as its focal character: schizophrenia. It takes quite a bit of time for ""The Soloist"" to decide what it's about, but it comes together very nicely. It's a film about their relationship, but then there are moments of Lopez's personal life and flashbacks of Ayers' life before he became ill. Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") does a nice job making all these important elements work, at least in certain portions of the film. Others parts, namely toward the middle, lag a bit, but considering what Wright and the talented actors, including the always lovable Catherine Keener as Lopez's ex, manage to do with it, it was quite well done.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site moviemusereviews.com"
"Vash_ebas","8","1","2","15 May 2009"," A very meaningful movie
","Amidst the current action packed, technology enhanced group of movies, it was refreshing to watch a movie about humans and humanity. What makes it even stronger and touching is that it is based on a true story.<br/><br/>It is a story of a friendship between a newspaper columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) and a homeless, schizophrenic cellist Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx). The story is well developed and realistic. The acting is excellent. There is a message for everyone- about the homeless and their suffering, and the limits of what one can do to help, as Lopez discovered. The scenes from the homeless shelter in LA are very realistic, using real homeless people to act as themselves. It is a complex story because it is based on a true one. There is no dramatic transformation in Ayers, as a result of Lopez's kind actions. His mental illness remains, but he and those who care for him are able to accept the reality and live with it. There is some improvement in Ayer's living conditions and more important he is able to do what he loves doing- play the cello. Lopez's actions improved Ayer's life to some extent, and he was able to eventually accept the limits of what he could do to help.<br/><br/>If there is a weakness, it is in the beginning. Too much time has been spent on trivia regarding Lopez's life. To some extent that background was necessary, to understand why he got interested in the Ayers story. However, some of the graphic details of his injuries, hospital visit, etc. were unnecessary and did not add to the story. Instead, it would have been better to jump into the Ayers story as quickly as possible. That's when the movie becomes interesting. The plot could have focused more on Ayers and less on Lopez, but I can see why Lopez was the focus- he was the one who wrote the story.<br/><br/>What I particularly liked about the movie was the lack of preaching, and the understated acting. There is no melodrama. It would have been very easy for Foxx and Downey Jr. to become melodramatic, but they kept it more natural. The credit for that should go to the director and the actors.<br/><br/>This is an uplifting film, despite its minor flaws. If you want to see something serious, sensitive, and uplifting, go see this movie."

","In an age where film has hardly captivated the mind and emotions, ""The Soloist"" surpasses the gold standard in modern cinema. Here's a true story that was unbeknownst to the populace and transformed into a fantastic masterpiece that could well be gauged amongst the best Oscar worthy films (A Beautiful Mind) in terms of undeniable overtures of grandeur. We examine character flaws in both human and mental statures. In a world subdued into atrophy and materialistic solitude, we find ourselves ignoring the lower class society when in turn a higher power has granted many of them a talent or gift to bestow upon the masses. Here's a story of a hapless reporter that has seen the pitfalls of everyday detachment and descriptively displayed them in his LA Times columns. Even in the past the rigors of unemployment were evident and unfortunately public media was no different. We see this disgruntled reporter juggle with the success of a great story and the impact upon viewers. He in turn sees the true meaning of friendship through the ears and visionary thought of a schizophrenic violin player named Nathaniel. The sheer enchantment of the story is enough to bring tears to your eyes. We felt the emotional convolutions throughout the entire film and how the public can take themselves entirely too serious. There are so many moments where you find yourself captivated by Nathaniel's story and how the troubles of a broken mind can engulf your entire world. This film deserves high accolades and will undoubtedly be a nod when the Academy awards come along. I highly recommend this film and hope it takes to you, uplifts you to a new reasoning"
"dtucker86","Null","1","2","3 May 2009"," Downey and Foxx make a great team
","There was a statistic they showed at the end of the film that shocked me. It pointed out that there are 90,000 homeless in Los Angeles on any given day. This film is a searing indictment of the shameful way we treat both the mentally ill and the homeless. Jamie Foxx is riveting in his portrayal of a schizophrenic with a talent for music. His character reminded me of the one in that movie A Beautiful Mind. We see the hellish torment this poor man lives with every day. Its almost like he's trapped in a prison with no way out. Robert Downey Jr. was so funny in last year's Tropic Thunder, he proves here that he is good at doing drama as well. He is wonderful as a weary, sardonic reporter who in a way finds personal redemption when he decides to do a story on this poor homeless man with a genius for music. Foxx and Downey both have great chemistry and I wouldn't be surprised if they both get Oscar nods."

","I will not isolate the ""The Soloist"" as the supreme film of 2009; but I do think it does harmonize itself into a profound film on friendship, homelessness, and schizophrenia. ""The Soloist"" is based on a true story of a Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez who befriends homeless musician Nathaniel Ayers in the city of angels. To this day, they still remain close and because of mutual respect they call each other by Mister. And I will do the same; I will refer to them as Mr. throughout my review. And also, the 80's band Mr. Mister will provide the soundtrack of my ""The Soloist"" film review! Kidding! Come back! Don't do a solo on me! I will bring you back to the story! Mr. Lopez met Mr. Ayers in 2005 in one of Mr. Lopez's solo journalistic city escapades in trying to figure his next story for the paper. Mr. Lopez saw Mr. Ayers with his homeless attire and shopping kart playing a mean violin. Then Mr. Lopez's writing light bulbs sparkled and before you know it: Viola! ""Homeless Violin Player"" came to the Mr. Lopez cerebral cortex as an idea for his next story. Mr. Lopez did investigate Mr. Ayer's background and learned that Mr. Ayers was a musically gifted Julliard student in the early 70's who majored in Celloism, sort of speak. He also learned that Mr. Ayers ended up dropping out of Julliard because of his schizophrenia condition. Mr. Lopez initially does have soloist ulterior motives in his friendship with Mr. Ayers, but then genuine emotions towards Mr. Ayers do get the better of Mr. Lopez as he grows closer to Mr. Ayers. OK, I think I am putting a little bit too much ""misterd"" on this hot dog review of ""The Soloist"", so I will give the Mister thing a rest! Director Joe Wright does an admirable effort in displaying the atrocities of homeless life in urban Los Angeles, and how the power of friendship can be the homeless' biggest ally to get out of the mental gutter. But Wright's left hand woman in ""The Soloist"" Writer Susannah Grant did not give the Wright word to back him up. Her discomforting, uneven screenplay of ""The Soloist"" was a bit off-key. Robert Downey Jr. does not let us down once more with his startling performance as Lopez. Jamie Foxx's thespian symphony was a tragic but weighty one in his heartbreaking portrayal of Ayers; his schizophrenic self-mumbles were quite remarkable. But my Oscar bets are more down with Downey Jr. for the solo Best Actor nomination from the film. The last act of my film review concerto of ""The Soloist"" orchestrates in summary that this film should not be left alone, and needs your movie-goer company. If for no better reason, 2 and a ½ words—Robert Downey Jr.!!!!!!!!!! **** Good"

","Most of us know that The Soloist is a true story about a Julliard dropout, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), who plays two strings of a violin on the streets of LA until LA Times reporter Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) writes about him in columns and eventually a book, ""The Soloist: A Lost Dream, and Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music."" And Ayers is no easy subject.<br/><br/>But the story is as much about friendship as celebrity, as much about remaining true to your ideals as rising out of poverty, and as much about schizophrenia as pride.<br/><br/>The Soloist gives ample opportunity for two actors with serious chops to exercise their gifts more than it gives us any insight into Ayers' illness or Lopez's talent. Although billed second, Downey is the concertmaster.<br/><br/>Additionally, it reveals the considerable homeless population of LA as worthy of attention: some 90,000 souls depicted alternately celebrating their companionship and dodging the LA police enforcing a no-stealing-grocery-carts policy. While even this meticulously presented story can only hope to capture the grimness of homeless street homes, Atonement director Joe Wright shows again how adept he can be at filming groups of the suffering unfortunate.<br/><br/>As in State of Play, The Soloist makes some reference to the plight of print newspapers, which themselves face homelessness in the wake of the Internet juggernaut. I wish someone would explore this growingly-intense topic more fully because most print writers want to face the printless future armed for survival, and the rest of us who live by morning coffee and newspapers share a kinship with those writers. Because I have now climbed onto my Hyde-Park soapbox, I will offer my advice that the Academy award Robert Downey, Jr. an actual Oscar rather than nominations. As I see his graying head in Soloist, I worry that someday I'll see him receive the Academy's lifetime achievement award without a legitimate statuette.

It may be touted as a long boring movie, but that is not to say it wasn't a beautiful story with an outstanding score.

I'm really not interested in a protagonist who plays handball with his own poop. If it's music I'm after I'll go to the concert hall.<br/><br/>Attempting to portray mental illness cinematically is about as stupid and pointless as doing the same with a LSD trip: it's been done many, many times before and they have all failed.

","The soloist is an average film, with very few to offers besides a mental illness exploitation story. It begins with Robert Downey character's trying to help Jamie Foxx character's,and there is it. No conflicts in the story at all, or at least decent ones, and the strongest conflicts in the story barely affect the story or the viewer. Is just... cold. <br/><br/>I have nothing against schizophrenic homeless musicians, but that kind of film is not interesting, isn't appellative, unless if you put a lot of effort on it and turn it in a fictional film. As you can see, that is not the case with this film. <br/><br/>I had also major problems with the acting, since that i couldn't feel nothing about the characters. However it maybe kinda unfair to put the fact only in the actors, since that the character development is this film is messy, confused and lazy. Foxx overacted and almost looked like a autistic man instead of a schizophrenic man.<br/><br/>As a plus, this film brings interesting and shocking data about the streets of L.A. The number of homeless persons living in the great L.A streets is disturbingly high. But apart from that, the film is uninteresting. 6.4/10"
"Zen-2-Zen","Null","0","1","2 September 2011"," Excellent Foxx, good Downey, lame direction (Wright)
","I was curious to see why was this film a distinctive looser among otherwise excellent Wright's films. It's hard to guess how and why it happened (the crack in L.A.'s air maybe? :-) but he completely lost any sense of pacing, building up and maintaining the momentum. Kind of as if he was doing a documentary instead of a feature with a sizable budget. One even has to wonder where on earth did all that money go?<br/><br/>Part of the problem is the script that was way too much burdened by trying to be ""true to life"" of actual Steve Lopez which is rather boring. Actual Lopez just talks/writes drivel on and on and on and it's natural to him since he's a journalist. A dramatist needs to have the sense of building up a momentum and making characters more intense and colorful than they are in real life or the audience falls a sleep.<br/><br/>So the principal fault of Joe Wright as a director was that he didn't tear a lame script to shreds but followed it and even worse go influenced by it and made the film even more flat, slow and boring. If doesn't help to have one Jamie Foxx who can deliver as much intensity as you'd let him when you don't let him. It doesn't help to have Robert Downey when you force him to be a talking head. It doesn't help to have an ex wife as a figurehead when you don't develop some juice and intensity without being self-conscious about whether actual Lopez had some juice with his ex or not.<br/><br/>Full feature film is not a documentary and fails every time it tries to be. That's the principal rule that Joe Wright forgot while making this film and Foxx and Downey bailed him out only to a degree to which they were allowed to. It also looks like Catherine Keener was ready and willing to do much juicier ex wife but also wasn't allowed to."

","""The Soloist"" is the reel adaptation of the real life story of LA Times journalist Steve Lopez (played by Robert Downey Jr) And Nathaniel Ayers (played by Jamie Foxx).Directed by Joe Wright (""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement""), there was huge expectations from this movie. But disappointingly, this movie seems very disoriented and stretched too long for comfort. The end result is what was supposed to be an inspiring movie about friendship, faith, music turns out to be a boring, self-obsessed, confused venture for Joe Wright.<br/><br/>Cast wise, one can't expect more. Both lead actors were just too good for their respective role. Special mention for Robert Downey Jr, who was born to play this character. His dialogue-delivery, trademark facial expression, emotions were just pitch-perfect. Jamie Foxx did a good job also, but I personally feel Robert Downey Jr was the heartbeat of this entire movie.<br/><br/>The biggest drawback of this movie was its length. It's okay to make ~2 hours movie, but to stretch it unnecessarily is not worthwhile. The final editing was much disoriented. Even after such a great performance from the lead, one never feels connected and attached towards the story or the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Soloist"" was not what everyone expected it to be. This project was just not suited for Joe Wright, who seems to have mastered making period movies. It's a pity that talents of Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx were not able to compensate for Wright's bad direction.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 5/10"

","On a Sunday afternoon I found myself rummaging through the HBO on-demand offerings. I past over 'The Soloist' a couple of times only remembering the first time I tried to watch it when I fell asleep before the end of the first act. My fiancé sat beside me when I found nothing else to watch, and decided to give Jamie Foxx as Nathanial Anthony Ayers Jr. another try. The first 30 minutes felt familiar as I remembered the opening scenes. I instantly became sucked into the story.<br/><br/>Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) is a columnist of the LA Times who is in desperate need of story. Out wandering around LA, Lopez heres the soft music of a violin with only 2 strings. There he finds the Julliard dropout, Nathanial Ayers (Foxx). Somewhat hard to follow at times, Ayers explains parts of his past to Lopez over several days. Lopez writes of Ayers and one of his readers respond. Lopez is sent a like-new cello to give to Ayers. Steve Lopez sets up a place for Nathanial to play and be safe. Over the next several months, Lopez tries to get into Ayers' head and find the source of the his assumed mental illness.<br/><br/>The two main characters, Ayers & Lopez, often are seen clicking like best friends and at other times tugging back and forth of the simplest of subjects. Downey Jr. and Foxx fit into these roles perfectly. Their on screen chemistry makes me want more movies just like this.<br/><br/>As this movie is based on the real life story of the two main characters, it is almost exactly adapted from the book written by Steve Lopez. This book entitled The Soloist: A Lost Dream, an Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music, was written about Lopez's encounters with Ayers during his column writing.<br/><br/>Very heartfelt, very true, and great acting.

"eric262003","9","0","1","4 January 2010"," The Artistic Values of this Movie Goes Beyond What's Expected
","The beauty of ""The Soloist"" is gloriously flabbergasting. The music will have you in stitches. The creativity in the making of this movie will inspire you to pick up an instrument and join in because the music is so sublime. But throughout, the message carries with you the whole way through and it's artistic values never shy away from the theme of the movie. The movie is not a family oriented movie, primarily due to the strong subject matter centred around a homeless man with a mental setback and the lack of service the state of California can do to provide this important cause. This at times can even be aggravating to even the mature audiences, but the story is capable to educate you on this subject and also to be entertained by the audiences. <br/><br/>For those who have family members with mental illnesses can easily relate to the character of Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx in an amazing performance), in the difficult struggles they face in life and towards the family members who are handling the situations they face. And those who have never encountered a person in the condition Nathaniel faces everyday in life will be able to understand that even though he's ill, doesn't mean he's not able to amount to anything. Even though Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. turned in some excellent performances, they are backed up with a strong supporting cast which also provide equally amazing performances. <br/><br/>The cellist who was tutoring Foxx's character comes off as unlikable, but the actor who played the character banked a convincing performance. The character was in serious desire for a reality check it's not funny. One of the most memorable scenes was when the musician tutor calls journalist Steve Lopez (Downey) to set up Nathan for a performance. While the phone call is in progress, he is in an awkward position that keeps himself isolated and incoherent in the world that surrounds him, making this guy an arrogant and ignorant character. But this character in particular may symbolize the ignorance of society in general and how lackadaisical we are for people like Nathan's character.<br/><br/>Like one would expect, lot of ground has been covered that it can leave one very sad after the credits roll. Not from the high-profiled storyline, but more from our own self-centred agendas leaving out those who are in need for our help only to be neglected by us."

Where this film departs from the normal film is that it tells the true story & does not come up with a Hollywood ending where there is a solution. In fact, leaving this open ended like the reality is a strength of this film. It makes the film come off as more genuine.<br/><br/>This is classic telling of a real story & while the film is at it, the depiction of the homeless area of Los Angeles is very realistic.

"wisewebwoman","6","0","1","19 December 2009"," Too bad!
","I was totally enthralled with the book of the same name, culled from the columns of Steve Lopez of the Los Angeles Times. I was surprised when the making of the movie was announced, I wondered how on earth this would translate to a watchable and engaging film.<br/><br/>Well I found out. I thought Peter Wright might better his work in ""Atonement"" and give us a serious interpretation of the book.<br/><br/>Some key elements of the book went missing along the way. Steve is on his second marriage for one and the loving parent of a small daughter. The fact that Steve brings Nathaniel home to meet his wife and daughter were hugely significant to me, to see this man of the streets interact with a child in a private home. A beautiful scene in the book. Absent completely from the screen. Instead we get an ex-marriage of some kind with Catherine Keener playing Catherine Keener, I'm not knocking the performance for she does it extremely well.<br/><br/>There is the man in a vacuum role perfected so well by Robert Downey Jr.) and the music is sublime except when in an effort to fill in screen time not occupied by the transported faces of the stars, gets filled with the type of flashing graphics available on any download of RealPlayer.<br/><br/>The thing is, I wasn't engaged with most of it, like I was with the book. I did engage with the homeless who portrayed themselves and wonderfully well but the humanitarian intent swallows it whole. 2 X 4s in movies are not a good thing.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were oddly placed and irritating. And actually we could have done without them. The friendship is developed slowly, I really admired the way that Steve is transformed more than Nathaniel. Jamie Foxx is adequate in portraying Nathaniel but he left me oddly unaffected unlike his Ray Charles which was so satisfying.<br/><br/>I believe the story arc would have been better served with Steve's POV more fully explored (i.e. his marriage was jeopardized by his attachment to Nathaniel).<br/><br/>Seamus McGarvey's cinematography was superb. He really does capture the gritty streets, homeless shelters and chaos of LA's underbelly.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 for the effort. Save your money. Read the book, forget the film."

The attraction of this film is certainly improved the fact that this is a true story, so to see what Ayers actually has gone through in his life is heart-rendering stuff.

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","4 October 2009"," Moving and intelligent
","It's a shame that this movie has been given such a low-key release in both the USA and the UK because it is an intelligent and moving story that is beautifully directed and superbly acted. Direction comes from Britain's Joe Wright, who did such a fine job with ""Atonement"" (another film based on a book), and he uses some great aerial shots and allows time for the music to work its magic. The lead actors are Robert Downey Jr - who has had his own lifestyle problems - as ""Los Angeles Times"" columnist Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Ayers, a musical prodigy, probably now schizophrenic, reduced to playing a two-string violin as a vagrant on the city's sidewalks.<br/><br/>In a sense, we've been here before, since music and mania make good cinema - think of mentally ill pianist David Helfgott in ""Shine"" or even Mozart in ""Amadeus"" - and Beethoven is a favoured classical composer for the movies (remember everything from ""Soylent Green"" to ""Zardoz"" and especially ""A Clockwork Orange""). But this is a tale worth telling because it is based on a true story, offers a sensitive narration, and exposes an important social issue, namely the relationship between homelessness and mental illness. Also it avoids a neat, simplistic ending, instead inviting us to consider how we can befriend and support people rather than necessarily 'mend' them."

"ellieforpeace","9","0","1","11 July 2009"," This is a Movie for Beethoven Lovers
","I will start this review by saying that I am very biased toward this movie. I am a music lover. I believe it is impossible for any music lover, especially an admirer of Beethoven, to be disappointed by this movie. I also adore Joe Wright, the director, and director of such amazing films as Pride and Prejudice and Atonement. The Soloist is vastly different from those film, but he pulls it together in a way that I greatly admire.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story about a journalist, Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.), who finds a talented homeless man, Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx), on the streets of Los Angeles. He went to Juliard School of Music, but, due to his own personal demons, dropped out and played on the streets. Lopez writes some articles about him and attempts to help him. The movie is about their relationship.<br/><br/>The movie has been billed as rather uplifting. But it really is not. It's about a crazy homeless man who remains crazy and homeless to this very day. The story does follow an arc, but the ending is not as satisfying as if it were a storybook, unlike Wright's other two movies. And that's what many critics, and everyone else is criticizing. But I think that comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the music. Roger Ebert, the great movie critic himself, said ""As for the music, Beethoven of course is always uplifting, but the movie doesn't employ him as an emotional showstopper..."" which is completely and utterly wrong. The thing is, Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, specifically the first and second movements are used many times throughout the movie perfectly, as ""emotional showstoppers."" Plus, Beethoven isn't always uplifting! Specifically the 3rd Symphony which is basically a tribute to a schizophrenic hero. The first movement is heroic, beautiful. The second is a torrential funeral march. They are used throughout the movie brilliantly, adding meaning to each scene for those who are familiar with the music. It runs perfectly with the life of the schizophrenic hero of the movie, one that is doomed to end problematically, despite all efforts. Joe Wright understood the importance of the music in this movie, and he picked it perfectly.<br/><br/>Joe Wright is my best friend. He's introducing newness into Hollywood movies. He tells stories in a traditional manner, but adds in innovative and original ""camera tricks"" in each one. And they all have so much depth and artistic focus. That's one thing he has, artistic focus. And it always comes at exactly the right time. He does some amazing things with music and the city in this film, and he's nothing short of brilliant for doing it.<br/><br/>Downey is amazing. I saw a 60 Minutes special about the real Lopez and Ayers, and though Lopez was nothing like the character in this movie, I will forever remember him like this. Which if fine. Downey played his character spectacularly. Ayers, however, was exactly like Foxx portrayed him in the movie. Foxx is a brilliant actor; he gets deep into his characters, and he isn't afraid of what that means.<br/><br/>In all honestly, this may be Wright's weakest film. The editing is a bit weak in the beginning. It doesn't follow a natural path for a movie near the end. But for someone who understands the music, it will be one of the best you are likely to see. I spent several months deeply studying it, and was greatly rewarded for it by this film. If anyone else did the same, they would see how brilliant this movie is."
"bstevens11","7","0","1","10 July 2009"," Writer's Attempt at Change
","The movie The Soloist depicts Van Jones' idea of solving the problem of poverty. Steve Lopez is struggling to find ideas for stories when he comes across a homeless man named Nathaniel Ayers. Steve Lopez decides to writes about Nathaniel Ayers and Steve soon becomes a huge, if not the entire, part of Nathaniel Ayers' life. Steve Lopez does not only help out Nathaniel Ayers, but he helps many people within a poverty stricken community in Los Angeles. Steve Lopez writes about Nathaniel Ayers, which soon becomes a huge topic around the city and gets many people's attention including the mayor. Steve Lopez helped out one person and that in turn helped an entire community. Steve Lopez knew that Nathaniel Ayers was a gifted musician and at first he sought out to figure out why this prodigy was on the streets, but later dedicated himself to helping Nathaniel Ayers obtain a better, happier life. Steve Lopez would force Nathaniel Ayers to make a decision he did not want to make to help him get the kind of help he needed to continue surviving. The scenes in the movie that were the most powerful were the scenes of the poor neighborhood. The street was not a street that anybody drove down. The only car that was ever on the street was Steve Lopez's car. The street was filled with homeless people. It was dirty and full of trash. It showed people picking up partly smoked cigarettes from the nasty ground. There were people beating each other up for whatever the reasons. This neighborhood was literally garbage. It showed how bad people were and are really living and it was sad and frightening. Steve Lopez began visiting this neighborhood and the L.A.M.P. Community in it at least every week and maybe everyday, mostly because that was the only place Nathanial Ayers could play his cello. Nathaniel Ayers loved to play the cello and would be at the community so he would be able to play it. Steve Lopez was determined to help Nathaniel Ayers and the neighborhood. The movie could have changed the protagonist to be Nathaniel, so that the audience could always get his point of view. As the perspective was from the writer, the audience misses out on a lot of important things that happened to Ayers. This suggestion would have brought a new light into the movie, as very few people understand the life of the homeless, and Ayers' personality would have added to that. There is not just one scene that puts the film in perspective and suggests its ultimate purpose. The first scene is when Nathaniel Ayers is in the terrible neighborhood and makes his bed in a certain spot. Nathaniel Ayers does not only make a bed for himself, but he makes a spot for Steve Lopez. Even though it is extremely dirty and unsanitary, Steve Lopez sits and talks with Nathaniel Ayers into the night. This shows how much Nathaniel loves Steve Lopez because he accepts him into his life and he allows Steve Lopez to be with him. The scene also shows that Steve Lopez wants to help Nathaniel Ayers so much and he likes Nathaniel so much that he is willing to sit and talk in a dirty, crime filled neighborhood with Nathaniel Ayers. The second scene is when Nathaniel Ayers tells Steve Lopez that he is his God. This shows how much Steve Lopez has helped Nathaniel Ayers. It also shows how much Nathaniel Ayers appreciates Steve Lopez helping him."

Despite a banged-up face, however, he's fine. Not long after, Steve observes a homeless man, Nathaniel (Jamie Foxx) playing a beautiful tune on a two-string violin. Striking up a conversation, Steve soon learns that Nathaniel once went to the prestigious Juilliard School of Music and studied the cello! How is it that the musician is on the streets? Actually, that's very apparent, for Nathaniel is obviously mentally challenged and most likely schizophrenic. Sensing a great column, Steve makes Nathaniel the subject of a future piece. After reading it, an area lady sends Nathaniel, via Steve's office, the cello she can no longer play, due to arthritis. But, Steve knows that it will be stolen if Nathaniel has it in his makeshift home so he makes a bargain with the musician. An area shelter will keep the instrument for him to play on the premises and maybe Nathaniel can consider living there, too? It works, at least for Nathaniel coming to practice the cello. Yet, as Steve gets further connected to Nathaniel as a human being, will he truly be able to make a difference in his life? Don't go to this one solo, my friends, as the tale is so moving and heart-wrenching that you will need a hand to hold. It tackles the subjects of homelessness, mental illness, poverty, music, and charity straightforward, with no sugar coating. As the two main characters, Downey, Jr. and especially Foxx are no less than brilliant and should garner some sort of nominations, if the academies have any sense. Catherine Keener, Tom Hollander, and all of the other cast members are marvelous, too. The setting in Los Angeles is a mixture of the good, the bad, and the ugly and the costuming is wonderful, especially Foxx's unusual clothing items. All other production values are high as well.

","Obviously, the 2004 film biography of Ray Charles, titled simply RAY, has a lot to be said in its favor. After all, Jamie Foxx won the lead actor Oscar in 2005 for his performance in the title role. He is very unlikely to repeat that feat playing the title character in THE SOLOIST, because 1)the latter film was released too early in the year, 2)it only made $30 million in U.S. theatrical receipts, 3)it did not get as much publicity and ""buzz"" as RAY, 4)Ray Charles was a pop music superstar with whom almost everyone is familiar, while the soloist Nathaniel Ayers is notable primarily for the mental illness which nipped his career as a classical instrumentalist in the bud, and 5)many movie-goers and Oscar voters prefer flashy over-the-top flicks (such as RAY) to quiet, understated films, such as THE SOLOIST. The reason I gave THE SOLOIST a rating of ""10"" out of 10 (compared to a ""9"" for RAY) is that in addition to portraying the torment suffered by the title character and his family (a main feature of RAY), the SOLOIST does such a great job of 1)showing how journalism works, 2)showing how open-ended fighting mental illness can be, and 3)showing how the homeless live, right down to filming actual homeless people in an actual shelter. Whereas RAY devotes much of its time to drug abuse and the glamorous life, THE SOLOIST--despite a few flaws--feels like a more helpful look at parts of society with which the average person is likely to come into personal contact (check out the panhandling musicians outside any U.S. major league sports venue when the temperature is over 50 degrees Fahrenheit), while RAY's milieu is too rarefied for most."

","Robert Downey Jr. does not disappoint. He brings his ""A-Game"" and then some as he delivers a compelling and layered performance. The rest of the cast (including Foxx) is remarkably average. That has more to do with the writing then the quality of the actors themselves. What hurts this film seems to be the director. You can feel his heavy hand on too many scenes. It's almost as if you can see him trying to find a way to make the film more compelling but failing at every turn. Strobe crazy lights filling the entire screen linked to the music, snot filled babies on TV, chaotic voices in surround sound trying to give the audience the feel of losing grip on reality...they all fail. Maybe the story itself didn't warrant feature length film consideration and drawing out the film didn't help matters.
