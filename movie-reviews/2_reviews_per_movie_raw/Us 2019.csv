","Spoilers Ahead, DO NOT CONTINUE!!<br/><br/>Look, it's an interesting film that's an ok way to kill 2 hours. But the ending complete ruins the entire premise of the film.<br/><br/>The mother we believe to be the good mother is actually the ""evil"" version (who swapped identities in the beginning of the film unbeknownst to the audience).<br/><br/>1. The original premise - that the mother does not remember what happened in the mirror house, is perfectly logical. She has amnesia due to fear. However, the amnesia and fear does not hold up if the mother was the evil version all along. There should be no amnesia and the only reason for it is to deliberately trick the audience.<br/><br/>2. If the mom was the evil version all along, she shouldn't be scared of a ""shadow"" of herself as she claims. Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did all of the evil versions have enough food/ water to survive?<br/><br/>6. Surely not every single copy of everyone in the world was stored in the one bunker shown. So how did the ""Good"" girl convince all of the evil copies (of all the rest of the world) to arise??<br/><br/>There are probably many many MANY more issues with this film. But god does it destroy itself trying way too hard to set up a profound twist that is just completely illogical."

","I liked the movie a lot. I thought it was very well shot and very well acted, and I can appreciate Peele's subtle homages to previous horror films throughout. However, the story itself is very weak and a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>A big concern for the main characters, as well as for the viewers, is why these doppelg√§ngers (known in the movie as The Tethered) are attacking. So we are lead from almost the beginning, to want those answers, and when they're actually delivered, it's pretty unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The logic (or lackthereof) of The Tethered's existence and motivation is very messy and ultimately ruins the final conclusion of the film, because it leaves too many holes in the story that need to be answered.<br/><br/>If Peele had removed the explanation element as to the Tethered's existence, functionality etc. it would have made it a better story in my opinion. It becomes then a survival horror film, and leaves more to the viewer's imagination and thoughts as to the how and why, and that could even leave some good opportunities for symbolism etc. which Peele is known for. Not to mention it would have made the final conclusion even more shocking, compelling and thought provoking, and viewers would be talking about it for a long time, in all the best ways. Instead we're left talking about the many plot holes in the explanation.<br/><br/>All in all, as a standalone movie, it's really good and I can appreciate it for what it is, despite some of it's plot points I'd like further explanation on.<br/><br/>Also, I don't really think it can or should be compared to Get Out in any way because they're two completely different films, in genre and the overall tone. Us is a horror film and Get Out is a social thriller. So it's unfair to pit them against each other, or put them in the same league, even though they share the same director. I feel like people looking to do that are going to end up disappointed with this movie no matter what."
"Goonie_BR","5","145","185","18 April 2019"," Disappointed
","I wanted to like this movie, I was so excited about the trailer and I like the idea behind it, it's very original... but it simply didn't happed. Although we can say that Jordan Peele is a filmmaker who thinks outside the box and brings important and strong subjects, I thought the movie was poorly developed. I need to believe in what I'm watching, but there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the whole experience was damaged. The metaphors are confusing, the explanations are flat and forced, the writing felt really lazy to me.
And to add, I thought the mix of comedy and horror, that can be made in very harmonic ways, was unbalanced. All the time the comedic moments came up to break the tension, so I was not able to get scared at all and I wanted to be.
Nevertheless, I'd like to point out the amazing acting of Lupyta. Her delivery is always intense and strong, no matter which character she is playing. And I hope Peele keeps his originality, but learns to develop better narratives in the future."
"edwardjsmith-02090","3","1000","1352","22 March 2019"," The plot ruins this film
","I understand what was trying to be achieved but it fell flat.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of movies like the mist or cloverfield. There is this underlying plot of ""sci-fi experiment gone wrong"" that doesn't get explained. However in this film we get a small but lazy explanation. This came in the form of a text card at the beginning of the film that basically reads ""There thousands of tunnels in the world. Who knows what's in them"". This was the movies only explanation and setup for a civilization of 6 million clones of people living in an underground tunnel. When the movie ended and it pieced together to be this it made for an overarching plot that was just stupid.<br/><br/>Now these clones did refer to themselves as shadows because they were sometimes forced to mimic the movements of the person they are cloned after. It was weird how selective that was and is very inconsistent in a way that hurt a couple scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just those 6 million clones coming out of the tunnel and killing the person they are cloned after. Once they accomplish that they hold hands and form a line stretching across the United States. And no I'm not kidding, this is exactly how the movie ends.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities was good acting, good music, and decent humor. However, none of that can fix a terrible plot that ended with an nonsensical twist. Like a sour cherry ontop."
"coopde-88684","6","1026","1399","22 March 2019"," Disappointed.
","Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews."
"rogerdob","1","884","1213","20 April 2019"," Totally 100% Illogical!
","I know that we, as moviegoers, must often suspend belief in order to enjoy movies. However this film pushes the viewer completely over the limits. Let's count some of them...1) there are millions and millions of dopplegangers of us living in tunnels below us, 2) they were created by the US government, 3) their only source of food are rabbits!, 4) they are all dressed in red clothing (who made the clothing?), 5) no one, absolutely no one, thinks of or suggests getting a gun to protect themselves (such an action would have solved the problem and ended the film early). This film is an embarrasment to horror films...even some of the worst horror films attempt a reason that is somewhat believeable for their premise. Move this film into the discount bin of DVD's at Walmart."
"cclarktaylor-34041","1","977","1344","16 April 2019"," Utter garbage!!
","My wife and I went to see this movie and I have to say that it was just a silly movie. The entire plot was unrealistic, and bland. We actually laughed out loud at some of the idiotic scenarios. The fact that Lupita was handcuffed to a coffee table and couldn't move an inch was ridiculous! How heavy was the coffee table? I looked at my coffee table when I got home and shook my head. A child could drag it all over the house! The father was just a soft black man. I'm black and I couldn't believe it when he dropped the bat in the hand of the clone. He limped around the entire movie! Just weak and feeble. Oh and when the family got into the land rover and the daughter actually argues with Lupita about who would drive the vehicle? So in the middle of being chased by crazy clones they actually argue about who would drive? The father had an injured left knee. He could have driven the vehicle but he instead, sets his weak self in the passenger seat. The daughter actually drives the vehicle! So in a desperately dangerous situation a 12 year old girl drives a very capable Land Rover? Utter nonsense. Get Out was far better. Mr. Peele, please go back to the drawing board."
"annieboo-41078","1","663","922","7 April 2019"," So stupid
","Started off good until the doppelganger started talking. I felt like they tired way too hard for it to be scary. The music they chose was scary but didn't match the movie. The doppelganger son, acting like a dog was just plain stupid. Not scary at all. The plot made zero sense. There was no point to this movie. I was literally laughing because it was so stupid, and not scary at all."

"nikosxen","5","1217","1745","22 March 2019"," most overhyped movie
","I am sure that this review is going to get a ton of down votes and I am pretty sure that all those 10/10 reviews are bot accounts (if you dont believe me check the profiles) so I wont spent much time analyzing the film. Many many plot holes,little substance and ultimately you have a movie with a weak script based on a good idea that takes itself way to seriously without achieving even half of what it promises. Get out worked that well because it didn't take itself that seriously and there was always an underlying tone of dark comedy to it. It gets a 5 because I liked the cinematography and I thought that the performances where actually quite good!"
"Lancaster16","6","803","1166","21 March 2019"," Did I watch the same movie as the people that are giving this a 10/10???
","Was excited to watch this movie with all the hype surrounding it. The first 20 mins or so was on par with my expectations and then it just fell flat on its face. Not nearly as good as Get Out. Way to many plot holes and un answered questions. Acting was decent and writing was average. Some funny parts and the soundtrack are the only thing that really saves this movie from being a 3 or a 4."
"blackchex","3","590","851","23 March 2019"," Sooo disappointing!
","Like other reviewers, first 20-30 minutes was good and then when the doppelg√§nger started speaking, it went downhill from there. It was slow, longer than it should have been, pretentious, and by the end boring. The dumb screeching from the doppelg√§ngers, the lack of a good script (some parts made absolutely no sense), the attempt to be both funny and scary at the same time... My husband and I almost fell asleep at the end! Is that what a good horror/thriller should do to you? We had such high hopes for this film and both left disappointed. Not sure how people are rating it even close to a 10. I've never left a movie review before so imagine how disappointed I was to leave this. The only good thing is that the movie was free because we had a gift card."
"marinabaroudi","1","463","672","9 April 2019"," Don't even bother
","Aside from the poor, cheesy attempt at comedic relief, the irritating ""demonic"" voices of the enemy, and the elementary, pretentious soundtrack, the entire movie literally doesn't make any sense at all.
If the enemy are ""shadows"" who are controlled by what their human counterparts do, then how were they able to construct all those suits and go up and kill everyone? Because the humans weren't doing that and aren't they unable to do whatever they want because they always do a copy of what their humans do? Plus the movie just ends with all the ""shadows"" standing in a huge line holding hands, if they wanted to kill everyone wouldn't they have just seen the original family and gone to kill them instead of just stood there? Because throughout different scenes in the movie the shadows weren't only trying to kill the one person who looks like them.
Honestly the movie could have just been some kind of stupid political stunt, I mean there's little clues throughout the entire movie. The main villain complains about oppression and suppression and how ""we are Americans"".
Honestly I don't even know what to say other than don't bother. It's such a cringey waste of time, I'd literally rather watch Thomas the Tank Engine."

","If the name wasn't Jordan Peele, you would have walked out of that theater. Most of the audience went to see US because of the amazing experience they had with the successful movie Get Out.<br/><br/>US starts with introducing us the family. The visuals are stunning, great score puts you right into the mood and there's a significant effort spent to make the characters likeable, up until the bad guys show up.<br/><br/>Until here, everything is right and we feel like we're watching a Jordan Peele movie. Then, it takes a wrong turn and falls down flat on its face.<br/><br/>The bad guys show up and as soon as Lupita's doppelg√§nger opens her mouth, the movie finishes for me. All of a sudden, I feel like I'm in a ridiculous movie made by a 13 year old. Her raspy voice sounded really stupid and cheesy rather than creepy.<br/><br/>Although I liked some of the humor, I felt like some jokes straight up ruined the scene's ambiance:<br/><br/>Okay. There is a family that looks exactly like you, standing right in front of you holding scissors, everyone looks scared to death and then you just have to say ""Please take the boat"", really now?<br/><br/>Once I experienced these untimely jokes, it went downhill for me really fast. The chase and the combat scenes are far from being realistic and I started to feel like a Jordan Peele parody on YouTube rather than an original picture.<br/><br/>The movie gets worse and worse after that and once things are being overly explained you scream WHAT? Because nothing makes sense and immediately you notice a plot hole after a plot hole.<br/><br/>Like many revievers said before, this movie would have been much better if nothing was explained and left for our imagination. At least the plot would make some sort of sense.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Nyongo puts an amazing performance. Although she plays two characters, you could swear the actors are different. She's that good. You could see every single emotion there's to exist on her facial expressions. Creepy? You got it. Sweet and caring? You got that too.<br/><br/>However, the others were an epic fail. The dad was annoying with no mimics whatsoever, the girl overplayed the emotions almost every scene and the boy was too stiff.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to see a movie with great visuals and musical score everyone's talking about, then go see this movie to form your own opinion.<br/><br/>But, if you say the movie you watch has to have a great story and should make sense, then wait for it to show up on a streaming network.<br/><br/>4/10 for the visuals, soundtrack and some acting."
"snorrig1","1","433","639","15 April 2019"," WTF, biggest hype ever
","Absolutely one of the most boring films I have seen in a loooong time. It's trying to be smart and original, but totally fails.
It is not enough for movies to be original, they also have to be entertaining. This movie is definitely not scary, it is just silly and not in a good way."
"alexopoud","1","362","539","30 March 2019"," Avoid
","I am struggling to find a good reason to give you in order to see this movie, but I cannot. I will not stick to how the actors were playing because it was not their fault about the role they had been given. On the other hand I will base my review on the scenario. What was the meaning of the movie? Which was the target of the plot? I did not manage to answer neither of the aforementioned queries. I read that I was going to see a thriller, but I strongly believe that it was a parody of the actual movie which I will see sometime in the future. My opinion is to consider it twice before you see it and you should better give your money to charity than to see this movie."
"The_Film_Auditor","7","397","593","23 March 2019"," Great idea, questionable execution...
","I am torn on whether or not I like the story of Us. Part of me really likes the originality of the idea and the subtle social commentary the film delivers; however, I felt that despite Us having an interesting idea, the execution led to a disjointed story that felt a bit scatterbrained. There were definitely parts of the film that were suspenseful and horrifying, but at the same time, other parts felt too over-explained or tropey. This leads to me having many unanswered questions about certain aspects and feeling like other aspects shouldn't have been explained at all to keep the mystery. I think the story is hard to talk about without spoiling it, but overall, I expected more from Jordan Peele's writing but did enjoy some of it.<br/><br/>Despite my indecisive feelings of the film's story, many pieces of the film were exceptionally well done. One aspect that stood out in Us was the soundtrack and the usage of music. I think the original soundtrack was memorable and used appropriately to accentuate the feeling of horror at some points in the film. On the flip side, the soundtrack was used to perfectly contrast what was going on onscreen. This led to some great sequences (the Beach Boys scene) that utilized the soundtrack in an interesting way. Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was Lupita Nyong'o and the child actors' performances. Nyong'o in particular is the most terrifying part of the film. She plays both a horrific monster and a badass mother, making it easy to forget that the same actor plays them.<br/><br/>As a whole, I think Us is an enjoyable horror film that has some missteps with its story elements and structure. I would recommend this film to horror fans, but don't go into the film expecting anything like Get Out."
"ksmart73","6","428","651","21 March 2019"," A lot of hype, but not fully satisfying.
","I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence."

","Yep. There's nothing good about this ""movie"" - it's too funny to be a horror movie but too embarassing and lame to be a comedy. I'm not sure what was the most terrifying thing I experienced - whether it was all the acting performance that was so bad it hurt my eyes or that undue musical accompaniment during the whole film that hurt my ears... Having a 2 hours long bleeding diarrhea would be much a much more pleasant way to spend Saturday evening than whatching this ""movie""."
"BA_Harrison","5","53","73","26 March 2019"," Double trouble.
","When Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to Santa Cruz, the site of a childhood trauma, with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), she finds her family stalked by a group of doppelg√§ngers intent on doing them harm.<br/><br/>My initial thought: that's no way to play whack-a-mole. You don't just stand there and hit the same mole over and over. Couldn't the actor be bothered? Still, I'm a reasonable person and can let that slide just so long as the rest of the film is good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it turns out that iffy whack-a-mole tactics are the least of this film's problems.<br/><br/>Character development is fine-I liked the central family, and their obnoxious friends were fun, but once the shadow people appear, it all starts to go a bit pear-shaped...<br/><br/>I understand that the home invasion scene is intended to be dark comedy, which I'm fine with, but I'd liked to have had some genuine tension and a few solid frights along the way. At no point did I feel scared, which is disappointing when you've signed on for a horror movie. I also don't understand why the doppelg√§ngers don't kill the family straight away (other than for the convenience of the plot), but that's just one puzzler amongst many.<br/><br/>Peele finally hits his horror stride with the attack at the neighbours' home, and the fight against the shadow twins, but once it becomes apparent that the phenomena is nationwide, the film takes a serious nosedive. Rather than leave the nature of his villains mysterious, Peele gives us a ridiculous back story to the shadow people that makes very little sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>The viewer is expected to believe in the creation of thousands, nay millions, of underground shadow people who control the population above through puppetry. These people live in a network of tunnels and, so I understand, eat raw rabbit meat. This premise leaves countless unanswered questions, none of which are adequately addressed. It's a half-assed attempt at an explanation which would have been best left unsaid.<br/><br/>Peele then expects us to swallow the idea that the countless shadow people have been organised into an army by Adelaide's evil doppelg√§nger. Clad in red jumpsuits and armed with scissors (acquired from a subterranean red jumpsuit and golden scissors warehouse, no doubt), she plans for her people to invade the world above. To what end? To overpower their more privileged doubles and then hold hands in a chain across America, as an act of defiance and solidarity.<br/><br/>All of this is intended as a metaphor for class divide in America, mirroring the fight between the haves and have-nots, and the struggle for equality, but the subtext comes at the expense of logic and narrative cohesion. Peele closes matters with a silly twist ending that only raises further awkward questions.<br/><br/>My closing thought: could have been great, but the whack-a-mole incident is just the start of it."

The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese.

","Jordan Peele's second film, ""Us"", has a lot going for it. The acting, cinematography, and music being standouts as truly superb aspects of the movie. In the end though, there are too many obvious and massive problems to be ignored. The numerous issues and inconsistencies render this film unable to reach its grand prospects. As an apocalypse movie, it is certainly one of the most original of all time, but the execution is admittedly poor. The mechanics of the underground facilities remains unexplained, an easy question being how the tethered magically have all the same clothing as their counterparts on the surface. There is never an answer. How did the tethered not run out of rabbits after being abandoned by the government, especially if they were used as a sole source of food? Where did the allegedly millions of red jumpsuits and massive golden scissors come from? How was the movement coordinated if only ""Red"" could ever speak? Why does Adelaide act the way she does in the beginning of the film knowing that she is truly the tethered version of herself, and why does ""Red"" act so strangely and alien if she is truly the ""normal"" of the two? Why would Adelaide ever agree to return to Santa Cruz in a million years? Is it suggested that Adelaide has evil intentions from the very start based upon her sinister smile towards Jason as she drives away with her family in the end, or the one she expresses when being driven home by her ""parents"" as a child?

The sets and wardrobe were full of vibrant colors, the soundtrack was good (only in the beginning, more on that later), the acting was great and the jokes seemed organic. The buildup in the beginning was very suspenseful, not relying on cheap jump scares at all. And then things to a turn for the worse.... way worse!<br/><br/>The shadowy figures finally made their appearance in the movie, everything is still suspenseful and the action scenes are playing out beautifully, and then the shadows start talking. I'm thinking what the hell is going on? Is this supposed to be scary? What they're saying makes no sense and isn't relevant in the slightest. Scene after scene is happening with no direction, no explanation, and no real purpose. The suspense is gone, and it is replaced with mindless screaming and action scenes which are not scary at all, it's just feels stupid. Kind of like the action scenes from ""The Purge"", a lot of things happening and people screaming, but at the same time nothing is happening, nothing is moving the story along.<br/><br/>It seems like the villains in the movie can't make up their mind on what they're trying to accomplish. Do they want the family dead or not? And then the jokes in which everyone was laughing at in the first 20 minutes in the movie disappeared, and was replaced with dialogue that just kept getting cheesier and cheesier. I just didn't know what they were trying to do with this movie. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just kept getting worse and worse. The plot was non existent.<br/><br/>The villains would corner their victims, and not kill them when they had the opportunity, they would just act like they're trying to hurt them, make a few creepy faces and stupid noises and then just let them go. This happened over and over until it got soo tiresome that you just wanted something, anything significant to happen. When people died, you could care less because they felt like expendable characters. And the whole time your watching the film, your waiting for the film to give you a clue as to what is happening and why. And then the soundtrack started sounding weird, not scary, just weird. As if they just asked a random five year old off the street to pick what they would think of as creepy music to go with the movie.<br/><br/>Then there were symbols that not only had no meaning but felt stupid, think bunnies and weird wanna be scary but still childish music. You'll see. The ending of the film reminded me of some of M. Night Shyamalan's not so good endings. There was a twist, but it just leaves you scratching your head in confusion, and feeling anger because it makes zero sense and doesn't explain anything about the previous 2 hours you just witnessed. Then we go back to this game of ""I wanna kill you, but I don't wanna kill you!, I just wanna freak you out a little and carelessly give you the upper hand when I didn't need to"". During these final scenes there were so many WTF moments, that reminded you that you were watching a movie because it was not believable at all.<br/><br/>My conclusion, the beginning was an awesome buildup to what could've been a great movie. Action scenes were happening that kept you interested to see what happens next. Then what happens next is the same tireless cat and mouse game over and over. In the midst of all this you're still waiting for an explanation that never comes, and witness a twist that doesn't make sense. The movie is over and you come to the realization that you just wasted 2 hours of your life and that the best thing about the movie was the trailer.<br/><br/>Horror fans won't like this, drama fan's won't like this, and the casual movie goer will definitely not like this.<br/><br/>So should you Watch it or skip it? I say save your money and skip this movie. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again. Final Score: 3/10"

"Tariqinto","9","144","223","22 November 2019"," BRILLIANT SYMBOLISM!
","Capitalism, Materialism and the duality of the American dream: the American dream isn't a destination it's just constantly trying to get more than what you already have and constantly being dissatisfied by what you do have.<br/><br/>Symbolism:
* Hands across America: a grand gesture that looks great from the outside but actually meaningless and empty. Aka capitalism.<br/><br/>* Gabe: Gabe represents the someone who comes from a background of oppression and now he bought into the American dream, hence his obsession with material things, plus he's becoming this regular American that's not aware of what or where danger is: 1. His constant arguments with his white friend about their possessions.
2. He kept trying to offer more money to the tethereds even though it was obvious that they don't care about that.
3. When he was trying to scare the red family in the driveway the first time he talked in a regular way but the second time when he came out with the bat he tapped into that ""intimidating black man"" persona)<br/><br/>* The tethereds in the white family house trying on clothes and stuff, the thetherd wife trying on make up and seems happy for a second before her face changes and she takes a pair of scissors and tries to give herself a plastic surgery (just like her original), because the American consumer is never satisfied.<br/><br/>* The Black Flag tshirt the twin wears: (Black Flag was a punk rock band that founded the counter-culture and anti-conformity revolution) the carnival worker in 86 was wearing one too in the beginning of the movie. This detail matters because the carnival worker was wearing it when Black Flag was at their peak, and because of the cold war and the capitalism vs. communism atmosphere nobody would just pretend to be that extreme because it's ""cool"" like nowadays.
And that leads us to 2019, one of the twins from the white family was wearing a Black Flag tshirt, not because she's really hardcore or anti-anything or going counter to anything, she's a typical blond teenager doing gymnastics in the beach and bullying others in packs like hyenas; she's actually the epitome of the American cultural conformity, and her wearing the Black Flag tshirt shows how capitalism turns and appropriates the realist of things into sellable pop culture. The most brilliant part is that she's wearing something that stands for individualism and the lack of conformity, and she's a TWIN, she's literally a copy of someone else. BRILLIANT SYMBOLISM!<br/><br/>* The main twist of Adelaide turning out to be the tethered Adelaide: it's not my favorite twist but it still complements my theory, that an entire person got replaced by a soulless copy and the shallow surface level society couldn't tell the difference. As long as it looks the same from the outside it does not matter.<br/><br/>Usually we tend to ignore injustice and inequality when it's forced on someone else, someone who's removed from us, an other. But Jordan Peele doesn't allow us to look away, the idea that this could be you, you could be the other, will you be able to look away from your own tragedy?
The difference between the originals and the tethereds is completely circumstantial, directly a result of having vs not having.<br/><br/>""We are Americans""
Red (tethered but really the real Adelaide) said that but I think she really meant ""we are Americans too""
Because there are two Americas, like I already mentioned: a direct result of having and not having.
A good example of that is the Alexa like device in the white family house that changed the songs from The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations, a feel good song sung by a group of white party boys, to N.W.A's F tha Police, a rage filled song against the harassment of the black community by the police and the entire system.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the ending is that it leaves you not knowing how to feel, who did win? The good guys? Who were the good guys? Was I rooting for the victim or the villain?
The movie makes us ask an uncomfortable question: if we relate or root for Adelaide family in this scenario, does that make us the bad guys? Does that mean we are rooting for preserving an unequal and unjust system just because we benefit from it?"

All good thriller with the introduction of the doppelganger and the killing. Up until you reach the third half where the tethered plot reveal which doesn't make sense at all. I wish Peele reveal more on the tethered or at least do some flashback of the government experiment but no he didn't do that at all. Instead, he tell the back story via Red story which was magic since the tethered never speak and how the hell Red know about the tethered at all. Never she tell about any of the government personnel incharge of the tethered oversee them at all. And how about do all person living in USA have their shadow body too. And when the government abandon them. Since they all are clones and how the F the clone have children exactly as the original have? The plot twist really have the flaw, big flaw that I can't ignore. Most professional reviews give thumbs up to the movie but please, read user reviews instead. All the professional review are biased as this movie was directed, produced and have main actors from black descendants. A bad movie should stated as bad movie and not sugar-coated with PC BS! I don't care if the movie have all black casts or having all aliens at all. I just want a good movie and this movie really bad at translating it. Peele's vision on the movie must had clouded his direction and with all the BS good reviews even make thing worse. His first movie was good, really good. Even the plot twist were really good and somewhat logical to mind. Maybe he in deep pressure to make a movie that surpassed his own masterpiece but in the end, he failed to delivered it."

"fatahhudaaa","2","19","25","1 April 2019"," Not A Moviegoers-Friendly, Plot Holes Everywhere, and Not Funny (Of Course ! This is not a Comedy Movie)
","This is a movie for those whose background knowledge is as same as the director. This is a movie about symbolism, metaphor, and allusion, that not everyone would understand. This movie is enjoyable for only some people, not a movie for everyone. This is not a moviegoers-friendly I think. For those who understand this movie, be thankful, be grateful, because maybe you have watched a great movie, which I believe is not. Because I believe that a good movie is a movie enjoyable by everyone, even if it is tricky, requires you to think, but still understandable, that's what I call a good movie. And this is not one.<br/><br/>Moreover, even after I did a research and read a bunch of review explaining about this movie's greatness, I still think this movie is not that great tho. There are way too many plot holes !! Maybe the director was focused more on creating symbolism, metaphor, and allusion rather than the coherence of the story. Maybe if the story doesn't have too many plot holes, at least I could enjoy the story, at least, but the reality is : I can't.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a lot of weird questions coming out of my mind while I was watching this movie. Is this supposed to be funny ? Should I laugh for that joke ? Isn't it a horror-mystery-thriller movie ? or a comedy horror movie ? Because it was not funny and not thrilling.<br/><br/>The only thing that I can appreciate is the notion/idea of the symbolism, metaphor, and allusion. I understand that some directors want to send a message in their movie. Unfortunately, the messages in this movie, which I think quite ambitious, are not balanced with the delivery of the messages.<br/><br/>
P.S. I think this movie has a similarity with ""Coherence (2013/2014)"". A movie about doppelgangers too. But Coherence is better and more enjoyable compared to Us. I recommend you to watch it."

Too many times there is comic relief in a movie that is supposed eye opening and revolutionary. I simply just don't buy anything in this movie and everyone who does I truly want to know why?

"bob-the-movie-man","4","36","56","22 June 2019"," A film with dodgy voices.
","What a great film ""Get Out"" was. Jordan Peele's classic which unpeeled (sic) race relations in a wholly novel and horrifying way. Yes, the story was a bit 'out there' and unbelievable, but he pulled it off with great chutzpah.<br/><br/>With his follow-up film - ""Us"".... sorry but, for me, it just didn't work.<br/><br/>It all starts so promisingly. Young Adelaide Wilson (a fine debut performance by Madison Curry) is on a seaside holiday with her mother and careless father when she wanders onto the deserted Santa Cruz beach at night. There sits, like some gothic horror ghost train, the Hall of Mirrors. ""Find Yourself"" it taunts. She makes the mistake of entering and changes her life forever.<br/><br/>Spin forwards 30 years and Adelaide, now a married mother of two, is back in Santa Cruz with a terrifying feeling that things are about to go pear-shaped. And of course they do!<br/><br/>Why oh why oh why those voices? This film had me gripped until a particular point. Having people stand still and silent at the end of your drive is an incredibly spooky thing to show. But then, for me, the wheels came off big time. The ""reveal"" of who these people were I could take. But the manner of their behaviour and - particularly - how they talked was horrifying; and not in a good way. When ""Red"" started speaking I couldn't believe my ears: Joe Pasquale after swallowing Donald Duck.<br/><br/>From there, the film became farcical for me, descending in progressive stages to a tunnel-based apocalypse: a plot element that was just so paper thin it bore no scrutiny at all.<br/><br/>This was, no doubt, an attempt at a satirical dig at the class structure of America (""We are Americans"" adding a double meaning to the name of the film). If it had been played as a deliberate comedy farce it might have worked. But otherwise no.<br/><br/>This is not to say that there are not positives in the film. The excellent Lupita Nyong'o gives the whacky material her all, and the other adult female lead - Elisabeth Moss (from TV's ""The Handmaid's Tale"") - is good value as Kitty Tyler: a diabolical incarnation in either form!<br/><br/>Peele also delivers flashes of directorial brilliance. The ""hands across America"", disappearing into the sea, is a sight that stays with you. I also liked the twist at the end, although in retrospect it's difficult to relate it to the rest of the story and strikes of desperation in the storytelling.<br/><br/>I know there are some who really like this movie. Each to their own, but I was not one of them. After ""Get Out"" I was hoping for something much better.

","I have been a fan of imdb now for 15 years. I regularly say to my wife or kids ""hey this movie has an imdb of 7.7....must be good! This is my first review because I was so mad about this it compelled me to register and leave this review.<br/><br/>Well this movie has proven to me that Imdb is now like amazon. Full of fake reviews especially early in a movies life. Before going I looked at imdb....7.7 with 10k plus reviews. Heck it must be a good movie. So we went. OMG folks this movie was terrible. Stupid plot, ridiculous to the point that the person I went with and myself both started looking at each other with ""can you believe this crap?"" look on our faces. We were laughing out loud at the stupidity when the ""demon voices"" part started.<br/><br/>We were so pissed we wanted to go get a refund. I was going to go and complain but instead my buddy said screw it lets just go next door and watch Capt Marvel. Which had an imdb of 7.2 and was WAYYYYYY better.<br/><br/>If Imdb wants to be taken seriously, they need to drill down on these fake reviews. Obviously this movie has a ton load of fake reviews going on, because it is inexplicable how anyone can give this movie a 8/9 or beyond fake 10. I give it a 6.5 maybe 7 for the first 30-40 min and then a 2-3 for the rest of the movie. Right about when the ""monsters"" show up it just gets ridiculously bad."

It tries to be suspenseful, somewhat horror, thriller, some action with little touches of comedy. It fails on all aspects, to me personally it is more of a comedy, because it's very bad.

This movie started off very slow and finally when it started to get interesting, it was as exciting as watching a documentary on a sloth trying to climb a tree after it ate to much... You found yourself looking at your girlfriend every 3 minutes wondering what started in the theater next to you, while she secretly looks at you with apologetic puppy eyes for choosing the movie. The acting was mediocre, at times trying a little hard but that wasn't the problem. The story was confusing yet foreseeable, and opened up way more questions than it ever answered. (do you know that scrunchy face you make when you and your girlfriend argue about the toilet seat, that was my face the entire movie)..
The conclusion/Twist was a giant thumbs down and even when its supposed to make sense it just doesn't matter. If you watch the movie ask yourself at the very very end when the child reacts to the mother, EVEN if the twist was true it doesn't matter, literally everything is the exact same and will remain the exact same. which in the end when everything very loosely came together it still did not make sense.

Just a few of the logic holes that frustrated me:
<ul><li>Why did Red tell Adelaide about how she went up and saw herself, when in fact Red was actually the original girl that got kidnapped? Why is Red telling Adelaide about the tethered when Adelaide switched places with her and knows about the tethered considering SHE IS ONE? We all saw Red wake up after being switched. It was purely for exposition.</li><li>How did every single clone just magically find their real selves? Sure, they have the same impulses, but how do they just know where all of them are? The two families were at their beach house for Christ sakes, not even their primary residences.</li><li>How come they seemed to be completely connected when underground and Jason's clone is very connected to Jason, but NO ONE ELSE even moved a finger when their other clones were out and about. Do they just magically choose when they want to be tethered?</li><li>So the clones are all just underground and coincidentally EVERY CLONE of the people at the boardwalk the night Adelaide/Red switched were in the same underground base? There have to be other many more underground bases.</li><li>How did the Tyler's tethers know how to shut off power and break into a house without making any noise and without any communication or direction or prior knowledge?</li><li>How did the mom hear the bushes outside rustling but not a single person getting into the house? Did these stupid clones just suddenly become ninjas? Also how did the twin clones come out of the twin's rooms? How did they get there?</li><li>Why does Jason just suddenly know his mom is a clone? Just because of a noise she made when killing Red when ANYONE would make weird noises when killing someone?</li></ul><br/><br/>

","Having an intriguing idea is great, but the director still needs to make a good movie. ""Us"" just isn't a good movie.
It starts out with great promise. The dark and chaotic prequel sets the tone, followed by a family dysfunction dynamic that carries into the present timeline and promises to be an important and interesting part of the story arc. An early unsettling event provides eerie foreboding.
Then the unsettled becomes terrifying. The ""Us"" seem supernatural, able to climb walls and outrun normal humans. The movie looks like an isolated, somewhat dysfunctional family facing mortal danger, with great potential to come together while depending on something in mom's background - or not. It's looking like Peele can really do horror!
Then it goes off the rails.
The isolated family idea gets tossed quickly as the story expands to include characters we have no emotional ties to. Then, the weird supernatural qualities of ""Us"" suddenly and inexplicably vanish. The family tension theme falls away while the main characters become invincible, removing any real sense of tension (or interest really). With no good main character arc, you start wondering where this is all going. Unfortunately, it's not a good place.
Either a horror movie can have a mysterious, unexplained cause, or it can have a well thought out, carefully explained and integrated back-story that teases out as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, Peele achieves the worst of both. He spoils the suspense by ""telling"" part of the back-story, but then leaves out even the most basic explanation why this could be remotely plausible or undiscovered. I spent the rest of the movie punching holes in the whole ridiculous premise instead of actually watching it.
The final ""twist"" wasn't nearly satisfying enough to make up for this stinker."
"nicholass109","5","152","278","22 March 2019"," Great potential, Poor execution
","A wonderfully thought out concept that has the potential to be a powerfully horrifying experience to the viewer, but it falls short of greatness due to flaws in logic that will have you screaming at your television. For example, there are a great deal of scenes where the main characters defy basic fight or flight reactions. Too many scenes where I found myself saying ""well you put yourself in that position, dummy"". The film makes our protagonists seem like 6 year olds with no perception of danger rather than grown adults with children. It reminds me of corny 1970s slasher films where the first victims are just complete idiots who were too dumb to live in the first place. Get Out had plausible characters with a twist that viewers could believe. This film had unbelievably stupid characters with a plot twist that you'd have to be blind and deaf to not see coming. Definitely overhyped but it's worth spending a couple bucks to see a concept that isn't often seen in films these days."

I think the film is trying to be too many things at once & fails to hit the mark on all fronts.
Is this film scary?
No, aside from the occasional loud noise, there is nothing in this movie that unsettles you.
Is this film tense?
Yes...for the opening 10-20 minutes perhaps. Once we meet the films antagonists, any tension that has been built, quickly dissapates.
Is the film funny?
No. Despite the occasional chuckle, Us never really hits the high notes I was hoping for. I felt the occasional poorly timed comedy quip, or unexpected character reaction detracted from the tension of the film.<br/><br/>Very rarely am I tempted to leave a movie screen, but this, sadly, was one of those occasions.

There are movies that stroke me from the beginning and the ones that grew up slowly on me.
This one (Us) is another lesson of how not to trust any of the reviews. I have no idea how this title could score such a tempting and inaccurate ratting. This movie has no tension, not even a trace trace of a captivating plot. It' boring, dull and offensive to the imagination.
I didn't give this title one star because it does have fairly decent acting and is based on a good, quite original idea and that's all.

As we are older (46 and 48) we did think maybe we were wrong age group, but we asked three different younger groups what they thought and all hated it. In fact one group wanted us to go on mass and ask for money back it was so bad."

","I don't write many reviews but this one upset me because I wasted $9 on it. It was boring and made no sense. Everyone made stupid decisions just like every other horror movie where everyone makes stupid decisions. It wasn't scary and it was very predictable. I saw the ending twist from a mile away. I loved 'Get Out'. It was interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat but Jordan Peele dropped the ball here. Not sure how it has such a high rating but I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen to wait for the DVD. It's just a bad film"

","We spent the hour drive home discussing the plot holes in this movie and things that made zero sense. There's a lot. Some parts were laughable, but I don't think they were supposed to be. Ridiculously stupid. Zero sense. Even the little twist at the end couldn't hold up when you examine the movie. I want my money back. Funny thing, the theater started playing the wrong movie- Captain Marvel, which was ridiculous too. I would have rather sat through that garbage again than this movie."
"swingfire912","1","87","154","24 March 2019"," No excitement at all!
","I was so excited to go watch this movie, and it's turned out to be so much disappointing. In the beginning it was okay and then you will get lost of how it's happened, why, or what is the end? Too many things is missing in this movie keep you wondering what will come next to explain what hust happened but no. Honestly, I felt to sleep for a moment, it was so boring later on without any action to let us want to continue watching. Not worth the watch."
"BandSAboutMovies","10","330","629","23 March 2019"," Filled with ideas and inspiration
","I was concerned that after Get Out that there would be no way that this movie could live up to that work of art, nor could it equal the hype. That's been the problem with so many elevated horror films of the past few years, movies that were so hyped that they couldn't help but be vaporware on celluloid, ciphers of films that barely hold interest much less devotion.<br/><br/>Writer/director/producer Jordan Peele has stated that he was dismayed by the genre confusion of Get Out, so he opted to make a full-on horror film as his follow-up. Unlike nearly every horror movie I've seen in a theater for the past two years, I'm happy to report he's succeeded. The packed house we saw the film in was only too happy to scream out loud, yell things at the scream and react to every story beat as a horror movie audience should.<br/><br/>Unlike a movie like last year's Halloween, Us is all about the terror of someone coming after you. There are numerous instances of stalking here that add up to true tension - as a horror movie should. It's also a testament to Peele's growing skills as a storyteller that there's so much humanity under what's also a pretty darn great popcorn movie.<br/><br/>The film starts with a TV showing us commercials for the beachfront at Santa Cruz and Hands Across America, the May 25, 1985 benefit and PR stunt where 6.5 million people held hands for fifteen minutes, creating a human chain across the United States. If you look closely, several VHS movies are on the shelf: The Right Stuff, The Man with Two Brains (a nod to Get Out), The Goonies (one of the evil twins yells, ""It's our time now!"" a Corey Feldman quote from this film) and C.H.U.D.<br/><br/>Between the quote that opens the film about tunnels under America and this VHS box, what happens next shouldn't be a total surprise. Those Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers were all the rage in the mid-80's, as that film and whether or not it could be true were hotly debated topics in my teen years. It's also a movie directed by Douglas Cheek - the father of Peele's first girlfriend.<br/><br/>We then discover the film's heroine, Adelaide Thomas, on a beach vacation with her parents. The film even cleverly references another film that deals with the terrors of the boardwalk, The Lost Boys, by having Adelaide's mother say, ""You know, they're shooting a movie over there by the carousel.""<br/><br/>Wandering off on her own, the young girl enters a hall of mirrors where she meets her doppelganger, a moment that we only see in small bursts until the end of the film. She becomes traumatized by the experience and it's only through becoming a dancer that she is able to express her emotions and move on.<br/><br/>In the here and now, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, Black Panther), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke, also of Black Panther and someone who feels like the voice of one of Peele's comedy characters at numerous points in the film) and their children, Zora and Jason are on their way to that very same beach. Adelaide is content to stay in the beach house and never go to the boardwalk, but her husband begs them to go to the boardwalk to hang out with another family, the Tylers (which is made up of Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss as the mother, Tim Heidecker from Tim and Eric as the dad, and their twin daughters).<br/><br/>Adelaide has been on edge all day. The man she saw as a child carrying a Jeremiah 11:11 sign is now a dead body being loaded onto an ambulance. And that Bible passage - ""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them."" - doesn't seem like a portent of anything good happening. That quote - and the 11:11 duality - is also referenced in the digital clock shown before the power goes out later in the film. A trivia note here: the doppelganger that replaces the man with the sign even has 11:11 scratched into his forehead.<br/><br/>This is a film based on duality and the scene that follows repeats the same journey that Adelaide made as a child, now with her son Jason wandering off, as he finds a stranger dripping blood. She instantly freaks out and gives chase, finding him and forcing her family to leave the beach.<br/><br/>That night, she demands that the family cut their vacation short. But then, the power is cut and the movie does what horror does best: drop the bottom out. Reality is no longer what you expect and now, a family that looks exactly like the Wilsons are on the front doorstep of their home. The police are fourteen minutes away, but that may as well be a lifetime.<br/><br/>This cracked mirror version of our heroes goes after the family with a vengeance. Adelaide is handcuffed to the living room table by Red, the leader. Zora, who wanted to quit track, is now chased on foot by Umbrae (the name literally means inner darkness or an eclipse). Gabe is dragged across broken glass and taken outside by Abraham. And Jason is pulled into a closet by the burned and scarred Pluto (the smallest of the planets, but also the name for the god of the underworld).<br/><br/>Each member of the family must deal with their duplicates on their own. Gabe, who has been a comedy figure and obsessed with his barely operating boat, uses said nautical craft to effectively murder his twin. Jason is able to realize that he can use his duality with Pluto to trap him in the closet, which gives his family time to escape to the boat.<br/><br/>Here's where this movie gets even better: when the family makes their way to the home of the Tylers, we soon realize that the shadow versions aren't unique to our hero family. No, everyone has one of these twins and they've all started to rise from the underworld with murderous intentions. Now, the creatures known as the Tethered are killing their surface world sides and forming a human chain.<br/><br/>Umbrae attacks the family as they drive off, but Zora uses the car - and not her human running ability - to kill her. But as they get to the boardwalk, the road is blocked by Pluto who has set fire to numerous cars and traps the family. Jason realizes that he's still tied to the boy, so he makes him walk into the flames before Red kidnaps him.<br/><br/>Adelaide follows her twin through the hall of mirrors and then deeper and deeper into the earth, passing the cages of rabbits which we saw in the title sequence. Now, we learn that the Tethered were a government creation, made to control people before being abandoned. Now, they are forced to remain in the shadows, stuck replicating the motions of their free twins above ground. Once Adelaide and Red met in 1986, their connection was a message from God that Red must lead the Tethered into the light.<br/><br/>Again, any other movie would stop here. The ideas are big enough. But like the best in horror, reality can be further destroyed by the real duality of the film: the heroine that we've been behind the entire film is actually the doppelganger. The real Adelaide is the one who has led the uprising, with the 1986 Hands Across America action as her childhood vision of what adults do to make a statement. Only Jason realizes this, as he slides his monster mask down on his face (I love how he constantly wears this, much like Frankie wearing the Dracula mask throughout The Lady in White).<br/><br/>The final thing we see is the family driving an ambulance into a burning city, surrounded by helicopters and the human chain of the Tethered stretching out into the horizon.<br/><br/>For all the talk of movies appearing to be John Carpenter influenced, this is the most Carpenter film I've seen that he didn't direct. It has all the elements - a group under attack by forces they don't understand, evil that wants to destroy you for no reason other than it wants you dead and an ending that appears as positive as it does negative. There's an underlying menace in Us that Carpenter's films have and few others can achieve.<br/><br/>Peele gave the cast ten horror films to watch so they would have a shared language when filming this movie: Dead Again, The Shining, The Babadook, It Follows, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Birds, Funny Games, Martyrs, Let the Right One In and The Sixth Sense. I believed this allowed them to easily create a language of their own. Peele has also called out a direct inspiration for this movie came from The Twilight Zone episode ""Mirror Image,"" in which a woman sees her twin at a train station and becomes obsessed with the fact that her evil side is trying to replace her.<br/><br/>Some may decry this movie for how it leaves so much unexplained: how could there be an entire world under ours, where people do the same actions as us, trapped to live in our shadow? Why do we need an explanation spelled out to us? Why can't we accept this premise and enjoy where it takes us?<br/><br/>Me, I'm wondering what the symbolism of having two Black Flag shirts - the logo shirt and the My War shirt, an album that divided the band's fanbase due to it being more Black Sabbath than fast punk rock - means. I was probably the only person in the theater concerned with such things. In fact, clothing is a big part of this movie, with the Michael Jackson Thriller shirt symbolizing the strange duality of the childlike Michael and his horrific red-clad zombie twin in the music video. In fact, Peele has referred to Jackson as ""the patron saint of duality."" Hell, the Tethered wear the same red as Jackson and also have one glove on their hands.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie is that it explores the dark side of the neon hue of the 80's. Even Hands Across America - an effort to bring people together and raise money for charity - always seemed creepy to me. I wasn't alone. As Peele told the L.A. Times, ""There was this kind of almost Stepford-creepy sense of American hope that we can do anything as long as we just hold our hands together.""<br/><br/>Obviously, I've put plenty of throught into this film. What I've come out with is that Peele is no one trick pony. I'm pleased to report that Us only confirms what Get Out hinted at."

All the horror clich√É¬©s are there. Some very cringe worthy comical moments with jokes that weren't funny. Plus, there is no character development. No character development at all. Only a solid first act, then followed by very disappointing second and third acts, with killings and more killings and a predictable ""plot twist"" I could guess right during the first 15 minutes of the movie. The concept of the movie is nice, cinematography is also nice combined with the soundtrack but these technical aspects don't save a plot that is very simplistic, with a terrible self-explanatory and predictable conclusion.

"stottlemyercheyenne","2","25","40","28 June 2019"," Plot? Acting? Confusion?
","First off, it was very hard for me to leave a 3 star review for this movie, considering I believe it deserves less.
There were way too many plot holes in this film and way too many goofs. Read the list of goofs, if interested.
The only reason I rated this a 3 star was because of the concept. The concept has great potential, but it definitely wasn't followed through with this film. I love the whole ""evil twin/clone"", doppelganger side of this story, but I felt quite filled with disappointment after the first 30 minutes or so.
Once the ""Tethered"" began speaking, that's ultimately where everything went downhill. It was a mixture of someone needing a glass of water (like Spongebob) and forceful demonic sounds, screeches, and voices. I found it more comical than anything.
The acting was terrible, to say the least. The only one's I felt were even worthy of having listed as good acting would have to be Kitty and Zora. No disrespect to the other's involved in this film though, there is potential elsewhere, I'm sure.
I do have a lot of questions for this movie, but obviously there won't be any answers for them. I can draw my own conclusions, even if those conclusions don't make much sense with the plot. Quite frankly, nothing made sense with the plot.
So, why weren't any of the other ""Tethered"" indiviuals mimicking their people? The only one that was mimicking at all was Jason (the son). Later in the movie, it showed where all the ""Tethered"" came from, how they take on the movements of their counterparts, but right off the bat, that wasn't included.<br/><br/>HUGE SPOILER ALERT IF YOU CONTINUE READING FURTHER!<br/><br/>At the end we reveal that Adelaide (The mother) was actually snatched up by her doppelganger in the mirror room and they switched roles in each other's lives.
Why did Adelaide decide to rally up everyone else's doppelganger to kill their doubles? How did that tie into her story at all? If she wanted revenge or to find her evil counterpart, she could have went on that mission alone. I don't understand how the other's come into play and how it has any relevancy in the plot or the first 30 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie had great music (yet it never matched the movie at all), good acting (only two characters), and a great concept (with a terrible carryout)."

","I liked ""Get out"". It was not the brilliant movie all the critics raved about, but it was a well-acted, decent thriller/horror with an interesting twist and perspective. Now, about ""Us"": this movie is overrated to a ludicrous degree and I was highly disappointed by it. My favorite parts are actually the jokes and the humor. As far as the rest is concerned, I didn't like the contrived acting, the ridiculous, far-fetched plot, and, worst of all, I didn't find the movie scary for a single moment. I think the problem with ""Us"" is that Jordan Peele is trying way too hard to come up with something original that will set him apart and justify his growing popularity within the horror genre. The overall result is just a weird, confusing mess that makes no sense whatsoever no matter how much you try to spin it. An example? The lady's double who speaks in the guttural voice is supposed to be scary and disturbing, but in reality she just sounds like she has a bad sore throat and ends up being annoying.

It made no sense. - Stupid<br/><br/>Don't even start me on the ""Twist"" at the end. I saw it coming a mile off. But again it made no sense. Why didn't she have any memory of living underground? After waking up in the underground facility and realising the other girl had stolen her identity, why didn't she just use the escalator and go back to the outside world? - Stupid<br/><br/>I don't understand how all those people were in the underground facility for so long without anyone knowing. it was so easy to find. How did they survive down there for so long? who made their clothes? they started as children so would have grown out of previous clothing and needed more. - Stupid.<br/><br/>I almost turned this movie off it was so bad.

Though it's a pure horror unlike Get Out there are a lot of jokes in this film which really tickles you. The film falls short of Get Out in creating an atmosphere of mystery and confusion but the tension in this is very high. Lupita Nyong'o shines once again and definitely has a shot at the Oscars, Elizabeth Moss with the little screen time till impresses.<br/><br/>The score is very haunting and in the car scene towards the end of the movie you really cannot think of the scene without the score.

And I've seen some real stinkers.<br/><br/>The acting was just about OK but the writing and the story were laughable at best.
Jordan Peele is a competent director but if Us and Get Out have taught us anything it's that he's an awful writer who tried his hardest to spring a surprise ending that just makes his movies a mess.<br/><br/>If he'd written a movie about a family on vacation who get terrorised by a group of people who look a little bit like them and left it at that then this movie would have been ok. But the whole cloning and no soul thing just ruined the story and made it a joke.<br/><br/>On top of all this, the characters were just not likeable at all. The dad who was a 6 foot plus macho man just caved within 5 minutes and decided he was going to let everyone kick his ass, even though it was HIM with the baseball bat.
The mother was just annoying and pointless and are we SERIOUSLY expected to believe that she was handcuffed to a COFFEE TABLE and couldn't move it? √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
The kids, don't get me started on the kids.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was when they decided to escape the friend's house in the friend's car and spent 5 minutes deciding and debating who was going to drive (with a few stupid one liners thrown in) and then decided to let the 12 year old daughter drive.

","Jordan Peele has lately been heralded as the suspense master of our era, a claim I would have love to support after the successful 'Get Out', a smart, timely and immensely entertaining suspense thriller. Unfortunately, after viewing the highly anticipated 'Us', I'm sad to say that I have to hold off on my enthusiasm. While all the elements that Jordan Peele use to implement 'Us' are there (strong performances, good build up sequences, dark humor, etc), the weak storyline inevitably fails to hold the movie together. I really want to like this movie. I consider myself as the kind of audience that is willing to stretch my suspense of disbelief a lot more than normal, but even so, the movie loses my interest half way through and I find myself no longer rooting for it's charaters. There are moments of humor as expected from Peele which I see as his trademark and always a plus as he does know how to incorporate it well with the horror genre. But ultimately, it's hard to hold interest in a movie when the storyline is not tight, no matter how posh the production is. There are plenty of glowing reviews of this movie out there, but I suspect they are motivated by money. I still have not lose hope on Jordan Peele. He is a very talented director and has a flair for the horror genre, a genre I love. I see this as a step back for him, but let's hope he realizes he has a lot of room for growth so that he can continue to learn to make great, if not better as movies as 'Get Out'."

So now, with this narrative mess of a film, Peele has two horror films to in his credentials; neither of which are particularly original or frightening.<br/><br/>I see that he has his fanatics and devoted adherents, but ego and self-promotion are not substitutes for talent.

Let's say that they're idiots who can't formulate sentences and act in barbaric ways. Fine. Even the basest *animals* aren't going to stick around and do tricks for overlords who aren't even present and aren't presenting a system of punishments and rewards to them.<br/><br/>
Even the lowest I.Q. people would have escaped such inhuman conditions long before the girl had the idea. When they show flashback scenes in which they do mimicked movements there is no one who is barking orders at them. There is no one who is standing guard over them with weapons. There is no reason for them to even be there. There are just cameras that are mounted on the walls, which are apparently useless-- a little girl escapes easily.<br/><br/>I have profound difficulty with accepting that millions of idiots thought that such conditions were acceptable until a ""topsider"" child informed them that they could have better lives then they remained patient enough

Definitely not ! Why ? I spent my time complaining against the flaws and the plot holes; thus, the script seems unfinished and/or big-headed.

","Jordan Peele follows 'Get Out' with a horror film starring Lupita Nyong'o in which the monsters look just like the heroes.
""We're Americans.""
That single line will be the portal through which Jordan Peele's fans might seek sociopolitical meaning in Us, an often terrifying thriller whose fantastical premise isn't nearly as easy to read allegorically as that of his shockingly good debut, Get Out. Clearly the work of an ambitious writer-director who can see himself inheriting the mantle of Rod Serling (the Peele-hosted Twilight Zone reboot launches in less than a month), it offers twists and ironies and false endings galore - along with more laughs than the comedian-turned-auteur dared to include in his debut film. Though probably more commercially limited by its genre than its hard-to-pigeonhole predecessor, it packs a punch.
Opening with a shot of a television surrounded by VHS tapes that tease at some of the film's possible inspirations (C.H.U.D., The Goonies, The Right Stuff; which of these does not belong?), Us introduces Adelaide (Madison Curry), a young girl in 1986 Santa Cruz who's about to have a traumatic experience at a beachside amusement park.
Cut to the present day, when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is a mother of two, heading out with husband Gabe (Winston Duke) for a vacation at her childhood home. Though she recoils at Gabe's suggestion that they take young Jason (Evan Alex) and Zora (Shahadi Wright-Joseph) to the beach - the idea triggers memories she hasn't told Gabe about - she relents; once there, mysterious forces seem to be pushing her toward whatever once harmed her.
A general air of icky dread builds toward the scenes that, having been spilled all over the film's trailers, can't be spoiled here: Back home that night, four mysterious assailants trap the Wilsons in their house. Each one is the near-identical twin of a family member, though only Adelaide's twin speaks. In a gasping croak, she identifies herself as Adelaide's ""shadow,"" who has lived a life of misery ""tethered"" to her but far away. She and the others have come to do some un-tethering, and it's going to hurt.
To this point, Duke (previously the fearsome clan leader M'Baku in Black Panther) has been a surprisingly winning source of comic relief, stealing scenes as most dads only wish they could. Now, those laughs are rationed out stingily, used to cut the tension between two very intense, very fine performances by Nyong'o. While her Adelaide is nearly paralyzed by a combination of maternal panic and childhood memories, her Shadow is an old-school bringer of violent justice, settling scores the Wilsons didn't even know existed.
As home invasion standoffs go, Us would be a thrill ride even if its villains weren't horrifying grotesques of the characters they seek to destroy. It ends with satisfying violence, but of course this is not the end: The doppelganger vision expands, taking in the neighbors (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker, 2018's version of Me Generation vapidity) and making escape much harder than the Wilsons imagined. And then things get weirder still.
I'll save you the trouble of googling the Bible verse cited by a madman here: Jeremiah 11:11 reads, ""Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.'"" But nobody cries out to God in the apocalypse Us winds up conjuring. They fight and fight, while viewers cower and pray that the answer to Peele's mystery will be worthy of the bloody road leading to it. We'll leave that question for viewers to hash out over a post-viewing drink. What isn't up for debate is the obvious pleasure Peele takes in crafting a film whose many references to pop-culture history - you'll be too tense to giggle when a boy in a Chewbacca mask yells, ""It's a trap!"" - are sometimes transmogrified into an iconography all their own. Monstrous beings wearing red jumpsuits and a single fingerless glove, carrying giant gold scissors while howling wordlessly to their partners lurking in the shadows - that's an image that will provoke nightmares, even before we can explore where its components come from.
Perhaps Us is making the obvious point that, whether we're black or white, it's people who look just like us who've made our world a disaster we cannot escape. Maybe we're doing the same, both of us creating a living hell for someone, likely without even knowing it. Maybe we're Them and they're Us. Maybe every happy ending is somebody else's catastrophe, and therefore, no horror film is ever really over."

Disappointed."
"alvesmarceloalves-73751","8","28","51","29 March 2019"," The nightmare is us
","There is a whole recent rise of horror films that seeks a reflection beyond the scares and tricks that terrify the viewer. In essence, they remain classified as horror, but are quite different from the traditional formula of the genre. It is from there that appear films like ""Hereditary"" (2018) and ""A quiet place"" (2018).<br/><br/>Jordan Peele is responsible for two good works within the genre. ""Get Out!"" (2017) used horror to deal with racism in an approach that used science and the loss of identity at the service of a perverse story.<br/><br/>""Us"", his latest film, uses similar elements of science from a question: what if we all had a wicked double coming out of the shadows to take our place? A double that lived in the underground the same life in which we live, but in a terrible and painful way, without being able to decide the destiny itself. What if this double decided to rebel? To leave the darkness to assume a place in which he sees to be also of his right. Is it possible to accept this act of revenge after a lifetime of pain?<br/><br/>It is from there that the family of Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) lives the biggest nightmare of his life. When the couple and their two children go on vacation at a beach house, she finds herself faced with a nightmare of the past. It was here, in that region, that Adelaide lost her parents and lived a macabre experience that definitely marked her.<br/><br/>It is not possible to advance much in the analysis without going into details of the story and, therefore, reveal important passages of the film. But we can summarize that the narrative created by Peele has a different power from simple clues played on the screen. The citation to the biblical passage from the book of Jeremiah, which addresses the inevitable arrival of evil to all people, is the first warning sign.<br/><br/>But how frightening it is to confront the most animalistic side of yourself is a message that permeates the film. The villains, the monsters, are ourselves. Without the brakes of life in society. Peele makes us face our worst materialized nightmares. And few things are as terrifying as that.<br/><br/>If ""Get Out!"" Had a somewhat rushed ending and with some problems, ""Us"" turned out to be somewhat predictable, whose events were moving to that moment since at least half the film. But still, how terrifying is this end, and how many reflections bring us from it.<br/><br/>""Us"" is a step further in Peele's horror filmography. It is a film with layers that are unfolding every moment and beyond. And it's scary. But it is a fear that, beyond violence, comes from the philosophical and psychological reflection of what history shows us. At that point, Peele hit the mark."

Being a sci-fi writer myself, I am actually embarassed to see such a movie receiving 7+ review points, when the story is just so poorly written. So many plot holes. So many unanswered questions. SO... MANY... lazy solutions on screen!<br/><br/>So, clones living underground?<br/><br/>Who has cloned them?<br/><br/>How the HELL does an abandoned clone-station hold clones from people that have not even been BORN YET, back in the 80's? Because when the red-family appears at their doorstep, they got clones of the children too, don't they? Were they cloned long before, or did the government scientists miraculously re-appeared at the station just to bring in the clone's offsprings?<br/><br/>Why couldn't young Adelaide just go back upstairs, when the staircase was just 50 feet away from her room? The station is VERY small, and no one was guarding the amusement park above. She KNEW her family was up there (being a real human, she knew how things worked).<br/><br/>Where did the clones find so many golden scissors? How on GFKING earth did they communicate between different stations in order to decide wether to wear red, or pink, or fking striped clothes?<br/><br/>Anyways... the plot hole list could go on, but, you got my drift.

","Whilst not just as good as Get Out, Us is a film I really can't stop thinking about. I kind of liked it, I kind of didn't and honestly, I'm a bit conflicted. I think the cinematography and concept are absolutely fantastic. The acting is pretty good and the score is great. The editing is probably the weaker parts of a really damn good film and really lets down the script and a lot of the execution.<br/><br/>I think some of the script is half-baked with plot-holes but what it does with the concept itself feels like something out of a great short story. The main actress is fantastic honestly, she does a great job and what happens at the end really turns the plot on its head and I'll definitely be having a different experience in the next watch which is great.<br/><br/>I really love how bizarre this film is, I love the ambiguity and the direction. I love the style and execution. It's a sort of creepy style which I've loved in other short films which hasn't really been explored until now. There are some great unlaying themes in there as well but it still definitely has its problems especially in the sound editing (the soundtrack is great but it is overused in parts where it didn't need to be) and the editing itself especially in several cuts between the past and the present.<br/><br/>In the end, though, I see myself really coming to love it on a second watch, I honestly can't stop thinking about it even though there were some things that could be better but this film really shows that Jordan Peele is a force to be reckoned with especially in Horror. I would love to see him tackle other genres or Horror sub-genres. If you liked Get Out, you'll probably like this film too, it's a really interesting film and it will be talked about for years to come. I give this movie a Not Perfect but Very Interesting/10."

"joshbarton15","9","15","25","24 March 2019"," Jordan Peele is a filmmaking force.
","Riding on the wave of success Get Out has provided him with since 2017, Jordan Peele returns with Us, a psychological horror that promises to get under your skin even more than his debut effort managed to. Peele showed innovation aplenty with Get Out, the social commentary apparent in the film providing it with much more to say than it seems, a trend that could make its way into Us as well.<br/><br/>When Adelaide and Gabe Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke) take their family on a break to the beach, they are faced with a fight for survival when a group of doppelg√É¬§ngers begins to terrorise them.<br/><br/>Watching Jordan Peele's Us comes with the pleasure of trying to work out what is happening and why, much was the case with Get Out too. The film is packed with symbolism and foreshadowing that further viewings will only become more rewarding, not that this initial experience wasn't in any shape or form. This is another twisted treat from Peele, the tropes of horror executed brilliantly with the perfect amount of humour littered throughout, meaning you should probably try and see this with as big an audience as possible.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the beating heart of Us is an utterly spellbinding Lupita Nyong'o in a dual role that showcases what huge talent she possesses. As Adelaide she encompasses the dread and fear of someone haunted by a childhood experience that leads to her crossing paths with Red, her doppelg√É¬§nger, who she portrays in such an effectively creepy manner. Winston Duke is great as her husband, getting the majority of the comedic moments and making them really work amongst the sheer terror the family are facing. Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex are both pretty good too as the younger members of the Wilson family, as well as excelling as their doppelg√É¬§ngers too.<br/><br/>Peele manages to hold the audience in the palm of his hand, from the masterful opening to the closing sequence when revelations have been made, and he uses music so well in his film, Michael Abels' score aiding the tense moments to great effect.<br/><br/>While I think Get Out is a better film, Jordan Peele does enough with Us, his sophomore effort, to show everyone that he is a filmmaking force to be reckoned with. Whatever he does next, whether it still be in the horror genre or not, I'll be there for it."

Thus by the transitive property, We are Us, Us is U.S., U.S. is America, America are We.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele follows up Get Out with another whole movie. Peele seems to think that a raspy voice is scary (it's not), that being frightened and laughing should happen, even coterminously, within the same scene (they shouldn't), and that rabbits are a metaphor for something I never figured out (I didn't).<br/><br/>In our local music scene, we have the phrase ""GGBB,"" which stands for ""Good Guys (and Gals), Bad Band."" Us offers up the movie parallel that phrase needs, ""GGBM."" The acting is good (despite raspy throating), the editing is good (despite the requisite jump-cuts), and the soundtrack is good. The plot, which feels like one of those plots you need to do some outside research to really, you know, get, falls apart from the get-go, progresses as if though separate ideas had been stapled together, and ultimately releases us onto a final scene which reels the mind, all across America.<br/><br/>Boardwalks and funhouses, beaches and boats, fireplaces and pokers, and matches and fires: it all adds up to some remorse for the buyers."

The dialogue is unrealistic and lazy at some points and the general nonchalance of the family in such a situation baffled me throughout, I understand comic relief but this took it too far.

I didn't think the twists were that intriguing (or really added up overall). Even though the writing didn't do it for me, I do appreciate the artistry. It's only Jordan Peele's second film, but his craft is spellbinding. He knows how to captivate the audience. The acting, the shots, the editing, the pacing are all top-notch and kept me chilled and engaged throughout. If the third act wasn't so underwhelming (especially after so much lengthy tension-building), I would consider it a masterpiece of horror like the rest of the world."
"adamjhargraves","1","16","28","28 March 2019"," How on earth did this get a high rating?
","When I saw the IMDb rating was high, I again thought the law of averages would mean that this film was at least good or be it not great. From the beginning up until the characters started to screech and make other strange noises, I was buying into the creepy atmosphere the film was building. From the screeching point it was all down hill and I found myself thinking it must be a super strong finish to pull together the mounting absurdity this filmaker wanted you to swallow. I couldn't do it, it was just dumb and insulting to anyone at least with average intelligence. Obviously I'm insulting a few reviewers of this movie out there but I'm optimistic that these same IMDb reviewers that gave this movie a good rating are definitely not representative of the broader communities sense of a good movie period. And what was the stupid reason the main character spoke with the voice of an old Indian."

","I barely ever write reviews but I just had the urge to give my thoughts on this movie.
After the amazingly refreshing ""Get Out"", seeing the trailer for Jordan Peele's ""Us"" made me very excited. The few things that they have shown made it seem genuinely intriguing and creepy.
However, after seeing one particular scene at the beginning I was immediately worried about the direction this movie is going...if you watched it you know which scene I'm talking about (it involves rabbits).
The movie seemingly has a cool idea that has potential, but the way it's presented is just so...boring. Many scenes just drag on forever without any reason, and they carry barely any emotional impact.
There are two good things in this movie, Lupita's performance and the soundtrack. Everything else is just not very convincing and feels like it's trying to be more than it actually is...there's a couple of creepy moments, and some comedic relief, but other than that it's just flat out boring as hell.
I have watched a lot of movies in my life and I sincerely do not remember being so bored watching anything...I do not recommend this movie."

","Peele's sophomore release has a lot to say. Although significantly unique in style, which will likely provide an entertaining and captivating viewing experience to most audiences, many are bound to leave disappointed. Us is far from a traditional horror film, and is an attempt to make a statement on individuals' role within themselves, society, and the United States (Us). This concept is intriguing, and the statements the film make are sure to keep individuals contemplating it far after it's over. In this regard, the film is successful, containing many interesting concepts, metaphors, and possible interpretations.<br/><br/>However, with Peele's attempt to represent so much comes the difficulty of putting it all together. Us is filled with plot holes and irrational moments that almost seemed to be caused due to laziness during scriptwriting. To worsen the matter, rather than providing a logical and simple ending, Us keeps piling more and more new information on until it reaches its abrupt ending. It almost feels as if Peele was on the verge of a masterpiece, but decided to send the rough draft of the script into production without proofreading or making logical changes. Due to this the flow, roundedness, and perfection that Us could have had is unfortunately absent.<br/><br/>7/10"

After watching US I can gladly say that Jordan Peele knocks it out of the park again. US is a amazing mix of suspense, comedy, and action. I cant think of another Horror movie that has ever balanced all three of those categories so beautifully. Starting with the comedy, it was really shocking how many times this movie made my whole theatre laugh out loud. I can remember at least four different moments that had the theatre dying. the horror/suspense was used with great care. zero jump scares all about the atmosphere like some of the greatest horror movies ever mastered. The movie reminded me a lot of the Strangers: prey at night, but much better. they both handled the action the same, as making it a top priority along with the horror and at some times it feels you are watching a action based horror film. That might not be everyone type but it sure as hell makes it a more diverse and interesting movie.

Peele creatively walks the line between horror and comedy while offering a story to chew on that's sold perfectly by the cast (From what I remember, only 10 people get on scree speaking credits this whole film). While not perfect, the movie easily warrants a second viewing alone to appreciate the numerous Chekhov's Guns placed from start to finish.

"CANpatbuck3664","7","12","21","31 March 2019"," Bold Ideas, Great Acting but the Final Product is Decidedly Mixed
","The movie you think you're going to get with Us and the movie you end up getting are two different things. Normally that's a problem but I think it works
in their favour. If the movie was too formulaic or too obtuse, that would be one thing but it's clear that Jordan Peele has his own ideas and they're original enough to catch your attention. I wasn't a fan of every one of them but this movie isn't afraid to do its own thing and I have to credit Peele and his team for trying something new and being confident enough to bring it to the screen with a lot of fanfare.<br/><br/>One of the things I was more surprised by was the amount of comedy in Us. The trailer billed it as more of a straight horror movie. This movie is actually pretty funny when they try to be, from Gabe's corny jokes to the Tyler family's selfish behaviour, I laughed more than a few times. They also have a couple of choice references in there that made me smile. However, I don't think the movie is as carefully balanced as the best horror/comedies are. There were a few times where the audience I saw this with were laughing through some of more tense moments (the ""Tethered"" largely speak in grunts and the theatre I saw this in was giggling whenever one of them had to communicate) and it came of as unintentional. Us is never particularly horrifying but it is an effective thriller. So the team were able to play in both genres effectively but the tone of the movie shifts and its not always an easy transition.<br/><br/>The best thing about both of Jordan Peele's efforts as a writer/director is that he knows how to get great performances out of his actors. Lupita Nyong'o was excellent in her dual roles here. She's best known for her turn in 12 Years a Slave or as Maz Katana in the Disney Star Wars movies but there were moments in this where I was astonished at the job she was doing. She shines the brightest in a cast where everyone pulled their weight. Winston Duke was a lot of fun as a dorky dad, I thought he was pretty funny and he pulled off the physical work in the part. I thought the two kid actors, Shahadi Wright Joseph as Zora/Umbrae and Evan Alex as Jason/Pluto were both capable and did solid work. Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker were decent as the Tylers, they're characters were jerks but they played them fairly well.<br/><br/>Now I've got to get to what didn't work for me. I have a hard time with movies where the story turns or the creative team make decisions where they are deliberately obtuse for the sake of creating a ""metaphor"" or leaning into some ""symbolism."" People make excuses for filmmakers saying ""it doesn't have to make sense"" or ""you get what you want out of it"" but there has to be an effort to make things palatable or to try and bring the audience in (I had the same problem with the 2018 Suspiria remake). The fact that they wanted to do different things is admirable but several moments in the climax and the denouement of Us don't add up. I can't go into spoiling the movie and I do think that a movie that encourages debate is something that we need more of. I also think that no movie is ever perfect, you can always find something to nitpick or whine about. But I couldn't always just take what Us spoon fed me, there's so much to question and the film doesn't even try to answer or provide a way to the audience so they can figure it out. Maybe you'll feel differently but to just tell me to shrug it off is lazy and just an excuse (Peele has also done this better in Get Out, there's no deep explanation into the procedure but the way they presented it, I was fine that there wasn't a point by point explanation). I'd also note the final note in this movie is decidedly dark and while I liked it, I don't know if it's going to hold up to further scrutiny.<br/><br/>I wanted Us to be something special, I liked Get Out but I also thought the praise that movie got heaped upon it was a little excessive. It was really good but to call it a ""masterpiece"" seemed a little hyperbolic. So I went into the theatre hoping that this would be that striking and bold movie that I could fall in love with to hop on the Jordan Peele train. There's a lot of big ideas in Us and I thought the acting was very impressive (especially from Nyong'o) but this movie seems to play by its own rules only when it wants to, they explain so little without providing the requisite bread crumbs to follow along and while the movie has its share of funny material and thrilling moments, I didn't think they meshed well together. Peele is an exciting new filmmaker who isn't afraid to take chances or try something different. I look forward to more movies from him but I still haven't got that can't miss, have-to-see-it film yet from him (that's only my opinion). I liked Us enough to give it a 7/10 but I can't go any higher than that."

Now let's review : script? No. Story? No. Plot twist? No. Horror? No.Thrill? No. Special effects? No. Drama? No. Any element of appeal? No. I mean i sat there for more than 2 hours watching and waiting for something to amaze me but by the end of the first part of the film i really was considering walking out!! This movie is poor in every aspect.. where is the idea or the story or the message you leave a movie with ? What were you guys trying to deliver through this monstrosity ?"

It has all the qualities of a story written by an 8 year old, who knows nothing about cloning but knows it has something to do with making duplicates..

","In 1986, a girl wanders away from her father in a carnival fair. She is shocked by a doppelganger. In the present day, the Wilson family is on vacation. They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.<br/><br/>I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is."

It looked like someone had a bad trip and decided to throw everything and the kitchen sink on film and call it a movie. ""Hey, let's toss in an amusement park, some sort of pointless 1986 flashback to Hands Across America, and how about a bunch of rabbits just 'cause! Oh, and let's put everyone in red suits. And we'll make those random bits of nonsense part of a secret underworld scenario where everyone has a double who lacks simple intelligence and the ability to speak but act out what people do above ground not much different than playing air drums in your bedroom."" I mean this was beyond ridiculous.<br/><br/>But aside from ludicrous, it was also extremely annoying. The way the female lead's doppelganger spoke was irritating and grating. But that was only enhanced by the idea that everyone else from the underground world could only grunt and scream. And that final attempt at a twist was not only predictable, it was far too late to try any form of redemption because by this point the resentment of having sat through the film was firmly in place. To add to the insult, some fool decided to let this atrocity go out to an unsuspecting public at a two hour run time. Perhaps a little courtesy in editing could have spared us maybe thirty minutes less, or better yet, 1 hour 56 minutes less. I'm amazed that time and money went into creating this grade Z cinema.

"zkonedog","10","21","42","4 April 2019"," What More Could One Ask For In A Film?!
","Back in 2017, I enjoyed Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" (giving it 8/10 stars here). However, my one ""beef"", if you will, with that flick was that I felt it couldn't stand alone without the social commentary. As a straight suspense thriller, it likely doesn't work. To me, that is where ""Us"" separates itself from even that solid effort and vaults into the rarified air of all-time classic. It is an incredible social commentary, yes, but can/could also stand alone as just a spooky horror/suspense movie nearly as well.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Us"" tells the story of the Wilson family: husband Gabe (Winston Duke), wife Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), son Jason (Evan Alex) and daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph). What starts as a pretty typical middle-class family vacation quickly takes a dark turn when a family shows up in the driveway of their getaway bungalow in the middle of the night. The Wilsons quickly discover that this mystery family is a doppelg√§nger of their own unit...but in a dark, twisted way. The alternate-Wilsons terrorize the real-Wilsons, and viewers are left in the dark until nearly the very end of the film in terms of why this is happening.<br/><br/>There are so many interesting concepts in play here, some of which include:<br/><br/>-Some great family dynamics and character-building in the early goings. For the social-message piece of ""Us"" to work we need to care about the characters, and that is not a problem here. The humor gets a bit over-the-top at times, but nothing that takes you out of the experience too much.
-The concept of doppelg√§ngers is always a bit of a spooky one, and ""Us"" plays this to the hilt. This is where the film can and does work as a straight suspense piece.
-Flashbacks centering on Adelaid's character give the film much-needed backstory and set the table for what is to come. These treks into the past are also wonderful for the little touches that Peale uses to create a sense of place, from the music to the clothing worn and the language/slang spoken.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there is the final 15-20 minutes that quite literally changes everything (which I will not entirely spoil here). There are two ways that ""twist ending"" films usually work: Either the twist comes as a complete surprise with really no way of guessing it (see: ""The Village""), or breadcrumbs are laid throughout and it still manages to catch the viewer off-guard (see: ""The Sixth Sense""). As a movie-watcher who is always very engaged in the experience, I have a tremendous amount of respect for the latter approach, and that is exactly what ""Us"" does to perfection. Not only does the ending completely shock the viewer with its social declaration and implications, but also in how certain signs were pointing that way all along.<br/><br/>Overall, there was never a single minute spent watching ""Us"" that I was disengaged from the experience. Whether it was the flashbacks, character-building, tension/suspense, or social commentary, this one had me hook, line, and sinker. I'm not usually one for immediately re-watching a film after the original viewing, but this is the rare exception in that it can be experienced in nearly a completely different way once the first viewing is complete and ""mentally processed"". To me, this is cinema at its finest."
"fedor8","Null","8","13","1 December 2019"," Another mega-stinker from an award-winning ""film-maker""... who doesn't even have a grasp of the basics.
","Starts off promisingly, with a decent enough premise for a mindless horror flick, but after the fairly ""normal"" first half-hour this cinematic roasted turkey just kept disintegrating, deflating, dumbing down, stupidifying, cretenizing.<br/><br/>In short, a typical airhead thriller - about violent kumbaya zombies holding Hands Across America. No joke. But considering the man who wrote/directed this dross, nothing should surprise us.<br/><br/>Yes, us. The victims of this monumentally idiotic movie. Us. The movie is - very mockingly - dedicated to its victimized viewers. It's about us and our patience. And our stupidity for wasting two hours on horsemanure.<br/><br/>I had no clue this was made by the rank amateur slash infamous ray-cist who created ""Get Out"", that awful white-guilt-financed/fueled Hollywood-darling (nuclear) bomb, otherwise I would have stayed away, very far, from this garbage. In fact, considering the damaged entity which made it, this is a refreshing improvement! Johnny is now officially a 1/10-level director, no longer a mere 0/10. At this rate, he should make a mediocre movie in about a decade. Fingers crossed.<br/><br/>Despite its supernatural theme, this starts playing out like a stereotypical idiotic home invasion flick as soon as the evil doubles move into action. Things get decidedly dumb from there, and I mean dumb. Nothing here makes sense. And then, just as you think it can't get any worse, it turns into a comedy. Out of the blue. Not even a funny comedy, but a cheap sit-com.<br/><br/>And then, eventually, the movie abandons comedy and goes back to ""seriovs bvsiness"" by giving us a moonwalking clone... which is technically speaking still comedy, but comedy of the unintentional variety.<br/><br/>Many whys here, extremely few becauses.<br/><br/>1. Why is Adelaide meeting her evil twin connected to other evil twins showing up in other households? Shouldn't this horror be reserved just for her? How the hell does her meeting a twin trigger a pandemic of evil twins? Is Adelaide the Spartacus of underground bunker clones? Why do evil twins wait for decades to finally start a ""revolution""? Are they so thick it took them that long to realize that they could leave their tunnels by simply moving upwards?<br/><br/>2. Why do the white-family evil twins immediately kill their originals, whereas Adelaide's parallel family takes things very slowly? If anything, shouldn't it be the opposite: doesn't the real-Adelaide-turned-zombie have EXTRA motive to take revenge on her evil nemesis by being quick and brutal? (Instead, she is used as cheesy B-movie-level exposition...)<br/><br/>3. Why does the white woman's twin not kill Adelaide? She ties her to a bed instead. Did the director tell her not to kill her because that would prevent that amazingly dumb switcheroo end-twist?<br/><br/>4. Why must we be tortured with rap music? Isn't the idiotic plot torturous enough?<br/><br/>5. Where did the government get the funding to build tunnels for millions of useless clones? It's Jimmy Carter, isn't it?<br/><br/>6. Are evil twins born out of our poops? The movie said they were coming out of sewers.<br/><br/>7. Why is the average rating for this movie so ridiculously high when negative reviews rule the ""helpfulness"" review option listing?<br/><br/>8. Why did this site allow fake reviews and concentrated hype to render averages of new movies almost entirely meaningless?<br/><br/>9. Why does the movie start off as a moody mystery but then degenerate into self-parody? ""Don't tell me you just made a Home Alone reference..."" - the line that completely sealed the movie's fate.<br/><br/>10. Why does the CNN cameraman just stand there while a maniac with a knife approaches to stab him?<br/><br/>11. Why does Adelaide's evil twin (who's actually the real Adelaide) say ""we're Americans""? What kind of idiotic answer is that? Is the film-maker trying to make some vapid ""grand"" social/political statement through this ridiculous zombie film - as he so spectacularly failed at in his previous awful movie?<br/><br/>12. Why are all evil twins born with the skills of highly-skilled ninjas? Were they bred to control their originals - or to beat the crap out of them?<br/><br/>13. Why does Adelaide's evil twin talk and reason like a class-conscious loser jealous of people who have more? ""While you got all the soft toys, I got sharp ones that hurt me."" Are the parallel demons Commies then? Why are tunnel toys sharp?<br/><br/>14. Why does this horror thriller run almost 120 minutes?<br/><br/>15. Why don't some film-makers know the basics of film-making - which includes the knowledge that horror films should never be two hours long? (Unless you're Kubrick.)<br/><br/>16. How is it possible that a family undergoing an extremely traumatic experience can start making jokes as if they're suddenly in a sitcom? ""Hey, I killed two, also!""<br/><br/>17. How is it possible that people who finish film school actually think they can casually genre-hop within one movie?<br/><br/>18. Why is it that Adelaide's son's twin imitates his movements in that bloody silly car-explosion scene? So are the demons slaves to the originals or not! Or is the director telling us that the evil kid is so thick he doesn't realize there's a fire behind him?<br/><br/>19. Why do IMDb bots have nothing better to do than help hype bad movies by posting fake reviews and swarm-voting?<br/><br/>20. Why do thick film-makers believe and hope they can get away with an explanation as dumb as the ""government created 100 million underground clones with which to control the humans above"" malarkey?<br/><br/>21. Why would ""the government"" waste trillions of dollars on such an ultra-expensive and idiotic scheme - when they can much more easily and cheaply control the rabble through CNN's fake news and liberal-propaganda brainwashing at schools and America's Mickey Mouse universities?<br/><br/>22. Why did the dilettante director pick a word as moronic as ""tethered""? Did he Google it a week before shooting started? Should Google delete this bloody stupid word from its computers so that bad directors can't find out about it hence annoy us with it in future clone flicks?<br/><br/>23. If the clones' purpose was only control of the originals, then why did they turn into kumbaya buffoons who are into Hands Across America nonsense?<br/><br/>24. If the real Adelaide came specifically for revenge (for the involuntary childhood switcheroo), then why didn't she say so at any point? She certainly wasted a lot of time on exposition, but failed to mention by far the most important thing...<br/><br/>25. If the real Adelaide was the killer all along, then how come the impostor Adelaide didn't have superior ninja skills compared to the real Adelaide who seemed as well versed in ninja-ing as the other clones? Why didn't fake Adelaide have any ninja skills? Is it because Ninja Courses start only after the age of 10 in the tunnels?<br/><br/>26. The millions of clones were ""abandoned"", and yet they survived: how? Did they go to evil-twin copies of Wal-Mart to shop? Did they butcher bunnies?<br/><br/>27. Why did the real Adelaide lose her voice in the bunkers? Was she singing Slayer songs a lot?<br/><br/>28. How come this ray-cist director didn't make a movie as bad as ""Get Out""? Why aren't white people the bad guys again?<br/><br/>29. Since when was 70s technology even remotely close to being able to clone chickens, let alone humans? What kind of a moron sets up a secret government cloning program that is based in the 70s, or maybe even earlier? (It is never hinted when the cloning started...)<br/><br/>30. What kind of deluded, confused writer-director sets up a finale battle in which the protagonist fights a DANCING, moonwalking antagonist? Why didn't he just add a laugh-track?<br/><br/>31. Why didn't the real Adelaide simply SAY that she was replaced, explaining that this is what fuels her revenge? I mean, aside from the fact that it would spoil the idiotic plot-twist that comes 90 minutes later...<br/><br/>32. Why does the imposter Adelaide behave as if she were the real Adelaide?<br/><br/>Actually, I know the answer to this one: she is a walking talking plot-device, not a real person. Neither Adelaide is real. No character in this movie is real: not the clones, nor the originals. They are all asinine jokes created in an extremely shoddy child-like screenplay written by a hugely untalented, lazy hack.<br/><br/>Let's summarize... The government was incapable of using the clones as telepaths - yet they created an army of super-strong ninja warriors... then let them rot underground instead of use them for fighting wars...? (Doesn't Unhollywood keep telling us that the ""evil military"" is always seeking for new weapons? Here's one, yet it's left abandoned! With these ninja warriors the US would have even won the war in Afghanistan.)<br/><br/>If this director had any sense he'd have set this plot in the future - not the past - and he would have devised a military conspiracy involving using clones for wars, instead of to control America's obedient sheep. The left-wing media already does that successfully enough, without the help of clones!<br/><br/>This is doubtlessly one of the dumbest movies in recent years. Its utter disregard for logic and common sense, and its schizophrenic genre-hopping, make it unique. If Ed Wood had been cloned 50 years ago (or much more likely 50 years from now) by the military, and experimented on with LSD in secret underground government bunkers, then given a camera - he would have made a movie like this."

","I didn't like it. I wanted to, but I just... didn't. It's a shame, too. As an avid movie-going African-American man married to a dreadlocked wife, a teenage girl and a young boy, no movie embodies my world better than the family dynamic in ""Us"". I am the dad in this movie. It's like he interviewed me. That said, this was two hours of what can best be described as entertaining nonsense. There's something there, just out of reach. A point to be mulled over, considered, talked about. I even saw it twice to be sure but... nah, it's definitely garbage. Maybe. Probably. The fact that I'm not sure is problematic and concerning.<br/><br/>I'm smarter than the average bear and honestly, like most art (and this IS art, no question) I feel like, if someone has to explain it, the artist did it wrong. Movies are not like other media. You get one, maybe two chances to make me relate and love your characters enough to care what happens to them - to make me watch the movie over and over again. I related and loved these characters, and tho I was captivated, I felt unsatisfied by anemic explanation of exactly what is going on in this movie's world, so at the end (two hours later), instead of what was obviously supposed to be an OMG moment of earth-shattering revelation, I'm wincing quizzically at the screen like, ""Hmm. That's probably not good."" (Yawn.)<br/><br/>In the horror movie genre, that's the definition of a dud.<br/><br/>I'll give it some time to marinate, as there's clearly a fton of subtext and Easter eggy iconography happening around the edges. Maybe it's a sleeper masterpiece and I just didn't get it yet (I'm hopeful). Still, if I'm leaving the theater twice unsatisfied, and not buzzing about what I just saw, wasn't the opportunity lost? Time will tell."
"jmholmes-73727","5","8","13","25 March 2019"," No Threat to Hitchcock Here
","The first 45 minutes are well done, as a creepy mood and menacing strangers appear, posing a direct threat to the family unit. Some grade ""A"" violence is also handled slickly. Performances are carefully designed for original mannerisms and vocal tones, particularly for the wife. But then about half way through, the script tries to explain, and rightfully so, the cause of whatever horrors are afoot in the neighborhood. The movie fails miserably to achieve this goal. It shows us a deserted subterranean laboratory and rabbits (yes, rabbits!) and these critters seem to have something to do with thousands of orange or red suited people , all holding hands, marching somewhere toward something.
Is it asking too much to have a short scene where someone TALKS and EXPLAINS what is going on?
The movie begins promisingly with fancy choral singing as the camera shows us a close-up of one caged bunny, then pans back to reveal a large wall full of the confined creatures. The people who made The Favourite knew what to do with their rabbits; these people don't."
"hotrobinproductions","10","62","143","23 March 2019"," Jordan Peele transcends horror to new heights and tests the audience
","This film is what a lot of horror movies are missing today. The deep messages in this film. Each single shot of each single frame by Jordan Peele symbolizes everything. The film is very in depth and it's a conceptual horror film. It's what scares me the most. Jump scares and tension isn't enough and that's almost what every single predictable horror film does. This film captures the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing what to expect while adding layers upon layers in the process. The fact the movie doesn't have a predictable bland jump scare fest that moviesgo for us amazing. This film is honestly comparison to the shinning. So many details layers upon layers spreaded around. The real horror is us, as people. Can you trust that you can count on us? I left the theater thinking about it so much. So many horror elements that crept me out. This is the type of film that will be looked back at years and years to come by now. Jordan Peele trancends horror yet again. Hands down the greatest movie of 2019 so far. Lead actress deserves an Oscar. Not to mention the whole casts acting was insane. Screenplay was amazing. Sound crept under my skin and made me terrified of my favorite rap songs. I will not be listening to them the same way as before. The script is amazing. The plot twist. This movie has it all and more. It can be too much for people and it can be confusing. And that's fine. Because with Jordan Peele ever since Get Out... not everything is everyone's cup of tea (pun intended) but in all honesty, US Is a film that leaps boundaries and Isn't afraid to embrace the tricks up its sleeve and Jordan Peele proves it. I honestly believe this film is a masterpiece and Jordan Peele pulls it off yet again. I'm over 20 years old and I left the film terrified. The conseptual horror is always more terrifying than almost any other horror movie that Hollywood tries to give us. It's like audiences don't want to be challenged. They want a predictable story some jump scares and a happy ending and they'll give it a good review. This film was completely off the wall and challenges the viewer with so much. 10/10 and that's my honest opinion. This movie has so much rewatch value. Just like the shining had. I will be watching this film in years to come. Movies like this holds up compared to other horror movies because you can't run away from the conseptual horror. But other films you can. Once you timed the jump scare and know the plot and figure it out the rewatch value is 0/10. US on the other hand has so much rewatch value. If I watch it again I'd probably end up with much more questions than answers and that's even more terrifying. So much conversation and things going on. I'm out of words."

","This has to be the worst piece of sh;t movie I've ever seen and I love trash movies. The seriousness that this movies has about itself is staggering and makes me want to throw up. The issues in the tone and the pacing are incredible, abhorrent and so obvious that they shouldn't even occur in a school project. The way ""scary"" or ""intense"" senses are destroyed by missplaced jokes is unbelievable and the way the story plays out just doesn't make any sense. The ""characters"" are blank sheets without any rational thought or human quality such as an instinct to survive.
The scenario itself could have been interesting but is instantly ruined and the ""message"" is a joke. The worst thing about it though is the was it thinks that its message is good and important and well transported, which is is not, same goes for the lame and overused ""plot twist"". It is a non baked social critic crammed into something that wants to be a movie and fails so miserably that I ask myself if anybody who was involved in this has ever seen a movie yet alone ever had contact to other humans. I almost had an aneurysm watching it and the fact that this hat nearly 20 times the budget of the original SAW movie just makes you realise one more time that an interesting idea and passion are worth so much more than money when it comes to art.
I wish I could eradicate every memory of this out of my brain but unfortunately I will have to be able to remember this for the rest of my life.

","You know that feeling of ""uhhh huhhh..."" when someone tries to sound intelligent about something, and they just came off and sounding foolish and morose? You know that person... They just watched a documentary, or perhaps read a Wikipedia article and then suddenly they were an expert on things like ""duality"", ""tropes"", ""Jungian Archytypes"" and such?<br/><br/>You could say it more succinctly: You know that person who wears the band t-shirt, can name the one hit song that the artist came out with... like... maybe... Thriller... and suddenly try to convince everyone that they were are the biggest fan in the world of that artist?<br/><br/>Same difference.<br/><br/>Thats kind of how this movie was. Peele tries really, really hard to sound intelligent, and to craft an intelligent narrative, but unfortunately falls so hard and so fast that the movie crashes and burns because he doesn't really understand what he is talking about in the first place. He can name drop an idea, he can loosely base an idea off of something ancient, but in the end he doesn't really get it.<br/><br/>He is flat out writing well outside his pay grade and intellect, and trying to pawn it off as a deep metaphor.<br/><br/>This movie is billed as horror, but the only horrific thing about it is that I spent 10.50 on half night movie for me and my wife. It was so bad at times it was cringy. Was it trying to be funny, or was it just so bad that it was funny? You have moments of suspense that almost pull you into the narrative, only to be immediately snapped out of it by a gag.<br/><br/>****Spoilers*****<br/><br/>The ending ultimately did it for me. I was kind of hoping the grand reveal would be a twist that would break my neck. Instead...it was cliche and contrived and really negated everything that could have been interesting about the movie. Oh boy, the old switcheroo... and now it's a revenge story.<br/><br/>That, and for some reason we really needed to hear a 3 minute expletive explaining everything that just happened, rather than letting the viewer sort it out for themselves. I guess Peele never got the memo that like a good joke, you shouldn't have to explain it, and a good story should just explain itself and leave the audience left with a bit of wonder and intrigue.<br/><br/>I've read some of the ""easter eggs"" and ""fan theories"" of the show, and for the most part the people who are getting most excited about it are people who got really into high school psychology. Beyond that it lacks any depth, any horror, and any ""gotcha"" plot twist. In a lot of way's it was more like a cheap imitation of an M. Night Shamalyan film, who if anything was mostly just a cheap knock off of Alfred Hitchcock -- a Copy of a Copy of a, if you will.<br/><br/>Granted M.Night started out pretty okay with Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, The Village and Signs... but even towards the Village and Signs you could kind of tell that he was stretching, and everything has been downhill since Lady in the Water.<br/><br/>Casting was okay, dad was a dork, the other family was more of a mocking satire than anything else, and while I had high hopes for this film being interesting, it pretty much shattered my desire for ever giving Hollywood any of my money anymore, ever again. It's really time for the land of Stardust and Celebrity to go away at this point. If this is any indication of what Jordan Peele's direction is like, then I weep for his new Twilight Zone Series as it would just be another cheap, uninteresting knockoff of something great..."

","The whole revenge plot the movie is built upon collapses in on itself when you read the story according to what the writers give you.<br/><br/>For example: the writers tell us through monologue that the clones are built to mimic the behavior of those above ground, but at the same time, the writers give them displays of freewill and personal desires. Which is not a problem on it's own; minor inconsistencies are required to form any interesting narrative. But when the protagonist, a little girl aware that she's mimicking another walks up the stairs, opens the door and is suddenly in the real world; acting with freewill, forces the other child underground as some kind of illogical vengeful desire, it creates questions and problems that were never addressed.<br/><br/>1. If the ""shadows"" exhibit freewill and a sense of curiosity and passion, why haven't any of the ""shadows"" wondered what was up a completely visible gilded staircase?<br/><br/>2. Why didn't the child, once kidnapped simply walk back up the staircase and into the free world to the saftey of her parents? Is that not what a child would desire? Not a nationwide takeover consisting of a genocide, but simply to get back to saftey?<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is the the child from the underground's fear of beaches and exhibitions of panic attacks. Why would she fear the beach? Why have panic attacks about seeing the other child when she knew full well about tethering as she's stated in her over-explanatory monologue... These scenes purely exist at the expense of the core plot and to add tension where the director could't find other ways to increase it.<br/><br/>The movie's message is blurred given these incredibly blatant plot holes as well. Classism is what most consider to be the prime theme in ""US"", But if anybody can ascend from living underground, eating raw rabbits to living above ground on a sunny beach simply by taking an escalator, is that really a case of classism? Is this a critique of critiques about classism in america shown through plot holes in a story? The answer won't ever be found organically unfortunately."

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","10","41","91","25 March 2019"," Peele excels with a perfectly crafted dark tale of identity
","As a fan of Jordan Peele's comedy work before Get Out made him into a household name as a director, I was very excited see him continue to explore social politics through horror in Us (2019). And Us (2019) is so much more complex and energetic then his last movie that only came out two years ago, that I had to watch this movie two times before giving my complete thoughts.<br/><br/>On the surface Us (2019) paints a very straightforward survival horror premise of a family called the Wilsons forced to fight against homicidal versions of themselves called the Tethered. But Peele doesn't rely on the gimmick of the killer or monster being our copies to hold it together. He merely uses it as an opportunity to go deeper into very questionable and existential ideas about human identity.<br/><br/>A large part of what holds Us together is Lupita Nyong'o dual performances as Adelaide and Red. When we first meet Adelaide she is this paranoid mother worried about her family's safety and is driven to extreme lengths to keep them safe from her Tether copy Red. And with Nyongo playing Red as well, she makes every single uncanny bodily movement and every word from her rasping voice to feel both terrifying the as film's villain but also evoke the harsh reality she comes from. But as the story evolves, Nyong'o brings more dimensions to both her characters that go beyond the final girl and slasher villain in a horror film. Adelaide becomes more assertive and aggressive in her actions and we then see the tragedy that Red has been carrying for decades that acts as fuel for her violent revolution. It's a difficult challenge for someone to bring this much depth to two characters in one movie but Nyongo's deserves as many awards as possible for achieving it.<br/><br/>Now that Peele's gets to play with a larger scope, we see that he gets to have more fun within horror and comedy. While Get Out was a slow burn to the horror's reveal, Us immediately sets it in motion within the first 30 minutes. The sequence of the Tether breaking into the Wilson's home is probably one of the scariest sequences I have seen in recent years. From there the movie never slows down to make you feel like the Wilsons are safe from this threat. But the horror never becomes overwhelming thanks to Peele's expertise in comedy to be used in the right moments. A lot of it comes from how well the humour is written within the characters themselves from Winston Duke's surprisingly hysterical portrayal of an ignorant nerdy dad and husband to the son played in a breakout performance by Alex Jones unintentionally being self-aware of the crazy situation they are in.<br/><br/>While Get Out made it very clear from the start it was about racism, Us plays it more subtly with its social messaging. Using the creepy imaginary of mirroring and contrasting visuals and sequences of repetition (just like last year's The Favourite it make flocks of rabbits evoke dread), it not only foreshadows the darkness that is to come but also reinforce the themes of dual identities. And examining closely through certain lines of dialogue and scenes, Peele is very much making a commentary on America's economy and class-system. Through the Wilson's middle-class perspective of what to them seems like twisted versions of themselves invading their home, Us reveals the misguided views society has on those that lack the upper-class's benefits and awards. And when the Wilsons are forced to breakaway from their carefree identities in order live; it only proves they can be just as savage as their own Tethers.
Particularly reflecting on the refuge crisis happening today during the Trump administration, Adelaide and Red's conflict becomes less about the duality between good and evil and more about whom deserves the better life and what is it worth to gain and keep that life.<br/><br/>Easily the best movie this year so far and is defiantly made be to watched more then once."

"shanemoose-88715","10","54","124","23 March 2019"," Brother's gonna freak you out!
","The most interesting thing about 'Us' is the fact Jordan Peele doesn't just play with the themes of humanity, American society, and ""Nature vs. Nurture"", but I feel that he also plays with the audiences' and the critics' expectations of him as a filmmaker. Peele clearly wanted to prove that he wasn't just a funnyman who got lucky with 2017's 'Get Out' and he does so by coming back to the director's chair guns blazing with his naturally-terrifying and a surprising-funny second helping of Horror; complete with a chilling score and a cast of excellent actors. At this point, Peele has proved that he could hang with the big boys with this perfect modern-day Horror classic."
"HollyGolightly61","8","32","69","22 March 2019"," Decent horror film with great acting
","Us is a horror movie with a story plot not fully realized. It's not the kind with stupid jump scares and well-executed. But the story doesn't explain a lot of it. When they tried to do it in last 15 mins made it weird and exhausting. I think horror can be generated leaving the story in ambiguity. The twist at the end is actually revealed in the trailer which took away the surprise element. Like Get Out, the comedy come pretty naturally.
The focus of the movie is Adelaide (Lupita N'yongo) and her doppelg√§nger. Lupita just hits the ball out of the park as her doppelg√§nger feels like a different individual. Other actors were good too. Acting and music is the best part of the movie.
It might be one of those movies which can be much appreciated on second viewing after reading the subtle commentary Peele leaves under the story. It is a decent movie and original compared to all the recycled and sequels content out there."

"dunnypop","10","47","107","25 March 2019"," US is the reason why I love Horror movies
","A true horror movie is one that grasps concepts and ideas like the recent Hereditary or Babadook and provoke thought well after the film like Get Out or even Martyrs (the original).<br/><br/>US is a masterclass of cinema. It's very well shot, well acted, well written and it's thought provoking. The idea of dopplegangers didn't really appeal to me but after the initial meeting of the characters, it really worked well. The audience was fully engaged and the movie worked on an entertainment level. It was pretty fun.<br/><br/>After watching the film, I spent the next hour with friends discussing ""what was Us"" really about as it isn't as obvious as Get Out. Is it about xenophobia, America, identity, government conspiracies etc....?<br/><br/>Not a mainstream horror film, which I can see why there are low ratings as the majority want to see something a bit more obvious in terms of the underlining message. Definitely a masterclass in cinema."
"jasmccoll","10","31","67","31 March 2019"," Simply Stunning
","I thought it was fantastic. Lupita Nyong'o's performance is nothing short of stunning, and he films underlying message is powerful, and subtley handled. The film (or at least, how I viewed the film) is about a disenfranchised lower class overrunning their so-called superiors after realising that they are the same - they are all Americans. The Tethered rather bizarrely go on to do what the surface people could never do themselves, finishing Hands Across America. It's set up as a standard home-invasion thriller but grows into something so much more.<br/><br/>There are definitely holes that you can poke into the plot (Why don't the Tethered just wander out of the tunnel, who's feeding the rabbits, etc. etc), but to me the plot really just felt like a vehicle for the message Peele was trying to bring across. The power of this message, combined with some absolutely stunning performances and cinematography, resulted in a film that stuck with me long after the credits rolled."

"jrgreenjr","6","18","36","22 March 2019"," A very well executed mess
","I'm still trying to digest what I just saw,
The positives:
1). Great music, great use of hip hop, especially ""I've got five on it"" and the score as well, the orchestral opening song was perfect
2). The color palette and set design give it a pretty unique look and feel, the opening especially
3). Jordan Peele is very creative, and that shows in small details and in his writing and take on this type of story
4). It was funny, although not all jokes landed or were perfectly timed, especially for the tone it was going for
5). It tried to be its own thing
6). I enjoyed the minimalist opening, wish there was more of that feel than the straightforward approach, with confusing details
7). From the start I felt personality in most the characters and I cared about them
8). Some interesting themes, that could have been explored better
The negatives:
1). The ending made no sense at all! Why would her doppelg√§nger replace her, and the real version of her doesn't try to leave earlier? why does she plan a revolt against all humans instead of just killing her doppelg√§nger and replacing her?
2). How is the ending a happy ending for the doppelg√§nger? All the other doppelg√§ngers are taking over, their family has to live in a post apocalyptic land, yet it is played off like the doppelg√§nger won
3). The twist was unwarranted, like I thought it could go there, but don't really know what it accomplishes besides just shock from the audience
4). Why do they use scissors? I get the whole paper doll thing but that's not an effective murder weapon for just the symbolism
5). Why are they holding hands? Besides the fact that they're supposed to represent the paper dolls? What does that accomplish besides symbolism?
6). Some of the jokes are totally out of place, it cuts the tension when it should have weight in certain areas. It is written like a comedy even though it's going for something different. Comedy is fine if it is used well, not creating a conflicting tone to the whole point of the movie
7). It sort of devolves into a chase/thriller that has a twist ending instead of the whole meaning making itself more apparent throughout the film
8). Kind of anticlimactic feeling"

"mattsky99","Null","2","2","31 December 2019"," Great potential gone astray
","Spoilers alert<br/><br/>The premise is original and intriguing but my views are as follows.<br/><br/>The film would have been easier to digest of were a book because the visuals of the scale start to beg questions immediately. I think it would have been better set in a small, sleepy town to account for some of this. Think a Stephen King type town. Then it could be accounted for how they ate, where they got their hair cut, had diets that made them of similar size of their top dwelling counterparts, ad nauseam. And why, when the project was scrapped they were not ""appropriately dealt with."" If it were an eccentric billionaire that was trying to develop an organ growing clone program on a small scale and stumbled upon the mental connection between the human and clone, a lot of these questions go away.<br/><br/>A second criticism is the inconsistencies of the characters. Sometimes smart and clever, sometimes seemingly learning impaired (car keys, stopping to catch their breath at the most inopportune times, again and again, etc). We were told that the main character had a special connection with her counterpart, the dancing and such, but when the friends twins were killed by theirs, the tunnel dwellers suddenly had exquisite gymnastic skills. I know many theories can try to explain this, but they all just lead to more questions. That was added frustration that compounded the question raised by the scale.<br/><br/>I hope this was a product of studio/outside influence on Peele, and not a sign his going to follow the career path of M. Knight.<br/><br/>I will definitely be watching Peele's next film. I hope that he pays attention to fair criticisms of Us."

I was picturing a barren underground wasteland similar to The Upside-Down from Stranger Things. The tunnels actually looked pretty decent. Everything was clean and organized, the people wore regular clothing, and they all had decent beds. There are people living on Earth now that don't have that. Also it seemed like they really only gave the main characters a scary set of doppelg√§ngers. Everyone else just looked dirty. Also that dance thing at the end was stupid.

Don't the tethered follow the course of the people above? Seems like going down the escalator changed who was in charge yet it's not a magical escalator this area was made by the government of some sort apparently..<br/><br/>3. And here's the worst, she was abducted around the age of 10... don't you think she would remember beging abducted and taken downstairs? Why does she act the whole time like she was never taken? Some sort of magical amnesia that only showed itself during her murder? I could go on but i think you get the point. The story had some major issues in a couple spots that don't add up.

I find it frustrating to include illogical, inexplicable and impossible elements in a world where all else is normal.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where the writer/director has spent too much time attempting to deliver a rather flimsy metaphor and not enough time delivering something cohesive enough to align with the basis of the movie.<br/><br/>Worth a watch but don't believe the hype."

I wanted to support the fact that it has a predominantly black cast and for all the right reasons.. instead I find my mind wandering throughout the film, couldn't get into it at all and had to force myself to watch it..<br/><br/>The male lead character was so laidback it was like he was just reading his lines because he had to. The female lead was slightly better but not enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>The storyline is so ludicrous but even that was ruined even more at the ending. There's a section where the family is tallying up their kills, even that's stupid..<br/><br/>I think without the OTT reception to the fact that this is a predominantly black cast, during a time where everyone is focused on colour.. this wouldn't have made it past a rating of 5.

"Naive-fox","4","2","2","24 July 2019"," A change for the worse
","Peele's directorial debut 'Get out' was far from perfect. But that was simply because it didn't deliver on the big picture. Then again, there was a lot of good things that showed how good Peele's work could get by just adjusting a few details. So, with a bit more experience on his back and a very promising trailer, 'Us' was expected to be most likely his first masterpiece and a well awaited return to the good atmospheric horror in an era plagued by supernatural or posession movies driven by jumpscares, completely dark scenes and overly strident music scores.<br/><br/>And for a short time he delivers. Not kicking out some of his old habits, Jordan Pelee still creates a great opening that -although too reminiscent of 'The strangers'- sets an incredibly eerie ambience and introduces some of the creepiest antagonists/killers the horror cinema has ever seen -thanks mainly to some awesome acting from the cast, specially the younger ones-. Then the film suddenly takes a turn. For the worse. For the very worst. After building this tense and serious atmosphere the story simply derives in some strangely clumsy comedy, with cringy catchphrases, clichee situations and a vibe more reminiscent of 'Zombieland' or 'Shawn of the dead' than a proper horror movie. And just so, the dread feeling and the sensation of danger vanish. All that remains is a mediocre movie that fails as a horror tale and doesn't deliver on the comedy or suspense either. The jokes are cheap, the backstory of the menace is never told -aside from a vague nonsensical explanation of their creation and a very mainstream motivation for their actions- and the overly open ending just adds more salt to the wound of finishing watching a movie that promised so much and not only failed to become a milestone of modern horror, but also fell way short of being a thrilling watch."

","I thought I would really like this. The general premise, the trailers, and the previous work by Jordan Peele. Nope. The plot made no sense whatsoever. There were way too many failed attempts to try to make this a ""funny"" thriller, with sitcom-like joke lines randomly & awkwardly inserted. Just didn't work. It not only wasn't funny, but it ruined alot of what would have been good suspense & tension. As many have mentioned, the underlying story was eye-rollingly nonsensical. Someone could have at least crafted SOME sort of quasi-believable story to account for the dopplegangers. It was somewhat watchable, but would have been less disappointing if I had expected a low-budget, Netflix/Redbox-style piece of garbage from the get-go.

","Jordan Peele's second feature length film will probably disappoint audiences and horror fans, who liked Get Out and where expecting to get another good and even great horror film. It does have very interesting ideas that everyone can have many ways and opportunities that they can present them and giving them a new spin, but unfortunately they chose to do it in a very unsatisfying way by making it very generic and something that it's done before and not being scary at all. It has great sound and great performances (especially from Lupita Nyong'o) that for some may find it very weird or laughable in a few moments, but it still works. Those are the only things that work, while the music was weak (aside from three tracks that are great); the dialogue was not bad, but very standard at best; the editing was something that didn't impress me and was very unnoticeable; the cinematography, although there were some nice shots, it wasn't enough for me and half of the characters were just fine, while Lupita's character and her family were great and likable. Overall it's a film that is not special and doesn't stand out at all and i hope Jordan Peele see what worked and what didn't and learn from his mistakes, so that his next projects can be great, even beyond that."

I think the performance by Lupita was incredible and it made the movie watchable, but there were too many things I felt the movie fell short in. I'm aware of the symbolisms throughout the movie and that's great and all, but theres nothing ""deep or complexed"" about the movie us reviewers are missing for why we give it a lows score. If there was a profound life lesson to this, it was poorly executed. Sad, because it had so much potential and I really wanted to love it."

But most problematic are the plot holes. If the main female protagonist really was switched in 1980's why did we see PTSD type aversion to heading to Santa Cruz? If they had switched places why wasn't Red, up in the real world bumping into walls etcetera to mimic the movements of its human self in the tunnels?<br/><br/>Loads of unanswered questions.

"garymathe-76173","7","2","2","18 June 2019"," Misunderstood, flawed, but not bad.
","This is a very misunderstood movie that will not resonate with most. Once the viewer realizes that the tethered represent the forgotten masses at the bottom of society (see details at the end of my review), things make much more sense, but a horror movie may not be the best vehicle to make that point, and the message doesn't become clear until the end, and for most, not even then.
The acting is good for the most part, the cinematography is great, and the score is apt and enjoyable. There are funny moments (some intentional, some not) and loads of cultural references (mostly from the 80s).
Now for the explanation:
The tethered look like us and try to act like us, but they are forced to live in the shadows/underground simply due to their social/financial status. It's even mentioned in the movie that they are Americans. At some point they are bound to find a leader and rise up, which includes violence. The human chain at the end is a reference to Hands Across America, a 1986 initiative to help the poor. This is not simply a theory, as Jordan Peeele himself talked about the theme of the movie."

","This movie seemed interesting at first, because I listened to the reviews on it and heard good things. Well... I was tricked again.<br/><br/>The movie gives you a text card at the start to get you thinking about underground tunnels or whatever... not much meat on that bone to be honest. We dip into a boardwalk carnival in Santa Cruz where this little girl finds an old sideshow attraction that apparently is the entrance to a secret underground clone lab. Turns out her and her clone that live in this lab are 'tethered' and end up finding each other in this sideshow house of mirrors thing. The issue is that the clones are soulless, so they're inherently evil, or have gone crazy due to having no souls and being trapped underground forced to mimic their counterpart's movements above ground. (yeeeeah, ok)<br/><br/>Anyway, fast forward to the meat, there's a huge clone vs original battle between basically everyone. The clones have escaped the underground compound because they got tired of the lack of sunlight and eating rabbits. Basically we end up back at the boardwalk after clone apocalypse occurs. The lead girl goes back into the house of mirrors, finds the entrance to the compound, finds her clone again, kills it, and then leaves with her family... to where? Who knows. Mexico apparently, and no idea why. What's weird is after the clones have killed their originals, they join hand to hand to form a human chain across the globe... this includes going underwater... so I'm not sure how they're living through that since the clones are just as fragile as we are.<br/><br/>Turns out at the end that the original little girl was replaced by her clone at a young age, and then was the one who rallied the clones to the surface while the little girl's clone carried on about life... seemingly forgetting she was a soulless clone monster thing.<br/><br/>This movie was pretty ridiculous, boring, and all around poorly written with predictable twists and turns. I wasn't impressed. The big father who plays Um'baku in Black Panther was emasculated the entire movie... made out to be a giant wuss for the most part. Everything else was just a lot ""huh?"" and ""what... why?"" Like why are these clones hell bent on doing a hands across america (world) remake?

The story rests on a dumb, half-baked premise that gets revealed in the last ten minutes, leaving you to wonder if Jordan Peele got himself out of the corner he painted himself into in the story by just shoving the exposition at the end and adding a Shyamalan-esque twist to divert the audiences thinking away from the underdeveloped concept. In fact, I would rather have seen a movie based on the sci-fi concept (I'm trying not to give out spoilers here) than what we got.
That story could have been in the vein of a movie like Ex-Machina. Instead, we got a Stranger Things version of Michael Haneke's Funny Games (a FAR superior home invasion movie that deals with class struggles), complete with nostalgic references and straight rip-offs of other movies under the guise of homage.<br/><br/>Seriously, go see Us (just because) and then watch Funny Games and Ex-Machina back-to-back and you'll see what a letdown Us is."

If the doppelganger survived so long and had a family, what does it matter that she's really just the doppelganger? (Nobody noticed she wasn't ""human""? After having TWO kids? Wow her husband is dense.) Why would her son be afraid since she's really his mother, doppelganger or not? This is why you shouldn't make a movie merely based on a good pitch, Hollywood.

"harrylosborne","7","2","2","3 April 2019"," A novel approach to horror, but too much left unsolved
","I like that Jordan Peele has been trying to think outside the box with his latest releases: Get Out was a decent flick, and I am excited to watch his reimagining of The Twilight Zone. Us stays true to this theme, exploring the duality of people through the Wilsons' ""evil halves"". Visually, this film is excellent, representing both 1980s and the present day strongly. Moreover, the use of colour (primarily red) and set design allows this film to smoothly work across different environments without feeling forced. Easter eggs and hidden clues are featured throughout if you look hard enough, which is an enticing proposition for the more hardcore film fan.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, the strong cast is brilliantly headlined by Lupita Nyong'o, who is perfect as both the cautious mother and estranged doppelganger. Credit must also be given to Elizabeth Moss, who demonstrates more of her range than most fans will be accustomed to (a very different tone to The Handmaid's Tale). Nyong'o plays the only truly serious role, with most others being utilised more comedically. The score for the film allows serious tension to build in some of the scenes - ""I Got Five On It"" is the key tune, used both in lighthearted and menacing scenarios to keep a constant flow to the film. Similar techniques have been used successfully in other movies, and to great effect here as well.<br/><br/>The only real drawback for me is the lack of clarity the viewer is left with after the credits roll. I respect that Peele spent more time on the story than on the scares - this simple but often overlooked point explains why the horror genre is oversaturated but underwhelming. However, too much is left to the spectator to decide... (without spoiling anything, rabbits?). Some may find this freedom to interpret beneficial, but I would prefer conclusion so as to make a proper judgement on the film's core principles, without being clouded by other mitigating factors.<br/><br/>Overall, Us is a fine addition to the horror genre, breathing new life into a category cluttered with the same plots and tropes: Peele seems to do no wrong at the moment, and I will be eager to watch anything he directs in the near future."
"abhaddakedhabhra","7","2","2","3 April 2019"," Suspenseful, Scary, Silly...
","I spent much of this film writhing around in my chair, and even had to close my eyes at a couple of points. Peele is a fantastically talented director, and the film starts off with plenty of promise, I was enraptured for the first 40 minutes. However, the next hour drags on, and while the rhythm of suspense - jumpscare - suspense - jumpscare has a brilliantly brooding creepiness to it, it just gets a bit tiresome after a while, and for the last half hour I was waiting for it to hurry up and get it over with.
Get Out is definitely deeper and stronger as a film, this is all just a bit confused and fumbling. Nevertheless, it is very well crafted, so worth a watch if you fancy raising your heartbeat for a couple of hours."
"duongconghuy","6","2","2","1 April 2019"," Feels empty
","To be honest, I don't even feel like I was watching anything because everything seems really out of place and the characters didn't really have a backstory. Except for the main character, of course! I was hoping for some exciting things to happen but it wasn't really there. The film didn't have any climaxes, it felt really rushed and unfinished. It was not up to my expectations, if they had more time and better plot then I bet they could have lived up to it and to it's true potential. I didn't feel much like a horror movie because it wasn't really scary at all, also a bit of comedy which seems kinda out of place. Overall, it was not like 'Get Out' but it sure has many hidden meanings. But meanings that require researches on the Internet. Also it didn't make me think much about what was happening and it was a mess."

"staciewilliams-89515","6","2","2","22 March 2019"," Tonally Inconsistant, But Entertaining Horror Pic
","Everyone wants Jordan Peele's follow up to his breakthrough smash, Get Out, to be equally as brilliant. Us has some great ideas and performances, but ends up a bit shaky due to odd tonal shifts.<br/><br/>Us lays on the mood fairly thick during its first 20/30 minutes as our heroine, Addie (a terrific Lupita Nyong'o) is plagued with what she describes as a ""black cloud"" over her family's vacation to a beach where she had a traumatic incident as a child. Fairly soon, Addie's fears prove to be well founded when a family of scissor-wielding dopplegangers break into their vacation house and terrorize them.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the moment the dopplegangers break in is the moment where the film's tone starts swerving in and out of the horror and dark comedy lanes. Granted, a few of the jokes do land because they feel like something a real human being would say/do in this same situation, but a lot of them feel far too goofy and this leads the film into a fairly bizarre 2nd act that feels more like a feel good/kick ass zombie-killing movie from the 80's, destroying the somber tone conjured in the film's first half hour.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that the 2nd act of Us isn't a rollicking good time - it is, but it seems so far removed from what the film had originally been building towards. Imagine if you switched the channel midway through The Innocents and happened upon Night of the Creeps or Waxwork. They're all great movies, but their styles couldn't be further from each other and, if you tried to mix them together, you'd probably get something like this.<br/><br/>Us wraps up with a fairly odd twist that'll probably leave you scratching your head. Perhaps if the film had been more goofy from the start and carried this tone throughout, one could laugh it off and just chalk it up to a fun, cheesy time, but it seems like Us wants us to be scared sometimes, too. It wants us to laugh at the strange, inhuman growls of its antagonists and be petrified of them at the same time and that's just not going to happen.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - Us is far from the dreaded sophomore slump for Jordan Peele. He still has an eye for great shots, tongue in cheek humor, and creative storytelling, but it doesn't come together the way it should. It's still worthy of a watch, though."

","I've never been a big fan of Jordan Peele's horror movies and I don't think I'm gonna be one in the near future. Everyone declares ""Get Out"" as great but I think I'm the only one who is disappointed by the happy ending (though satisfying). Same case with this year's ""Us"", well, almost. Added with the plot twist that I think is quiet nonsensical even to the standard of this movie's logic. Some parts are pretty inconsistent too, like when the protagonists' dopplegangers decide to ""play"" with their victims first but the others' are not so benevolent (still can't understand why besides their statuses as main characters allow them to survive till the credit rolls). I think this will be an on-going trend of reviewing Peele's written and directed next horror franchises: When (almost) everyone (especially the critics) says it's great and frightening, I say it's just good, but not more than that."

The movie at first start as a home invasion movie, then it goes into a slasher movie, then it goes into a horror chase movie and as the plot progresses, it evolves something bigger than you could have imagined.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to the end.

","...Them. The rich and the poor. The wealhy and the impoverished. The ones and the others. The people and the puppets. The living and their shadows.<br/><br/>Us is the second movie directed by the highly-respected Jordan Peele, who made ""Get Out"" 2 years ago. This horror film manages to do so many things in its limited runtime. It succeeds at being a fun, scary an entertaining ride without losing its social and political themes.<br/><br/>The film talks about disciminations and class diferences in a fresh and exciting way and proves that such social problems are still present. We have our luxurious houses, our well-cooked meals, our comfortable lifestyles and because of our easiness we tend to forget about ""Them"", the ones who suffer, who are in pain or the ones who help and try but never get a reward. ""Us"" is parltly about all these intriguing themes, but never forgets that it is also a film and a dark and fun experirience and not just a politically driven story.<br/><br/>Its nicely shot, some of the shots actually ahve hidden meanings and clues or the development of the story. The acting is spot on, with Lupita playing 2 really demanding roles giving her most shocking performance yet. The soundtrack is great and some of the songs are used a contrast to the events of the film and make for a good laugh. The movie has its humor too, but sometimes I felt that it was too much with it.<br/><br/>The script is really one of a kind. It might not be 100% original, but it is presented in such a way that the point it tries to make are clear while being such a good cinematic experience. It is of a bigger scale and has a lot of plot points that are clever.<br/><br/>Now, the bads. Firstly, like most films of its genre, it has a banch of forced moments and some characters take really stupid decisions. Sometimes, during the 2nd act, it loses its weight as a story and has a lot of ups and downs in its tone. One joke comes after the other and I kind of forgot that I was watching a horror film. And the twist in the end is sooooooooooooooooo predictable and I'm still not sure if it is really important. They could have just go for something more ambiguous or give a hint or something.<br/><br/>But, overall that's a good horror-social commentary-comedy! Jordan Peele makes his own kind of movies and tries to explore and talk about global and ""US "" issues in startling, new ways. Even if I'm not sure if ""Us"" and ""Get Out"" belong in the same universe, they are great and significant films and deserve your attention!<br/><br/>8/10 Watch in the cinemas with your shadow and have some scissors with you..."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","21","44","23 March 2019"," Us is tethered to enormous pressure, but only just succeeds.
","Jordan Peele has now made a name for himself in Hollywood. 'Get Out', in my opinion at least, is a fresh modern masterpiece and many share the same sentiment. With that, he built up this colossal amount of pressure. Could he actually deliver the same amount of inventive quality that blends a variety of genres and convey social commentary? Well, that's up for debate. Whilst I found Us to be a decent comedic thriller, admittedly the feeling of doubt and disappointment overwhelmed me. Peele's reach far exceeded his grasp, and that consequently hindered the film's execution. A family, relaxing on holiday within a picturesque lake house, encounter another family who inadvertently invade their home and wish to kill them. They soon realise that these crazy individuals are actually ""Us"".<br/><br/>An innovative premise that upholds an ominous aura. A visionary picture exhuming apocalyptic biblical references, oozing dread and despair through hellish behaviour. Commenting on the social normality of modern American citizens and their reliance on consumerism to differentiate wealth classes. The ""Tethered"" symbolising one's own self-destruction during times of increased turmoil. Suffice to say, Peele once again has managed to create a world with many layers. Allowing you to ""peele"" them back immediately after the credits roll. I take no issue with his ambition.<br/><br/>Neither do I have any problems with the characters and performances. This relatively young family provide plenty of banter and dark humour amidst this heightened situation. The parents attempt to provide security for their children, which naturally conjures up themes of parental influence. The children gradually showing signs of inspirations from their parents, whilst succumbing to the violent behaviour of modern society. Swinging golf clubs at jaws and smashing precious rocks into craniums. All energetically performed by its cast, who all feature juxtaposing dual performances. Nyong'o stealing the show with her wildly contrasting performances that felt both unsettling and reassuring. Duke provided much of the humour that enhanced the accessibility and enjoyability of this darkly sinister feature. Moss also gave a surprisingly creepy performance.<br/><br/>Peele's directing style is solid yet again and utilises some inventive shots in an attempt to crank up the tension. Slow panning, dimly lit environments and much focus on character faces, in particular their eyes. The cinematography was gorgeous and aided in visualising various ""twists and turns"". Oh, and bonus points for playing some Janelle Mon√É¬°e.<br/><br/>But, despite the overall praise I have for this film, I have issues. Quite a few of them actually. Peele tried so hard in creating this ambiguous vision, that it hindered the numerous genre traits. It's not remotely humorous, it's rarely thrilling and the scares were non-existent. Inadvertently, this forces the pace to be inconsistent and unfortunately the narrative never really gripped me. Putting aside the tonal shifts, these evocative emotions that we the audience are supposed to experience are diminished by Peele's screenplay that exhumes far too much exposition. Towards its climactic third act, nearly every element to the mysterious ""Tethered"" is heavily explained. This includes their motive, their backstory and their plan. All in precise detail. This clearly detracts from Peele's intentions in creating an ambiguous piece, and unlike 'Get Out', the final twist was predictable from the start. I was never on the edge of my seat, and not once had my mouth gaping from any unexpected twists (despite Peele trying).<br/><br/>In the end, it's just a home invasion thriller with an inventive religious spice. Intended to be something more, yet unable to fully blend the various genres, therefore producing a wave of disappointment. I'm probably going to say something that may ignite some discussion, but it's how I feel. Had this been directed by a lesser known director, the average rating would be much lower. However due to Peele's name being attached, it seems that many (including critics) are being far too generous. Another underwhelming flick from 2019."

I felt I had missed certain details that could have potentially added to my viewing experience. Then I went back to see Us for the second time and I felt so much more of the film worked. It became clear that something was wrong with Adelaide from the beginning and I was suddenly shocked that the rest of the audience had no idea. I also had heard a theory since my first viewing of the movie that Jason also was switched out like his mother (likely on an earlier trip to Santa Cruz), which the film also hints to numerous times. These clues include the fact that he cannot work his magic toy, but his tethered version can, he is the only family member who seems to figure out that Adelaide isn't who she says she is, he knows words that he shouldn't, and Adelaide seems to potentially realize the tethered Jason is the real Jason when he steps into the fire in the third act of the film. She suddenly seems to be at a loss when this happens, moments after she is about to kill him herself. Anyways, these are all just theories of course but I really do believe the film has a lot to offer and does make at least enough sense to work as a movie.

I like the cinematography and many of the shots are striking and one shot pays homage to another iconic film: The Shining. I want to see this movie again. The casting was absolutely wonderful."

","This film is a work of art. The cinematography, sprinklings of humour, moments of utter terror, suspense, alternative theories... Oh and the musical score combined with breathtaking acting made this a film worth its 10/10 rating.
My daughter and I almost changed our plans by falling for the low ratings and negative imdb reviews - but the metacritic review was high, so we went to the cinema anyway. Thank goodness. If you're intelligent and creative then go and see US."

"vigilantereviewer","8","21","45","23 March 2019"," Really good film, but not Peele's best
","Jordan Peele's Us is pretty good, but it has flaws. The movie has a great cast with an especially fantastic performance by Lupita Nyong'o. Once again Peele offers a horror movie with great cinematography and a suspense-filled score. The movie is great until the end starts approaching. The scene that reveals what's going on is very weirdly written and shot, and even with Lupita's great performance in the scene, it feels very off. The premise and idea of the movie is great, but the movie isn't as good as it's idea. Overall it's a really good film, but it isn't Jordan Peele's best."
"bsempowski","10","34","79","26 March 2019"," Jordan Peele has created another hit
","This movie is amazing the soundtrack is extremely creepy and well paid for the movie. the fact that all the actors play two characters is extremely impressive. The performance of the doppelg√§ngers in this film is extremely creepy and unsettling. The doppelg√§ngers also give this movie a very personal sense of horror. You can really imagine your own doppelg√§nger following you home with scissors. This really adds to the old psychological terror of this movie. The movie also uses symbols like hands across America and turns them into dark creepy symbols of the destruction of humanity. This movie is amazing and Elisabeth Moss is extremely creepy. This movie will make you think of people smiling and completely new way. The movie also has an amazing twist is on the level of the six cents. This movie does not compare to get out but I believe this movie is super different I cannot be compared. This movie is more traditional horror but demonstrates. Films like this had turned black people from the victims of horror movies into the heroines. this movie also has some hilarious comic relief and multiple dad jokes. the most hilarious part of the movie is when one of the characters asks Alexa like device to call the police but instead it plays a rap song about the police. The compilation this film ensures that you are not scared the entire time. This movie isn't a traditional horror movie instead it's more of a thriller and post-apocalyptic story. Also the film's idea that there's an entire secret underground full of all humanities doppelg√§ngers is deeply unsettling. The end this film is amazing and will leave you wanting more. You will also never look at scissors, rabbits, smiles or hands across America the same way."

","I almost never write reviews, but I had to for this movie! Jordan Peele is a very funny, creative, and I would say a misterious persons. This movie definitely shows his personality while making this movie, and how good of a writer and director he is! This movie really made me think of the whole concept of the movie, which I'm still not too sure about. Can't wait for it to be in the dollar theater in my town and on redbox so I can watch it again! I think every movie, no matter what genre should always have a splash of comedy, and there was many splashes in the movie and I absolutely loved it! I don't have enough words to explain how great the movie was. It was a great horror/comedy, and he kept it classy by not showing any gory scenes, which wakes it kid friendly too. Good job Jordan Peele, I cant wait to see what you have in store next."

","""Us"" felt like an idea for an hour long Black Mirror episode unnecessarily stretched into a 2-hour snore-fest. It started out promisingly, with nice cinematography and some decent atmosphere. But as soon as the cards were on the table, it took a nose dive that lasted for 3/4 of the running time. The more exposition it provided, the less sense it made and the more eager to leave the cinema I became. The ending only made things worse.

"knightmartha","4","14","28","22 March 2019"," Such a letdown. US was just ""OK""
","First off....Lupita Nyongo was/is OVERHYPED in this role!!!!! OMG. The tethered version of her was way better than her normal person role. She, Winston Duke and the son Jason were severely overcast. The 2 young girl leads as well as Elisabeth Moss's entire family were spot on! Madison Curry as young Adelaide made this movie for me. Her parents were also decent in their roles. I don't usually care about plot holes, BUT I REALLY WISH J.P. would have shown us detail into the new Adelaide's transition and what happened to the stolen Adelaide. I wish he had shown new Adelaide in old Adelaide's home, interaction with parents, friends, etc. Is Winston Duke English? Both he and Lupita had these accents that kept coming out....were they meant to be ""bougie"" black people who talked white? Or is that their normal accents???? Didn't care for Winston Duke's 6 foot tall oafish demeanor. Loved the visual of the Tethered holding hands at the end and throughout the movie. Best parts of ENTIRE MOVIE was the amusement park scenes and when the tethered were mirroring what their doubles were doing above ground. More background would have been great in the underground tunnels....maybe if Adelaide had walked into a scientists/doctor's office/lab and saw some old photos, maps of tunnels, a binder telling us about experiments....SOMETHING!!!!! Would not pay to see this again. Again, young Adelaide/Madison Curry MADE THIS MOVIE for me. She carried. Lupita....I actually wished the above ground Lupita died. Ugh."

","So I wasn't going to write a review about this movie but I scrolled down the reviews (About 60% of people had a similar opinion) and I see someone else write ""Move over John Carpenter."" in reference to Jordan Peele's career because of this movie.<br/><br/>... To even compare ""Us"" or ""Get Out"" (better movie, but thats a different story) for that matter to the work of John Carpenter (Assault on Precinct 13, The Thing, etc.) is downright lunacy.<br/><br/>""Us"" fails as a horror film, a comedy, psychological thriller, social commentary, or whatever genre this movie was going for. It never scares you, the non-forced laughs are few and far between, and the plot had so many holes built off of uninteresting characters that you never really care about what happens to anyone including the big ""twist"" at the end. Every interesting concept that made up the stunning trailer for this film was ruined from an unfinished, ludicrous screenplay that I guess we're supposed to excuse because there are some interesting images planted throughout movie.<br/><br/>I'm sure it'll make tons of money because the critics have no balls and it was marketed brilliantly, but this was a terrible movie. I think the originality and artistic ambition gives it an edge over truly horrific work like the DCEU movies, Bright, etc. But don't waste your money on this, just wait for Redbox or get it for free."

It seemed they were building to the great reveal and what the reveal ends up being is underwhelming, corny, and predictable.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't sure what it wanted to be.

"brodybrugman","9","13","26","24 March 2019"," Us is a phenomenal horror
","First off I've been anticipating this movie for months ever since the trailer dropped because I thought get out was a great thriller and overall had a great plot and the originality of that film felt real. So this one was high on my list of movies to see in 2019. And I experienced one of the best films ever. Now there will be spoilers from now on.<br/><br/>
First off just to get this out of the way the cinematography and score was amazing. Second off the directing and screenplay from Jordan peels was amazing couldn't of done a better job. Third off the homages from classic horror movies and 80s and 90s nostalgia was amazing for example when the Tyler's tethered arrived and the twins died the shining reference was very there and that feels good when you know a director knows his horror movies and examples of the homages come from such as nightmare on elm street,chud and such more. Also a side note the micheal Jackson and hands across America was amazing and the classic 90s hip hop was great. Fourth off the twist started feeling more real towards the end when Adelaide killed red you could tell she was showing tether traits. But the twist was still surprising because at first I was thinking she was just happy because she knew the threat was out of the way since she has been traumatized as a child but really she was a tether. Fifth off Gabe's humor brought light to the film and I appreciate that because it would've been a dark film over all if Gabe wasn't humorous. Sixth off I loved how I left the theater with many questions surrounding the ending on what to think and how this film is meant to make you think. Last thing I found this film very creepy and there was a jump scare here and there but overall that's what I look forward too in movies<br/><br/>
The very few negatives
-I felt as some moments where very humorous when you can tell it was meant to be serious
-I couldn't tell if Gabe's clone was meant to be humorous as well or if he was being serious with all that moaning
-I would've loved more from Zora but I felt as if the film mainly surrounded around the other three.<br/><br/>
Final verdict- this film was very enjoyable with very few flaws and I hope Jordan peels can surprise us with more films like the last two and let me say us does not disappoint"

","If you go in to this expecting it to make sense like some spoon-fed equation of plot then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you want to have fun riding on a fresh genre-bending thriller with some wacky twists and unashamed quirk then you may find it to surprise you. I went in as blind as possible, with low expectations to simply be entertained and it delivered for that to me. First of all the cast is EXCELLENT. Fresh terror on their faces. Beautiful acting. By every single one of them. Even the younger cast was impressive with some thrilling scenes. And next that music score. Dense, fresh, fun, chilling. Wacky. The cinematography and pacing/unfolding of events was edge of your seat anticipation. I forgot I was watching a movie, it did what it was supposed to. The experience was more than sub-par for me. Because I was willing to just go in and have fun. I enjoyed Get Out, Peele's previous film. Now, for the bad. Okay I admit some of the plot was full of holes and some pseudo stuff. Some of it was over the top silly and far-fetched. But I do not expect to go in to a Jordan Peele film and not get that wacky unreality feeling. I have come to understand his style with it's low-key fantasy and scifi motifs and elements that are never fully explained. This was a small part of Get Out's spectacle also. and this film remains to be that same style Peele has developed. It is a fresh hybrid. Respect. Is it perfect? Of course not. Was his artistic vision realized and did it entertain me? Absolutely."
"impendingdd","1","7","12","27 March 2020"," Peele isn't a horror master
","Peele's sophomore horror film proves that Get Out was a fluke. Get out was by no means a masterpiece either. Here, in US Peele awkwardly blends horror and comedy and it doesn't work. The Alexza scene was so forced. The voices of the woman doppelg√§nger was so distracting and bad. Like someone was trying to make a horror film at home with friends. Peele has to get off this idea that because he has some pretentious opening and fresh new idea, he's going to have a master film. You have to tighten the screws for an overall coherent and consistent picture. P.S. For those wondering, the film provides no scares."

","I loved the start of the movie up until about the last... 15-20 minutes? Once everything starts getting revealed it really puts a stinker on the film.<br/><br/>Loved the dialogue and interactions between each of the characters. What I didn't like is how the movie is things with the ""twist"". Everyone in the theatre sees it coming based on the premise, the problem is it doesn't make sense now.<br/><br/>If our main character ACTED differently then I could see her being switched. The problem is that she just acts ""scared"" about this place. And somehow she has to be informed about the experiments.... Despite her being the one who was actually involved in them?<br/><br/>Further to this - if the humans abandoned them down below... How did ALL of those people just survive off of rabbits? How did they only know she was ""special"" after she danced? Not the fact she was screaming for her parents while she was handcuffed to a bed...?<br/><br/>Honestly this was a 9.5/10 until the ending. Now it's getting a 3. The movie itself does not make up for this lackluster ""ending"" if you can call it that."
"jadediamond","10","18","39","24 March 2019"," Still don't know what I got five on it means
","I really enjoyed this movie. The cast was great playing double roles. The pacing was great. The score of this movie was amazing and it fits perfectly in the scenes, especially when Adelaide and Red (Lupita's characters) face off against each other for the final time. The movie was a great mixture of horror and comedy. I didn't think I was going to be scared but some moments were very frightening. The cast was amazing and the story lingers in your mind long after you leave out of the theater. It was hours after viewing the movie did certain moments finally click with me. This is one of those movies that the more you view it, the more you find something different. The only thing some people may be a tad bit of a complaint about is the ending. Some like it ambiguous. Others liked it as is. At first, I was the former and thought the final twist was an unnecessary add on which told away from the movie. But later on, the final twist made moments from earlier on in the movie finally click with me. It's still a great movie, but it would have been stronger with an ambiguous ending that we'll be talking about for decades later like American Psycho or The Prestige. It's a refreshing horror movie to us horror movie fanatics who have grown tired of the myriads of mediocre movies in the dying genre which needs fresh blood every once in a while. US is that fresh blood. Finally, don't go in comparing this movie to Get Out. That's equivalent to comparing Prince to Michael Jackson, The Truman Show to Dumb and Dumber, Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense. If you're going to judge this movie, then judge it on it's own merit. I really had fun watching this movie and plan to see it many more times."

Me and my dad we're discussing the ending for 15 mins trying to figure out what exactly happened. (In a good way). The acting, soundtrack, idea, and camera were incredible. But the script was not thought out throughly enough I don't think. Sorta rushed.<br/><br/>Overall it was a pretty good movie. Get out was definitely better but the concept of this movie was super original. I recommend this movie... even to people who are somewhat scared of horror movies.

","Well, watch this movie only with the sole purpose of being entertained by the thrills. Then I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Don't watch this while expecting some brainwashing ideas and theories. Just watch this because it's thrilling and entertaining. Because once you use your brain to process, every fun will just fall apart. I watched this in cinema and I feel quite satisfied of overall of the movie. In general, it's entertaining and give you chills and makes you feel so.. growled, I think.
The plot is easy to follow, I know right away that the girl was switched from the very beginning of the movie. And it doesn't become a plot twist anymore. So it's useless if you try to make the audience feel, 'oh wow! I didn't see it coming!' because it is sooooo... Expected. The ending is left hanging though, and it's up to you to interpret the continuation of the movie.

","This movie was amazing!
Disclaimer you should not comper this movie with get out just because it from the same director. Jordan Peele knows what it takes to create a original movie. While watching the movie you can see how much he loves the horror genre himself by al the reference and little Easter eggs he put into the film. This movie tricks with your mind and I love that because the movie doesn't end in the theater but it makes you think about what It al means.
And can be interpreted in alot of different ways. I feel like if you don't like this movie it's a taste thing. But If you look at it with a critical eye this movie is simply amazing! The comedy is also perfectly proccest into the film and it doesn't feel forced at all.The lead/main actress was amazing in here Dubbel role.

"aciessi","9","14","29","31 March 2019"," This is US
","They say the greatest enemy that every one of us has is ourselves.<br/><br/>America, this is your life. Us is Jordan Peele's second feature film as a horror auteur director after shocking and thrilling audiences two years ago with Get Out. The Jordan Peele many of us knew from MadTV and Key and Peele is no longer. He's evolved into a modern day John Carpenter, and damn it, we've needed one. This time, he cranks up the scares to 11 and leaves you squirming in your seats and then leaving the theatre with so many questions. Because, whereas Get Out was an obvious and straight forward satire on the crumbling facade of American race relations, Us is way more ambiguous with what it is trying to say. For that, Us is a strange, fascinating and wickedly cool film and something horror fans and just plain film fans will remember for a very long time.<br/><br/>Santa Cruz. 1986. A little girl curiously ventures away from the boardwalk (now virtually guaranteed to be a Hollywood tourist attraction) and discovers an ominous fun house-of-mirrors right beside the beach. Inside, to her terror, she meets a sinister carbon copy of herself with a mischievous smile. Cut to 30 years later, the little girl is now a happily married mother of two, traveling with her family for a weekend getaway in Santa Cruz. Ho boy. Her family wants to go the same beach she did all those years ago. She cant bear to stomach it. She gives in and goes along with them, only for some very strange, sinister things to start happening to them all over again.<br/><br/>Us inhabits a world of dualities. Or more specifically, every person in this movie has an evil version of themselves. The so-called ""untethered"" that are out to vengefully take the place of their original host body. They are us, and we are them. They live underneath the human world, among multiplying rabbits. What is Peele trying to say? There isn't a definitive answer, but any of your best guesses is entirely possible. Is it a comment on self-loathing and the depression epidemic that has swept up so many in our generation? Is it a personified metaphor of the dark side that lurks within all of us? Is it's message more political (U.S.) regarding issues of class and social status? Is it a statement on America's violent upbringing? Or a satire on what is perceived to be normal and conformist in our society? Whatever your point of view may be, Us can conveniently be interpreted that way, and perhaps that was the entire point.<br/><br/>This movie is fantastic and Jordan Peele is a born filmmaker. Lupita Nyong'o gives a breathtaking, terrifying performance. She is the actress to beat in 2019. I laughed, I cringed, I walked out with a big smile on my face. Us is for you, me, and everyone you know. See it."
"CrumbsReviews","9","14","29","23 March 2019"," Peele The New Mastermind of Horror?
","Let me start this off by saying HORROR does not have one meaning. Just because a movie is classified as HORROR does not mean it has to be like all generic HORROR films that include jump scare, gore, etc. Horror can be psychological and scare you from your own thoughts rather than what you see. With that being said, I went into this film wanting a psychological horror/thriller as that is what this film seemed like, based of trailers, and that is exactly what I got. A lot of people might be disappointed with this film mainly because they are expecting generic horror (jump scares, gore, etc..) which this movie is far from. People should also go into this film not expecting another Get Out. I've been hearing people complain this movie is terrible and so forth because they its nothing like Get Out. Us is more of a full fledged horror film with comedic elements throughout. While Get Out was more of a Social Commentary Thriller. In Us, Peele grabs your attention from the opening shot and keeps it throughout the film. This film has great acting by the whole cast especially since they are playing both the protagonist and the antagonist. The cinematography is well done as it leads you into some nice shots throughout the entire movie, some of which reminds me of the original Halloween. The stand out in the film is without a doubt Lupita Nyong'o. This might be her best role I've seen her in. The way she is able to keep the audience on edge as the antagonist and keep you rooting for her as the protagonist with ease is mind blowing. The score is outstanding as well, it completes each shot terrifically. The script is were I can see people having some issues. Peele's script does have some plot holes but ultimately I thought it was remarkable. Peele has this incredible tendency to make the audience think and reach deep within their mind for answers. I love filmmakers that can do that. To fully understand this film you will need to watch it multiple times. There are so many little details and lines in the film that if you miss them you might end up confused. I myself will be seeing this film at least 1 or 2 more times. All in all, Us will not be a film for everybody, if you enjoy a film that will get you thinking and reaching deep down in your mind for answers then this is the film for you. If you do not enjoy those kind of films then you might not enjoy this film as much as others. Us is going to go down as one of those films people will be talking about for a while."

It would've been ok if the ""tethered/shadow people"" whatever were like some supernatural thing or ritual thing maybe, but clones? By scientists? What scientists? When? How were they tethered?<br/><br/>But that wasn't the worst thing. The movie tried to insult my intelligence by adding the twist that Lilith Nyongo was the clone the WHOLE TIME.
How exactly is she the clone if she isn't a freak of nature like the other ones? Why doesn't she talk like she smokes 5 packs a die like the other clone-lady?
I saw the damn ""Hands Across America"" thing from a mile away, too.
""Get Out"" was way overrated, but compared to this it's almost ""smart"". Which it's NOT.
If ""Get Out"" is a 6 or 7, then ""Us"" is a decent to strong 3, maybe a 4 on a good day. When I'm feeling stupid."

","Watching the trailer's for Jordan Peele's Us I felt intrigued, but also apprehensive. The trailer was such a perfect vector of chaos, mystery, and nightmarish imagery, that I was afraid the movie itself would not be able to deliver on its unsettling nature as potently. Ultimately, I feel like I was right- but not due to a lack of trying.<br/><br/>In fact, trying too hard might be Peele's weakness in Us. This is a movie where my praise and detractions feel like they almost perfectly cleave down the non-spoiler/spoiler line. The characters are (mostly) well-written, the performances are outstanding (Lupita Nyong'o is the stand-out of a strong cast), and many of the movie's set pieces are well thought-out and shot, especially the climax. However, walking away from Us I couldn't help thinking of the movie's inescapable Stephen King vibe, which is both a blessing and a curse. King is probably the best there is at creative horror scenarios and populating them with likable people. He is also not known for restraint, prone to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, even when it works to the detriment of the overall nightmare he's concocting. Us excels at the first part, then falls prey to the second.<br/><br/>The premise comes straight out of a bad dream. On a stormy night in 1986 young Adelaide Wilson wanders off on the Santa Cruz boardwalk and stumbles into a mirrored funhouse where she encounters her doppelganger, dressed exactly like her, hair styled exactly like her, but aggressive and possessed by a kind of feral fury. Jump to present day and adult Adelaide (Nyong'o) is beside herself emotionally as her upper-middle-class family returns to the same beach for a summer vacation This is when they are all accosted by their red-jump suited double who bear scars, malevolent grudges, and incredibly lethal scissors.<br/><br/>If Us had kept its scope to the cat and mouse between the Wilson family and their homicidal ""tethers,"" then Us could have been an excellent thriller, perhaps even an exceptional one. But as the movie progresses you feel Peele's desire to deepen the nightmare, which becomes as unwieldly as a Jenga tower until it collapses in the final two minutes.<br/><br/>*** Spoiler portion of the review begins here ***<br/><br/>I'm not sure where Peele's desire to explain the Tethers and their origin comes from. Perhaps he was afraid audiences would react poorly unless his nightmare had a narrative explanation. Or perhaps the movie's midway mark when it goes from being a home invasion horror to a mash up of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Dawn of the Dead is because he felt that the world-ending nature of his attack of the clones calamity better highlighted its haves vs have-nots allegory. I don't think Peele has such little faith in his audience to believe the former, so I side with the latter, although I contend a movie with a smaller scope could have been just as effective at driving the point home.<br/><br/>The worst part of Us is not that it is a bad movie, it is that it is a irreparably broken great one. Everything that Peele had working for him kept me with it, despite the nagging questions that began piling up. How exactly does an organization not only create perfect clones of people, but make sure that the clones will have children that are essentially clones of their topside counterparts? And exactly how many clones are we talking about? One for one with the residents of Santa Cruz? California? The United States (the underground bunker where the final showdown takes place doesn't look anywhere near big enough to work for any of those)? I know I'm not supposed to ask these kinds of questions, which is why I wish Peele hadn't brought them up in the first place. But by the end it's clear he is enamored with the idea of going deeper and deeper down his own rabbit hole (pun not intended) so when the last reveal takes place, a mere few minutes away from the ending credits, it broke me. It's not only a switcheroo because apparently nowadays it's not actually a horror movie unless it has some redefining twist at the end, it's a trick that plays dirty with an audience that has swallowed a lot just to get to that point. It's kind of surprising that a Jordan Peele movie would have me walking out mentally comparing it to certain M. Night Shyamalan films, and not the ones we fondly remember, either. Us isn't a bad film, however the gap between what could have been and what is is the scariest thing about it."

","Us Review:<br/><br/>A family's serenity turns to chaos when a group of doppelg√É¬§ngers begins to terrorize them in Jordan Peele's new nightmare. After the success of Get Out and the creepy looking trailers, I had to see Us. I actually saw it twice: once on the Thursday opening and the second being tonight. Needless to say, I really liked this movie. Jordan Peele is one of the best writer/directors out there right now. His story is very interesting. It starts out as a home invasion movie like The Strangers, but then turns into something new that we haven't seen before. There were some chilling scenes throughout but he has a way of putting humor in it. What's great is it's not forced and it just comes off naturally. I would say Get Out wasn't as scary and more funny than Us. Though Us is more creepy there were more laughs at the humorous parts since most of the audience needed a way to cool down for a sec. The climax of the film is hands down one of the best scene I've seen in a horror movie in a long time. It wasn't scary or anything but it's the way Jordan executed it and made it into art. That's all with the help of Oscar winning Lupita Nyong'o. If she doesn't at least get a nomination for both the Globes and Oscars I'm going to be furious. She plays two different characters and does so well that I forgot that it's just her playing both. The two contrasting personalities make her performance on par with her Oscar winning role in 12 Years a Slave. Winston Duke provided most of the humor in the movie and I loved him. He's turning his fear into little one liners that made the audience roar in laughter. Their two children were very good for being children actors. Evan Alex's other person named Pluto was literally the creepiest part of the movie. I think it's great that he did that well. Once again this is all with the help of Jordan Peele. You can tell he's been writing his scripts and analyzing them for quite some time. Michael Abel composed the score and I think it's creepy and pretty at the same time. It's surprising that it's only his second score, Get Out being his first. I think his score will at least make the Oscar shortlist. The cinematography was really pretty. There's highlights with reds and blues and whites contrasting with dark surroundings which I liked. Mike Gioulakis's cinematography also better make the Oscar shortlist. The editing was pretty good, again especially with the climax of the film. I just really liked this movie. It was original and gripping. One thing I will say is the first time I saw it I felt anxiety throughout and my heart was racing. For the second I watched it I only felt that once. Really good horror movies keep that anxiety and will make your heart race every time in my opinion. I'm not saying this isn't a really good horror movie but I wish I could feel that every time I watch it. Also there's a twist at the end that I called from even before I watched the movie. I liked the twist and it's interesting to watch it from a different point of view the second time if you didn't predict it. I have some questions still with the film but I kind of like that. Still a few things could've been explained. I think Us is a very good movie. It is currently my favorite movie so far of 2019. I like it just a little more than Get Out. I think this will go down in horror classics with Get Out and would definitely recommend seeing it!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"
"azvarela","9","11","22","24 March 2019"," Horror Onion!
","If you like your movies spoon feed to your, then you might want to skip it. This is for the audience member that is well versed in literature and horror tropes. The director tells you nothing and will leave you with little defined answers. It is the job for the audience to talk it through and interpret. All the clues are there if you are smart enough to find them.<br/><br/>The list of social horrors in this movie is long but for me the themes of MENTAL HEALTH are strong. It shows how a traumatic event in our past can keep us trapped, TETHERED to our dark subconscious. It shows what happens if you don't deal with the skeletons in the closet and how the shadows are wreak havoc in our future lives."
"generationofswine","1","11","22","23 March 2019"," An Honest Review
","Well, they cut back on the blatant racism from ""Get Out,"" so that's a plus. It didn't make the film a uncomfortable to watch in an original ""A Birth of a Nation"" kind of way. But's it's still there, just slightly muted.<br/><br/>And, like ""Get Out,"" it'll have the same cringe effect once its not socially acceptable any longer. But again, it was toned down so it isn't as uncomfortable a watch.<br/><br/>However, the film kind of gives everything away in the very beginning. Straight down to the grand event at the end. So if you're paying attention to glaring, obvious, detail the twist at the other end can be seen easier than a 20mph fastball.<br/><br/>There is a moment of doubt that, maybe the obvious hints were wrong, but right before the action starts the mother gives a speech to absolutely ensure that you, yes, you were right from the start.<br/><br/>And the racism, though toned down, makes it pretty clear that the peaceful and loving event highlighted at the start of the film, isn't just going to be for nostalgic reasons. It's going to be a plot element, only because someone like Jordan Peele isn't that type that would look at that gesture of 80s kindness favorably."
"TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow","8","11","22","23 March 2019"," Visually stunning, engaging and thrilling, despite some writing flaws
","I really enjoyed the movie. Visually, it's a masterpiece. Script-wise, not so much. The movie is really great for a casual watch for some scares and thrills, but it's not nearly as smart or expertly thought out as Get Out, and I don't think it is going to improve all that much on rewatch.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal, standouts for me are Lupita (obviously) and her daughter. Their tether versions were also the standouts of that group too. The scene at the car with the daughter and her tether clone was amazing and terrifying!<br/><br/>The sudden brutal killing of their neighbors was shocking, and even though I had expected more people to have tethers, it was still a shocking reveal in the moment.<br/><br/>The last minute twist was predictable, but I don't think that took anything away from it. It was a really cool concept, but I wish it was executed better. It should've been revealed earlier in the third act so both Lupita's could talk it out, making the final showdown even more dramatic and fleshing out the story of who their characters really are. This could've conveyed the whole ""maybe the evil is US"" message Peele is blabbering about everywhere a bit more.<br/><br/>In terms of message, there is no message. Clearly there's something, but it's just way too abstract. There's nothing wrong with abstract messages/art, but clearly this isn't an abstract story or universe - it's set in our real world - so the 'hands across America' imagery literally had zero meaning. Maybe it would've worked better as a painting? It's supposed to be deep, but what did it mean? I don't think Jordan Peele even knows what it means. It didn't make sense within context of the movie. Why were the tethers joining hands all across America? What were they trying to accomplish? I have to admit though, they set it up amazingly with the old man at the beach. How were the tethers so magically linked that they were literally shadow puppets and mimicking the humans every move? Why did the government create them to begin with? HOW did the government create them? The idea of the tethers is way too fantastical and unreal for the more ""realistic"" and ""real world logic"" explanation the movie tried to give. Also, what was stopping the tethers from leaving the tunnels? Yes, it could be a metaphor for something, but there still has to be a literal reason that stopped them from leaving for the metaphor to work (just say the government had security guards down there.. idk!)<br/><br/>If you remove the ""tethering,"" the scissors and all the ""hands across America"" stuff, you've got a conceptually less interesting, but still fun, thrilling and entertaining zombie movie that at least makes sense.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","5","8","4 April 2019"," Struggles a bit early on and at the end, but overall a good movie
","Let me lose a few words on ""Us"", a new American 2019 movie, and the most recent work by writer and director Jordan Peele, an Oscar winner for his screenplay on ""Get Out"". So he found an even shorter title this time and a cast list that is topped by Lupita Nyong'o, another Oscar winner and the one and only lead actor in this film. Feel free to check the supporting actor list yourself as I will spare you the names with the exception of Elisabeth Moss from Mad Men and The West Wing, always a favorite and the way she portrayaed her evil twin was great fun. But first things first: The film runs for almost 2 hours and is about a family of four who goes on a holiday the mother is not too fond of. By the way anybody else felt Lupita to be too young here, at least for being the mother of the girl? Anyway at the very beginning, Peele just like with Get Out, used a prologue scene that lies back quite a bit in the past before the action of the actual movie we have here. Even way further than Get Out if we are specific, not just a year or so. Seems to be something Peele likes to do, while other directors/writers prefer scenes from the middle/end of the movie and then lead us to how they happened, Peele sticks with actual chronology. I like the idea. But except that I was not too impressed by the early parts of this movie and found everything before the actual twinvasion pretty forgettable. This includes for example the scene when the boy disappears at the beach which was really ridiculous and over-the-top how she panicked. But when the family is attacked and approached inside that house, things get far more entertaining finally. The hostage situation somehow reminded me of Haneke's Funny Games, even if I was wondering why the police wasn't coming. But I guess we find out about that later on as they are just too busy, but did they take the call then? Or did the character lie about the police? I am not sure. It is not essential anyway, you can appreciate the scene without that too. I did like the red costumes by all the ""bad"" guys by the way. As for the scissor part, this sure was a trademark, but sadly it did not feel as memorable and iconic as it could have been.<br/><br/>As for the ending and with that I am talking about the scene down there with the two Lupitas, the location was great, but the revelation was not as epic as I hoped it could be. A nice fight scene and that's it. They sure could have gotten a lot more out of that, also with where the boy is hidden. The final plot twist thumbs-up to you if you saw it coming that it was the clone all the time. I didn't, even if thinking back I could have given how much of a talented dancer she was and it's tough to create that artifically, but most of all how she is apparently the only twin that can talk, or do more than uttering lets say like we hear it from the man's twin. And the shrink session when we hear how her parents think she has changed so much. So this was a good idea that makes sense too. And she did trick the most of us I am sure. But it also fits in with the idea that the other ones are not evil, just desperate. They are just different, but they are humans as well and want the better life and are genuinely scared of the other life. Overall, Peele got in quite a few funny references again too, even if the main idea was horror obviously, not as much comedy probably as in Get Out where there is one character that almost only deals with comedy, the chubby one coming to the rescue eventually, but still here with Us you will have a moment when you smile too. Many of these moments actually. You will know what I mean when you see them. In addition, let me lose a few words on the scene when the boy's twin is killed, the one with the severe burns on his face. On the one hand I disliked the scene because it hardly could have been planned this way by the fake mother that the ""real"" boy would take these steps backwards to have the other one walk into the fire. But still, it shows us that the other mother is giving up on her ""son"" this way. Or lets say better ""the boy"" because there are no real maternal feelings involved, otherwise she wouldn't. Just like there were no feelings involved for the hunky other man, they are just thrown together like their sane counterparts are. In Germany we would say ""Zweckgemeinschaft"". And it is inevitable. They don't have free choice. They are forced to follow up and react. One thing I personally found very unimpressive was the gigantic twin chain that is referenced several times, briefly early on and much longer later on. This did absolutely nothing for me in terms of significance and metaphoric meaning and should have been left out completely for all I care. Now this film overall is sadly weaker than Get Out, but mostly because of how good Get Out was, not because this one here was bad whatsoever. It's a decent watch, especially in the middle and from the atmospheric perspective. I am curious how much awards attention Lupita will attract here. Certainly not none, but I am undecided if she can get in at the Oscars a second time. It happened frequently for previous winner that they manage a follow-up nomination not much later afterwards (Rockwell, Bridges only to mention two, but these were immediately afterwards). We will see. From the first half of the film, I think she is likely to get in, from the second not as likely except the ending perhaps. She sure won't win a second time, but I think she has a shot at making the top5 again, this time for lead and the film's unfortunate release date I would not pay too much attention to as Peele managed to get in Kaluuya too and win for screenplay with Get Out being reelased at a similar time I believe. We will see. Overall, I give Us a positive recommendation. Go watch if you like horror films."

HOWEVER, as it's been said, the explanation for the tethered at the end of the film was so ridiculous it caught me off guard. They realllly should've avoided this explanation and let us guess into the symbolism. Make the explanation be magical so we can overlook the huge list of logical plot holes: They have the same clothes? They are just somehow imitating what's happening above ground; how much autonomy do they have? Where are the guards? Etc etc. It was really a disappointing, weak way to tie up all the loose ends."

"ChipperX","7","5","8","26 March 2019"," Us - A Creepy Opportunity Wasted.
","<ul><li>Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.</li></ul><br/><br/>The intense buzz for Jordan Peele's sophomore effort, Us (2019) brought movie fans into cinemas by the droves. Trailers for the film were rampant and visceral. Winning an Oscar for his first movie,Get Out (2017) (a masterpiece), it seemed Jordan Peele had only to sign his name to this project to have us all line up with money in hand at the box office. Unfortunately, most people learned belatedly that all that glitters is not gold: Us is far from perfect.<br/><br/>Starting with The Good: Casting Lupita Nyong'o as the adult Adelaide Wilson was a master stroke. Lupita is the perfect, warm mother who holds her family together at a time of incalculable crisis. Young Adelaide Wilson, played by Madison Curry, is a real treat. Zora Wilson, played by Shadai Wright Joseph, is especially convincing as Adelaide's fearless daughter. The family dynamic between the Wilsons is predictably complex but also familiar, and all of the actors do a great job of interacting as real family members would.<br/><br/>The set pieces are saturated in color and convincing in a horrific way; the carnival, beach, and summer home all share a duality between naturalistic and horrific, as the script demands. The film's horror, once it begins, is complete and shocking. Unfortunately, that immensely negative energy does not have a sufficient vehicle to channel it.<br/><br/>The Not-So-Good: Jordan Peele wrote himself into a rabbit-hole with this script. Sheer horror is never enough for the film connoisseur; eventually the audience wants to know why it is being led along a certain path. Once the killing starts, it either makes sense, or it doesn't.<br/><br/>Is it reasonable to assume that doppelgangers populate tunnels underneath us, mirroring our actions? Is it reasonable to assume that these twins want to kill us all and take our places as we pay taxes, stand in line to pay for groceries and schlep our children to Little League? Is it reasonable to assume that each of these shadows beneath us has been supplied with a perfectly fitted red jumpsuit and a pair of finely sharpened killing shears? If it is not reasonable to assume these things on our own, then the story-teller must give us a powerful story which convinces us. Unfortunately, this is where Jordan Peele, writer-director of Us, fails.<br/><br/>The Bad: Once the killing starts, we are transfixed with the sheer violence of it all. Unfortunately, by the time the movie is shifting into its third act, we no longer care. The main characters seem to be repeating their actions over and over, with no apparent resolution. Kill, run, and kill again. Once the film shifts into expository mode; all hope is lost. Shadow-mom gives a powerful speech which confuses us, the underground home of the shadow people looks a bit like an abandoned shopping mall, and the rabbits hop madly about without a turd in sight. Worst of all, Lupita Nyong'o is revealed to be something she isn't supposed to be.<br/><br/>Us is a fine film if you remove the impossible elements, like a million shadow people killing their counterparts in order to join hands while standing in the sunlight. Some scenes are just unimaginably horrific and frightening, but this is not a painting - it's a movie. When you sum up all the gory images and still end up with nothing, the movie is not a success - it's a tragedy."

","The soulless mount a 1970s style 'performance art' revolution, hand-holding into a great wall across the globe. When you stop and think how ridiculous this all is it can only be seen as satire. The seedling of the soulless one switching lives with the other, their own revolutionary leader 'Man in the Iron Mask' style, then leads them to claim what's hers. Their symbol of action is taken from some random t-shirt they see. Why do t-shirts hold so much symbolic power here? It's because they're in this trashy beach-bound American context; how the revolution goes on beneath theme park rides, sand and flip flops... as she says: ""We are Americans."" Us = literally United States. So of course rather than the great pyramids or monuments of humanity, it would be random garbage printed on shirts to imitate. Same how he knocks her out with the souvenir and Alexa is the closest weapon to defeating them. I'm reminded of the short story where aliens come down thousands of years after the apocalypse and reverse engineer humanity concluding McDonalds was their church of worship. The Africanism, the symbol of chains, the voodoo brings about its primal freight of replacement and reckoning by the underclass (with full on quotation of slavery and the 'underground railroad'). I don't think it's just race but 'us' in our luxury vs our shadows in iphone slave shops. 'We' are above ground enjoying the rides. 'They' are underground in dark tunnels and can only pretend. It is very modern day with immigration, migrant crisis, globalization. Have and have not's. The race to the top via a race to the bottom. And the art, the dancing, is the simple act of consciousness leads the tethered to some kind of awakening. Consciousness and unity is the way out only after uncomfortable violent revolution. How about the uselessness of the fathers across it as almost sitcom comic relief? The patriarch in power using it to no end. ""You take it all for granted."" (From Idiocracy: ""Shouldn't I train him?"" ""I think he can pretty much learn to sit on his ass and watch TV."") 'They' are coming for your robes and vodka.<br/><br/>Think how the anti-hero mother could not ascend without the violent act of forcefully switching. That she could only assimilate into the host culture via the most silent, diligent mimicry, abandoning the culture of her own, showing the global unity leads to homogeneity. (Would like to see the same film again except entirely from her perspective.) Here we are all guilty and replaceable.<br/><br/>As usual genre is the only avenue directors have to tinker, tweak and consider the form. While art house audiences are puritan and pretentious about plot and tone. In the end, an audience member remarked, ""I don't know what that was, I need to watch some YouTube videos about it."" To me it's Peele's primal terror+satire via Ki-Duk Kim, a postmodern thriller. Tim is even in it."

"iggybach1","3","8","15","24 March 2019"," DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE
","The film is too much brain and too little brawn, meaning it lacks the guts to go where it promises. Making a horror film is no easy task and Peele in this case is simply out of his league. Once it becomes apparent every member of the family will survive the night of reckoning, any terror is drained from the story and it becomes reliant on the same old tricks, tropes, and gags of the genre in trying to pull off the impossible - a story attempting to be at the same time, comic and serious and macabre, but ultimately way too high in concept. To the film's further detriment, Peele feels the need to explain it all at a point in the film when anybody still watching is probably straining to care anymore. As well, he steals a number of ideas from Haneke's FUNNY GAMES, then fails to frame them with any punch or savagery. That at least might have helped his audience begin to struggle with the universality of his notions of us vs. them. Isn't that, as he has stated, the purpose of the film?"

The movie starts ok with a nice atmosphere building. But after the creepy stuff start to happen the movie went downhill fast.
It was already pretty bad when the ""explanation"" began, but then that was so cringy it completely ruined the movie for me.
And I saw that last plot twist coming from miles away.
Jordan Peele should be ashamed for hiring the amazing Lupita Nyong'o for this mess.
Do not waste your time with this movie."

","The movie at the start build up pretty good. It build up the tention and gets you ready to be scared and jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>It's all starts to crumble a little after the ""evil halfs"" of the family appears. some of the portrating of the ""evil's"" are played good and some is just stupid (like the father and daugther evil's)<br/><br/>Then you discover that not just the family of the mother has ""evil's"" but also the neighbors? and the rest of the town?!
The movie ""supernatural vibe"" had completly destroyed after this reveled and so has the potential of the movie.
after that part the movie is no longer scary (not that it really was scary to begin with), and it just makes you go like ""uh?! what is this? why? just why?""<br/><br/>Then theres the ""final battle"" between ""good and evil"" which was pretty good if i must say, only to be baffeled by forced twist for the ending.<br/><br/>The good part was that the ilogical part of the movie helped it to be not that scary when i watched it late at night.
The bad part was the ilogical and weird parts of the movie that ruind what it has build at the begining."

After that the film needs more explanation<br/><br/>what exactly the tethered are going to go against humans.

","This movie being touted as the follow up by the director of Get Out, did not do this movie any favors. Excepectations were too high. Get Out is fantastic, but I think people judge too harshly expecting follow ups to be as good or better than past work. Then proceed to judge with one stars. Just look at M. Night Shyamalan. This is in no way a 1 star movie. Not even close by horror standards. It will keep your attention. There is some fun dark humor, gleeful gore, with a twisty ending. You end of liking/empathizing with characters (a skill only good horror movies have, making an audience relate and grow close to the main characters). The complaint I will agree with is that the doppelganger voice is ridiculously annoying. Seriously. We're not all just being picky by mentioning it. I dropped a star for that stupid voice. It was over the top and grating while adding nothing to the plot. Do I understand why it was that way? Yep. Still bloody annoying. This is worth a watch by horror afficianados. Kept my attention, didn't blow my socks off though. Good middle of the road horror/thriller movie. With a stupid voice."

","Ok, so Jordan Peele directed 'Get Out', which caused quite a stir among critics. He is back with 'Us'. I remember not wanting to watch 'Get Out' but eventually decided to see it due to the media hype. It was better than expected, but nothing special.<br/><br/>Again, due to the media hype and box office success, I decided to watch 'Us', a film I wasn't particularly interested in seeing. There are very few films I can't sit through until the end, even if they are bad. 'Us' is one of those rare films I simply couldn't handle any more, and finally hit the eject button.<br/><br/>The film seriously suffers from lack of intelligent dialogue. In fact, the dialogue is incredibly standard - below standard even. And then there's annoying diaoluge like "" The first 35 minutes were incredibly boring. When things started going wrong, the film wasn't scary because the acting was so comedic. (Not sure whether this was the intention or whether the actors were just bad). Instead of sitting through the entire movie, I read up on the plot and how it would end. Boy, am I glad I decided not to watch this to the end. What crap!!!

Its 100% impossible for those other people to live underground with such easy access and noone ever finding out. It's also impossible for them to seemingly kill everyone everywhere. Yeah right noone fought back, noone realzed that there are weird people on the street. And ok you can tell that its fantasy, some weird sieence or magic but lets be real even zobie apocalypses have more sense.<br/><br/>Then we have this ending. So let's assume for a moment that those girls actually switched places when young:
1. Girl chained in basement would die of starvation becouse who would feed her? Parents? We saw that ""other"" have to mimmic actions of those above so its unlikely they would do it correctly becouse ""other"" kid was missing.
2. If ""other"" parets freed that little girl she would just look for escape. It was pretty easy to find so why not?
3. In the ending monologue woman i red talks about herself as ""other"" while shes not and she clearly should know shes not. She should just tell ""you switched our places when I was young, now you will suffer"". That was the whole point.
I'm baffled that anyone would give this garbage movie more than 3 let alone 10 but ok."

The movie is not only full of illogical plot holes and unanswered questions the main family does illogical things and acts normal at times despite what's going on.

"Icecreambenjaminelliott","1","3","4","5 July 2019"," Didn't Really Work For Me
","This movie has a lot of promising elements. The cinematography is gorgeous, the art direction is nice, the cast is lovely, the music is phenomenal, and it's got a pretty cool concept. Unfortunately, none of it really comes together or works.<br/><br/>I have a slight problem with Jordan Peele's writing. He comes up with brilliant concepts. Get Out and Us are both great ideas. However, I think he lacks detail and specificity. His characters feel somewhat hallow but are occasionally heightened by great actors. With Us, the twists and scares feel cheap, the story really has no logic, but at the same time has too much logic. The story is bizarre and really makes no sense at all, but I've seen plenty of films that do that too, but they establish a sort of odd, surrealist nature right from the start. Us attempts to constantly over-explain itself. It attempts to pull logic out of absurdity.<br/><br/>Peele's themes are muddled here. I'm not sure I understand, even after two watches and plenty of discussion, what the point of the film is. It attempts to pass itself off as an artsy horror film like Get Out, Hereditary, The Babadook, Midsommar, etc., but all of those films have defined themes. I just don't get the point of this film.<br/><br/>Lupita is good. Not great. She never even gets close to the brilliance of Daniel Kaluuya's performance in Get Out. Winston Duke is only ok and the kids shouldn't even be in the film. All they do is muddle up the film even further. Elisabeth Moss is funny and great in a parody of the typical white woman in a horror film. Unfortunately, none of them are fully formed characters and I didn't really care what happened to any of them, which is kind of an issue.<br/><br/>It is nice to see a black family at the center of a horror film, or really any film at all. Unfortunately, the movie just doesn't really work. It's kind of just a lot of noise that isn't really saying anything.<br/><br/>*on a second watching my opinion is harsher. This movie is bad. Good Cinematography, but it just doesn't make an sort of sense, isn't scary, and the acting is poor. This is the most overhyped film of the year."
"TxMike","Null","3","4","4 July 2019"," Curious movie, filmed in Santa Cruz.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. Not my wife's type of movie.<br/><br/>This movie had generated a reasonable amount of hype, plus it has Lupita Nyong'o in it, so I was anxious to see it. I found it very well made with many interesting visuals, but with one difficulty.<br/><br/>When a writer/director makes a movie with lots of symbolism he or she sees very clearly what they want to convey. However each viewer comes away with different degrees of comprehension of what his/her intent was. I read a number of ""professional"" reviews and most of them have praise for ""Us"" but each with different takeaways.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what points the movie was trying to make, something about our shadows always getting the short end of the stick. Something about thousands of miles of tunnels in the USA. Then the twist at the end, when we find out what really happened to the young girl in the hall of mirrors in 1986.<br/><br/>So, while I mostly found it an entertaining viewing I don't come away with some new revelation about people and their lives. I mostly enjoyed seeing scenes of Santa Cruz where we vacationed just a few years ago, walking the same streets where the car fire scene was shot near the end of the movie, plus the beach and the pier.<br/><br/>I think many viewers, who are not professional movie critics, will not enjoy seeing this movie because the themes and messages are mostly obscure.<br/><br/>Edit: First I want to say no movie should require ""extras"" on a disc to explain the movie. But I DID watch some of the extras on the BD afterward and in particular the filmmaker talking about what motivated him to come up with this particular story, and that is interesting. Part of it is we think as if we somehow earned being in an affluent position, as the featured family was, when in fact it was just luck of being born where we were. And the idea that meeting your doppelganger can be scary. But he also admits that it is just a popcorn flick, not to be taken too seriously."

If the mom was the evil version all along, she shouldn't be scared of a ""shadow"" of herself as she claims. Sure she could be scared (of being revealed to be a fraud by the true her) but not of a shadow. Again, purposeful misleading to set up the twist.<br/><br/>3. Why does the good version go insane and deciude the only way to get revenge on her evil self is to raise an army of evil duplicates that murder their good halves? Again, contrived and makes no sense.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't/ couldn't the good version of the girl use the escalators to escape the evil realm? This really doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>5.

Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, a logistically un-believable backstory is quite another. Without going into spoilers, the DNA element alone is mathematically impossible. Then figure travel, international immigration factoring into a supposedly US-based phenomenon...these matter a lot.

","I was extremely excited for ""Us"" which probably made it much worse for me when my expectations didn't pay off. There are some really great things about this movie, but ultimately you're left with a half-thought-out ending that only makes sense and fits correctly if you reaaaaaally force it to. I felt that the cinematography, music score and acting was overall good. Nothing astounding, but it kept me immersed and entertained. I love that it took place in Santa Cruz, where I grew up. I loved the Boardwalk being so heavily featured, it was really cool to see. These are all of the positive things I can say.<br/><br/>Massive spoilers ahead: The rules and physics of this world strictly don't make sense. Okay, so there is a copy of all of these people in a basement in Santa Cruz, that were created to try and control their counterparts on the surface. These copies are just mindlessly controlled and have to do what their counterparts are doing on the surface. We see tons of examples of this, they are bound by the actions of those above. How did the girl get out and up the escalator in the first place? Even if you're willing to get past that, how did the clones all have enough control to obtain millions of pairs of scissors and make custom red outfits? They explicitly made these materials-HOW!? Why can they suddenly leave the basement? Why were counterparts created of random inconsequential people that don't even live near Santa Cruz? Why would they have made millions of these failed experimental clones when they would have learned from one test subject that the mind control didn't work? And most ridiculous of all, why do they have to eat raw rabbits? What a stupid ""scary"" detail thrown in to the mix just because. Yes rabbits reproduce quickly, but there's no reason they have to eat raw screaming bloody rabbits at all, other than ""this is a horror movie, spoooooky!""<br/><br/>Before you get uppity claiming ""you missed the symbolism! It's not about that!"" No I didn't, and yes it is. Yes, I get that a group of people that we marginalize and that we view below us as a society doesn't have the same chance for success as many others, and yes I understand that when on the surface and given a chance those same people can succeed. The message is all fine and good, but it's so hamfisted and shoved in your face that Jordan Peele forgot to make the rest of the movie make sense. Overall this movie was a great build up for 25 minutes followed by an hour and a half of nonsense, but I was entertained most of the time. The ending, again, is just so ridiculous and left so many plot holes that I can't enjoy it all that much."

","Like Jordan Peele's first film, Get Out, his sophomoric second feature, Us, demonstrates that his directorial talent outweigh his ability as a scenarist. Despite good, if borrowed premises, both films become problematic in the final third where the elements don't come to a meaningful or satisfactory conclusion. Us, more ambitious and large scale than Get Out, is less enjoyable. It's both overlong and tiresome. How many times can I watch Lupita Nyong'o swing a golf club at a doppelganger? Unfortunately, the film gives one plenty of time to ponder the absurdities, inconsistencies and clich√©s. Why do the Wilsons' doppelgangers allow them so much time and opportunity to escape and ultimately survive while everyone else is killed immediately without warning. The tethered apparently destroyed all of Santa Cruz with no policeman firing a gun or anyone else offering resistance unlike the Wilsons whose son destroys his doppelganger by having it mimic his actions. And why does his mother waste time listening to her doppelganger spout (expository) gibberish instead of continuing to search for him in the underground. The underground is a mall with seating, numerous rabbits, classrooms, an escalator and perhaps a sweatshop that produces form-fitting red jumpsuits, leather gloves and shears! Get Out had some sharp humor; here the humor is ill-placed and uncertain. Despite the reviews that say it needs to been seen twice to be understood, once was more than enough for me. Like some other recent films: A Quiet Place, Velvet Buzzsaw and Bird Box, the antagonists/creatures need better definition, consistency, some sense of purpose and a screenplay that doesn't require the audience to fill in the gaping holes in logic and reason. An unsatisfactory film during which I was aware of the audience becoming fidgety."

Winston Duke, didn't know whether he should be serious or funny and he failed at both. Honestly the entire film felt that like it was confused was it a comedy or a suspense thriller. The characters were never developed. I didn't care who lived or died. This movie is M. Night Shylaman bad. Actually it's worse.

"colinwohlrab","2","3","4","6 April 2019"," Don't think about it too hard
","Here lies the story of a celebrity horror director who clearly was influenced by too much.
And here lies a story that tries so hard to be relevant/terrifying/funny/unusual by first and foremost it tries to be popular and therefore falls flat under the category of ""pretentious"" because the movie takes itself as seriously as a film would.
So here lies in this shallow grave the rotting corpse of this movie, so laiden with ideas it becomes pointless, because as slick and clever as it might be there is nothing actually there.
Here we have a very engaging opening 15 minutes and an interesting (although very very flawed) ending but the middle hour of the movie is just an extended generic horror action sequence where everyone is trying to kill everyone. Hmmmm, nothing new there.
Then we have this ending...where the main character is revealed to be actually her own duplicate, switched as a child. It's not a twist if it makes no sense.
Anyway, I'm sick of writing about this.
Really frustrating when the climax of the movie denounces everything that happened before it and uses ""God"" to wimp out of unimaginative script.

It's hard to specify just why this movie sucks without giving away certain elements of the story, but for the $20 I contributed to the box office earnings (with the expectations of a LOGICAL and SATISFYING storyline), I feel Jordan Peele owes me something for sitting through that movie. Since I'll likely never get my $20, or those two hours from him- I intend to stop someone else from lying to see it. The movie is boring on top of just being illogical. First, know that. Secondly, I enjoyed Get Out, and had read reviews saying that US is just as good if not better... (not true)<br/><br/>As flimsy as the plot appears to be in the previews, that's actually better than what it turned out to be.

From revealing the 'monsters' too soon, to absolutely disarming its own horror element, I'm no longer sure what this film wanted to be.<br/><br/>What I'm sure of is that it wasn't ""smart"". The plot was so convoluted it opened itself up to lotus pod levels of plot holes, and thus failed to play by its own rules. In an attempt to make itself mysterious or memorable it instead became childish and pointless.<br/><br/>The big reveal at the end was also hugely underwhelming. I honestly wasn't expecting it because not only did it not make sense, take far too long for them to get to it, but it was also so blatant by all the clues that had been spoon fed to us that I assumed it was a red herring. There is so much wrong with the plot that I just couldn't begin to write it all out here, I'm sure other reviewers will elaborate. It felt like a drunken concept that should have been forgotten and rightfully replaced with a headache come morning.<br/><br/>For me it failed as a modern horror. The feeling that it felt like it was never going to end was far more terrifying.<br/><br/>The only takeaway is that I now have a new bottom of the scale for new horror and I know to avoid further content from the creator."

","My daughter loved ""Get Out!"" and really wanted to go and see Nolan's latest offering. We went and watched ""Us"" and both of us came out very disappointed. It started off fairly well with a feeling of unease gradually building. At some point, I am no sure exactly where, it went off the rails. I found myself laughing out loud at random points. The ""Horror"" dissipated and it sort of degenerated into a farce. To say there were several holes in the ""plot"" suggests that there was an actual ""plot"" in the first place.Two people got up and left halfway through, I very much wanted to join them. I soldiered on for the sake of my daughter even though she was looking dispirited too. Some of the ""fight"" scenes were just laughable. The father dispatches his Tethered copy on the boat and then a few minutes later they are all sitting around the dining table surrounded by their neighbour's bodies. They all had the emotional depth of a rock. As the film went on it just got dafter and dafter. Supposedly every person in the USA had a Tethered copy living under the Carnival Hall of Mirrors! That is a very big cavern that can house over 300 million people who all eat raw rabbit!! It is difficult to believe how anybody could rate this Film as a 10. Some people are calling ""Us"" the best Film they have ever seen!! ""Us"" isn't even the best Film I have seen in the last 24 hours. (If you want a decent Film to see try ""Blue Ruin"".) The twist at the end was just so predictable I was expecting it halfway through the Film. I have awarded ""Us"" 3/10 primarily because the actors tried their best and the Cinematography was very good in parts. The Script was terrible and parts just a joke.

But as in all movies there is a fork in the road and US seems to have picked the wrong path. Unfortunately with each fork in the road the movie becomes more convoluted anf lost in its own mess.<br/><br/>First fork - the movie starts off on a great note with imtensity and setting up the audience. Then suddenly we started getting bits of light humor and a dose a thriller. At first, it was a nice touch but as the movie moved along it gets confusing. It was hard to tell if Peele was trying to make a legit horror/thriller in the vein of The Strangers or something more comedy driven like Shaun of The Dead. This strange state leads to a clumsy film in the end.<br/><br/>Second fork - when the family goes to their friends for help a similar horror scenero is occuring to their friends. Okay, unexpected and not sure why and now the audience is filled with more questions. In the right script, i can get it, here it gets even more lost.<br/><br/>Third fork - so we now have 2 families who have their idential look alikes attacking them. Naturally the 2nd family is taken out as well ad their copies and the first family decides to watch the news. Here we find out this is bigger than we thought because in East LA people are being stabbed for no reason by people dressed in red jumpsuits. The family decides to bug out and we see signs of destruction all over the sleepg community of Santa Cruz. Again, why? Whats going on? None of this fits together.<br/><br/>Fourth fork - the family ends up back to where it started at thw begging of the movie at the beach carnival. Its daylight, nobody around except for dead bodies and destruction and a line of these people copies holding hands similar to 1986's hands across America. Were dragged down into a maze tunnels and end up in a white hall with individual rooms and rabbits running loose from their cages. Fight breaks out and eventually we think its all over. The family piles into ambulance and starts driving away.<br/><br/>Fifth fork - as they are driving we are then thrown back to the past when the little girl meets here copy at the carnival on the beech. In a convoluted story we discover the girls were switched and the origional is help prisioner with all the other copies in a sanitarium like prison.<br/><br/>Confused? So is the movie. There are so many questions left that it takes away from any enjoyment the film had. Who or what were these idential copies? Why cant they speak but yet have creepy abilities to do strange body contortions. Whats up with the rabbits? And why is there a steange mix of humor and thriller?<br/><br/>Like i said, its not horrible but it leaves a very unsatisfied feeling with the confusing plot.

I am a fan of the writer/directors debut Get Out which was an original horror with quite a bit of social commentary. However Us neither feels as original or has the same level of explicit social commentary Get Out has.
Maybe it does have a social commentary message and I just didn't get it?
This movie feels like a guest directed movie version of a Twilight Zone episode, which is pretty much what it is.
The story revolves around a family returning to their beach holiday home and having to deal with the unwelcome and dangerous visitors who come in the middle of the night. Watching trailers gave the impression that this was a house siege type of movie which it isn't. The action moves away from the family house and elsewhere so if you were expecting a drawn out tense home invasion movie that's not on offer.
This is more of a psychological horror with some violence and blood, not flat out impossible levels of gore.
The film does build up tension and doesn't rely on jump scares, there is also some humour which does work, although the other patron I saw this with didn't seem to think so. Well not everybody likes rap music or maybe he was the police?
The score and soundtrack are both very well done, adding to the comic relief at some points.
The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the ending was predictable, maybe this is due to the source material being part of the Twilight Zone cannon. What may have been difficult to second guess back in the day is quite easy to predict today. It takes more to fool people these days.
Where this is original or at least unfortunately rare is that we have a horror movie, well basically a movie about a middle class black family which is to be celebrated. We are moving away from the hood movie equals black movie era which can only be a good thing. Even black horror movies in the past always seemed to located in a ghetto environment. Not this time.
Its a very good horror movie its just unfortunate that Get Out is an excellent horror movie which its bound to be compared to.
One thing about the movie is that you simply cannot understand everything about it in one showing. Anyone who thinks they can is deluded and simply trying to appear smarter than they are. It has been designed to be watched multiple times which begins to feel like a cheap trick to manipulate the box office. Based on this reason I have downgraded my rating to a five, if you cant experience the full story watching something once, its a fail."

","I walked into the cinema with an open and neutral mind because I didn't really know what to expect from this movie.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes weren't the best imho. I found the acting unnatural and quite frankly a little bit cheesy. Then out of the blue the movie becomes a bit comical, my first thought was ""man, this movie sucks, this is unrealistically bad acting"", then I had a few laughs and that's a good thing! However the movie steered away from the horror part, it wasn't really that scary, maybe it was me but I didn't jumped from my seat once.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't great either, Shahadi Wright Joseph did a great job though! She sure has great potential imo.<br/><br/>It's an unconventional disposable comical horror movie.

"Suave785","6","3","4","22 March 2019"," Get Out!
","Like many whom saw the movie I was quite intrigued by the trailer released last December. It provided a great preview for what I thought would be a rather unique viewing experience. I went in with high expectations and was met with a poor storyline and poor character selection. Luckily, the actors and actresses in the movies, especially the lead, were able to carry the film.
I am not a movie snob. I expected a horror movie that would be a new entry to the genre. But even horror movies f9r the most part have a plot and characters upon which to build around. ""US"" felt like an experiment in the horror genre for Peele. In my opinion, he took his shot and missed.
To sum it up, please don't put this movie on a pedestal based on the success of ""Get Out"". They are two completely different movies. I do suggest seeing the movie if you like the actors and actresses. But if you are looking for some real scares check your bank account after hitting the snack bar at the movies."

","So let me start off by saying I was really looking forward to watching Us because it seemed very unique and unique it was, but not in the good way. Us was a very boring scattered film, falls under the Horror/Thriller genre yet During the whole runtime of this movie there wasn't even one scene that left me fearful or thrilled, more like bored and disappointed. Now don't get me wrong I am not saying to just throw a bunch of blood and mayhem on the screen or jump scares but what I'm saying is, the movie isn't scary. Some of the acting is really good but honestly not enough to save this dumpster fire. People out there made it seem like this movie was a classic of some sort, a masterpiece and I'm here to tell you, that is absolutely FALSE!!!!!! This movie doesn't even come close to being a masterpiece and even Jordan Peele's -Get Out was overrated in my opinion. I feel we live in such a delusional world nowadays that when a black director makes a film with a predominantly black cast people automatically praise the film. Do I hate Jordan Peele as a director? Absolutely not, I love his unique ideas on cinema and I think he has an unseen gem headed our way in the near future but as of right now, I was highly disappointed with Get Out and Especially Us but am still optimistic, about Jordan Peele and his future as a director."

"Only_Honest_Review","1","4","6","13 January 2020"," Story just doesn't work
","I'm stunned audiences gave the film such high praise and can't help but wonder if we saw the same movie or if I'm missing something. Get Out was universally acclaimed by critics and fans so expectations were high for this movie but I found this movie boring and barely watchable if not for the decent acting. It's not really a horror and more of a home invasion mystery but the main problem is the story doesn't make sense. I can look past narrative inconsistencies and poor science but the overall plot of doppelgangers living in underground laboratories isn't well supported with a sensible reason and consequently their rise to take over the normal world doesn't make sense as well. The weak logical foundation isn't able to support an already creaky script. Overlooking logic, the other main issue is the direction. Whereas Get Out was filled with tension and mystery building up to the cathartic reveal, Us revealed the doppelgangers early on and there wasn't much tension or mystery beyond the backstory of who they were. So the movie just ends up being the main characters trying to run away and escape the doppelgangers. Finally the ending doesn't work with the dancing doppelganger and the twist ending that makes no sense. I struggled to watch the movie and was not invested in the characters and in fact the big mystery and question on my mind as I watched wasn't the doppelgangers but how critics and fans could possibly enjoy much less praise this movie. That's an even bigger mystery than the movie. And I can't help but wonder was this even written by Jordan Peele. How can the quality of the script be so bad here and so good in Get Out. That is another mystery.<br/><br/>As a note, this movie is an illustrative example of what is wrong with critics as a whole. They seem to be completely out to lunch on this and have lavished praise on this movie to the tune of 93% fresh tomatoes. It's a classic case of the Emperor has no clothes but it boggles my mind how such an intelligent group of experienced professional critics could be duped into thinking this is the new and better version of Get Out. This is why I don't bother with critics opinions and just go straight to the audiences views. This movie isn't worth watching for free. I usually only give a one rating to some Asylum or Steven Seagal movies. So it's that bad. Avoid this turkey and watch Get Out again."
"mdwhitaker-81530","1","4","6","12 January 2020"," Updated my rating to a 1 star, down from 2
","When I first saw this at the cinema, I thought I was maybe being harsh, given the positive critic reviews and hype around the movie. I've just wasted another couple of hours of my life watching it again at home.
Honestly dreadful.
Those finding deeper meaning or commentary in the story or theme of the movie are looking too hard and possibly using psychedelic drugs. With such a weak story that is absolutely riddled with holes and whole plot points that don't make any sense or add up, you can't start pretending there's something more meaningful at work here.
A film can be the most outlandish sci-fi, horror, or whatever, but to be successful it has to have some sort of hook that enables you to suspend disbelief or grounds it in some kind of believable version of ""reality"". This movie throws that idea out of the window completely and expects you to go along with.... well, I'm not actually sure what it offers you to go along with. It's bad. Really bad.<br/><br/>I think the critics were giving to director a free pass after ""Get Out"". For me, this is a drop off in quality more stark than M. Night Shyamalan's, after ""The 6th Sense"".<br/><br/>Avoid, unless you are desperate for a movie and have watched everything netflix, Amazon Prime, the cinema, your DVD collection and every tv network known to man, has to offer."

It's also really hard to understand the themes of the movie. I also hated get out, but at least through out its development I wanted to see how Jordan Peele would solved it, which was in a really stupid way. The most ridicoulous thing about Us are the ""scary kids"", kids are easy to kill, there's nothing scary about them. They're fragile. Not exactly Michael Mayers types.<br/><br/>Us is bland and got me more anxious than any film I had ever seen. Can we stop pretending Jordan Peele is a good director? There isn't a memorable scene in any of his two movies. To his credit he attempts to be an author, he fails miserably, but he attempts it. The other aspects of the film like cinematography and production design are well crafted, but with such a bizarre and poor execution its impossible to have a good movie.

"choiseburgerz","3","4","6","23 July 2019"," Madeas Big Happy Family meets The Purge
","I'll try to keep this short and sweet. This movie doesn't have many strong points. It was EXTREMELY overhyped, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters.<br/><br/>The antagonists aren't scary. Like, at all. They're not spooky or all that strange either. In fact, they're mostly pretty lame, unoriginal and easily defeatable. You've seen all of their mannerisms a million times before, from the croaky voice, the creepy smile, and the crawling on all 4's like a spider. The only scene where they even seem like a looming threat is the first 10 minutes after they've appeared, and that part is only scary because it's mysterious. The origins of the doppelgangers aren't well explained, and don't make any sense whatsoever when explained. And again, their story just turns out to be pretty lame and the plot holes are plentiful.<br/><br/>There is a bit of humor thrown into the movie. It's intended to be ironic humor but it just flat out doesn't work. Jokes are thrown in at random times here and there with no pattern or reason for them. It just seems like Jordan Peele wasn't taking it seriously and had just got done smoking a bowl when he thought of a few wacky lines or scenes on the spot. It makes our characters appear to not be taking any of this seriously, and it completely ruined the protagonists husband all together.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but the way the characters act doesn't make sense either. They're not very scared when they should be. They're very scared when they shouldn't be. They dont seem to care when a family member is in trouble, or even literally being attacked. There are several scenes where one of the kids or the wife are nowhere to be found and in danger, and here comes the husband to crack some lame joke and not even care about his family.<br/><br/>All in all the movie just isn't very interesting. It's not thrilling and it's not scary. It was a pretty big let-down actually. The plot holes are larger than the actual script. All the 10/10 upvotes on here are either bots or people who worked on the movie personally. If you like horror/thriller films, you will probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>3/10 Just not a good movie"
"Gradomyr","4","4","6","15 July 2019"," Too silly
","First, I admit, this movie has some good tension. It's nicely made, and the main actress plays very well.
But the plot is silly and unreasonable beyond even scary movie standards. The whole tethered world is insane. What are they? If they are human beings, how are they connected to their copies? If they are mystical shadows of humans why do they have different names? If they are abandoned who maintains the underground? Their own words ""we are Americans"" do not help. Is this some sort of political commentary? It must be, because the movie is called Us. Get it? U.S. But how? What? Why? Do they have a copy of everyone in US? (Does that include illegal immigrants?) Why Santa Cruz of all places? Why children play with sharp toys that cut their hands?? Why do they eat raw rabbits???

","Okay. Just like what I said, I'm going to talk about how I thought this was a comedy, or at least a horror-comedy. I'm surprised that this is a 100% horror film. Am I missing something? Literally, I was laughing all throughout the film. While watching, I was like, Wait. I thought this was horror. Oh, it's Peele. So maybe it's not. But I heard people say it's so scary. I was just confused the entire time. And the whole plot itself is funny. Oh, there are tunnels in the United States with no purpose at all, let's make a movie where there are actually thousands of crazy people there. That's a skit right there. And it didn't make any sense at all, so I was like, Well. It's comedy. I guess that's the punchline. So I finished the movie and checked online the genre of the film. It's legit horror? I'm so confused. I'm only writing this because that's how confused I am. I know that on horror films there are some funny scenes sometimes, but this film. It was 50% funny. The comedic timing was there and had Peele's style all over it. Like how the first shadow people were killed. The sound. The timing. Everything. The guy was dragged by a boat. Come on. That was funny. Maybe I'm going crazy and that's the point. Overall, this movie just didn't make sense. The acting was superb, but the plot was trying too hard to go somewhere. If it's a horror-comedy, as I thought it was, like Zombieland, then it's amazing. But as a serious horror film? Being compared to Get Out? What? I'm so confused. The cinematography and sound made it so creepy, I get it, but to be compared to an actual horror film, I'm so baffled. Even if you remove the comedy part, maybe I'm not smart enough to see the logic of the movie because it does not make any sense at all. And the twist in the end was predictable.

While some parts are creepy, it's creepy just for the sake of being creepy. We don't know why the doubles act the way they do and aside from a brief and flippant explanation to their existence, we are really just given scraps of a story and expected to feast.<br/><br/>So why should we care?

","1.Because of the antagonists of this movie,the ""Tethered"",are exact living copies of their host with exactly same appearance and character from their host,I can not figure out which is the copy and which is the host, especially in the later part of the movie when the secret basement was shown and during the part where the protagonist killed her copy and her memory of year 1986.
2.The plot and meaning of this movie is still a mystery;I don't know what the ""Tethered"" in red holding hands together and police choppers flying above them in the ending means.Can't the police on the choppers just shoot them directly?!
As a summary, this movie is a horror movie because it featured blood and gore,killing and antagonists wearing dark-colored cape,but this movie is also not a horror movie because the ""Tethered"" is still a mystery.
The worst thing is,this movie is with a nasty long opening music with enigmatic, Shamanism-like lyrics.

He is such a favourite that he gets a free pass with this juvenile, predictable and clich√©d mess that comprises 'Us'.<br/><br/>Come on, people! You have villains that make unnecessary speeches/illogical time-wasting actions every time a main character is at their mercy, but unimportant characters are conveniently and efficiently bumped off without said speeches or any formalities.<br/><br/>I can point you to hundreds of 3-star (or less) efforts that use exactly the same plot device. It is a puerile, adolescent technique that went out of fashion two decades ago. It is just lazy.<br/><br/>The characters are all one-dimensional. The plot is non-existent. The weird premise is simply nonsensical, and does not make anything mysterious or baffling, but simply stupid. There is nothing to understand, no hidden deeper meanings, nothing to figure out. Ooooh! And don't forget the obligatory scary twist at the ending, one that just makes no sense in terms of what has gone before.<br/><br/>What is going on here? Were you really scared? Were you really on the edge of your seat, rooting for the protagonists? Did you think, for one moment, that ANY of the main characters were in mortal danger?

"david-meldrum","9","4","6","3 April 2019"," Scary, chilling, head-scrambling, funny, satirical, profound, technically brilliant.
","Early in Quentin Tarantino's career it was hard to tell what type of film-maker he'd turn out to be. His early films were so soaked in pop culture references, sly allusions and dialogue about comic book characters and the like, that the task of decoding what, if anything his films were about was a largely fruitless one. It could be argued that we still don't know; we do know that he needs a more ruthless editor, but there seems to be little (if any) thematic consistency. Two films in to Jordan Peele's career, we know rather more. His films so far seem equally replete with pop cultural references; there's little sign of the ill discipline that has come to define Tarantino (though in Quentin's defence, Pulp Fiction was just the right side of baggy. Just.); and whilst we can see the fingerprints of Tarantino in, for instance, Peele's use of music, we can also see the larger themes he's reaching for. It helps that Peele is sticking to the horror genre; but taking Peele's calling card of Get Out and his second film Us together, it's apparent that he may well be one of the key film-makers of the era. He may also, it seems, be the prophet our times need.<br/><br/>Whereas Get Out was clearly and obviously about race, Us could be about any number of things. Peele has been articulate about how this is in itself a breakthrough - a major film by a black film-maker with black leads that isn't about race shows, he says, a development in the conversation. The way Us appears to light up like a forcefield whichever of a number of themes you bring near it could be a weakness, and lead to a game of decoding that causes viewers to lose the power of the film's concerns; for me, that would be a mistake from the viewer rather than Peele, but I can see why it may be a problem.<br/><br/>Let's be clear; Us is scary, funny, technically brilliant, stuffed with standout performances, and profound. Is it better than Get Out? Who knows. That seems a daft game to play. Like Get Out, you can decode any number of cultural and genre reference points; I'll throw one in to the ring I haven't seen mentioned (yet) - HG Wells's 'The Time Machine', the science-fiction book that more or less created the time travel sub-genre. The influence here isn't in time travel; but rather, to me, in something hinted at in the film's opening shot that becomes a central part of the film's plot. I'll say no more on that for fear of spoilers.<br/><br/>It's an adrenaline ride, for sure. A home invasion movie, a doppelg√É¬§nger movie, a family in crisis drama, a slyly satirical/comic take on and deconstruction of the American dream, consumerism, capitalism, celebrity charity drives (prefiguring the Insta-charity brigade); it touches too on animal testing. Like many horror movies it looks at the consequences of early trauma on later life, throwing in a dose of imposter syndrome for good measure.<br/><br/>For me it says most about privilege. During apartheid in South Africa, the governing party banned any art that would be deemed to subvert their rule. Sometimes they missed the point. Bright Blue's song 'Weeping' snuck through, because it appeared to be a song about a man with noisy neighbours. It was, of course, a parable; a parable about the way white South Africa kept the rest of the country at bay. In the words of the song, in the quest for peace and order, the threat of the angry underclass was stifled. The mistake made was that what they thought was anger, wasn't; it was weeping. But if the weeping remained unheard for too long, it may well turn to anger.<br/><br/>That's the thematic territory that Us seems to me to tread. As the moneyed classes bury themselves in consumption and comfort, an underclass is increasingly alienated, and increasingly desperate. The underclass might be seen as angry; in fact they are weeping. But when the weeping is unheard, and instead patronised and then forced to continue to pay the price of the privileged's comfortable life, we watch it eventually turn to blood-soaked, murderous anger.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that, controversies about accents notwithstanding, Lupita Nyong'o's central performance is remarkable; each cast member who's asked to play two versions of the same character is similarly terrific. Elisabeth Moss is superb in her supporting role, which does not give her enough to do (but in fairness, no film gives an actress of her remarkable talents enough to do). There are jump scares to rival most, but it's the chilling, creeping dread and the final, head-scrambling twist that lives in your (sub) conscious for days after. It has what may be the bleakest final shot since Frank Darabont's The Mist, made bearable by the film's well-judged wit and laugh out loud tension-breaking.<br/><br/>As with Get Out, Peele is tackling one of our era's most urgent issues, calling us to listen and act before it's too late. Whilst churches squabble, politicians drown in self-interest and celebrity culture demands its tribute, Jordan Peele may well be the prophet our times urgently need. Maybe many won't give credence to that, soaked as his horror stories are in blood and fear; but therein lies the challenge. Prophets rarely invite us to comfort.<br/><br/>Have we ears to hear?"
"kensacca","1","4","6","3 April 2019"," Lousy follow up to Get Out
","I'll support any director with a great concept and story. The trailer to this film was all you needed to see. The rest is just boring junk. I fell asleep two to three times because I was bored to tears. There wasn't one clap at the end of this film, so anyone who rated this a ten is just not being straight. Horror?

","I preferred Us to Get Out as it was more of a traditional horror film. To start, some of the issues in a lot of horror films are present here, ie characters making poor decisions. But I guess if they weren't to make those poor decisions, we wouldn't have the film. I like the comedic elements and the way they were interwoven into the story, although I did think there was a bit too much comedy present in the film. But those are my only gripes. Lupita, Winston, and the children all give a remarkable performance as both the good and evil side of themselves. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance from Lupita in fact. I will definitely be watching this one again soon. I feel it will be even better after a second viewing. 9/10."

","After months of waiting since the first trailer for Jordan Peele's second feature film was released, I was finally able to see ""Us"" in cinemas on the films opening night in my city. While it was not necessarily the film I was expecting to see, after 3 days of non-stop reflection I can confirm that this was a film that I really, really enjoyed, and would even go as far as to say that I loved.<br/><br/>Let my just reiterate that the trailers that were released for this film are not as spoiler filled as those for Jordan Peele's first film, Get Out, were. The film is filled with so many layers, not only with the main plot itself but also within the films subtext, which I must say while it is still there it would not exactly be as easy for general film audiences to determine in comparison to Peele's first film. In saying that it is still a deeply enjoyable film for all types of film goers, as long as they are able to accept that Us is not your typical horror film, and is probably not going to be the film they suspected it would be from the trailer.<br/><br/>Technically Us is outstanding. In terms of cinematography, the film excels, particular in its opening scene. Every time that something appears in the frame of this film you can tell it has been purposely put there for a reason, whether its excellent foreshadowing, or even just a fun reference from Peele, it carries significance and will undoubtedly make this film excellent for repeat viewings. The score for this film is marvelous. While many would be concerned whether the trailers extremely popular rendition of, ""I Got 5 On It"" by Luniz would make it into the film, don't worry, you won't be disappointed. I must give a special shout out to the track, Pas De Deux. It is so chilling and eerie, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it. It also plays in one of the films best scenes, which I of course won't spoil.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great. All of the actors do such an awesome job acting in two very different roles, which I'm sure would have been very difficult. It is because of this acting (and of course Peele's writing) that helps make all of the characters, especially the Wilson family, so likable. Special shout out to Lupita Nyong'o and both pf her chilling performances as Adelaide and Red, as well as Winston Duke, who plays the goofy and lovable father of the Wilson family, Gabe, so well.<br/><br/>In terms of criticisms, it is difficult to talk about without spoiling the film. There were multiple points in the film where I felt that the comedy seemed to undermine the suspense and horror. While the comedy in itself was not weak at all, the comedy throughout the film was all fantastic and most of the jokes landed, its just that if the film was a bit more horror focused in some of these scenes it would have made the horror more effective. There were also a few plot holes with the film and its ending which could have been explained a bit better, which I of course won't go in to detail.<br/><br/>Apart from these few small gripes however, Us is a great film. Its sometimes hilarious, and sometimes bone chilling, and for the most part provides a good balance of the two. I had an excellent time watching Us, and can't wait for a second viewing!<br/><br/>Us (2019) - 8/10"

"plasticanimalz","8","4","6","30 March 2019"," Wow, Some of the Dumbest Reviews Ever
","I am a big fan of horror films and Jordan Peele's work, and from the beginning, not when people saw Get Out and suddenly realized he existed. I was fine with being satisfied with my enjoyment of the film but then saw all these bad reviews that said consistently the same thing - people didn't understand the film, or that it wasn't logical. Really? IT'S A HORROR MOVIE! Is Freddie Krueger logical? Jason Vorhees? Pet Semetary? No. Most horror films start and end in fantastical terms that are based somewhat in reality in order to scare us. That's why Freddie Krueger scared the pants off people in the '80s because that was the first time a villain attacked us in our dreams. Fantasy meets reality. That's what horror is.<br/><br/>A lot of Jordan Peele's work is based on his obvious love of '70s, '80s and '90s films, and general geek culture. Get Out, as he stated, was inspired by the '70s version of The Stepford Wives. And, if you've seen the film, like I have, Get Out is basically a clever reboot of that film replacing racism with misogyny. I wonder if all the people who thought Us isn't logical think you can put people in a deep hypnosis and they become robot slaves. Nope, Get Out isn't logical either cause it's a HORROR MOVIE.<br/><br/>I thought Us was a superior evolution of Peele's career because, as I said, Get Out is pretty paint-by-numbers to Stepford Wives. Watch it, you won't see much difference other than the theme. Where, Us is a generally inspired by Peele's love of '80s films, and I'm guessing he saw Three Identical Strangers, and he took that inspiration and created something wholly original and intriguing. Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, there was one guy laughing in our theatre when Elisabeth Moss showed up as the Tethered, but every one else in the packed theatre was scared AF. It was a very tense film with little breathing room. I haven't been that scared in a film since Freddy Krueger. When I asked my partner what she thought of the film she said, she was scared, traumatized, ruined from horror movies for all time, and would take every second back if she could, and she had her face covered through most of the film. She said what she was able to watch was very good. And when I used the creepy voice all night she was jumpy and irritated with me. That is a good horror movie.<br/><br/>For everyone that has their theories, here's what it's about: in the opening scene when the camera is zooming in on the '80s TV, talking about Hands Across America, there are video boxes on both sides of the TV. The three films to the left were C.H.U.D. (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers), Goonies, The Man With Two Brains. Little Easter eggs of what the film is about. All are campy '80s movies that are considered cult geek classics. There's not some attached, deeper meaning like people are trying to assign to Peele's work. This is the same man who's first film was Keanu, a story about a gang kidnapping a man's kitten. Like Tarintino, Peele is just a man deeply passionate about film, and what he likes, he's just more into '80s cult films, while Tarintino likes Korean action films. And many think Tarantino is a genius, but a lot of his career is based on stuff he ripped from Korean films and other places that most Americans don't recognize so it seems fresh and completely his own. But both Peele and Tarintino take their inspiration and create fresh, interesting ideas of their own.<br/><br/>Aside from Peele's job well done, the actors performances were excellent. I've definitely jotted Lupita in my book as actors to watch out for and see their films. I've seen her in several films, but she hasn't had something that I've seen that let her shine in the way this film did. She was usually there merely to support some man's role, rather than shine on her own.<br/><br/>Though there wasn't as much humor inserted into this film as Get Out, probably because it would have slowed down the bullet train of tension, but my favorite moment was when Elisabeth Moss told her ECHO to call the police and it played N.W.A. instead; very funny. I love how Peele plays between both worlds of horror and humor, kind of like his own modern take of '80s horror/comedies. He's done a good job of modernizing that genre. I look forward to his take of The Twilight Zone."

"lyrafowlpotter","Null","4","6","29 March 2019"," What a Great Premise!
","There are no spoilers here. :D The premise to this film is wonderful. The first 30 minutes before the ""threat"" shows up are great. Unlike some people on here, I prefer 2hr films, more time for the characters and story to be fleshed out. I also am a fan of slow burns, I can enjoy a fast-paced film but slower films, again, allow for more exposition. Unfortunately, that just didn't happen here.<br/><br/>I love psychological films of all stripes, and mind-bending films are some of my favorite films. It would be lazy to write me off because I don't totally share your opinion. This isn't a horror film, it is a thriller, and unfortunately, as a thriller, it falls under the weight of it's own plot holes, and lack of suspense.<br/><br/>""Get Out"", while effective, is overrated and overblown. It is, in some ways, just as illogical as this film. Here, however, what is lazy writing and lazy plot devices, is being described as ""genius"". ""Get Out"" was a pretty racist film that was supposed to be critiquing race issues, okay, than don't have ALL of your white characters be evil, theirs a start for you. Despite that, it was still a well-made film, it had a good build up, held your attention, and had a good solid final act. It didn't deserve Academy awards, especially since ""Hereditary"", a superior film in almost every way, didn't get a single nod. ""Us"" is not so lucky, as to have the positive side of ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, the cinematography and direction are very well-done. From a technical standpoint, outside of the script, this is a great film. Unfortunately, a good script, even if the story is simplistic, is one of the most vital elements, if not the most important.<br/><br/>Why does the script not work here like it did in ""Get Out""? ""Get Out"" had a superb finale, it was tense and suspenseful with some good kills. ""Get Out"" created mysteries in the same way ""Us"" does, but ""Us"" not only doesn't answer most of them, it offers up allegory that is nonsensical, and too many plot threads that make no sense. Other reviewers have already expounded on this issue. They could be overlooked more if the film was more presented as a 100% fantasy, or the ending was something along the lines of ""The Signal"", or if the focus was solely on the people experiencing, and not on the issue itself. Meaning, no answers would have been better than the answers it gave.<br/><br/>Overall, it had good atmosphere in some parts of the film, and again, the first 30 minutes were superb and had such a wonderful buildup, that unfortunately was totally dropped after that point. This will rightly become, a forgotten film in 10yrs. It isn't very memorable save a few scenes, and it squandered so much potential. Was it not made by an over-hyped film director, this film would have languished in development hell, and been likely bombed, if it even made it to theaters and wasn't straight to VOD. Maybe it would have become a cult classic, and maybe it would have been a better movie since it wouldn't have to deal with the MPAA, but given it's current iteration, and with the expectations it had on it's shoulders, it is barely above average.<br/><br/>God Bless ~Amy"

","Peele has had an incredible start to his career and I came into this movie with incredibly high expectations. Coming into Us with such high expectations definitely set it up for disappointment. The production, cinematography, and score, were all nothing short of incredible. That said, the writing felt almost rushed and there were massive plot holes that inevitably left the audience feeling disappointed. Unanswered questions are fine in a movie, but some of the big reveals felt forced and didn't make sense with other events that happened in the movie.

It's a movie that has every kind of genres, although I certainly felt it was more comedy and thriller than horror, and I guess by horror they mean the horror that the family in the film had felt, not as we will be frightened from it jumping from our seats! It really didn't need to have that much of funny scenes. Sound effects are great in movie Theaters, actors weren't that good, and I didn't think they're acting for a horror movie as some scenes are so stupidly directed for such a good movie, expect all of that, Lupita preformance was extremely good. I'd give this 6.9/10 just because the beginning and the end of it, plus Lupita performance.

"robinsonaustin-07490","6","4","6","23 March 2019"," A Major Disappointment
",".To start with, I thought that Peele's previous film Get Out was okay, something not necessarily warrant of a high score, but it was a fun watch. With Us...it was..okay. I feel that this is another example of hype killing a film. For the most part, I liked the performances of Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o. The kid actors were also pretty good, not annoying as most cases are with child actors. The Tylers' actors were fine. The double performances that the actors had to do when getting into their Tethered role was impressive.<br/><br/>As for anything else...I'll just admit it, the writing was not good for this movie. While I appreciate that it wasn't going to be about race as Get Out was, there is always a meaning to a film even if it's unintentional. The problem here is that Peele was juggling too many plot ideas. I mean you have the numerous allusions to Jeremiah 11:11, the rabbits, the fact that the Tethered lived in tunnels that were abandoned. The Tethered is an interesting concept on paper, but the issue is Peele seemed to not know what he exactly wanted when making these creatures. I've heard theories that they could represent second-class citizens who were wronged by society among other alternate interpretations, but the Tethered's nature is hard to process. There is an explanation given to the doppelgangers' existence, but the problem is it borders on the realm of absurdity. Get Out had its out there premise of brain transplantation but it was still in a relatively realistic setting. Us on the other hand goes so far pass the point of believability, it takes me out of just accepting what the film is.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was the comedy. While Get Out had comedic moments, they never eclipsed the horror. With Us, there are several moments that are meant to be scary, but they are undermined by comedy. Winston Duke's character for instance doesn't work so much for me. He is supposed to be that stereotypical hip dad that embarrasses the kids, but with Gabe, I felt that he was more annoying to an extent.<br/><br/>Lastly..the twist. I won't give away what it was at first, but when it happened, it irritated me. While it doesn't ruin the movie, it is utterly predictable. From just the first trailer I saw the twist coming from a mile away and I hoped that Peele would wisely opt out of it. But we got it, and it is forever instilled in the audience's collective brains.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film. On the contrary, it is entertaining. The soundtrack is good. However, I feel that the writing has too many holes in it, which is a shame because Peele received an Oscar for his screenplay of his directorial review. The Tethered could've been interesting and probably gone up there with the likes of Skarsgard's Pennywise or the Babadook. Instead, it is a major disappointment. This film should not be compared to Get Out as it is its own thing, so when you decide to watch it, try to keep the lingering comparing it to Get Out film at bay."
"jeremy-m-poe","4","4","6","22 March 2019"," I wanted to like this movie
","Spoilers below<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Either the movie was super meta in its genius critique of forced symbolism, subjectivity, the hypocrisy of the woke movement (I know Peele wouldn't think that, but I do), and our overly obsessed culture with useless trivia, or the movie was guilty of it all. Depends on who you ask I guess, but my thoughts are Peele was deliberate about the vague construct of this movie. He has said that Us would be a Rorschach test for audiences. That maybe the only thing that saves this movie.<br/><br/>
Initial viewing of the film, I thought the movie was terrible. I honestly still feel like that could be a possibility after more thought, because there were a lot of things I did not like about the film, but if my hypothesis proves true, I can dislike but respect the film. Maybe he's trolling everyone, because the symbolism is SUPER on the nose throughout the movie and somehow the symbolism is also incredibly vague. What I mean to say is that the symbols in movie are too ""Look at me! I'm a symbol! I mean something!"" I kept thinking to myself, ""Why are doing this, Peele? What's the point?"" Again, Peele does not strike me as someone who came into this subjectively or haphazardly. He had a clear motivation when he made this movie. Which leads me to my second point.<br/><br/>
There's a moment in the film where the father and daughter are behind an ambulance truck and they see the line of the Tethered holding hands. The father makes a comment that it looked like some kind of screwed up art project (this line on the surface is supposed to be a bad dad joke, but I think it actually summarizes the whole point of the movie for me). It's such a blase and throwaway statement, but it makes sense if you, ahem, follow *the white rabbit.* You follow me? You see what Peele is doing that is secretly genius? How many people are going on rabbit trails after this movie? A LOT.<br/><br/>
The symbols are rabbit trails.<br/><br/>
It's possible that movie is a critique of itself, tying into the whole theme about US, a doubled, layered meaning that we need to deal with us before we deal with others, which in turn will positively affect the outcome of the nation we live in. While I'm definitely not part of the woke, SJW movement, I definitely think before you deal with anyone else's problems, you should remove the log in your own eye first, then learn to help others with the splinter in theirs. That's a message I can roll with, but if it's some vague thing about race, our history, etc. then the movie fails. I hate art that tries to be subjective.<br/><br/>
I think he clearly had some good ideas here (I agree with Grace from Beyond the Trailer that I don't think he executed these ideas very well). But I'm not going to trash the film either. At least Peele made an effort to make something unique and different, so I can appreciate that. I just personally was not a fan of the film, but I respect the craft of the game and his hard work put into this movie<br/><br/>
That aside, I do have some good things to say about this film.<br/><br/>
My praise for this film has to go to Lupita's acting, the third act (I for one enjoyed the final act, the *AMAZING* camera work and cinematography, and the best part of the film: the music. The music was so good, that I literally looked forward to hearing any of it when it came through the speakers in our theater.<br/><br/>
End of line."
"Bertaut","7","10","20","1 April 2019"," An effective socio-political thriller looking at issues of class and privilege
","There's a detail to be found in writer/director <a href=""/name/nm1443502/"">Jordan Peele</a>'s second feature, Us, which gives you a good idea of the amount of thought that has gone into the film. In the opening scene, set in 1986, a young girl walks into a hall of mirrors, with a sign outside proclaiming ""Find yourself"", and a picture of a Native American above the door, with the words ""Shaman Vision Quest"". Later in the film, now in the present day, the same hall of mirrors is seen, the same ""Find yourself"" is seen, but now the picture of the Native American has been replaced with a wizard, and ""Shaman Vision Quest"" with ""Merlin's Enchanted Forest."" This change, easily dismissed as representative of everything that's wrong with PC culture, is actually much more telling. It represents a meaningless and superficial attempt to tackle society's discomfort with its violent history. It's like putting a plaster on a severed limb; ""sure, the white man slaughtered the Native Americans, but if we do things like change signs on amusement parks, everything should be forgiven, right?"" This, in turn, speaks directly to one of the film's most salient themes - the US (or us) is a country built on violence, racism, and oppression, but as long as such things are swept under the carpet and no one talks about them, then there's no need to worry. Peele very much wants people to start talking about them.<br/><br/>I wasn't the biggest fan of Peele's previous film, <a href=""/title/tt5052448/"">Get Out (2017)</a>, although I certainly admired how he reformulated the tropes of the genre so as to suggest that just because the US gives the appearance of being a pseudo-post-racial society, it doesn't necessarily mean that that's true behind closed doors. With Us, he is working in a similarly metaphorical mode, using the tropes of the home invasion thriller to probe issues of class and, especially, privilege. The plot is an allegory for a nation divided into those above and those below, the haves and the have-nots, those with opportunity and those without. Essentially, Peele suggests that when social/economic/political inequality is so pronounced for so long, sooner or later, the only recourse available to the have-nots is to make a grand statement, a statement that will almost certainly not be peaceful.<br/><br/>The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in 1986 with young Adelaide Thomas (<a href=""/name/nm10014402/"">Madison Curry</a>) seeing something in a hall of mirrors that deeply traumatises her, resulting in her not talking for several years. The film then cuts to the present day as the now adult Adelaide Wilson (an astounding <a href=""/name/nm2143282/"">Lupita Nyong'o</a>) travels to Santa Cruz with her family - husband Gabe (<a href=""/name/nm6328300/"">Winston Duke</a>), daughter Zora (<a href=""/name/nm8630978/"">Shahadi Wright Joseph</a>) and son Jason (<a href=""/name/nm8256189/"">Evan Alex</a>). The family is comfortably middle-class, although much to Gabe's irritation, they are nowhere near as wealthy as their neighbours, the Tylers - Kitty (<a href=""/name/nm0005253/"">Elisabeth Moss</a>), Josh (<a href=""/name/nm1727367/"">Tim Heidecker</a>), and twin daughters Becca and Lyndsey (<a href=""/name/nm1344400/"">Cali Sheldon</a> and <a href=""/name/nm1343484/"">Noelle Sheldon</a>). Uneasy at being so close to the scene of her childhood trauma, Adelaide becomes convinced that something terrible is going to happen, and that night, when the power cuts out, Jason reveals that there are four people standing ominously in the driveway.<br/><br/>It's not a spoiler, of course, to say that the people in the driveway are the Wilsons' doppelg√§ngers. However, one of the problems with parsing the film is that so many of the socio-political themes are tied to who the doppelg√§ngers are and what they want, that it's difficult to discuss them without spoilers. So, small spoiler ahead - the doppelg√§ngers are called the Tethered; essentially, they are an underground-dwelling race of lookalikes, spiritually tied to those living above. Although partly inspired by the 1960 ""<a href=""/title/tt0734590/"">Mirror Image (1960)</a>"" episode of The Twilight Zone, the main influences for the Tethers appear to be urban legends surrounding ""mole people"" and, more specifically, the conflict between the Morlocks and the Eloi in <a href=""/name/nm0920229/"">H.G. Wells</a>'s The Time Machine (1895).<br/><br/>Setting out to probe both economic and societal divisions in the contemporary US, Peele introduces the theme early on with Gabe's jealousy at the Tylers' nicer house, fancier car, and much bigger boat. Later, after the arrival of the Tethered, the theme becomes more explicit; through no fault of their own, they live in an underground realm, deprived of the opportunities those above the surface have access to. The allegorical dimension couldn't be clearer; the film is essentially a parable about class division. The Wilsons represent a middle-class all-American family; the Tethered represent the underclass, those without access to the privileges enjoyed by the wealthy, despite possessing the same capacity for happiness and success. This similarity is driven home when Adelaide asks Red (her Tethered) who they are, and Red seems confused by the question, answering (truthfully), ""we're Americans.""<br/><br/>In this sense, the film is very much about marginalisation. Adelaide is not smarter or more capable than Red; rather, the main difference between the two is just that of the difference between a poor person and a rich one; fate of birth. This speaks to perhaps the film's most important point - the marginalised, destitute, and discriminated against can succeed just as much as everyone else if only they're given the opportunity to do so. This is also alluded to in the powerful final shot, which reveals that the Tethered have accomplished something which the surface dwellers once attempted but failed.<br/><br/>The Tethered are the ignored, those swept under the rug of society, out of sight out of mind, just like the alteration to the picture above the hall of mirrors, with Peele allegorically examining what could happen when the marginalised and ignored can be marginalised and ignored no longer, whether they be the economically impoverished, the racially suppressed, vets suffering from PTSD, non-Americans xenophobically regarded as the Other, really any group of people that society at large has shunned. True, the deeper he explores the Tethered, the more insurmountable logistical problems that are thrown up, and the further he strains credibility. However, it's a testament to both his filmmaking acumen and the strength of his thematic concerns, that such straining is not as detrimental as it may sound.<br/><br/>Even more so than Get Out, Us is exceptionally accomplished from an aesthetic point of view. The opening scene, for example, features extraordinarily impressive photography by <a href=""/name/nm1227638/"">Mike Gioulakis</a>, designed to place us as close to young Adelaide's consciousness as possible. As she wanders along behind her parents, the camera sticks primarily to her height, with everything towering above her, whilst the candied apple she holds is hypnotically red and shiny (one could say Edenic). Another fine scene features the rare use of a split diopter, a tool favoured by <a href=""/name/nm0000361/"">Brian De Palma</a> that allows both foreground and background subjects to stay in focus simultaneously. Using it in a crucial scene towards the end of the film, it is the only time we see Adelaide and Red's faces in the same shot at the same time, with Red shot in BCU, facing away from Adelaide, who stands behind her.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Nyong'o's nuanced work as Adelaide and Red is especially noteworthy as a study in contrasts. Apart from their appearance, nothing about the two is similar; their posture, their facial expressions, how they talk, how they walk, how they react to things around them, how they use their hands. Adelaide, a former ballet dancer, is graceful and elegant, whereas Red is automaton-like, her movements almost staccato and splintered into sudden bursts. It's a clinic on how to convey individualised psychology through body language, and at times, it's hard to believe it's the same actress playing both roles.<br/><br/>In terms of problems, there are a few. Aside from the insurmountable practical issues with the Tethered, my biggest issue was that every time the Tethered want to kill someone, they do so immediately, without ceremony or pause. However, they pass up multiple opportunities to kill the Wilsons. At first, this seems as if it's because they wish to keep them alive for some reason, but later in the film, we find out that really, they just want to kill them. Never once do they attempt to do so with the ruthless efficiency with which they kill others, which is an irritating inconsistency. Additionally, the final twist, of which I will say nothing, doesn't really work, feeling like something of a twist for twist's sake that was never fully integrated into the narrative.<br/><br/>These small problems notwithstanding, Us is an impressive film that improves on Get Out in almost every way, and which serves as a more complete artistic statement. The Tethers are monsters because they have been left with little choice other than to become monsters, imprisoned by a system they had no part in creating and in which they are not allowed to participate. Both visually accomplished and thematically complex, Us once again finds Peele examining the kind of social oppression that no one wants to acknowledge, but this time he widens his scope to move beyond issues of race. In Get Out, he took a story of bodily possession and moulded it into a story of black/white relations. In Us, he demonstrates that oppression can easily cross racial boundaries. And the real horror of this isn't to be found in monsters or jump scares. It's to be found in humanity's frequent inhumanity to one another."

","The idea that a family experiences a horror and that horror is themselves has much potential. Unfortunately, this has little to do with Us.

"avenuesf","5","10","20","23 March 2019"," Way too complicated
","Just like ""Get Out,"" I eagerly waited to see this but then walked out of the theater this afternoon scratching my head when it was over. Unlike some of the reviewers here I can't say I was disappointed, as I thought so much of the film was well done. First and foremost it's a horror movie , and Jordan Peele really knows how to build terror and some great suspense (as an example, there's a horrifying scene in which a family is matter-of-factly massacred to a Beach Boys soundtrack that was masterfully done). The problem is that the plot and logic of ""Us"" became so complicated and convoluted that I stopped trying to follow it halfway through the film. In fact, I just read an explanation of the ending on the Digital Spy website and I seriously doubt most people will be able to figure it out... there are way too many details that aren't spelled out very well during the film's running time, many of them unnecessary.<br/><br/>""Us"" reminded me of an updated version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" with references to other horror films like ""The Birds"" and ""The Purge"" thrown in. There's also a humorous wink to a part of the plot early in the film by a scene with a videotape of ""C.H.U.D."" in the foreground.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o gives an incredible performance and carries a lot of the film, as well as Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex.<br/><br/>I hope Jordan Peele continues to make horror films, because I think he has the skills to make a great one; but when the audience is so distracted by trying to understand what's actually happening and why, the film loses a lot of its impact. ""Us"" seemed to me to be a series of well-directed scenes but I couldn't tie them all up at the end so they made sense and I felt kind of cheated by that."
"esweet-154-191260","4","10","20","22 March 2019"," Disconnected, discombobulated. Went in excited, came out disappointed.
","Firstly, I don't see 'color'. I question this 'color' talk when I hear it as I grew up watching the Cosby Show along with millions of others making it a top series of the day. I hear Jordan Peele's talk about adding color representation to the big screen and that's to be celebrated, but for me a movie is about the movie. A good rating is easy, a movie just has to entertain, it's plot, it's editing, photography and acting, anyone of those being exceptional is enough to draw me in. I liked the then standing 100 score on rotten tomatoes, that and Peele's talk show circuit was enough to sign me up. I was genuinely excited to see this on the big screen, maybe that anticipation contributed to my disappointment in the form of a lunch bag let down. I wanted it to keep me on the edge of my seat, it didn't. I wanted to discover some hidden complex connected plot line and frankly it wasn't present. What little surprise there was has been done before. I liked the beginning, the slightly obvious homage to the time. Like everyone else there were moments of 'oh yeah, I remember that...','..the hands across America thing', the subtle uses of that age appropriate typefaces, the primitive lower thirds weren't lost on the audience either. The pace starts off slow and drops disconnected clues along the way that tease the ending prematurely. Without spoiling it, the ending isn't all that original. We've seen bits of this storyline before, Body Snatchers, The Strangers Prey at Night, Journey to the far side of the sun, all served up in varying degrees in this Peele's second theatrical release. I read somewhere that he was displaying the divide in the US, that the hands across America is used to show American unity, except they are all in red which confusingly blurs the films villainy against the films humanity, who is who, why is this presented somewhat disconnected from the plot. Are we supposed to embrace that the cause and a solution to the American existential crisis resides within us individually? I don't see it. A duality of causation per individual does not exist in reality, maybe he is trying to encourage a population to empathetically reach across the aisle, to understand another's view to help bring some closure at middle ground. If he is, it's going to be clearly lost on the same demographic that celebrates Trumps tariff revenues as a win when that money isn't coming from the wallet of overseas companies but the wallets of middle America who now pay more for their preferred goods and services. Other countries manufacturers don't suck up the tariff, it gets added on to the landed continental US price and its North Americans that pay that bill, this is basic stuff. A crowd that isn't savvy enough to recognized their diminished purchasing power, isn't likely going to meet anyone halfway, anywhere. If we leave politics and divisiveness aside, is this a good movie? It's well shot, the colorization is decent, the doppelg√§nger acting is impressive and the concept is decent, albeit d√©j√† vu. I think Jordan had some good concept bones and a lot of ideas, I think he rode the success of his Get Out Oscar to get this movie made and in the can but he rushed it. Nothing feels resolved, everything feels like there could be more back story, more flesh put on those bones, it's a hodge podge of decent ideas all strung together in a rush. To give him the benefit of the doubt, he had all sorts of good ideas that he didn't spend enough time on. To be a harsh critic it just didn't gel, it felt sophomoric under a large production budget. It's not worth some deeper discussion, I don't agree with it being prophetic, personally, (which is all any critiique is, a personal opinion) I came away disappointed and feeling a bit ripped off. Sorry Jordan, maybe next time."
"SilverUsurper","10","15","33","30 March 2019"," Ambiguity, Artistic Vision, and Spectacular Cinematography
","Don't believe the haters. Jordan Peele's second horror film is probably the most ambitious movie in the genre since Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining. I was amazed by what the film tries to do--and by what it succeeds in accomplishing. Replete with references to other films (Hitchcock, Jaws, The Lost Boys, Halloween, etc...) to TV (particularly The Twilight Zone), to literature (the plot runs on a social dynamic similar to the one depicted in H.G. Welles's The Time Machine), and to Painting (the mirror image at the film's beginning is remarkably like Ren√© Magritte's 1937 piece, ""Reproduction Prohibited""), Us is driven by intense performances and tightly constructed scenes. In the end, it's a brilliant allegory for and deconstruction of class in America, but, beyond all of that, it's a riveting film full of irony and clever twists. Do yourself a favor and see it."

","Jordan Peele's projected second blockbuster coup slowly distends with a puzzle of philosophical devices in a hall of mirrors disguised as your average thriller.<br/><br/>After the narrative crosses its crest, audiences might want to take time to digest and appreciate its bizarre concept that at first may appear funny, trivial, and difficult to follow. Give it time and let the brewing process happen, with its substantial hints in numbers of scenes that even in the eye of its characters' emotions is a thread that connects to the major plot details.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o is eloquent with her extremely expressive and lucid acting. She portrayed two characters with a big gap on personalities and still manages to display intricately the distinctive characteristics of both. In addition, there is a conflict between her craft's subtle actions and monumental expressions that materialized two characters and appeared different but ""tethered"" or connected at the same time. Probably one of the best performance in a horror movie so far. üëè<br/><br/>In the midst of the film's note-worthy aspects, the cinematography is a stand-out. For instance, at the beach scene, there is a distinctive contrast between bliss and uncertainty - that establishes comfort, at the same time provokes hesitancy while building-up thrill. In complementary, the music score that circulates with style between classic jazz and modern music radiates emotions designed to establish intensity.<br/><br/>Too bad those thrills and intensity, were simply destroyed by the film's fillers and misplaced comedy. In every established thrill, there are snaps of fillers that breaks the anticipation. The nonessential comedic comments were designed to conjure relief and freshness from the film's already complicated narrative, but also consequently made it hard for the viewers to get back on track and follow its story-labyrinthine - an inferior move for a film that is full of symbolism.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was a decent movie, a great comedy-thriller, and does not scratch on Jordan Peele's Get Out-established name on pop-culture.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Being a horror fan first and foremost I try to be thankful for any horror that is released. I don't always like them though. This was a film about a failed government experiment on cloning. That in and of itself is a cool idea for a movie. When one of the dopplegangers says ""We are Americans"" it opens up much potential for interpretation. What isn't as cool is that Peele leaves it up for interpretation 100%. Horror shouldn't be so hard to figure out. Furthermore, at the end Adelaide has a flashback and realizes she has been the doppleganger all along. This is really a reach in the writing. I wish Peele would have kept it more simple than that. Horror makes complicated turns difficult. Instead of bracing for a scare, you're trying to figure stuff out and for me tonight as I watched the film, that was definitely not cool. I didn't hate it, but I felt numb about it. So much cliche and so much of the same tropes he used in his first horror ""Get Out.""<br/><br/>I would like to see Peele do some drama etc based on race. That is the strained topic of both his movies. Why not just let horror be horror and make those statements in a drama or sci-fi social consciousness umbrella. There was little to no character development in either film because they posed as horrors which usually don't have that. If his next is horror, I think I am twice bitten thrice shy. I'll probably miss it."

","I walked into this film thinking it was going to be a stereotypical cheesy horror film that was going to be all jump scares and no substance. Even though I love Jordan Peele I thought there was no way he could top ""Get Out"". The truth: it was a fantastic film that played the tight games with the audience. Peele is amazing at trusting the audience to play along with his story telling g and the result is a wild ride filled with cinema-nerd Easter eggs, dark humor that's somehow relatable, and layers that make you go: wait, can I rewind that part?<br/><br/>My advice is watch is once then watch it again and you see from the beginning that Peele and N'yongo are in on this story together. Her acting is telling you everything you need to know about the ending from the first scene. What makes this movie so great is it's not just scary in the typical horror movie ""What the hell"" sense. It makes you question everything you've just watched and makes you question ""was I rooting for the wrong person?""
I give this movie an A and I rank it up there as one of the greats. No it isn't ""The Shining"" or ""night of the Living Dead"" but it mixes elements of real life fears (the past coming back to haunt you, intruders invading your home, etc.) And Peele then goes ""Maybe they can handle that fear at a different level."""

It's a film that really gets you thinking and there's already some great theories about the story. I can't stress enough how much I love this film. I could go on for ages but I'll just end with Jordan Peele is a GENIUS.

"david_rudy_lee","10","10","21","25 March 2019"," Another Solid, Socially Relevant Film from Peele
","This was a film that I was highly anticipated coming out this year. It was one that I was looking into showtimes while on vacation, because I was gone the opening weekend. I kept seeing the trailer over and over again, so I finally got a chance to see it when I still had vacation day scheduled when I got home. To get into this, the synopsis is a family's serenity turns into chaos when a group of doppelgangers begins to terrorize them.<br/><br/>We kick this off back in 1986. We see a television screen showing us some commercials before cutting to a boardwalk. There's a family where the mother and father don't seem to be really getting along. The father might have a tad bit of a drinking problem and their daughter isn't talking a lot. When her father isn't paying attention, she wanders off into a hall of mirrors. It is there that she comes face to face with another little girl who looks just like her.<br/><br/>It then jumps to the present where the little girl grows up to be Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o). She is a bit on edge to the summer house she is going to with her family. Her husband is Gabe (Winston Duke). They also have two children, Zora (Shadhadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). Something interesting is that Jason has a mask with him at all times and a bit off.<br/><br/>Gabe wants to take the family to the beach, but Adelaide is completely against this. We know because of the incident that happened to her as a child. Gabe or the family has no idea. He does convince her they go meet their friends there. Their friends are Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) along with their two kids Becca (Cali Sheldon) and Lindsey (Noelle Sheldon). When Jason disappears to use the bathroom, he finds an odd man. This freaks his mother out and they go home.<br/><br/>Adelaide feels something is wrong and when the lights go out, she panics. It is then that Jason informs them there is a family outside. Their lives become a nightmare as they soon realize this other family looks exactly like them.<br/><br/>Now I am trying to go as vague with the recap as I can to not spoil the film. I will state that this film has a quote that starts it off that kind of gives away what is going on here. I've seen some people are upset about this, but I personally wasn't. I will admit, I was at first, but then I started seeing all of the signs that writer, director and producer Jordan Peele put into the film. Examples are the infamous C.H.U.D. VHS, Jason wearing a Jaws t-shirt and amongst other things. Seeing all of these things, I have to give him so much credit for putting these little things in that only horror fans will probably pick up on for references.<br/><br/>Coming into this film, I had a feeling there was going to be some social commentary going on. I can actually see that some of my friends won't pick up on them or if they do, they are going to hate them thinking that it isn't really something that is an issue, but I have to say, I think it really deepens the film for me. It is looking at the issue of race; with Gabe really wanting to be like the Tyler's as everything them get seems to outdo what he's done. There are issues of class, which is everyone against their doppelgangers. I don't want to delve too much into this, because I think I could probably write a whole paper on the different issues, what they could mean and things to this effect. It is something that knowing Peele from previous works, I had a feeling we would get and I'm so glad they're there.<br/><br/>Much like his previous film, Get Out, I love that we are following black protagonists. I love that Adelaide is our final girl and I will delve more into that in a bit. As a horror fan, I've heard and made the jokes about who would die out of my friends and even seeing the documentary Horror Noire, it makes even more sense. I like seeing things from a different perspective and a film like this definitely helps there.<br/><br/>Now I didn't love everything about this film. There is so much explained, but there is one aspect during the end that I wish would have given more. I like the bible verse that is used and I think that ties in a bit with things that are said, but I really just want to know why there are these people and why are they there? It is a scary concept and knowing what the opening lines states, could something like this be possible? Absolutely, but I just wanted a bit more of why they are there for me personally.<br/><br/>To the pacing of the film, I think for the most part it was really good. There was a lull though after the initial incident, that I lost a bit of interest. I does reel me back in as the second act really progresses, but I just felt the film lost its way a bit. I'm a big fan of the duality the film gives us of things that happened earlier in the film and then come full circle in the end. I thought the ending was solid, even though I thought the reveal was something that probably happened pretty early on. I think it makes sense for the film and why everything happens as it does.<br/><br/>For the acting, Nyong'o was great. I love how her character is so subdued in the beginning of the film and then we see the fear grow within her. It is when she is faced with saving her children and family that she grows into what she has to in order to survive. She makes a great final girl and if she really wants to keep doing horror films, with her ability, I'm completely for it. Duke was solid as her husband. He brings some comedy which I think is good for horror to alleviate a bit of the tension when needed. Moss and Heidecker were solid as well. I thought all of the kids in the film, especially Alex did well. It can be tough for children, as they seem to be either really good or really bad. Alex and Joseph for the screen time they got, were good.<br/><br/>Effects for the film I believe were mostly practical. Something else I love about Peele I've heard in interviews is that he loves the genre and I think that amount of respect is there in the basics for sure. The blood and effects look real which really helps. There is some CGI but it is hidden by shadows which hide if it doesn't look good and really keeps the realism. I thought the effects were good for sure.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film is something else that was on point. It seems to be split between score and real songs, but the ones that are chosen are perfect for when they are needed. I will never be able to hear the song 'I Got 5 on It' without thinking of this film. The real songs title or lyrics fit the situation and the others build the tension. It was very well done in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I've seen horror fans being pretty divided on this film. I took a bit of time after seeing it to process and then writing this to ensure I got down everything I wanted to say without spoiling it. I'm normally a guy who doesn't like things force fed to me, but I like that this film wants you to know things with the references. I think the social commentary is good and the acting helps bring this all to life. There is a slight editing issue to me, but it still builds tension and I like the reveal. The score and the effects were both really good as well. I personally felt this is a very good movie."

","I'm one year late to the comment section but here we go: I HATED THIS MOVIE! And after reading the reason why people ""love"" this film, i hate it even more. Before i get into the specifics, let me just say that the WORST film i've seen in my entire life is a Dutch movie called ""Borgman"". This one takes a close second.<br/><br/>1-This is a ""horror"" film that's not scary at all. It's just confusing. It ain't a slasher, nor a psychological horror, nor a monster movie. It's just confusing. It begins very interesting and when the doppelg√É¬§ngers first appeared i was like - what's gonna happen now? But when Lupita Nyong'o evil version opens her mouth, it all goes downhill...<br/><br/>2-A lot of people, are seeing hidden meanings and broad criticisms of our current society, the disparity between the haves and have nots, social inequality, racism, political connections, blah blah blah. There is NOTHING to be ""seen"" or ""understood"" here. Nothing! If Jordan Peele meant to shoehorn such discussions in there, he failed miserably. And if you can ""see"" such things it's only because you want to believe they're there. It's a movie for people who want to delude themselves into thinking they are smart. But believe me, it's just a confusing mess from start to finish.<br/><br/>3-My greatest criticism is that this movie is simply NOT ENTERTAINING. It's boring. And incredibly pretentious. It's almost as if people are watching and saying: ""only the smart ones can see it. Only the smart people can get it. Do you ""see"" it? Do you ""get"" it?"" It's an exercise in narcissism for people who consider themselves pseudo-intellectuals and particularly sensitive to the issues of modern society. You can squeeze this orange as much as you want, but nothing will come out.<br/><br/>4-Once again, we have an example of a movie where ""everything can happen"", where ""all options are on the table"", where ""several interpretations are valid"". When you have these characteristics, in reality NOTHING MAKES SENSE. You need a well-told, coherent and grounded story that will eventually lead to untied knots for fans to discuss and think about. ""Us"" doesn't leave any untied knots because there aren't any knots, not even a rope. This movie is empty."

We see them being forced to endure fictional rollercoasters and waltzers. Then, suddenly this tie seems to have gone, the clones for an unexplained reason no longer copy those above them and without any means of written of verbal communication, all six million of them are able to plan a coordinated attack.<br/><br/>How would they even share a basic bit of information like the date and time of their uprising?<br/><br/>It's also hard to understand how their underground world worked, when the young girl one a t-shirt in the fairground, her clone underground received the same t-shirt.

In this thrilling and epic tale, Jordan tells us the story of how the scariest creature we can be afraid of is ourselves. Through great characterization and great performances we are introduced to the family doppelgangers, each with their own twisted characteristics that creates a feeling of strangeness and restlessness that stretches not only to the entire Wilson family but also the audience. The duality of the original and doppelgangers personality is beautifully represented by Lupita Nyong'o's performance (one of her top performances so far).
The film doesn't rely on jumpscares and ghosts to be scary, instead it uses a psychological horror to inflict fear upon the viewer. Everyone has a copy of themselves, so everyone has someone set to kill them. A path of destruction set in motion by no other then ourselves.
The social critic becomes explicit with doppelganger Adelaide Wilson explanation of how the underground world came to be. It was the surface people who created them, forced them to live underground, segregating and subjecting them to those conditions. For ones to thrive, ones must be sacrificed, and that's how this world and our world operate. Shadows of the surface people, continue to survive, mimicking their original selves, mentally challenged, inferior beings. And it's only when the major plot twist is revealed that the second social critic comes to light. Turns out, surface and underground people weren't so different, just a product of their own environment.
Although the argument being mined with a few plot holes, I think the film does an excellent job on entertaining the audience, combining horror and humour in a subtle and innovating way. Ultimately it passes its message and due to its ambiguity, will certainly inspire hours of debates among fans and talked over through years to come."

","I really wanted to like this film. For the most part, I did enjoy it. The score was excellent and JP is one of the best at utilizing music you wouldn't expect to be appropriate for the setting...it just works. For example, the use of a hit track by NWA is a perfect use in the scene and only after thinking about the film the next day did I make the connection of why it was used (no spoilers). Some sequences were shot very well and the cinematography would be an 8 at a minimum. The characters were great as well, however, I did find it somewhat irritating that the comedic relief via character dialogue seemed to be a bit in excess. The plot was interesting, but some logical aspects of it seemed difficult to reasonably agree with. Overall it was a solid film, but nothing to rave about. Do not compare it to GET OUT- that is an unfair comparison and each of these films have their own dynamics that are independent of one another. Go see ""US"" and see for yourself - just temper your expectations and soak it all in."

The acting from nyong'o was superb, a 10/10 in fact as she stole the show..... i wont compare it to get out, as thier simply on different levels one being very good! the other being very much mediocre.

","The craftsmanship of this movie is where it truly shines, all of the technical aspects, from the score, to the cinematography, editing, pacing and acting was phenomenal. The part that hold this movie back is the story. The beginning of the movie until the point when the family met their doppelgangers (will be calling the shadows from here on) was exhilarating and captivating. But all the tension built up in the beginning quickly fizzled out. The concept was great, but didn't feel fully realized and was full of plot holes no matter how you interpret the movie. If this movie had remained a metaphor, instead of clumsily trying to explain where the shadows came from and what their plan was, it would've been a much better film. Initially i left the theater feeling disappointed. All the symbolism and metaphors don't feel well thought-out and lack any true meaning. I expected better from Peele but there is still some room for intelligent discussion after the movie ends. I just wish they hadn't shoved in the explanation for the shadows and the ""twist"" at the end was better executed. I would recommend the film but don't expect a masterpiece like Get Out"
"popovichh","1","5","9","30 March 2019"," Absolute piece of cinematic trash
","I wasn't expecting much from ""Us"" when I accepted my friend's invitation to watch it, mainly because I've seen the trailer and deep down knew it was going to be just another uninspiring, run-of-the-mill, post 2005 'horror' at best.<br/><br/>And then I sat on the cinema chair and the horror began... no, not the kind of horror you'd expect but the other kind. The kind where after 30 minutes you start panicking inside as to how to keep your eyes open for the next hour or more (in this case an hour and a half!), trying not to feel cheated out of your ticket money. Hell, they probably charge less for a night in a half decent motel where at least you get a bed and probably some actual horror too.<br/><br/>Mind you, I'm the kind of person that loves movies and can watch just about anything, as long as it doesn't insult my intelligence or my imagination. Draw your own conclusions from that.<br/><br/>Anyway, let me put it this way - the trailer itself is stupid and even it is better than this movie. In fact, if you could pick 3 good scenes from the entire movie (and that's quite a big IF), they would all fit in that trailer. Even the plot twist itself (yes, the part where everything is turned upside down and everything you thought was true was not) wasn't enough to redeem this horrid piece of audio-visual vomit.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna go into details because there isn't much to be going into, I'll just say that judging by standards good movies must meet in order to capture and entertain their audiences, this one failed at pretty much every single one: character development, screenplay, storytelling, immersion, plot and closure. Not to mention how irritating it is to watch another liberal-feminist piece of propaganda garbage where the husband is a shallow idiot behaving like a child (impressed and obsessed by motorized vehicles and sports) while the wife and daughter are all grown up and mature, keeping him on a leash. Need I say more?<br/><br/>On all fronts this movie failed to deliver anything remotely compelling or truly entertaining (cheap laughs don't count) and is not worth your time. Not even if it were free to watch. 1/10 is not a score low enough for ""Us"", it deserves much MUCH less than that."

"adelta","8","5","9","24 March 2019"," My thoughts.
","My review after some thought<br/><br/>
I went into the movie not knowing much about it besides the trailer. I haven't read any think pieces or gathered much information concerning the meaning behind the movie.<br/><br/>I think the one thing I did was go into the movie looking for clues, Easter eggs, etc. trying to outsmart the movie instead of just watching the movie.<br/><br/>From a surface level review of my thoughts, there were a few things that stood out to me.<br/><br/>The scripture gave a clue about what was going to transpire. The evil they can't escape is within themselves so in a sense you can't escape yourself. The shadows(below grounders) were being portrayed as evil or maybe an alter ego but contained within the depths of the subconscious imo. However, since Addie was switched out she had the ability to break through the subconscious and assist the others. She was a little girl when her mind was taken and assimilated until she was able to remember her truth. I just think shadow Addie was lucky and things came together at one time to allow her mental escape.<br/><br/>I think it was all mind over matter and the above grounders were allowing their shadows to overtake their consciousness.<br/><br/>The boy and girl were able to outsmart their subconscious because they were the children of the shadowed Addie so there was an evil inherent trait in them. You saw how the daughter was killing folks and the boy outsmarted his shadow. The husband didn't have a clue but maybe lucked up by banging his head to start the motor that I believe hurt and killed his shadow.
(He did that earlier in the show.)<br/><br/>The other thing that stood out was the family was very suburban and lost all sense of street smarts or cultural interaction like turning to God, praying something, looking for holy water, oil, nobody strapped.?? It's like all common sense/street smarts went out the door.<br/><br/>I thought it was more of a psycho thriller because it was more about mind control imo than the physical that was presented.<br/><br/>The physically dead bodies were a representation of the shadow's overtake of their good consciousness and that basement dungeon area was the mind/ consciousness Imo"

How can billions live in those places? How do they feed? Why did the government make those clones? Many holes in the plot. And that final ""twist"" emulating Shyamalan: TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. None of us in the cinema seemed good. People mocked when things happened. At the end of the movie you DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING about how unlikely it is. I didn't connect with it, it didn't touch me.

"Metaflix","6","5","9","22 March 2019"," A step back from 'Get Out'
","Jordan Peele's work is immersive. A few minutes into watching his movies everybody sitting in your vicinity seems to disappear and all that remains is you and the gripping story unfolding on screen. He achieves this effect by allowing his films to breathe. Sometimes the camera lingers on scenery. Sometimes it lingers on a person. Either way, it demonstrates a patience in filmmaking that is rare for a first or second-time director, meaning that Peele undoubtedly honed this skill throughout the 53-episode run of his comedy show and was able to successfully apply it to horror.<br/><br/>This duality-comedy and horror-is perhaps the most striking (and successful) component of Peele's new film 'Us,' the follow-up to his Oscar winning debut 'Get Out.' There are just as many laughs littered throughout the film as there are moments of shock and tension.<br/><br/>Yet there's a hollowness to 'Us,' as though the burdens of being one of the most prolific creators currently working in Hollywood stunted the overall development of the film. Peele likely took years to write 'Get Out' and the astounding density of the story shows. Peele had perhaps half as much time to write 'Us'-while being twice as busy-and the product speaks for itself.<br/><br/>For example, there's an interesting red-blue dynamic applied to the costume and set design, but its intended meaning doesn't always feel consistently applied. Furthermore, one of the on-screen deaths is needlessly unrealistic, while a particular shot setup towards the end of the film tries to be artistic but just doesn't work ... at all.<br/><br/>As a result, it begs the question of whether 'Us' is disappointing compared to 'Get Out,' or if it's disappointing entirely on its own."

","I truly love that someone like Jordan Peele is out there making original films like this. Get Out was a near perfect horror/satire and Us, with all of its flaws and possibly plot holes, is an inventive, chilling, and creepy entry into what has become a real resurgence of the horror genre these past few years. Like any great film, I still have tons of questions following my screening, many of which are spoiler territory. The film's insistence on staying ambiguous was great until it decided to reveal some answers that we didn't necessarily need. But I'm afraid, those only made my questions exponentiate. Lupita Nyong'o is expectedly incredible as the mother of the family being tormented by their own doppelgangers, and Winston Duke follows up his beloved turn in Black Panther with very good balanced performance here. With a movie like this, seeing it with a packed audience on a Friday night sometime can make the film less scary, but it certainly makes it more fun. Though the film is never truly terrifying, it's always unsettling, and those unsettling thoughts will not leave your brain until long after you've seen it in theaters. Peele's direction far outshines his writing this time around, with his music and shot choices making for some of the most memorable in recent years with horror. The only thing bringing this movie down is the amount of suspension of disbelief you have to obtain to buy into what Peele is selling. It's a double edged sword when you start to read into Reddit theories that could either make or break your opinion on this mind-trip of a thriller.<br/><br/>8.7/10"

"CubsandCulture","10","13","32","23 March 2019"," Plot incoherence is used to fuel deeper allegory
","If you need your horror or sci-fi to have a pretty straight forward plot that can readily be explained from point A to point B, even if the viewer needs to reshuffle the pieces a bit, this film will annoy you. There are some fairly large questions that are left unanswered. Moreover, I don't think there is any way to truly piece the film together entirely. The plot is frayed at the ends. Personally, I don't have a problem with this largely because I think it opens the film up to have many things read into it.<br/><br/>The central metaphor and allegory seems readily open to discuss the following topics: racism, classism, trauma/mental health, American tendency to try to gloss over the past and/or the current ugly social conditions, parenting styles (!), the divided self and how divide the US currently is. This ambiguity in subtext is maddening in the way good puzzles are. I suspect there really isn't one definitive answer but several plausible ones. The writing is crisp enough that this seems intentional. Regardless of the question of deeper meaning the characters are utterly engaging and the surface plotting (i.e the gags) is great. Horror characters are often extremely stupid people. Peele has a knack for writing them so they don't seem stupid and the vast majority of the behavior is reasonable. I will also warn that there is a pretty big ""twist"" that seems obvious to me. (I guess it within 10 minutes) While I found this added to the tension others might get annoyed by that.<br/><br/>The 2nd act of the film is utterly intense and Peele's direction is remarkably sure handed. I am sure there is a mirror beat in the 2nd act for every development in the 1st and 3rd act. It adds to the overall unnerving effect of the film. Peele mixes comedy, horror and dark humor with ease and the middle hour is more creepy and messed up than Get Out. (I consider this film slightly better than Get Out). If nothing else horror junkies will love the 2nd act.<br/><br/>The acting is very good but Lupita Nyong'o gives the first truly striking performance of the year. So much of the film depends on how you perceive each of the two characters she plays. She nails the terror and the horror. She nails the duality of humanity. She carries this film entirely and utterly elevates the material. I think she is better here than in 12 Years a Slave. I just hope she is remembered come next award season.<br/><br/>First great film of the year."
"jwwalrath-227-85487","10","13","32","23 March 2019"," Wow, what an experience
","Horror/thriller Us, about a family being attacked by duplicates of themselves, was such a unique experience for me. This is only Jordan Peele's second film and he already has a confident sense of direction. Tightly controlled use of camera angles and fine use of color and scenery are all here. The panning out opening credits has a slow, unsettling strangeness to it. As I said, this is a thriller and the whole thing has taught pacing and fight scenes.<br/><br/>The general story is entertainingly freaky. The duplicates, with their scary gold scissors and gloves on only one hand, are unsettling. And it isn't exactly like they're a mindless horde. Each one has a distinct, weird personality.<br/><br/>The script is also pretty funny at points, but the humor never feels like it is detracting from the horror.<br/><br/>The music by Michael Abels is also delightfully eerie. Be sure to check out the opening credits. The movie's main theme might make the list of most recognizable horror music. (It sounds a little like the main theme from Akira if you've seen that.)<br/><br/>The entire cast, main and supporting, is great, including, surprisingly, comedian Tim Heidecker from Adult Swim's Tim and Eric. Winston Duke is fun as the family's goofy father and Lupita Nyongo excels in uncomfortableness as the duplicate mother.<br/><br/>The first act/setup is a little slow, but things run smoothly once the duplicates attack. The explanation to the duplicates' existence is a little vague. I mean the duplicate's motivations are made clear, but the logistical details of the whole thing leaves a lot of questions.<br/><br/>Overall, i highly recommend this to people who are looking for something a little new in horror."

","Peele had a good storyline going, and a good concept behind it, but failed to write the story properly.
The movie was meant to be ambiguous, however, Peele turned something that is suppose to make you think into a classic ""Shyamalan"" twist.
This movie could have been amazing, and the twist at the end could've worked, but there had to have been other things that Peels had to do correctly for it to work, and there were too many things wrong with his writing, pacing, and explanation provided in the show.

","Us is the new horror horror film directed by Jordan Peele and stars Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex as a family who was attacked by their doppelg√§ngers.<br/><br/>Like Peele's previous debut film Get Out, it's a blend of horror and comedy with some political themes. But on the contrary, Us is more of a pure horror film than the director's debut. But it doesn't mean that it's a bad film.<br/><br/>Us creates the tension well while also including comedic scenes. Winston Duke as Gabe, the father of the family, is initially portrayed as a comedic relief but became a well rounded character throughout the story, as with everyone else.<br/><br/>The story creates a unique sense of what the family, and the world will do if we are facing the ones we can't, which is ourselves. The characters in the film decide what they would in real life, with real dread and fear. Each character uses their own abilities and advantages to go against their doppelg√§ngers. As the plot unfolds, the exposition may be a drag but what comes next is very mind blowing as the film comes to an end.<br/><br/>Get Out is a more satirical film while Us is a pure horror film with a theme that may be timely depending on the people's future. Other than that, it's still a great horror film for horror fans and movie fans alike. If not the Oscars, this film deserves several awards for it's direction, screenplay and performances of each actor.<br/><br/>-Yman Dayawon"

"leonblackwood","4","4","7","22 January 2020"," Average horror movie with a couple of twists! 4/10
","Review:
Although the director added some twists and turns to this psychological horror, I still struggled to find it interesting. The dragged out scenes became a bit ridiculous after a while, and the mirrored zombies were extremely odd, in a bad way. Lupita Nyong'o played both roles well, alongside her kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), but her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), was completely useless. The scenes that are supposed to be horrific, weren't that frightening, but there is a sense of intensity, even though it's slightly predictable. The whole ""2 worlds"" theme was original but it was revealed a bit too late. With a lot of these horror movies set in small towns, it surprises me that other towns don't intervene, once they hear that there is a high death toll, mainly caused by Zombies. Anyway, the movie starts in 1986, was a young Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) goes on vacation with her parents to Santa Cruz. At the beach, she wanders off and enters a funhouse, where she encounters a ""doppelg√É¬§nger"" of herself in the hall of mirrors. In the present day, the adult Adelaide is haunted by memories of the encounter. She goes with her family to their house in Santa Cruz. She is apprehensive about the trip, but Gabe, eager to impress their rich friends Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), brushes off her misgivings. That night, a family of four dressed in red appears in the Wilson's driveway. They break into the house and attack them. The intruders are the Wilson's doppelg√É¬§ngers, led by Adelaide's double, Red. As she is the only one who can talk, Red explains that the doppelg√É¬§ngers are called the Tethered, who share a soul with their counterparts, and that they have come to ""untether"" themselves. She tells them the story of a girl who is loved and happy while her ""shadow"" remains in the dark, suffering. The family is separated by their doppelg√É¬§ngers, and Red makes Adelaide handcuff herself to a table. Zora is pursued by her double, Umbrae, and Gabe is pursued by Abraham, while Jason is sent to play with Pluto. Zora evades Umbrae and Gabe kills Abraham, while Jason discovers that Pluto mirrors his actions and locks him in the closet. Red is drawn away by Pluto's cries, allowing Adelaide to break free. The family regroups and escapes on their boat. Meanwhile, the Tyler family is murdered by their Tethered. The Wilsons arrive and are forced to kill the Tylers doubles. They turn on the news to see that the Tethered have been murdering their counterparts across the nation. When Zora drives the family away in the Tylers car, Umbrae attacks, but Umbrae is killed when thrown off the car. At the Santa Cruz boardwalk, the Wilsons find the road blocked by their own car, which has been set on fire. Pluto has set a trap for the Wilsons, standing over a gasoline trail with a match. Jason, remembering that Pluto imitates him, makes Pluto walk into the fire. Red abducts Jason. While Gabe recuperates from his wounds with Zora, Adelaide returns to the funhouse and finds a secret tunnel in the hall of mirrors. It leads to an underground facility overrun by rabbits, where she finds Red. Red explains that the Tethered are clones, created by the government to control their counterparts on the surface. When the experiment failed, the Tethered were abandoned underground for generations, mindlessly copying the actions of their counterparts until Red organised them to escape and take revenge. Red and Adelaide fight, with Red countering all of Adelaide's attacks. Will Adelaide kill Red and save her family, you have to watch the film to find out! Whenever you watch a horror movie, and the family is happy and jolly at the beginning, you just know that something bad is going to happen! In this case, it started mysteriously and then it jumps to the present day, so that made it different from most of the films in this genre. Once the doppelg√É¬§ngers kick in, it follows the horror guide book, until the end when the twist kicks in. As I'm not a fan of horror movies, I'm not the best person to comment on how good a film is in this genre. From a personal point of view, I found this film to be pretty average, in terms of entertainment, and the shock value was quite low. It's still worth a one-watch but it will be quickly forgotten. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Jordan Peele, who also brought you Get Out in 2017. As an actor, he's starred in Little Fockers in 2010, Wanderlust and Keanu, which he also produced. He is mostly known for his comedic TV work, alongside Keegan-Michael Key, but after the popularity of Get Out, he has gained respect for his work behind the camera. With an Oscar for the best screenplay for Get Out, and a producer credit for the new Candyman, which is due to be released later this year, he must be pleased with the direction his career has taken so far, especially with the profits that his films have made.<br/><br/>Budget: $20million
Worldwide Gross: $255million<br/><br/>Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller
Cast: Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Anna Diop, Cali Sheldon and Noelle Sheldon. 4/10"

","My 13 yr old daughter wanted to see this, so after I looked up the content (to see if there was sex, drug use etc. & saw it was really just language & blood - I agreed). After about 20-30 mins of watching the stupidest movie I've seen in my 48 years, I go to IMDb on my phone - because I am confused. I thought all I heard was all the rave reviews about this film. Then I'm looking on IMDb on my phone and see one 1 star review after the next - saying things like worst film ever, etc. Then the light bulb goes off; I realize what happened;<br/><br/>We live in the politically correct era - which means any motion picture that involves gay, black/minority (like Bohemian Rhapsody & Us) will be celebrated & triumphed as the next Gone With The Wind or Shawshank Redemption. So because this film was the first horror movie to star mainly black people and had a black director - white America is going to herald it as the living legend of horror films - instead of calling it out on what it REALLY is - a giant pile of vomit. It literally was THE dumbest movie I've seen - and I mean on all fronts; the acting, the script, the plot, etc. It was so highly embarrassing I was cringing. I especially cringed hard when I heard that stupid voice that they speak in.<br/><br/>Save yourself the $5 and DO NOT rent this on iTunes - after 20 minutes you'll realize you just flushed a Lincoln down the toilet."

","I suppose this comment has been repeated a few times, but in all honesty, this film was not what is was hyped up to be. It had a lot of potential-good actors, good direction, good music. But the plot was asinine and completely contrived.<br/><br/>I don't mind horror movies that leave you with a lot of questions. But this movie was 2 hours long, with oodles and oodles of ""explanation,"" all of which really made no sense. Either the movie has to be abstract artwork, or metaphorical psychological horror..... or the explanations need to go away, because they just come across as plot holes.<br/><br/>Biggest problem was the main character, and this huge gaping plot hole that is revealed at the end literally ruins the entire premise. I won't give away the ending, but if the lead character is in fact who she is revealed to be, there is no reason for her to be doing any of the things she is doing, nor her doppelg√É¬§nger.<br/><br/>Absurd premise, absurd ending. Not worth the time or the money to see it. The 3-stars are for the pros I already mentioned. Didn't care for Get Out like others, but this one sealed the deal for me. I'm done with Peele's movies."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","7","17 April 2019"," This motion picture ineptly ran with scissors! Regardless, I was still tethered to this movie. The flick was semi enjoyable, even if parts aren't that scary & too silly.
","If you wanna get crazy, we can get crazy. Writer & director Jordan Peele proves without a doubt, that he is indeed eccentric! After the success of his 2017 Oscar winning horror film 'Get Out', he went bonkers within this genre. This movie from him was insane! The film tells the story of the Wilson family led by patriarchs, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) & Gabe (Winston Duke) being attack by a separate family of doppelg√É¬§ngers. Without spoiling the movie too much, the first thing you probably want to do when watching this motion picture is not focus, excessively on the reality or logistic of the premise. Instead, you should see it as more of a symbolic statement that it was intended to be. After all, questions involving the vast amount of currently up to date semi resilient clones kept underground are mostly left unanswered. We might never know if the government laboratory still kept the clones alive, even if the original host dies or leave for a different country. Better yet, there is no resolve to the question if they make new replicas for those whom are recent immigrants or illegal aliens. Things like that are not meant to be explain. While, we might not know exactly when the cloning project ended. The film didn't do enough to make the replicas seem that desperate. The movie should had shown more abnormalities changes involving deformities, undernourished, or demise Tethered, due to their limited rabbit based diet to make the film's premise stronger, knowing that the replicas would go to any means to quickly take over our lives & escape their horrific and squalid conditions. Since Peele didn't do that fully. It was a bit jarring to see most of the doppelgangers led by Red (Also played by Lupita Nyong'o) take their sweet ass time escaping the underground & killing people, especially with the Wilson family. Don't get me wrong, I do understand that the Tethered did started out uneducated, due to the lack of a soul & forced to imitate the actions of their above ground doubles, because of that. However, it's obvious by 'the Hand across America' attacks, that they do commit individual actions under their own free will & choice. Yet, I found it still puzzling, that despite no longer mimicking their counterpart's lives 24/7, they still act like animalistic with comedic groans and moans. Hearing them make ridiculous sounds was a little too off putting for me. The noise ruin the scenes that are supposed to be frightening. The film could had done better, with more smart quiet killers. It's sad, because the choice of red jumpsuits and murder weapon being a pair of scissors was truly scary. It's symmetrical. They reflect both the literal and metaphorical bloody rapid severance between the have nots and haves. It could had been a very strong commentary on the duality of the American dream, nature vs nurture. Instead, the metaphor for the troubles between social classes were somewhat loss with some viewers. It didn't quite push us, to confront the shortsightedness of many prejudices between the poor and wealthy, within this under the surface upward mobility mortality play. Especially when it comes understanding we all are one of the same, regardless if born in rags or riches. The whole duel clock & duality mirror imagery meaning should had been more clarified. Despite that, the twist toward the end was highly predictable. The flashbacks to Adelaide's childhood weren't really needed. It kinda push the obvious. It felt like filler and really hurt the pacing. Honestly, Peele could had gone with the approach of one world, many parallel world's Schr√É¬∂dinger's cats with that, for a more unique watching. Regardless, I still dig the foreshadowing with Adelaide's white shirt turning blood soaked by the end of the film. It shows who she really is. I also like the clever cultural references to other Sci Fi and Horror films such as 1956 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 1984 'Chud'. Even the nods to fictional novelty works like the Bible & Alice in Wonderland was cool to see. The movie even copy bits of real life historical events like the Underground Railroad, Sept 11th, and even the rabbits being clones in 2003 for equally chilling effect. However, the best thing about this movie is the music. Great use of ominous gothic chanting from composer Michael Abels. Even the instrumental version of Luniz's ""I Got 5 on it"" is particularly memorable during the movie's more dramatic moments. Following the music, is the haunting, beautifully well filmed shots from cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. He really does knows how to create a sense of dread. The duel acting from all the performers that went along with the visuals, was outstanding with the different in mannerisms within their characters and the rival doubles. Overall: Despite some flaws. The film is still worth taking a stab at. It's a above cut from the rest."

There is so much more to this film than than one family being under siege. While Us might lack the very obvious social commentary and irony of Get Out it does deal with the fear of The Other and how some people literally live an underground existence.<br/><br/>1986, Santa Cruz Beach, the Fun Fair, eight year old Adelaide wanders off from her parents and encounters her double in a Hall of Mirrors, this leaves her traumatised. 2018, Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o), her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex) return to her family home in Santa Cruz for a holiday. Things soon get weird with four figures, a family, appearing in their drive. When Gabe attempts to confront them, the two strange children lope off to the sides, almost like rabbits, the male approaches Gabe and the attack commences.<br/><br/>The doppelganger family can't seem to speak properly, they communicate in the open by whistling and through animal-like howls. Each of them carries a large pair of scissors which they use to stab people. Even the children are murderous, killing whoever gets in their way. All prove very difficult to kill. When the Wilson's neighbours house comes under attack from their own doppelgangers it becomes clear that this is a wider problem.<br/><br/>After this the film literally goes down the rabbit hole, we are dealing not just with existential terror and a killer cult but something far stranger. A horror story straight out of an unexpurgated fairy tale. Jordan Peele has written and directed this alarming tale which will have you mulling over it's meaning long after the final credits roll. 9/10."

It's a think piece that I feel like most people have considered at least once in their lives. The execution was a little washed in the personal narrative that the main character and her alter revealed. Nonetheless, there was plenty I loved about it. Each actor did an amazing job, the music was on point every time, the pacing felt natural and the scenery was immersive. I suppose the ending didn't really matter after the twist was revealed and knowing that the alters were all mad but it still feels somewhat incomplete to me. Left me feeling a little disappointed."
"movieman6-413-929510","5","4","7","24 March 2019"," Jordan Peele tells the good message of his new film in an unnecessarily difficult way.
","Us is a new horror thriller directed, written and partly produced by Jordan Peele, the director of Get Out.<br/><br/>In the film, the Wilson family decides to go on holiday to Santa Cruz, California, in the old family home of mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong¬¥o), in order to escape their busy lives. Here they plan to spend some time with friends who live here and to relax together.
When they spend a day at the beach, the youngest son Jason (Evan Alex) wanders and almost goes missing. As a result of this event, mother Adelaide is bothered by her mother's instinct and becomes very protective of her family, because she used to experience unpleasant events in the same area.
The family goes straight back to the old family house to spend the night here. Here they also see four mysterious figures that hang around the house and eventually break into the house. If the family clearly sees who has invaded the house, the family sees that they are dealing with doubles. These doubles seem to want to kill the family, to take over their lives. The Wilson family must now compete with their doubles to preserve their own lives.<br/><br/>With this film Jordan Peele has made another interesting film, with which he, just like his last film Get Out, also tries to tell a message about life and the world. With Get Out, he tried to raise the issues of racism in a playful way. With this film Jordan Peele also tells a good message, but unfortunately he has chosen to tell the message of this film in an unnecessarily difficult way. Because of this narrative method, the films can sometimes come across as lengthy rather than interesting. As a horror film it is also more exciting than really scary.<br/><br/>If, as a viewer, you continue to pay attention while watching the film, you can find some hidden announcements in the film that help you understand the message of the film and what the final plottwist is. Despite these hidden announcements, you only get the full explanation of how certain things and events could happen in the film at the end of the film. Unfortunately, the explanation at the end of the film does not provide an answer to all the questions that you, as a viewer, may have while watching the film. If Jordan Peele had paid more attention to the end of his film script, he might have been able to answer these unanswered questions, so that the viewers would not be left with unanswered questions.<br/><br/>The acting is well done in the film. Jordan Peele also had the cast watch ten horror films to get in a good mood for filming this film. Most of the cast also play a double role, because in addition to their original characters, they also play the roles of their doubles. So they have to play the same roles in two different ways in the film. The actors who play the family in the film look realistic as a family because of the way they interact. Lupita Nyong¬¥o puts the best acting as the main character in the film. The young actors who play the children in the film also play their roles well. For them, this film is also their first real film role that they play."

I don't know if the intention was to leave the theatre scared, sceptical or bemused.

"mckeesean","2","4","7","23 March 2019"," Dissapointing and overrated
","This film could've been terrifying or a fun horror spoof/comedy. Unfortunately, it's not sure what it wants to be. It's mildly funny at times, intense at others, but never all that scary or laugh-out-loud funny. The audience I was with seemed equally as confused by the tone. Chuckling awkwardly at times, even during parts that were supposed to be scary. The plot and hands-across-america moment are so absurd, this movie was begging for more humor. In the end, it was just a weird, awkward let down."
"DVDExotica","6","4","7","22 March 2019"," Think About It, But Don't
","First let me just start off with some basic pros and cons. There are a lot of great ideas here, and the actors all do a superb job of bringing them to life. On the other hand, the movie is too long. Clocking in at just over two hours, the repetitive cat and mouse, to-the-death struggles between people and their doppelgangers started to get down right boring, like ""let's just determine who stabs who and get on with it!"" Some of the humor was genuinely clever, some was out of place and ineffective (they go from being deeply traumatized to comical bickering over trivialities and back with no emotional authenticity). And the cutesy use of pop songs started to wear thin by about the third one. The ""I Got Five On"" it chat in the car? Cool. The ironic mass murder set to The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" scene? Great. By the time we got to the the life and death struggle to the tune of ""F- the Police,"" though, we'd gone to the well too many times. So, overall, a perfectly watchable, decent but unexciting little horror flick.<br/><br/>But okay, now let's get deeper into the weeds and SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. Unlike his last film, Get Out, I think Jordan Peele spent so much time on meaning and metaphors of the subtext here, he let the superficial plot blow in the wind. It's exciting to contemplate just what he's saying with this movie... is this a statement about classism, or are both ""sets"" of people really two sides of the same individual? ""Us"" as in the U.S., how we as a country treat each other, the idea of some kind of self-wrought biblical judgement (i.e. all the Jeremiah 11:11 references) coming to all of us? That's fun to digest and debate.<br/><br/>On the other hand, just thinking about the literal premise is a frustrating experience. Theoretically, the government ran and abandoned a cloning facility underneath a public beach? And the entrance is a boardwalk entrance that anybody, even an aimless small child, can just wander into at any point? There's not even a closed door to discourage this... and indeed, by the fact that it's an open attraction, you'd think bunches of people would walk in every day. But nope, over decades, it only happened that one time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the government cloned... every single human being in the country? And gave them all matching clothes of their counterparts, plus identical red jumpsuits and a pair of scissors each? Maybe the scissors were for eating the live rabbits they were left to live on as a bizarre little eco-system. I get the idea of scissors cutting the ties that bind and the rabbits as intriguing visual imagery and even some kind of metaphor... a population growing out of control, and/or a little Alice In Wonderland going down into the secret underworld allusion. Again, great subtext, it just fails on the superficial textual level. I think perhaps Peele should've went with a supernatural premise rather than trying to sell us on a practical, real-world explanation.<br/><br/>Because if we're just talking about some kind of mystical, unknowable force at work, then okay fine, anything goes. But since we're being told it's a contemporary government project, then things should make some kind of sense. How come sometimes the kid walking backwards makes his clone walk backwards, but other times they act completely independently? Who kept the underground facility so spotless after it had been abandoned? The girl said she spent years planning her revolt, and then her plan was just for everybody to run up the escalator and stab everyone with their scissors? Ugh, I could go on and on, but it's clearly all just a sloppy mess the filmmakers never bothered to think through before dumping in the audience's lap.<br/><br/>We're just not supposed to think about it. Like the Mystery Science Theater guys say, ""it's just a show, I should really just relax."" And fine, except with it's coded messaging and metaphor signalling, this is a movie that's begging us to think about it, making for a really frustrating contradiction. On the one hand, ""whoa, this is so deep when you think about it,"" but on the other, ""it's just a fun time, don't overthink this stuff."" Get Out got absurdist, too, when you followed its logic all the way to the end; but it still worked on both levels, where Us does not."
"MyopicVision","9","7","15","23 March 2019"," If you are a cerebral thinker.. you will enjoy the thriller that is US.
","Based on some of these reviews, it seems as if we all watched two different movies... and that may well be the case seeing that there was a movie bout ""Us"" , the family that meet their doppelg√§nger family and then there was the other movie called US that was a satirical narrative of America.
Or you may have been a viewer such as myself who was able to see the duelling factions and integrate them into a really well done movie.<br/><br/>If you were hoping to see Get Out II then you will be disappointed. Its not Get Out. There is equal opportunity killing. There were no nods to Get Out other than one lane scene resembled the lane scene in Get Out. Other than that... the two movies were not comparable.<br/><br/>I watched this in a Magic Johnson AMC in Harlem, NY and I was not disappointed. This movie was made for us and we were all engaged laughing at the right moments, scared at the scary parts and yes screaming at the actors to "" get in the car , yo!"". This was made for us and we understood it. It felt like it was meant for us and the only way I can describe this movie without spoiling it is by saying it was like the Purge, Childish Gambino's This is America and a whole lot of messed up emotions.
The scene where Director Peele takes us from comedic highs to terror depths in one actor's expression was amazing.<br/><br/>He got something out of these actors that I haven't seen in their previous body of work and I appreciate it.<br/><br/>Whoever that little girl is who played the young Mom character.. I never want to meet her in a dark alley. Im just saying.
The political message... you have to find that for yourself but I was satisfied and based on the conversations that I overheard; we all had different theories.
The best movies are the ones that play over and over in your head once the final credits have rolled. This movie will be playing for a while in mine."

","Jordan Peele's sophmore scary film may not have quite the seamlessness and uniqueness of his first but what it lacks in the mastermind department it makes up for in the creepiness department.<br/><br/>A family of four, while vacationing in Santa Cruz, are attacked by their more feral clones. It's a desperate situation as the family tries to figure out how to neutralize the attacking family.<br/><br/>""Us"" created a lot of questions and don't expect them to be answered. Not that it's necessary for questions to be answered in order for a movie to be good, it's just that Peele set that bar with the movie ""Get Out"". I stilled enjoyed it and I'd be lying if I said that the movie starring a black family didn't matter. The fact is, before ""Get Out"" and this more slasher ""Us"", there was a dearth of black scary movies. Besides some low budget obscure films the only one I can think of is ""Tales of the Hood"" which was simply OK. ""Us"" is not quite the genius of ""Get Out"" but you can't hit a homerun every at bat."
"costierascripts","9","7","15","23 March 2019"," Extremely Original Horror/Comedy
","""Us"" is the best horror movie I've seen in several years. It rides the line between horror/thriller and comedy effortlessly. The packed theater I was in was going back and forth between laughing, silence and screaming within the same scene. Lupita N'yongo's performance is just insane - literally feels like two completely different people. All the other acting is amazing as well, especially Winston Duke and Elizabeth Moss. But the true star of the film is Jordan Peele. Even though he won the Best Original Screenply Oscar for Get Out, I think this script is far superior. The character building, the world building, the plot structure and the dialogue is so well thought out and creative. But the true impressive feat here is the directing by Jordan Peele. The cinematography, lighting and direction of actors is absolutely incredible and adds such a unique and unsettling atmosphere. There is also much more under the surface than there appears to be. It really is a movie that deserves multiple viewings for you to truly appreciate everything this film has to offer. It's just stupid good."

This is the kind of film that I expect is going to bother people and be controversial.Some will love it and others will look at it like a over ambitious Shyamalanesk film that falls flat. Personally It checked all my boxes it was well written, the comedy worked when it needed it too.

As always however I assumed the worst, I've long since learned to keep my expectations low when it comes to Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Well, I class Us in the same category as Get Out, namely it's good but it's hardly anything special.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a family who come under attack by their own clones. The concept works and the film turned out to be miles above the home invasion film I expected it to be. In fact the scale is far greater than I assumed, this was really quite good.<br/><br/>The cast do a great job, but for a movie that tries to come across genuinely scary and chilling there was a lot of comedy thrown in and I'm not sure that was a great idea.<br/><br/>The story is decent, it's well paced and it all comes together in the end.

Every detail is important and it all adds up at the end. The soundtrack is one of the best ever for horror movie and I was on the edge of the seat almost whole throughout whole movie.

You would have to be as mindless as one of the ""tethered"" (god what a stupid concept) to find this movie enjoyable.

This movie is chock full of symbolism, mostly subtle, about marganilization and the people who are more or less forgotten or treated differently by society. This movie has gotten a lot of flack on here for having plot holes and a somewhat confusing ending, but if you read up on some of the symbolism Jordan Peele used, a lot of that starts to make more sense. Personally, the ending made sense to me though I didn't see it coming. I thought the gory scenes were well-done and not over the top like so many horror movies before it. Also, I know there was an outcry over how one of the characters speaks, but if you actually watch the movie it makes sense.

It's a standard ""thriller"" that's been watered down and made into overhyped mush that is easier to consume than oatmeal, and comes out faster too.

I did know this was Jordan Peele's follow-up to the great Get Out, *may be* horror and I saw one movie still. I avoided everything else and SOOO GLAD I DID. Incidentally, I did the same to Hereditary, and both that movie and this were two fantastic horror-movie going experiences.<br/><br/>So, I would suggest doing the same here.

I freaking cannot believe how great Get Out was and as I think more about Us, I do believe this is actually better.<br/><br/>Once again, he writes an amazing and absolutely original script - even when he takes from so many horror subgenres. While I was watching this, I was writing my review in my head and kept comparing this movie to (this) movie and then I thought: Oh! It's also like (that) movie. Once again, to tell you which movies I saw within this one would be a spoiler.<br/><br/>I know I'm being vague here and you don't know me from Adam (but, I hope you do, by now.) This film is for both film and horror lovers. It's a wonderful throwback WITHOUT that forced nostalgia Hollywood has been cramming down our throats.

Also see Get Out if you haven't already and be prepared to pre-purchase a ticket to Peele's next feature as this guy's got an incredible future ahead of him.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Warning: Do NOT drink beer before or during.

One one hand the plot has so many issues that they are almost too numerous to count, and certainly too numerous to be able to even begin explaining them all in a review. On the other hand, this movie did produce some of the scariest and most disturbing scenes/characters I have ever seen.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I can't rate a movie very highly when the plot is just absurdly unrealistic. Normally I would give a movie with so many plot issues a 1 or 2 rating but because of how sick, twisted and down-right terrifying some of the scenes and characters were, I'll bump it up to a 4."

","As I loved Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" I wondered what his follow up would be like.
Yes it's horror, yes it's scary, yes the actors are good, but the story makes no sense at all. Everyone has a good and bad side in them, but to stylize them into alternate beings for some purpose could have been interesting, but here it is all jumbled up. Yes I can point one finger at a person, and three are pointing back at me, but not everyone has a multi psychotic alter ego. I've been to that park in Santa Cruz in 1999 with my young children, but to make ever going near a fun park or the beach, or to have luxury hobbies and stuff to make them appear shallow is done much better in many other films.<br/><br/>Maybe I too dumb to get it, and not a mental health professional, but this film is nuts, slow and boring, but too scary for any one with kids. They will be scared the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Sorry Jordan, but try again. I know you have talent, but get a good story next time."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>As a one who loved ""Get Out"", i went to see ""Us"" (2019) just tonight on its opening night. At the end i wasn't disappointing of because ""Us"" is a very well made, pretty original, superbly acted movie. This is a much more straightforward horror slasher movie then ""Get Out"" was, and in my opinion it wasn't as good as that one. But on its own, ""Us"" does deliver. Its bloody, funny and pretty original. While it suffered a bit from a pacing here and more near the end, it did enjoyed this movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Us"" is a pretty straightforward slasher horror flick with pretty original idea, amazing acting by all 4 leads and good writing. Its pacing unfortunately wasn't that great especially near the end, but overall its a good genre movie."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","6","13","22 March 2019"," Crazy ride
","A creative synopsis and a fine yet not flawless execution. The film is a crazy ride, that is for sure and one ride that offers its audience many great twists and turns. The film has many good aspects, some great and some so-so. The great of all aspects is for sure the performance of Lupita Nyong'o. What a tour de force performance... and I am talking Toni Collette ""Hereditary"" - tour de force. A fantastic turn in her double role. First the traumatized mother on the one hurt and then her crazy ""twin"" where she is so fantastically freaky and gives you constantly an uncomfortable feeling. I haven't seen many 2019 films yet and this is hands down the best performance of the year so far.
I also liked Winston Duke who brought a lot of self irony to his role.
The kids were also truly great. Jordan Peele had a great idea but I think towards the end he lost a little bit the route to the conclusion. Because the explanation for the happening is rather a bit poor-is. But that is the only flaw I found with this film. Generally it a very scary movie that often brings you on the edge of your seat... also the score and especially soundtrack is fantastic. Not sure if I love or hate the final twist, I saw it coming but still feels that it causes some story holes ... however I will look closer on my second view. What I really dogged was the self irony Jordan Peele from time to time brought to it. Really a good film. Entertaining for sure and the characters are very likable (well.. some of them ;-) )"

I don't know what Peele was going for here. For a horror film, it did not have enough tension or suspense to be affective. As for the dark comedic racial and socioeconomic underpinnings that he was so successful with his prior outing, much of that fell flat here. Very little worked with this picture. Even the surprise ending was a yawner because much of what came before it was so uninspiring, that by the time of the big reveal, you had long ago checked out.

Then the movie then goes on to explain the back story of how they were bred & deprived of normal lives, which tries to create compassion in the viewer's mind. Now a director who fails to understand that you cannot be scared of someone you sympathyse with, as opposed to something that you do not understand. what you cannot understand, scared you the most. Wonder why Stephen king or Lovecraft never tried to provide a rational explanation of why their evil ones did what they did?
The movie starts as horror, soon becomes a science fiction, and ends as a secret society/ revenge/conspiracy theory - circus & goes all over the place but basically heads nowhere. While failing to do the most important thing, that is scaring the audience."

"Stoshie","9","3","5","24 November 2019"," Finally, an Original Horror Movie
","I watch a lot of horror movies, and there is a certain kind of sameness to them all. They seem to be copies of each other (or copies of Asian horror, but that's another topic). Sure, there may be a twist thrown in here and there in some of them, but overall, there is no originality shown in any of them. Basically jump scares, gore, leading music that tells you when to be scared, but no originality in theme, production, or plot. I could go on and on about the themes that have been beaten to death (no pun intended) in most modern horror movies, but I don't want to make this particular review longer than necessary. None of them leave an impression on you that lasts longer than it takes to get to the parking lot of the theater or to turn off the disk or TV.<br/><br/>Here, we have something that is completely different. Finally, some original writing, some original production values, some original direction, some original ideas. A film that holds together right through the end, in spite of the many reviews here from people that obviously didn't see the obvious continuity that held the film together throughout.<br/><br/>I have to question the motives of the people here who have written so many negative reviews. Are they so locked in to the standard horror movie technique that they can't step out of it long enough to recognize something different? It makes me wonder what today's audience would think of ""The Shining"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"".<br/><br/>And no, I won't even get into the significance of 11:11. That seems to be too much for most reviewers here to deal with. They just want your typical horror movie plot style and ending so they don't have to think about what they've seen.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews here nit-pick about plot holes. Sure, they are here, but are you kidding me? Most modern horror movies rely on plot holes from the beginning. Without them, they wouldn't be able to exist at all. So why focus on the relatively minor ones here, while ignoring the fact that other horror movies consist of nothing but one big plot hole right off the bat?<br/><br/>Anyway, if anyone reads this, don't let the reviews here deter you. Watch this movie. You will see a horror movie unlike any you've seen before."

It was super creepy in the beginning and sometimes throughout. Although, I figured out the twist immediately, just couldn't see how it would tie into the whole premise. It also gives hints that there was a switch. The mom not wanting to kill her tethered kids. I swear she made little clicky noises too. Also the whistling at the end.

If the switch had been made early, did the moms character, remember who she was the whole time or did it slowly come back to her? Why didnt the real version say, hey she's a fraud? Why was she leading an underground army while doing hands across America? Why didnt she go back up the escalator? Where was the government that made these people? Were they abandoned? They surely would've run out of rabbits to eat. Why did they make em? Did the son know she was bad the whole time or just the end? Why was he wearing a mask? What was his magic trick?

"dano-47967","8","3","5","27 May 2019"," Great second film by Jordan Peele that just confirms his talent in filmmaking.
","When I saw first reviews on ""Us"", I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it or not, mostly because the reactions were a little more divisive as opposed to Jordan Peele's debut. Thankfully, it was the former in my case.<br/><br/>One of ""Us'"" biggest strengths is without a doubt the acting. Most of the performances are good, but Lupita Nyong'o definitely shines the most. For the majority of the first act she does a very solid job, but once the more emotional and disturbing scenes come in, she alone makes those scenes that much more tense. All of the main characters are likable and well-written, which is something I especially appreciate in horror films.<br/><br/>The soundtrack made for this film is incredible. It captures the tone of the scene very well for the most part, which adds a lot to the overall feeling of the film. Michael Abels might just be another rising talent in the music department and I hope to hear more great stuff from him.<br/><br/>The cinematography is solid, it was easy enough to follow up what was going on for throughout the film's runtime. Overall it was just another very well executed aspect of ""Us"".<br/><br/>Like ""Get Out"", ""Us"" has its own social commentary and message it wants to say, which I definitely enjoyed, which can be interpreted in more than one way.<br/><br/>There are only a few aspects in the film where I'm sort of torn in-between. One of them is the humour and comic relief. The comedy sometimes landed and was appropriate, and sometimes it seemed distracting and wasn't all that fitting. I would personally prefer if that comedy wasn't there in those cases, since it was ruining the scary aspect by quite a bit.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending is arguably the main reason why this film got such polarizing responses. It very much depends on how one interprets the whole story after the credits roll. For me personally though, the ending makes sense, even if the more ambiguous approach would work a little better in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Us"" is a great, well-made second film by Jordan Peele, that is worth the watch just for the acting, score and its social commentary alone, which already puts it above the majority of modern non-arthouse horror films."

I didn't get into the acting.
I thought the actions/reactions of the family not believable.
strange build up of suspense.
I recommend you check out the 70s film Invasion of the body snatchers.

"gbidari","4","3","5","23 May 2019"," Overrated mess, but better than most
","Slow, full of interesting ideas that don't come to satisfying conclusions or aren't explored well, this feels like a poorly adapted Stephen King. Not scary enough to be a horror, not funny enough to be a comedy, not deep or intellectual enough to work on its own merit. Everything is just vague but not in a way the engages your imagination. Much like a long version of Peele's Twilight Zone which is also a pretty disappointing mess. The pacing is slow and I found myself pretty distracted. Definitely never achieves its potential and doesn't really make it to suspension of belief. Still there are some fun sequences and a few of the jokes hit well. Overall this film feels rushed from a script level and needed more thought. Ultimately there are just too many ideas and nothing sticks. Not sure why this I rated so high."

","This movie is fun to watch, and creepy. However its not near as scary as people say, and the ""hands across america"" statement at the end is stupid, illogical, and pointless. So now that the tethered are free, they are just gonna stand in a line and hold hands? So dumb. And how did they kill EVERYONE? They have scissors. What about the army? And if the military is still around, which they are logically, they could easily wipe out a bunch of people with scissors. I am NOT racist, the fact that some people are is sickening. But the political messages about it are pointless in a horror movie."

I know it sounds nit picky but they had an impact on my enjoyment of this film. The acting however was very good. I actually enjoyed the dialogue very much. I thought it had some funny parts as well. The cinematography was good too. The suspense kept me on the edge of my seat sometimes yet it does have some stupid decisions made by the villains and protagonists.

I've seen a lot of people picking the plot apart on here, and this just isn't that kind of movie, nothing here is all that logical, but that's not the point. The film has a great nightmarish atmosphere that fits perfectly with the strangeness of the story. Grading a horror film really comes down to one thing: Did it scare me? It did. There's a scene early on the film that made me gasp out ""Oh my god"" and cup a hand over my mouth. The actors all do a great job and Jordan Peele is really a talent to watch out for, 9/10."

"MichaelMRamey","8","3","5","3 April 2019"," Great Follow Up For Peele
","I really enjoyed this film. A lot of people (like they do with most films) like to knit pick small things instead of enjoying a film for its entertainment value. In terms of horror, this is one of the better horror films in years. I understand that there is an underlying message of the class system in the United States, but I had a good time watching this as a film. The biggest films in the world right now are super hero films and we don't ask questions about well how is this even possible? and knit picking small details like ""How did they get the red suits?"" Who cares! It's horror film, not a historical re-enactments. Lupita is amazing in the movie and in fact, everyone involved was tremendous. This is definitely a film you'll have to watch twice and you'll be able to watch it with a whole different experience than the first thanks to the twist ending. However, there was only two things I didn't like too much about it. One was that horrendous scene at the end where we can see Lupita in the background in the class room and her face up close. It's just a bad shot that you can clearly see the editing in; which this film is really well shot, so it's just the smallest blemish. The other thing being how insane the plot came when Peele tried to explain how all this was possible. It kind of made you sit there and go, ""okay?"" This felt like a film where we didn't really need any solid answers as to why this was happening. All in all, a good film that I ended up eating higher than his previous film Get Out, but it is really close. Looking forward to seeing his next film!"

","The only thing Jordan Peele is a master of is destroying potentially good movies.

There were also many pointless parts in the script which made the movie even worse."
"MrDHWong","9","3","5","28 March 2019"," Proves that Peele is one of modern cinema's most unique, interesting filmmakers and that Get Out was certainly no fluke
","Us is a horror film written, produced, and directed by Jordan Peele (Get Out). Starring Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, it proves that Peele is one of modern cinema's most unique, interesting filmmakers and that Get Out was certainly no fluke.<br/><br/>33 years after a traumatic childhood incident, Adelaide Thomas (Lupita Nyong'o) travels with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex) to their family holiday house in Santa Cruz, California. Late one night, the family are visited by a group of four people who stand menacingly out front of the driveway. After Gabe fails to make them leave, the four people break into the house and reveal to the family that they are their exact doppelg√§ngers, albeit, wearing red clothes and brandishing large pairs of scissors.<br/><br/>Much like Get Out, Us is a slowburner horror film, relying on building a tense and foreboding atmosphere during the first and second acts, resulting in an explosive conclusion. Similar to how Get Out had flashes of David Lynch influences, Peele's clever use of cinematography and symbolism in Us has strong allusions to the work of Stanley Kubrick, in particular his 1980 film ""The Shining"". Each of the main cast were terrific playing both their regular characters and their frightening doppelg√§ngers, in particular Lupita Nyong'o. What one can expect next from the brilliant and unique mindset of Jordan Peele is anyone's guess, though I am already on board at this point.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

There was definitely more of a comedic aspect then Get Out, which I enjoyed, and they did lighten up the suspenseful moments.

"thesupertomster","7","3","5","25 March 2019"," Less tightly-crafted, still enjoyable
","Us is the second film by Jordan Peele, the writer and director of Get Out. While this film is more of a straightforward horror/slasher movie than a 'Social Thriller', it is unmistakably a Peele movie, featuring his signature reincorporations and sardonic wordplay along with the added claustrophobia that comes with the home invasion genre.<br/><br/>While I believe that Get Out is the superior film, there are still many aspects of this film which are an improvement over its predecessor. Firstly, the soundtrack is much more memorable and used to great effect. The blending of humor and horror is also more effective; Get Out alternated the more dramatic and serious scenes with comic relief scenes, but Us manages to have some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in the middle of extremely tense and horrific moments while still maintaining the feeling of constant dread, making for extremely entertaining scenes which are the perfect mixture of horror and comedy.<br/><br/>However, the script and concepts, while genius at times, seem slightly disjointed overall. The logic in Get Out was completely sound, and rewatches would always reveal more hidden details which strengthened it even further. The logic in Us can fall apart if examined too closely, and the numerous ideas struggle to complement each other at times. I feel that Peele had less time to fully think this idea through, perhaps because he felt the need to release a second film as quickly as possible in order to cement his place as a noteworthy up-and-coming director.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, plot holes matter much less than overall themes and symbolism, which Us handles very well. While the social commentary of Get Out was very clear and left little room for debate, Us is more open to speculation and theorising, presenting the audience with a variety of ideas and statements which can be brought together in numerous valid ways.<br/><br/>Even when forgetting the symbolism and commentary, Us still shines as a supremely enjoyable slasher/home invasion movie with striking images and very well crafted sequences of prolonged tension. However, the more squeamish among you may want to give this one a miss."
"babyjaguar","5","3","5","24 March 2019"," US, THEM, THE MULTITUDE... WHO CARES?
","The only thing that keeps my score from going any lower is the great performance by Lupita Nyongo. She plays a mother (and the doppelganger) on a weekend trip with her husband (Winston Duke), father of her kids (played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex). Things go seriously wrong when she reunites with a past childhood trauma experience along Santa Cruz's beachlines.<br/><br/>Nyongo shows a great range of what acting should project; I hope she pursues more ""genre"" or horror scripts. But what a waste of her talent, imagine her working with David Cronenberg, Alfred Hitchcock or even Stanley Kubrick, or at this point even Tim Story could do better. Again, my only recommendation is to see this film with an actor (Nyongo) who serious about the craft because this film would of been a complete disaster without her.<br/><br/>I felt there it could been a truly innovative film here if Jordan Peele had only took control of the story writing and let another director visualize the horror, suspense, etc. (maybe the directorial talents of Boots Riley -- who did ""Sorry to Bother You""). There are lot of pointless ""artsy"" visual references (minimal interior sets with rabbits) inlaid with predictable socio-political ""MAGA"" themes (and 80s ""Reaganomics"" as well -- and I love political satire) thus it's just trying way too hard.<br/><br/>The film's interesting soundtrack, combination of 90s hip hop/drum & bass plus R&B tunes with classically-inspired tracks help to give the story's ""twilight zone"" vibe but that's about it. It's been said that Peele gave Nyongo a viewing list of genre cinema like Asian horror films, she learnt very well and obviously he didn't."

Despite having one of the most beautifully filmed openings I have seen in a while, the film drifted into something that was just not for me.
Once the people in red come into play, the film switches gears. Reasons as to why certain and important things were happening were left open, with little to no explanation.
In many cases, there was comedy added to point where it felt forced or unnecessary, causing the mood of the scene to be almost ruined.
One thing that got me were the kills. Many (almost all of them) were done off screen, only showing the aftermath.
Yes it's horror but to me, hardly. I feel that it was more of a suspense/thriller?

","The man who runs a soup kitchen in the Bronx knows that something is not right with the city he feeds.A.J.(Daniel Stern), a self-styled reverend, tells Bosch(Christopher Curry) about the dwindling numbers of his homeless clientele. ""Ten to twelve of my regulars,"" the good Samaritan explains to the police chief, ""undergrounders"" he calls them, are unaccounted for. They're vagrants who live beneath the concrete, ""a regular labyrinth of tunnels and caves"". Douglas Cheek's ""C.H.U.D."" is a B-movie with something to say. The 1984 cult-classic provides ""Us"" with a template for Jordan Peele's leitmotif of forgotten Americans. Peele locates the film's socio-economical message: America has a caste system, and isolates it from the dreck. ""Us"" forces the audience to reconsider who the real monsters are in ""C.H.U.D."" These seemingly malevolent frogmen, living in the recesses of the sewer, are a militia, which only becomes clear when we learn that these radioactive creatures turn out to be reconfigured human beings, denatured so by toxic waste. These humanoids, in their former incarnation as ""bums"", were treated by the people at large as a homogenous group you either pitied or felt revulsion towards. They were city pariahs with bad hygiene and unwashed ill-fitting clothes. ""C.H.U.D."" starts off with what appears to be a random and senseless murder. A woman, walking her pooch at night, fails to notice the clawed hands gripping both sides of a dislodged manhole cover. The cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers don't look it, but they're intelligent beings, and know that woman to be Mrs. Bosch. Once ignored, these reconstructed beggars command people's attention; their never-ending co-dependence on ephemeral patrons are over. It must be the creatures' glowing yellow eyes, sharp elongated fangs, and slimy reptilian bodies. Among the murdered whom the radioactive hobos settle grudges with are the usual suspects; belligerent cops with city-mandated orders to tear down their cardboard cities, and heartless waitresses at that diner-turned-crime scene whose policy was to never hand out freebies. Comeuppance never befalls on Wilson(George Martin), the man responsible for this alchemy made possible by the stockpiling of hazardous waste materials in the subterrestrial hell where displaced men and women call home. Humans, not C.H.U.D.'s kill the corrupt NRC guy. ""C.H.U.D."" never overreaches, never intends to make a grand statement, just a small one about the dangers of untreated toxic waste. It probably never occurred to the director-for-hire that Wilson is the humanoids' leader. But auteur Jordan Peele sees it; he is a post-modernist ethnographer, part Quentin Tarantino, part-Gregory Nava. Peele has Tarantino's gift for historical revisionism, but in this case, it's history in the making that he writes and extrapolates. Peele recognizes what ""C.H.U.D."" never underscores, or even notices, which is that Wilson's malfeasance has the accidental effect of giving these disposable people a reason to live. They have a superpower. They exist.<br/><br/>It's a home invasion; black on black crime. ""Us"" is attacked by ""Them"", a seemingly prosaic sentence that function both as a bit of plot synopsis and also a pointed and ironic reference to the French-family-under-siege horror flick(original title ""Ils""). Red(Lupita Nyong'o) makes the case, however, for being ""us"", too, not ""them"", the proverbial other, when she declares, ""We're Americans,"" as she stares down her mirror image Adelaide, in response to her question: ""What are you people?"" Why is it ""what"" and not ""who""? It's because ""Us"", unlike lesser films, doesn't employ the repressed memory as a plot contrivance. Adelaide knows who she is before the audience does. See ""Us"" a second time and you'll get a different read on her anxiety as the family approaches the same Santa Ana beach, scene of the crime, so many years ago. Back at their vacation house, Adelaide has an idea what, not who, these people are the very moment her son(Evan Alex) announces their presence in the driveway. The wife/mother knows why her husband's lookalike substitutes words with animal noises, and why her duplicate children make no noise at all. Most important of all, she knows why Red is fluent in English, and more worldly-wise than her kin. Way back when, in that hall of mirrors, the nameless girl cuts to the chase; she doesn't wait for the girl with a name to fall asleep; she doesn't have a pod on her to place beside the real girl's body in deep repose. The girl wearing the ""Thriller"" t-shirt is wide awake when the nameless one snatches her from the mirrorless mirror. Among other things, ""Us"" reimagines an ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers, in which the ""pod person"" learns to be human. Adelaide's parents know that something is wrong, just like the wife(Brooke Adams) in Philip Kaufman's 1979 version, but whereas Elizabeth knew her catatonic husband was a replacement, Adelaide's parent think their little girl is suffering from PSD. The nameless girl learns to be human. Adelaide(now Red) never loses her humanity. ""Little girl, run,"" Red warns Zora(Shahadi Wright Jackson) because her doppleganger Umbrae is a killing machine. Likewise, the nameless girl who snatched the named girl's life away. between the intervening time as a child and an adult, reinvented Adelaide, and who can say for certain that the real McCoy would have turned out better. That's compassion in the nameless woman's eyes, as she checks on Umbrae, who takes her last breath in the woods after being hit by their car. ""Us"" makes a case for nurture over nature, while it simultaneously makes another case for nature over nurture. After a lifetime of living among replicas, The Little Girl Formerly Known As Adelaide emerges as the leader of her own cannibalistic human underground dwellers. She is a Wilson. The invisible people in ""C.H.U.D."" were the homeless. Who are the C.H.U.D.'s supposed to be in ""Us""?<br/><br/>John Landis directed ""Time Out"", the first segment of ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"", which starred Vic Morrow, who in the course of a single night learns what it's like to be on the receiving end of institutionalized racism at its most vehement. First, he's Jewish, then Vietnamese, then Black. The unrepentant racist is shot at, dehumanized, forsaken and forgotten, made invisible; a rumor. Landis also directed the long-form video for Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"". The t-shirt that the named one wore on the night she was replaced by a counterfeit Adelaide is the key to understanding ""Us"". They're not zombies, remember; they're Americans, as Red had already explained. Red describes herself, and the people she lives with as ""shadows"". Shadows, in the pejorative sense of the word, can be a slur for Mexican and Central American immigrants. ""In the Service of Shadows"" is a making-of documentary film for Gregory Nava's ""El Norte"", a film about two Guatemalan illegals, down and out in Los Angeles. Jordan Peele knows ""El Norte"". It's no coincidence that ""Us"" takes place in southern California. Peele, as aforementioned, is the heir apparent to Quentin Tarantino, a postmodernist filmmaker who knows how to knit his motion pictures into a celluloidal patchwork quilt with panache. The journey is shorter; the shadows' trip is a matter of taking the escalator; it's the trip from Mexico to the United States in miniature. The flashback, late in ""Us"", shows the relationship between Americans and shadow Americans. For every person at the carnival, there is a double, pantomiming every body movement, trying in vain to be ""us"", not ""them"". The C.H.U.D.'s in ""Us"" are people on the border, right now as I write this. Peele triangulates ""El Norte"" with ""C.H.U.D."" In essence, Rosa(Zaide Silva Guiterrez) and Enrique(David Villapiando) are homeless. Everybody in Tijuana is homeless. To reach the United States, the ""coyote""(Mike Gomez) makes the Guatemalan natives crawl through a sewer pipe. They're homeless people in a sewer; it's an amalgamation; it's ""El C.H.U.D."" Enrique and Rosa are shadows. Mexico is the shadow. Central America is another shadow. The C.H.U.D.'s in ""Us"" embody Bill Connor(Vic Morrow) in Landis' segment of ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". White, black, yellow; they all learn what it's like to be brown. Conversely, in ""El Norte"", both Rosa and Enrique pantomime; they both want to be American. Rosa, a maid, goes through the motions of starting the washing machine. but it doesn't start. Enrique, a waiter at a high-end restaurant, enters the kitchen from the dining room through a swinging door, then pretends to serve coffee to customers while using rudimentary English. Peele seized on this for the flashback scene.<br/><br/>Peele also uses Tarantino's penchant for revenge fantasies. Like ""Unglorious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", them gets back at us in Grand Guignol style. And here is the cherry on the cake. When Adelaide was a child, ""Hands Across America"" made a big impression on her. It was 1986; Ronald Reagan's second term. She organizes her own version in 2019. The chain extends out into the ocean. Peele is a genius. These C.H.U.D.'s can't breathe underwater. It's symbolic.<br/><br/>These C.H.U.D.'s are reaching out to Puerto Rico."

","When the movie started, I knew that the film would convey a message beyond the surface of just your ordinary slasher movie and I was correct. For those who haven't seen it yet, practically everything in the movie can be viewed as a subliminal message, from the clothes, music, names, and food. Peele is truly using his platform to make a statement on social and economic views in the ""United States"". You will see a few nods to earlier classic horror films including his. Again, for those who haven't seen it, be open-minded and know that the movie isn't your typical ""cut-em up"" style film.

"darksketcher","2","4","8","6 January 2020"," Jordan Peele; One Hit Wonder
","I'm a Jordan Peele fan; from Mad TV to Key and Peele. When I found out Peele was breaking up the act to pursue writing/directing horror movies, I was like ""how selfish can the guy be?!"" Then I watched Get Out and I was amazed by the film so much that I thought he had a natural talent for this. Then I watched Us, a huge disappointment! The start of the movie was great. A family vacationing at the beach, pretty normal but later on that day at night they were paid a visit by a family; they're doppelgangers. Which seem to be a movie about an internal struggle to survive against their doppelgangers became something overly complicated. It turns out these doppelgangers ""the Tethered"" are copies of everyone around the world that have been hiding out in tunnels that humans built a long time ago. They have no souls or personalities other than a killer instinct. They come out of hiding; killing people and also finding time to do hands across America. At the end, apparently the mother, who's been fighting alongside her family against this threat, recalls that she's not the real mother but a doppelganger who escaped into the real world leaving the real mother chained up since childhood. To make this perfectly clear; the mother from start to finish was NOT the real mother; the real mother was killed in the movie. This movie would be good if I wasn't spending a hour and half trying to understand what was going on or trying to understand the concept of the Tethered. Peele spent way too much time trying to explain what they were, which he totally failed explaining his own creation. The shocking surprise of the mother not being the real mother does not make sense after revealing how the Tethered act like. What was the whole point of killing people and doing hands across America? It made no sense nor did Peele explain the fascination behind the concept. I enjoyed creepiness behind the movie, the costumes, the individual characteristics of the Tethered but it was not enough to overcome this bad movie, story and plot. Jordan Peele; your only one Hit Wonder will always be Get Out. Now go back to your buddy, say you're sorry for breaking up the band and stick with what you're good at."

"mcorner","8","4","8","25 March 2019"," I enjoyed it. Mostly what I expected. A fan!
","For one reason or another, I didn't see ""Get Out"" until several months after it was released. I felt like I missed something by not paying close attention to the small details, so this time, I was determined to do so from the beginning. The very first image on the screen when US begins is of a television commercial. But in the left part of the screen, there is a shelf with videos. Those videos were titled: Man with two Brains. ""Tuesday Nite"" (handwritten), The Goonies, and C.H.U.D. Somehow, these would figure prominently in the movie.<br/><br/>Despite my promise to myself, before long, I was lost in the story. And that's fine.
A movie is supposed to be relaxation and a bit of mindlessness. I remember being a bit surprised that we were carried along so quickly.<br/><br/>My husband has often said that he considers a movie as ""good"" if he continues to think about it for days. Sudden thoughts about the plot popping into my head are also a good indication for me that I like a movie.<br/><br/>One of the first ""after-effects"" about US is that I began to wonder, how was it, exactly, that Addie knew how to get to the underground area? Once she went back to Merlin's Forest, she went right to the door and followed the maze down to where the Tethered lived, without faltering. And as a young child, she couldn't speak once she returned. Why? Because none of them could speak! She had to learn with time. The only reason Red could speak was because she was Addie!<br/><br/>I suspect it's going to take several days for me to work out all these issues. I think it was a very good effort by Mr. Peele and I look forward to the next one."

"raudafitriani","10","23","75","20 March 2019"," Mind-Blowing and Terrifying.
","Us is 2019 American psychological horror film directed by Jordan Peele. It's about Adelaide Wilson (played by Lupita Nyong'o) who returns to her house in Santa Cruz, where she grew up as a child for summer vacation. She is haunted by a traumatic experience from the past and concerned something bad is going to happen. Then it did, a group of their doppelgangers showed up at night begins to terrorize them. All dressed in red jumpsuits and carrying golden scissors.<br/><br/>The film stars are Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, and Tim Heidecker. All of them are talented and amazing. Their expression and gestures are not so different from Jordan previous film, Get Out. Unlikely Get Out, this movie had some jokes, well at some point this movie can make you laugh while getting scared. The performance of Lupita is so impressive, she's playing two different characters. Adelaide is a protective mother of two children and Red is a lunatic person.<br/><br/>From the beginning to an end, it shows us a lot of foreshadowing and getting more complicated also appalling. It's been a hell of a ride and insanely good. The story does an outstanding job of building up the tension for the story and building the character developments. There are a lot of symbolism and meanings throughout this film, like Rabbits and Scissors. The script of Us is so structured and detailed, but still a lot of plotholes and some logical issues.<br/><br/>The sound editing and music of this movie is so terrifying and creepy, and make this movie even more perfect! Bravo, Michael Abels! The cinematography of this movie is the next level, there are a lot of stunning and intense shots in this movie that I can't wait to share. This movie is well-edited with the shots, the story, as well as the pacing.<br/><br/>This movie will make you think deeper not only a minutes after watching this but also the next day. Overall, Us is an amazing movie that different from any kind of Horror Thriller movie and Jordan Peele is a hell of a genius. Totally recommended and worth a watch for a thousand times."

","I cannot believe that people actually think that this movie deserves even a passing grade..it is the worst and the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.. And even the laughter in the movie teather didn't annoy me as much as this dumb movie did!"
"DiBudzz","8","6","14","23 March 2019"," Yes this has plot holes, but it is still thought-provoking.
","Okay so I noticed that everyone is bashing on the ""plot holes"" that the movie contains which is fair enough. But there are certain aspects that are explained that people are overlooking or simply didn't catch.
For example, people keep asking how and why the tethered decided to kill their doppelg√É¬§ngers in the world above and how they knew where they were. It is alluded to that they are exact CLONES. They have a linked thought process. The only difference is that the tethered don't have souls because it couldn't be replicated. It is also clearly stated that the U.S. government created them to control the world above and abandoned them because they were flawed. So, this is an American epidemic, not a global one.
I have to mention that the acting was great from everyone and all of the performances were believable. Peele's usage of foreshadowing and symbolism was definitely admirable and not too predictable. But, I do have to acknowledge some of the plot holes that were not explained. Some of the big ones were obviously, where the hell did they get their outfits and gold scissors? How did the armed forces not decimate the tethered with superior weapons and knowledge? Why didn't the real Adelaide openly talk about the switch that occurred in the living room scene? I agree, that was all very stupid and unexplained.
But, all things considered the movie has so many great messages about society that can be interpreted in different ways. From what I gathered, the main messages were... if you suppress who you really are inside for too long, it's just going to fester and manifest itself in reality as a monster, so be who you really are because we all have a dark side. Also, the whole hands across America thing that people are bashing was kind of cool. He is trying to send the message that hate in the U.S. brings about unity amongst us which is obviously screwed up because it should be the opposite. Lastly, the whole bit with the dad being jealous of his rich friends was reinforcing the point that he is middle class and is still unappreciative of his situation. Then you get a brief glimpse at the rich friends and they are horrible people that are alcoholics, miserable, hate each other, and are superficial. The point is we should all see each other as people and the division of classes is getting worse and will eventually lead to a disaster. I have to leave off by saying I absolutely hate when movies implement any political agenda but Peele gets his message across subtly enough where it isn't annoying and is actually creative and thought provoking."

"OtherShipwrecks","9","5","11","24 March 2019"," The True Horror of Assimilationist Politics
","Us is a profound and brilliant political fable, one that not only speaks to the controversial legacy of the 1960s civil rights strategy, but can also be generalized into an anti-assimilationist critique of respectability politics and a structuralist analysis of the social subject.<br/><br/>Obviously, the film's catastrophic event is a metaphor for revolution - the lowerclass getting organized and overthrowing the existing social order by murdering the upperclass. But what makes this film interesting is the plot-twist towards the end, where we find out that the woman who fights for her family is actually from the underworld, and that Red is actually the little girl from the surface world who got dragged down into the underworld by her counterpart and went insane.<br/><br/>This is precisely the central tragedy - and the true horror - of this film: the woman from the underworld who fought her way into the surface world supresses the memory of where she comes from and ends up fighting to preserve her upperworld social order instead of fighting for the liberation of her people.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the girl who got dragged down into the underworld went insane, but because she experienced the upper world, she was the only one who knew what had to be done - organize the formless masses of the underworld and revolt.<br/><br/>The behaviors of these two individuals are both determined by their new-found class positions - the lucky member of the oppressed class who assimilated into respectable society, instead of trying to liberate her people, ends up maintaining her upperclass social order; whereas the upperclass individual who got dragged down, instead of trying to get back into her upperclass position, became the leader of rebellion.<br/><br/>This structuralist analysis of the social subject highlights the tragic and horrifying reality of assimilationism. According to the assimilationist strategy, the answer to oppression is to join the existing social order and try to gain respect from the oppressors. In the context of the civil rights movement, the assimilationist answer to racial oppression is for black people to become respectable by white society - by becoming professionals, well-spoken, adopting white bourgeois lifestyle, etc. In the context of the lgbt movement, the assimilationist answer to heterosexist patriarchy is to assimilate into straight culture - by adopting the bourgeois nuclear family, by gaining access to the institution of marriage, by leading a professional middle-class lifestyle, etc.<br/><br/>In contrast, the revolutionary, transformative, or separatist positions refuse to assimilate into the existing oppressive social order but instead aims to either overthrow, radically transform, or create a separate social order from the status quo.<br/><br/>What Adelaide embodies is the grim reality of the American dream - invisible lower class people (from the Third World) who fought their way into respectable society, became the lucky few who made it, and end up as the most ardent fighters for the deeply oppressive and exploitative capitalist imperialist social order.<br/><br/>The film, however, ends with optimism and hope - the ignorant and privileged social order is overthrown (albeit with few surviving reactionary elements), the wretched existence of invisible lower class people were liberated, and the emancipated people all held hands in unity, symbolizing the triumph of a new egalitarian social order."

Yes, it's a landfill of symbolism about consumer culture. I don't care about bible verse bread crumbs nor various potential meanings of rabbits. I want to watch a movie not google search for clues to a puzzle. The symbolism is contrived and overdone. The story makes no sense. How can doppelgangers, the tethered, commit mass slaughter with scissors??? Americans have guns. What's with the hands across American thing? The military would bomb them once they saw them as a threat. Why did she just live in the tunnels when there was a gateway outside? Why didn't they at least go thru the gateway to get some food? Why does she decide to go to Mexico when she knows her tethered thinks like her? Let her husband make the decision since his double was dead.

","From Jordan Peele who gave us 'Get Out', the latest horror film nominated for an Oscar Best Picture comes his latest offering 'Us' starring the stunning Lupita Nyong'o. We follow her character Adelaide and her family's vacation which she's been dreading, going back to the place where she was once traumatized as a kid having been lost in one of the carnival's attractions. Her uneasiness comes to fruition when intruders show up on their driveway and they try to maneuver their way out as the suspicious but familiar-looking characters that seem to want to take over their lives.<br/><br/>Now due to some loopholes in the story-telling it was hard to make sense of what was going on, even after the reveal near the end. I had to read up about the movie to understand it a little more and it helped me appreciate it a little more. Because of that it's easy to assume that maybe part of the fun was sucked out because the movie was juggling too many ideas up in the air and that it failed to come up with an ending that measured up to what it heavily referenced to, Thriller by Michael Jackson and Jaws by Steven Speilberg. Just the same, Jordan did his homework, Lupita committed and delivered and Winston Duke (Black Panther's M'Baku) was a treat to watch.<br/><br/>I have so many questions that were left unanswered and to avoid spoilers I will not enumerate them here. One that I can bring up though is I still don't get the 11:11 reference. Every time I see it I mutter ""make a wish"" under my breath. As for the bit about Hands across America, the director said that it represents ""American optimism and hope - it's a great gesture but you can't actually cure hunger and all that."" That I get. it actually resonates with the current landscape of social media, what with it's keyboard warriors woke and cancelling culture that may be getting people to discuss about topics not usually talked about but at the end of the day still fails to change anything.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a pure horror movie where you want to be scared  for no reason, look somewhere else because this will leave you more with puzzled looks than fear in your eyes."

Yes, there are people who are less fortunate than other people. This movie is just a game or puzzle for the viewer to try and figure out what symbolized what.

"michaeljameshill-98919","4","2","3","17 November 2019"," Overrated - Easily The Worst ""Horror"" Movie I've Seen This Year
","I heard amazing things about this movie so I watched it with my wife. We are both fans of horror films and even a 7/10 is very rare for a move in the horror genre to get.
First off, I don't think calling this a ""horror"" film is at all accurate. There are moments in the film which could be called ""scary"" but I personally think ""scary"" is too strong a term. I would personally categorize this move as a ""mystery"", not even ""suspense"" because the term ""suspense"" would imply the movie causes deep interest or anxiety, which this movie didn't for my wife or myself.
Not to give too much away but there are certain evil ""entities"" in this film, the evil ""mother"" speaks with a laughably contrived voice which I think is a great microcosm for the film as a whole. It tries to scare you but fails miserably, it tries to send some sort of message about the haves and have-nots but that is also an abysmal failure, it tries to have comedy and action elements and it fails at those as well, it tries to surprise you at the end with a ""big reveal"" but by the time you mercifully reach the end of this movie 1. You no longer care and 2. Stevie Wonder could have seen the ""big reveal"" coming from a mile away.
My wife will give up on a movie midway through if it's not going anywhere and I found myself telling her, ""Maybe something interesting will happen at the end."" to convince her to see it through to the end. Spoiler alert...nothing interesting or surprising happens.
I will say that perhaps there are theories out there which make the film more interesting. If the film were interesting on the surface in any way shape or form I would normally be all over going online to see what theories are out there but this was so damned boring I have no interest whatsoever in doing so.
Save yourself 90+ minutes of your life and watch just about any other horror offering. You'll be glad you did."

","Let's just say this is a very different type of horror compared to Get Out, it's more akin to a spoof horror/comedy like Scary Movie or Nightmare on Elm St. Ultimately I found it difficult to watch after 40 minutes in because it airs too much on the side of comedy in combination with a very weak plot, you feel like you're watching complete nonsense and it drags on for an excruciating 2 hours! It's a shame because the acting is great, Peele's directing style shows some real class with an overall very high quality of production. There also some nice touches like the eerie soundtrack which suggest a sort of classic Japanese horror movie, and some of the imagery manages a certain creepy atmosphere. But ultimately I don't like the direction he's gone with this movie, I hope he can come up with a better script for his next one."

","My review was never posted for some reason after putting a lot of thought and effort into it. So I am posting again with just a quick summary.<br/><br/>This movie is laugh out loud stupid, and is basically every generic cliche rolled into one. The characters repeatedly make stupid decisions, and eventually you don't even care if they survive or not. It is not original or scary in the least, and I don't think I have ever watched the clock waiting for a film to end as much as this one. Jordan Peele has become to horror just as Tyler Perry has become to comedy. He already ruined Twilight Zone and he is clearly not stopping there. Avoid at all costs."
"pmtelefon","4","2","3","15 September 2019"," Heavy handed silliness.
","Someone should explain to writer/director Jordan Peele that ""Twilight Zone"" episodes were only thirty minutes long. They weren't two hours. Just like his earlier movie ""Get Out"", ""Us"" is a elongated ""Twilight Zone"". The first half hour or so of ""Us"" is painfully dull. After that the movie picks up but by the end it doesn't take us anywhere worth while. The cast is fine, I guess. The movie is not. I'm also not a fan of the horror movie ""twist"". I know people who love the ""twist"" but I like to enjoy a film's journey not it's contrived ""shock"" ending. I think the ""twist"" usually takes away more from the final product than it adds. That said, I didn't like the twist in ""Us"" either. It's just extra icing on a cake that wasn't too good to begin with."

There were too many plot holes to even keep count, and the script was also pretty poor at times.

The movie is boring, and the plot makes no sense.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's a huge plot hole in the final twist, as hundreds of reviews state here. It's just... wrong.

","Fantastic idea, abysmal delivery.<br/><br/>On the back of Get Out's phenomenal reception, Peele has free reign to write, produce and direct this big, flaccid turkey of a film.<br/><br/>So many things to deride here. Terrible dialogue, awful special effects, ridiculous breath-voice of the anti-wife, hilarious walrus-calls of the anti-husband.<br/><br/>If only someone had gently taken him aside and suggested allowing somebody else some input. The socio-zeitgeisty point the film is making is truly interesting, but the execution is sadly lacking any pace, tension, story or characterisation. I'm baffled as to why people have praised the acting, as it's mostly risible, even from the likes of Elizabeth Moss, who's myriad scary faces had me hooting with laughter. Was that the intention? Seems like the film itself doesn't know.<br/><br/>Quite early on I started wondering if Peele wouldn't be better doing opinion pieces for an enlightened newspaper rather than subjecting us to this laughable dross.<br/><br/>This, along with his mediocre-at-best forays into TV, make me conclude that Get Out was a happy mistake rather than a sign of great things to come."

The story begins in a very intriguing manner that really draws you in and makes you invest in the family, but by the halfway mark, the whole thing just starts falling apart under it's own weight.<br/><br/>Instead of being scary it becomes funny and predictable, and by the end it all makes so little sense that you're left scratching your head as to why they did what they did instead of going for a full on supernatural horror. The film wasn't nearly as fleshed out or imaginative as Get Out and it asks the audience to check their logic at the door.
There are some really interesting easter-eggs and references throughout as well as some really intelligent nuances to the music, character and history, but it's not enough to engage or make the last 3rd anything other than contrived. It really felt like they just ran with a spark of an idea, a ""what if"" situation, and never truly gave it the time to really grow.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie... It just couldn't deliver, as it felt more like Style over substance."
"mark-whitaker-551-790996","5","2","3","15 April 2019"," falls over once it starts explaining itself
","I won't take long, just to say, I enjoyed the director's previous movie, Get Out, and was really excited to see this after watching the trailers.
I even enjoyed it up to a point, but once the explanation of the ""tethered"" started to come out, it just felt like the film unravelled due to an endless number of holes in that storyline (and that was just while I was watching). If I thought about it some more, I'd no doubt be able to come up with a tonne more; and there is the issue with ""Us"" - if a film is going to make you suspend disbelief, it can't have plot holes that literally slap you in the face repeatedly. It has to create a reality that you can buy in to; and for me ""Us"" just didn't, once it started explaining the ""tethered"" it lost that buy in.<br/><br/>I've seen people talking about it's social commentary etc and that's all well and good, but it just isn't able to execute a very flawed plot explanation."
"mkoenn","2","2","3","15 April 2019"," Absolutely terrible
","The first 20 minutes were promising -- nothing great, but you could see where it was building up to something that might be good. And then it gets really inane and the rest of the movie is basically people running from monsters. It's so ridiculous it's not even scary.<br/><br/>And with a movie like this you expect it to have interesting social commentary to take the place of good story telling. In ""Get Out"" I enjoyed the social commentary, even if it wasn't nearly as intricate as a Coen brothers movie or something like that. And I kept waiting for the social commentary here, but it didn't really go beyond the obvious surface level type of stuff and didn't leave you with much to think about beyond why you didn't leave the movie early.<br/><br/>The only saving grace was I thought the actors were pretty good for the most part and the ending was interesting. But that's not enough to make up for the horrendous writing, storyline, dialogue, etc."

","First off the good parts. Good acting, some really nice camera angles and an enjoyable score. That's pretty much it as far as we were concerned.<br/><br/>Where Peele got 'Get Out' so right was the fact it was very clear in what type of movie it was, this is the total opposite. Is it a thriller? Home invasion type horror? Comedy even? I can't think of a movie where you reach the end and can't put it into a certain genre.<br/><br/>Peele also tries far too hard to make this some kind of artistic masterpiece, this could have been an excellent thriller/horror if it was just simplified a little.<br/><br/>Finally, too many films these days conclude without ever really explaining the main plot, this definitely falls into this category and ultimately ends up coming over a little full of itself and a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>Nowhere near the level of Get Out and to be honest one to avoid"

The performances are breathtaking. Lupita's performance for me stole the show. The way she played 2 different characters with perfection. Her husband is also very good and adds a lot of funny moments. The kids were surprisingly very good too. Overall, this movie is great. It's not as magnificent as Peele's last film ""Get Out"" but it's definitely a must- watch

"applelover-81575","6","2","3","6 April 2019"," Extremely hit or miss.
","Acting:
This film was hilarious to me in unintentional ways, the delivery of the main villain
was so hilariously terrible. Although the acting was quite good most of the time.
Cinematography:
The best thing by far was the cinematography, it was stunning to look most of the time.
Plot:
while the premise was interesting the execution and writing was quite average. The most notable poor plot point being the twist at the end, it was predictable and awful.
Tone:
The balance of comedy to horror was by far the most poorly handled part of the film. The tone was never consistent and just as I was on the edge of my seat someone cracked a joke or something so stupid happened that ruined it. I left the cinema wanting a consistent horror atmosphere similar to what Peele created in Get Out.
Overall:
I would recommend this for the casual cinema goer or someone who loves good cinematography, but don't expect much more than an average horror film. If you want something better by Peele watch Get Out. If you want something better than both of these films check out Suspiria (2018) for some good horror, or The Lobster (2015) for some great tone balancing."

I'm not one to add spoilers so I won't, but the screen play on this was perfect for classic film lovers like my husband and myself. The writing and film techniques pay homage to classic horror/thriller films especially those from Hitchcock. The critics hype was justified and the over all feel was brought on by extremely well acted cast directed by an up and coming master Director. Please stay with it until the end."

","I don't think I've ever walked out on a movie - and I didn't walk out on this one - but I came close. The premise was compelling - doppelg√§ngers terrorizing a family - but I thought the execution of the story was a little lacking. It took a long time for the story to get going, and even when it peaked it wasn't much of a climax. The ending was dissatisfying as well, leaving a lot of unanswered questions and filling the story full of plot holes. The cast was well chosen, the acting and dialog were not bad (though sometimes a little over the top), I just didn't care for the direction of the film. I was disappointed in the film and would not recommend spending theater ticket money on it. I'm almost compelled to say it isn't worth renting/purchasing for home viewing. I have hundreds of movies in my home collection and certainly no shortage of horror/thriller films, but this one will not be added. I've seen it once and that was enough."

It's not sure what it wants to be as a movie, first it's a home invasion then is kind of like a zombie film and that bit drags on and on, it's a shame as could of been so much better but really the script let's it down bigtime, the movie just felt rushed"

","After watching get out I was really excited for this, and while this was in some ways not as good as get out, I wasn't dissapointed. The movie isn't perfect, it has some plot holes but just watching the movie is an amazing experience. The movie's highlight is obviously the terrifying and thrilling second act that starts when the family shows up to when they kill the thethered version of zora. That is one of the most amazing sequences i've ever seen, it's terrifying but it doesn't rely on jumpscares. When jordan peele tweeted that get out was a documentary and us is a horror movie, he had a really good point it's a movie that leaves you excited about what's going to happen. My big problem with the movie is that the neding doesn't seem satisgying, it has a big build up and the ending didn't leave me as amazed as the second act did. I'm not sure if it's such an amazing movie as it has been building up to be, but it was an amazing experiece to watch it"
"daryopeek","7","2","3","30 March 2019"," Too ambitious home invasion movie
","Like Peele's last film ""Get Out"", Us also not provide a remarkable originality, but its acting performance and how the climax is served, manage to redeem the flaws. However, Us also leaves a confusing story of a home invasion movie with an ambitious twist and underlying mega plot that explained in only one scene. All's good in other departments (including lots of jokes), but the unexplained nature of ""Us"" bring a simple plot (which actually can be resolved in one twist nicely), into somewhat awkward apocalypse movie that I am hesitate to see. It's still worth watching, but be careful for a confusing after taste when you walk from cinema."
"antonyjereynolds19","6","2","3","28 March 2019"," A Good Follow up to 'Get Out'
","First off, this film is not that scary but the tension is high for most of the two hours. The words that I would use to describe this film are 'interesting' and 'creepy'. Lupita Nyong'o is especially brilliant as the protagonist of this horror, backed by a talented Winston Duke and a well rounded ensemble.
From my interpretation, this film explores ideas of duality and rivalry. What I mean by this is how we define an enemy, is it a part of ourselves? Or is it when you see the negatives of yourself in another? Jordan Peele (the director) does a great job of making us question these ideas.
I do enjoy how bits of comedy are interwoven nicely throughout this film, rather than feeling forced, the comedy feels natural, mostly at the hands of Duke.
Nevertheless, I was not a huge fan of the 1 hour 15 mins - 1 hour 35 mark. Whilst it was not particularly bad, I felt that parts of it were out of place and the tone of the film at this point was off.
On top of this, some of the logistics of the film don't add up, this is never a major deal in the movie but it does bug me, a bit, personally.
To conclude, 'Us' is a good horror/ thriller, whilst not terrifying, it is intense and explores new ideas that are ambitious and for the most part, pay off."

"sophaljonesy","8","2","3","27 March 2019"," Chilling and full of surprises
","The trailer suggested a home invasion horror involving doppelgangers, but it is much more. Jordan Peele's Us is a full-on horror movie complete with scares, chills, creepy soundtrack, and blood. There is humor injected but the humor does not feel forced. The story is also very engaging, and you really want to know what happens next. I am amazed that Peele, whose comedy sketches I love could make such good horror. This is one of the few horror movies that really rouses my feelings till the end, and I would still want to pay to see it again."
"greennprple","6","2","3","27 March 2019"," Good for some fun, think the purge but not as good
","The story has a lot of potential, but is very underdeveloped, it leaves more questions than answers and not in the good thought provoking way. There are a couple of jumpy bits and some great acting from Lupita, which carries the film at times. In typical ""horror"" movie fashion there are too many plotholes and ""don't go down there"" moments. The most annoying part is Lupitas inability to move a table! Unless it's fixed to the floor which is highly unusual. Anyway 6/10 is fair."

Here, the questions just keep coming and that ends up killing one's ability to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>And just to note, I thought Get Out was the best horror movie in a long long time."
"octoberbaby-47728","6","2","3","24 March 2019"," A Spider with 9 Legs
","I loved ""Get Out"" but found no epiphany in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie appeared as a spider with so many legs. Not twists that keep you on the edge of your seat but confusion on where this movie is going or where did it begin. Was it a ""black comedy"". No pun intended<br/><br/>I initially thought, ok doppelg√§nger is a good premise - we all have them. But then I referred to the opening statement about the use and existent of underground dwellings and caves.<br/><br/>I tried to in my mind connect that maybe all our twins live in caves and will appear -when? How? No connection. Do they live in the dark recesses of our minds?<br/><br/>I think Lupita is s good actress but I found her acting just funny as the evil twin in this movie.<br/><br/>I did like the fact that unlike Tyler Perry these Black characters were not mired in ""the white"" family syndrome. But were more just a ""corporate money "" made family. We all know these families in real life.<br/><br/>So the twist is Lupita is the evil twin. But there was so much trying to figure how this movie connected and where from and where was it going was lost in confusion. So the revealing twist was drowned in the confusing plot.<br/><br/>I applaud Jordan Peele for his use of real Black people. Not the ones that both races feel are movie star appealing for the screen.<br/><br/>And I do think Winston Duke was very good and In just a normal way not an exaggerated minstrel Black way or a lost in space white way. .<br/><br/>I don't see him as the new Alfred Hitchcock though. I think Get Out was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Just as M Night had his with ""the Sixth Sense""<br/><br/>Everything after is just mediocre."
"goldcd","5","2","3","23 March 2019"," 2/3 of a great film
","Maybe unfairly, but not uncommonly, I watched this film comparing it to ""Get Out"".
It doesn't compare well.
Frustratingly though, many aspects are better.It has great performances. It has a wider scope.
Nothing that's on the screen is bad - it's just what's on the screen doesn't fit together into anything satisfyingly coherent.
It seemingly goes out of it's way to snub out a few possible metaphorical readings, but this leaves the film cold in the middle. I find myself trying to wedge some justification in, to give it some meaning, and feel the director is fighting back.
There's a twist at the end, you will see coming - it's not unwelcome and provides a modicum of depth - but then I found myself annoyed that the film bothered to include this, and ignore huge swathes of other ""unexplained stuff that just happened"""
"doveed","6","2","3","23 March 2019"," Not the Best
","To put my review into perspective, it took me 3 viewings of Get Out before I really started to appreciate it. I can't say that I love it, but I think I get it, and I recognize that there's a lot of intelligence behind it. Of course, I wanted to like Us, but I can't say that I did. Like Get Out, the premise is a little too random and high concept. I would probably get more out of it if I see it again, which I wouldn't object to at some point. Without a doubt, Jordan Peele is a very talented filmmaker but I just didn't connect with this one. Nevertheless, I give it 6 out of 10, because it was well executed. As I was leaving the theater, I asked a woman what she thought and she said, ""It was lame."" That might be a bit harsh, but I understood her dissatisfaction."
"Lord-Bigglesworth","6","2","3","23 March 2019"," A brilliant film hampered by idiocy--minor spoilers
","So at a first, cursory glance, this may strike some as a straight-forward horror movie--albeit extremely weird and confusing. After a bit of reflection and analysis, the vast, meaningful layers of the film start to reveal themselves to you. What the movie is truly trying to say at its core may be different to each person and up for debate; however, the basic idea is that we are our own worst enemies. There is an exorbitant amount of depth and symbolism beyond that, or at least I think there might be--I'm not about to say I truly understand this film.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the issue with this film, at least for me and presumably people like me, is that there are also numerous cases where the viewer is questioning the logic and realism of what's happening on-screen that it detracts from focusing on the more thematic depths of the film. For such an obviously intelligent film, there are WAAAYYY too many instances of horror-movie cliche events where the characters make a stupid decision seemingly to keep the film and scares going (just how are you going to forget the car keys, for the SECOND TIME, after formulating a plan to drive to mexico? and then why are they suddenly going back to the center of the calamity when there's no apparent no reason to go back there and we just decided to LEAVE? etc) There are also issues concerning the dopplegangers that seem to defy reason, even in this alternate universe the film creates. The actions of the two individuals in each pair seem to only be connected when the film deems it so.<br/><br/>The film brings up a lot of thematic questions, some of them are about who we are and how we treat others, which are important questions for us to ask. Unfortunately, the film also brings up a lot of literal questions about the hows and whys of the events that are unfolding on the screen, distracting the analytic viewer with thoughts of ""well, that doesn't make any sense."" Perhaps, upon further viewings, all the inane actions of the characters on the screen might reveal themselves to be part of Peele's master plan and were fully intentional. Right now however, I'm thinking: no.<br/><br/>There's a brilliant movie tucked away in here somewhere, it's a shame that it's sharing the screen with a rather idiotic one as well."
"cgearheart","6","2","3","23 March 2019"," Good but I was expecting so much more
","Us was an incredibly original and awesome movie, but I personally thought it was going to be a lot deeper and dramatic based upon what the trailer showed. Instead, we got a wacky and weird sci-fi subplot that was fairly predictable by the second act. Yeah, it was a really cool movie with awesome twists but I was expecting a deep and disturbing film focusing specifically on the family and their doubles, and the creepy duality of it all. Unfortunately, that didn't last long and instead we were treated to an exciting yet pretty off the wall and virtually frightless genre film. It's a good film, but it was very misleading.<br/><br/>

"jsneag","5","2","3","23 March 2019"," Really great trailer,very disappointing movie
","This movie had some nice jokes and a great and talented cast but that was pretty much it for me.The music was really annoying especially in the opening title sequence that felt like it was five minutes and played tense music in scenes that maybe they thought were tense but really weren't. There were also a bunch of issues for me like a young girl hitting some with a baseball bat that looked like it didn't have too much force behind it and hitting them with the back-end of the baseball bat that made them squirt blood on to their face.There are also a bunch of unanswered questions such as later in the film we find out that everything the original person does so does the tethered but if thats the case how did they all exit the loop? We see after the switch that when the tethered did ballet,the original did too so I thought maybe she lost control and the tethered was in charge but she created an uprising and left the area even though the tethered didnt enter the building.Another issue for me was where did they get the outfits from and the thousands of golden scissors? - its never explained,they just got them.How did the tether of the main character have feelings?- she clearly shows them and its not fake yet they explain she has no soul.The biggest disappointment for me though was there wasn't really a motive for killing everyone(in my opinion) and I guessed pretty much at the start of the film that they switched and the scene with the parents speaking to a psychiatrist confirmed that I was right.Very disappointed with the story and music but loved the cast."
"philpiasecki93","7","2","3","22 March 2019"," Us
","Satisfactory creepy entertainment. Jordan Peele's ""Us"" is by no means a failure, but it is not as perfect as some would like to believe.<br/><br/>The picture begins rather well; it sets up the central conflict with Peele's usual style of tricks; suspense, humour, originality, good dialogue. This continues up until two-thirds or so when the story begins to overwhelm and quite possibly confuse the audience with its constant output of ideas. It begins to feel more muddled and less grounded in the world Peele has established. It almost feels like you are watching a different film in the end from the one you initially intended. All you're left with is Peele's version of a Shyamalan twist.<br/><br/>In the end, Peele ignores the ""bomb theory"", eliminating real suspense at a point where the film should have used it to its maximum potential."

","What I got from this movie was a nature vs nurture question. Adelaide turns out to be the Tethered, whilst Red is the true person who was attacked and swapped with Red. Grown up Adelaide appears to be a normal, functioning human being who is a good wife and mother. Red is a violent, twisted being. Would the real Adelaide have grown up to be like this with her parent's influence? Would the real Red have been a gentle Tethered whilst stuck in the underground if she had never known what she was missing out on? Also, each of the kids is half tethered, half human... Where does that leave them?<br/><br/>Another poster questioned how Adelaide didn't remember that she was the Tethered if the reason she wasn't speaking was because she didn't know how, not because of the trauma of getting lost. Compared to her new life of love, security and warmth her old life would have been a trauma so it would make sense for her to block this out as she grows and embraces her new life. Kids are known for being adaptable.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie, very interesting and leaves questions unanswered which adds to the experience in my opinion."

This is the type of person that can easily loses a child on the beach and not use her head in the first place.<br/><br/>The girlfriend of the mother is another silly weirdo, has a bad marriage and an unlistening husband gets you killed in your own house, in front of your brand new land rover.<br/><br/>The girl can't outrun her evil self who was basically walking the whole time. When in front of the car and her evil self disappears, her first reaction wasn't to keep running but to get on the ground like she was playing tag. I mean, what can she even do once they get physical contact?<br/><br/>I have nothing to say about the boy, other than the closet scene I forgot everything he did in the movie.<br/><br/>Bad twist at the end, you would need an alternate ending for it to make some sense. Writing this makes me realize the movie doesn't make sense at all, bad plot. Out of respect for the director I give a 5, it's creepy enough for a thriller film, only if there was a better plot or at least a better reason for the doppleganger to exist, then it would be a re-watchable movie."

The concept of the movie is something which could be explored in many different ways but how Jordan Peele has made presented his idea is enjpyable.

"fromTull","5","1","1","31 January 2020"," Sparse and tedious. SJW Oscar hopeful.
","Although 'Get Out' had a skeletal story I enjoyed it because the premise was captivating despite its simplicity. 'US' is another story altogether. The story is lazy and sparse (but not as barebones as ""Get Out""). Clones with a catchy moniker: ""The Tethered"" do creepy things. Neither one of Jordan Peele's films are 'horror movies' exactly, more like 'eerie movies' instead because they're more unsettling than horrifying. The characters aren't fleshed out with interests/ jobs/ hometowns/likes/dislikes. Peele also has a problem with overly long shots and sequences. He has some good imagery, but not enough. He milks his top shelf ideas for all they're worth. Lingering. Lingering. End the GD scene, Jordan!! During the first attack on the family, the dad had time to flee the home and go boating for (what felt like) twenty minutes while the daughter sprinted (far) down the street, leaving the brother and mother at home with their doppelg√§ngers clicking and clacking and twitching and staring and boring me to tears. The pacing is so horrible that by the time an encounter reaches its conclusion you don't even care, nor are you scared because you just sat in a room with the evil twins for twenty minutes and remained untouched. That doesn't make them good people, but it does declaw these monsters. It's tedious and thinks it cleverer than it is. Bunnies= soft/Shears= Sharp. . . opposite sides of the same coin! Instagenius!! Also, I think the director has some issues he needs to work on because there's a lot of passive aggressive racism. A movie filled with r&b, yet the only people to die explicit deaths are whites who get beaten to death with golf clubs as a song by The Beach Boys plays. Then a comment on OJ Simpson comes seconds before white characters are stabbed to death. With her dying words one character asks her Alexa to ""call the police"", but instead NWA's ""f the police"" begins to play in near entirety (of COURSE it does). Long story short, 'US' is a generic fantasy that lacks tension and tries to fill that hole with grotesque contortionists who are just boring. Unnecessary social commentary and painfully extended chase scenes are included for free."
"renan_","6","1","1","2 January 2020"," Out of reason conclusion
","The possibility of the main character being replaced in the mirrored room is considered from the beginning, because she started to act differently after she left. However, this possibility is discarded as she explains to her husband what she saw in that place and by the way she shows restlessness and fear by the signs she sees during the vacation, leading to the conclusion that she wasn't replaced, only became traumatized by the encounter with her other self. As the movie progresses, the dialogue between the main cheracter and her doppelg√§nger doesn't leave a possibility of that original hypothesis being what really happened, once the evil copy talks as if she lived in the underground her whole life and explains to the main character the origin of people's copies and how they live as if she didn't already know. What seemed to be out of reason in fact is revealed as the plot twist, but a twist that doesn't shock and only leaves question marks in the viewer's head."

All in all, the part that left me most confused was the ending. It didn't seem to be a twist, rather a what if... reminds me of back when I was a kid reading Goosebumps where you could pick your ending based on your actions. The movie was all of their the place and the practicality of their decisions as opposed to what I may have done left me frustrated and confused but overall I was entertained.

","The marketing of movies... it's a machine that often doesn't represent the actual film. This is marketed as a horror film when it's really a dramatic parable with some violence. This movie is ""scary"" in a sense - it's representative of deeper themes about America, and we live in scary times (though I did think those thematic elements were a little heavy-handed). So yeah, the message is important, sure. But is the film actually entertaining? Not as much as I would have liked it to have been.<br/><br/>Unlike Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out,"" I didn't feel pulled into any of the main character's emotions in ""Us,"" nor did I feel like their situation was unfolding in a way that pulled me in. The only scene that was effective with that is the one you see in the trailer - the dad/husband standing in front of his house questioning why his neighbors are standing like creepy statues in the distance. Beyond that, I never felt engaged with what the main characters were going through in the moment. Thus, I was never actually scared for them. It was written/directed in a way that made me feel like a passive viewer from a distance. And there were moments that were clearly meant to be serious that felt campy and funny. A lot of crashing stinger sound effects were meant to create jump scares but there was no actual jumping on my part.<br/><br/>That said, the cinematography was pretty, and I do like the overall concept and theme of the film. I just didn't enjoy the execution of it. If this weren't Peele's follow-up to the far superior ""Get Out,"" it would never have gotten such buzz and exposure nor pulled in the box office numbers that it did."

Why didnt Red escape from the underground when she got replaced by the clone after she got out of the cuffs. Was the clone all of a sudden able to control her now she was not underground anymore? Why would she choose to stay underground for 30 years? And the execution of the plot twist was corny as hell. Also the voice of Red was seriously comical.
The comedy was seriously annoying. I hate it when people who are in horrible situations dont even seem to care. Especially the kids were unfazed by dead bodies. Really takes you out of the experience. And the parents were like: ""oh our friends are dead which means probably everyone is getting killed by their clones right now, that sucks I guess"" instead of having a panic attack.
The music was okay, except for the main theme which sounded like a parody of satanic chants from other better movies like The Omen.
The characters had no development and werent interesting in any way, this movie relied purely on its stupid plot which fell flat.<br/><br/>To summarize: this movie was ridiculous not only in its premise (which is a good thing, I like originality) but also in its execution (which ruined this movie for me).

I was very disappointed with this daft and unscary body snatchers movie. The premise is just too silly for words. We each have a doppelganger tied to us mentally and physically by some unexplained scientific means. The clones are kept in underground bunkers and fed a diet of rabbits, until they rebel and start wanting to live above ground. Obviously this is a recipe for disaster. Cue clones in red boiler suits terrorising their above ground counterparts. They have a thing for long pairs of scissors. For a movie that purports to be horror, there is little tension, few scares and not a lot of horror. One of the clones speaks like someone with really bad laryngitis and another runs about on all fours and barks! The protagonists are just not monstrous enough to be scary and the plot is nonsensical, sci-fi twaddle. The cast are pretty bland too. No-one seems that bothered and the acting has a ""going through the motions"" feel. The kids convince more than the adults and actors of the calibre of Elizabeth Moss, are just plain wasted.

After watching the amazing ""Get Out"", me and my husband decided to watch another film by Peele, but wow! Is this the same writer/director?<br/><br/>The film never takes off, and has such plot flaws that really left us very annoyed.
I mean, it's not necessary to explain everything that happens on a movie, sometimes it's really good to leave room for discussion and theories.
But here, what happens is that at the end we have a ""Scooby Doo moment"", with a looooong explanation of the whats and the hows.
And even after this explanation, we still don't get the point.<br/><br/>It felt like it was trying too hard to be a possible cult movie, and it felt really overwhelming to finish to watch this.

It wasn't scary in the least, and so weird in a bad way. It was like a bad twilight zone episode, only 2 long excruciating hours worth of one. I don't get the great reviews at all from the critics.

"davidjkobb","6","1","1","18 June 2019"," Over Rated
","This movie is given more credit than it deserves because of Peele's previous horror film, Get Out. while Get Out is also overrated (though still a good film), Us is overrated and isn't very good at all.<br/><br/>While the acting and directing, for the most part, do what they can to save this movie from completely falling apart, the writing is in shambles. The movie makes the unforgivable mistake of long episodes of exposition, telling and not showing. I believe it does this because Peel doesn't know how to show the story, because he doesn't know what the story is. I can almost see his thought process, ""If I feed just enough allusions to cultural imagery into this movie, people will fill in the blanks that I can't."" However, even that idea fails, because there isn't enough ammo for the viewer to use to fill in the blanks. Another unforgivable mistake Peele makes is showing the ""monsters"" too early in the film. Once the monsters are in the house, and especially once they start dialoguing like bad super villains, I am no longer afraid -- just bored."

","Like it or not, Peele is possibly one of the only auteurs of the 2010's. If anyone remembers, we use to get several per decade.<br/><br/>Now the former MADTV actor, and Bill Clinton Audience actor plant (1992) is too ""woke"" for ours and his own good. This effort was perhaps way too self-conscious, placating to 4 chan & 80s film buffs, rather than fluid story-telling. It's like he was working on a conspiracy comment section legacy first, putting the story at hand second. No doubt clever at times, It's merely a Twilight Zone episode stretched into a feature film. The last twist was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>""Get Out"" rose well above being a agenda-film-of-the-week, far exceeded expectations. This one gets old. AT least Peele didn't sell out just yet, by accepting the next remake or shared universe factory product, opting for rare original, modest budget theatrical films.

A shame really as it could have gone somewhere incredible or twisted. Speaking of the twist, it was predictable from about a quarter through the movie.<br/><br/>The problem is that US recycles a number of older horror movies which did each of the theme better: Invasion of the Body Snatcher, Logan's Run and The One I Love came to mind.<br/><br/>The opening text was misleading too, I thought it was alluding to some sort of subterranean mutant world or a supernatural dimension. The film is a bit of a mess, although the actors gave pretty solid performance. It's just they are not that well written nor interesting for me to sympathize with.

And some aspects of the explanation provided in the final act of the film would not make sense if one thinks it through.<br/><br/>The director has cleverly embedded many clues and Easter eggs into the film, but his message was eventually stated explicit by the characters in the film. Unlike Nolan's Inception (2010) which has an iconic ending for its ambiguity, the ending of this film is unequivocal, leaving no room to different interpretations, which might make the whole film less appealing to some critics.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider this film another great work by the great mind of Jordan Peele.

Film scores high on acting, direction and editing but it betrays on scripting level.
The inetrest is held tighter till the Imposter family arrive. After that it is all runing, hiding and saving yourselves. Defeating antagonist (imposters) remains a physical work, a mere action. The entire searching-out-source-of-the-imposters play holds no importance in finding the way to defeat the enemy.
The only mystery remains is the reason why the imposters are taking over the world. Which remains partially unaswered even after the movie ends.

","The movie is directed by, none other than, Jordan Peele, and stars ... Lupita Nyong'O, Winston Duke, as well as Elizabeth Moss.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1. The direction: What else can I say other than it's terrific. I mean, the filming locations are astonishing, as is the way the whole thing is shot.<br/><br/>2. The acting: Having seen her in only two movies, the only I've actually seen Lupita Nyongo'O act in was Black Panther. That being said, this is film I've seen her truly shine in. I can't go into very much detail, to be honest. All I can say is that this is the best I've seen her be in.<br/><br/>3. The score: First word that comes to mind would be wow. I will admit, I love the gothic genre, I love it to death; if you got that joke, good for you.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>The writing: By now, you're probably thinking 'How dare you!? How dare you criticize the writing!? Jordan Peele won an Oscar for best original screenplay!' Here me out, upon watching the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself ""Well, this does in no way look similar to The Strangers."" But on top, I than thought, ""You know what, I wanna go and see this."" And surely enough, I did just that. And after which, I thought it was ... okay.<br/><br/>Here's the first act, 'This seems ... very weird,' here's the second, 'You're seriously going that direction?' And here's the third, 'Um ... okay.' Yeah, that should be saying a lot.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that the second act was what truly aggravated me. You have this family who are blatantly the main focus of the film, and then you have this other family who are introduced in the first as (how do I put) a lot more self-indulgent. And if that doesn't sound aggravating enough, how 'bout this, they die. Yes, each and every member in that family gets killed by their own evil selves.<br/><br/>The reason this annoys me so much is because, and it should be obvious, the murder victims in the film are mostly Caucasian, including that one family. I mean, the way they are portrayed is as complete nimrods.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I got a Silent Hill vibe from the third act. I mean, come on, that's what the whole movie felt like, Silent Hill + The Strangers + The Purge.<br/><br/>All in all, while not scary per say, this film is undeniably entertaining. After all, the ending did make up for it, to me at least, and I do recommend it."

","Having been anticipating this new Jordan Peele movie for quite some time after the terrific ''Get Out'', my expectations were set quite high. In short, I was thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is deceptively intriguing and does give the entire movie some merit, especially after the very end where the entire plot is made quite transparent. That, however, is just about the only positive thing I can point out in this movie apart from it's sometimes unique camera angles and general quality of production. Oh yeah, and the music. By the last third of the movie, I actually started skipping ahead just to get through the painfully elongated scenes of fighting and ''disturbing'' or ''tense'' games of hide and seek which are more ridiculous than anything else. Like I said in the title, the movie simply doesn't take itself seriously to be passable as a solid horror experience. The jokes are numerous and misplaced as much as they are corny, the interactions nonsensical.. This is especially pronounced when you take into account the scenes where children are perfectly composed and cold-blooded when faced with gore and corpses for the first time in their life. No matter what kind of children you have raised, they will NOT be okay with suddenly having to kill other children or grown-ups for that matter. Many moments feel forced and unimportant, but the biggest issue I might have with the movie is that the characters simply never feel like they are truly and honestly threatened, mostly due to the idiotic comedic chops that keep appearing out of nowhere in situations which are presented as dire.<br/><br/>All in all, I expected much much more from this movie. Wait for the next one, and lets all hope it delivers."

","Jordan Peele's highly anticipated second horror outing Us leaves us with many questions. In 1986 young Adelaide wanders off alone to a funhouse and in the hall of mirrors encounters a version of herself. Even wearing the Michael Jackson Thriller t-shirt her dad just won in a fairground game for her. Yes that's weird, but how? Her parents are understandably distraught when she is found, but what happened in that funhouse stays in the funhouse, with Adelaide unable to speak about it.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present day and the now grown Adelaide, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is driving with her family to the Santa Cruz house where she spent that long ago summer. Winston Duke is wisecracking husband Gabe, with kids Zora and Jason. Jason played by Evan Alex, and true to his namesake, likes to wear a mask and wears a Jaws t-shirt. We might be safer in the water this time! Shahadi Wright Joseph's Zora is like any teenager attached to her phone.<br/><br/>And Gabe's bought a boat for the summer, it doesn't work too well, but it's still a boat he can tell his friend Josh about later that sunny day. On the way to the beach they pass a murder victim being lifted into an ambulance. We remember he was in the fun park when Adelaide was small and carrying a sign saying Jeremiah 11.11. Adelaide tells the kids not to look. The Wilson family meet up with their more affluent friends the Tylers. The already sozzled Kitty played by Elisabeth Moss, and Josh played by Tim Heidecker, with their twin girls.<br/><br/>Much like Adelaide when she was younger, Jason wanders off and comes across a man standing on the beach in a red jumpsuit with blood dripping from his fingers. But he doesn't tell the worried Adelaide what he saw, until she later notices a drawing he made of the encounter. The now spooked Adelaide tells Gabe of her own childhood all those years ago, and how she feels something is coming for her, Gabe lightheartedly jokes that when the storm blew the lights out that evening, it possibly was herself she saw in the funhouse full of mirrors. Understandable, but when the power goes out at 11:11, and Jacob says there is a family outside, the tension, with score by Michael Abels, could be cut with a pair of very sharp scissors.<br/><br/>Main plot spoiler!<br/><br/>Having set the scene for us Jordan Peele now sets to work unravelling a big ball of string all the way down to the many miles of underground America, and ties us up in knots. For this is no white rabbit filled Wonderland we know.<br/><br/>What if our governments experimented on us? What if they tried to control out minds by duplicating us? Could we have clones that we didn't know about, yet who mirror everything we do above ground, tethered to us like puppets attached with strings. And even wear our exact same clothes. Are they Us if we hadn't had the opportunities in the sunshine? And what would happen if these doppelg√§ngers living underground in the shadows found out about our lives above? Would they feel we had stolen a life that could have been theirs, if they had been given the chance? And if so who would lead them above ground? Surely someone who had actually been above ground!<br/><br/>A terrific thinking movie, with great acting across the board. Not so much a cover your eyes horror, more a terrifying social experiment that went badly wrong. A great duelling pas de deux and many many questions."

When you do a terror movie it's supposed to be scary for the audience
This movie wasn't scary at all
It has not horror or terror

He is not that good
He should've stayed on Jordan and Peele

","Honestly, I wasn't expecting an amazing film as I was already a bit disappointed with 'Get Out'. I believe that 'Us' offers an original premise and is very intriguing at the beginning. Technical aspects are great. Some shots are amazingly well executed with eerie score and beautiful cinematographic work.<br/><br/>Just like Tony Collette in Hereditary, Lupita Nyong'o is the heart and soul of a film that without a female lead, wouldn't even be worth watching. I believe that Jordan Peele really overcooked this film, creating an exaggerated story that didn't get anywhere.<br/><br/>He tried to repeat the 'Get Out' formula, but luck wasn't on his side this time. More importantly, he saturated the film with so many unnecessary symbolic references, that created massive confusion and discomfort. I'm not sure the film is worth watching twice, but I may give it another chance...<br/><br/>Score: 6.5/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"

","I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the movie. It had some good jokes and comedic death scenes. The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged. Then the family turns on the TV and funds out about the outside world.<br/><br/>After this happens, the tone changes to a much more serious and dramatic film. Apparently there's some sci fi angle to what felt like a fantasy film up until then. If I was a creative consultant to Peele, I would have told him to dump most of the explanation sequences.<br/><br/>Then we get the twist at the end. I didn't think it was bad, but it was pretty obvious from the open.

Dir: Jordan Peele
Runtime: 1hr 56mins<br/><br/>Synopsis: Accompanied by her husband, Adelaide Wilson returns to the beach house home where she grew up as a child. Haunted by a traumatic experience from the past, Adelaide grows increasingly concerned something bad is going to happen. Her worst fears become true when four masked strangers descend upon the house forcing the Wilsons to fight for survival. When the masks come off the family is horrified to learn that each attacker takes the appearance of one of them.<br/><br/>Just going to say off rip that I had relatively high expectations for this. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a high score, Get Out has a high score and even won and Oscar. I'm not going to say I'm totally disappointed but I guess I just expected a little more. Jordan Peele was recently announced to be the host of the new reboot of ""The Twilight Zone"" which suites him because after seeing this film and in comparison to ""Get Out"" both films are like plot lines taken straight out of a Twilight Zone episode. The film starts real casual everything is normal and then some insanely weird turn begins to change pretty much the whole outlook on either the world or the way things operate in this ""universe"". Storyline was great I can't knock it there, it was well written with some very odd twists throughout the whole film. I was not entirely entertained through the whole thing unfortunately with kind of getting bored. Pretty much standard ""horror"" theme with 20 mins of story build and then 30 mins in you start to see the weird stuff happen. The ending is the part that really gives it a twilight zone vibe which leaves it somewhat open ended. The cinematography was nothing to complain about. With being a feature film it lacked on jump scares and I guess actually ""scary"" scenes. A few gore cringe scenes here and there but nothing to make you turn away in disgust. The characters were almost too predictable, the father was the ""comedic relief"" complete with dad jokes and trying to ""lighten the mood"" attitude. The kids obviously did what kids do in films like this. Play a pivotal role without outshining the main character. My biggest complaint about the film and I literally could not shake it even after the film was over was what they did with the characters. They added an attribute to the ""Us"" versions of the characters that I absolutely could not stand and in my opinion shouldn't never ever ever ever be done with horror villains. But that's just my opinion and I don't get paid for my opinion lol. As for a theatre watch... ehhh I suppose if you really want to see it, it's not too long where it becomes boring or unbearable but I would probably just wait like I did with ""Get Out"" I probably wouldn't buy it unless Jordan Peele releases 4 more ""horror"" films and then makes them a set or apart of the same universe. And I use the term horror lightly because I honestly don't even know if I can classify these as horror. They are just kind of different and strange. They are very lacking in the ""scary"" realm but I suppose it depends on who you ask.<br/><br/>I'd say it was mediocre at best. Like I said the writing is fantastic and the plot is great, but going in I had different expectations. I was expecting more of a terror film than what I got. Go watch Get Out and then go see this so that way you have a general idea of what your walking into. Not saying they are really similar in storyline, but they have similar vibes."

","Don't get me wrong, I don't expect a horror movie to be totally believable. There's always got to be some suspension of disbelief, which I'm up for. Without some internal rationale, though, a film like 'Us' fails even on its own terms, because there is no reason for the things that happen or the characters who appear.<br/><br/>I've loved the horror genre since I was smuggled into a drive-in in the 1970s as an 11 year-old to see Peter Cushing in 'The legend of the seven golden vampires'. It gave me nightmares for weeks. Many years later, I found it and watched it again and had a good chortle. That's the thing about horror movies, when they're not really good - you end up sniggering, or leaving. Yesterday, I saw 'Us' and ended up doing both."

","Let's start with something positive, it's diversity and overall appearance of the movie is refreshingly new. The characters are interesting and relatable but I'm afraid that's it.<br/><br/>The introduction is noticeabley long, dragging out a whole 7 minutes just on opening titles does test your patience.<br/><br/>The film manages to stuff everyone horror stereotype inside it, ranging from the 99+ tripping into a long crawl to wasting every opportunity to strike an enemy with a weapon.<br/><br/>The predictability factor was sky high when after every situation occurred the audience were just left saying to themselves ""how convenient""<br/><br/>After enduring such predictability, the film does present one surprise: the ending. Oh, how the ending didn't only confuse its audience but just didn't make sense. It wasn't smart or psychological, it simply made to sense at all. I really suggest staying clear from this movie folks."

"henryau-29344","6","1","1","9 April 2019"," I don't get the hype...
","Great concept and I liked the twist at the end, but throughout most of the movie it keeps going from thriller-type movie to comedy. It has a good buildup up until the home invasion but afterward it just feels watered down.<br/><br/>People keep saying there's so much symbolism in the movie like the concept of duality, how meaningful is having a soul, references to the Bible eg Jeremiah 11:11, keeping up with the rich at the cost of your identity, etc. So I watched it a second time but there just isn't much to reflect on. You have to dig realllly deep to ponder about the aforementioned themes, but I just find that grasping at straws to put more meaning in the film. The only big theme I was left thinking on was (without spoiling), Can a copy of a person without a soul be considered a real person?<br/><br/>The more I think of the plot the more I disliked it due to the plot holes, hence the 6/10. Both times I watched it I heard others in the theater mumble ""wait, that makes no sense,"" ""what?"" etc. Without spoilers, how do the other people escape underground? How do they get organized so damn well before and after their escape when one person does all the planning without electronics? How does an entire city let alone the nation fall to these people armed with nothing but scissors? How does *she escape with mimicry when the elevator only goes DOWN??? Why is she always being kept alive after being caught? Who feeds the bloody rabbits and how is that a viable way to feed them all?<br/><br/>I guess it's worth a rental to see an interesting concept with a good score and cinematic ending, but overall with all the hype and $$$ it's been getting, I find it disappointing."

"zukowskipatryk","4","1","1","7 April 2019"," Great production quality, horrible and nonsensical plot
","Get Out was a masterpiece. It had a very, very original plot and great use of tension. Us howerer lacks both of these. First of all, when you watch a movie that gives you a very hard question to answer in a logical, in the movie's world, way you should be given some clues from time to time to release the tension of not knowing what is going on even in the slightest. This movie holds that tension for a good hour or so. But that would be okay if there was anything plot-revealing going on during that time. Instead you are given a long chase with no plot advancement. This truly was holdong me on such tension, because I was waiting the whole time for something, anything, that would shed some light on the mystery. And in the end, when I was sure this plot cannot make any sense at this point, the movie did the laziest thing it could when it comes to explaining the whole plot and to make the matters worse the big reveal was aaaaaabsolutely dumb and made very little sense. In the end the movie decides that it will tear it's skin, muscles and organs off, throw it all into a river and say, while showing you it's bare bones: ""Acculy, am art and symbolic"". No. No you're not. Your artism is weak and symbols make no sense, because putting symbols for the sake of putting symbols is not how putting symbols into a piece off art works. Us is a very sad dissapointment, because the whole production quality - the acting, the dialogues, the camerawork, the music - is incredible. It's a shame that the plot is so poorly thought out."

"FredOnFilm","8","1","1","4 April 2019"," 'A terrific achievement in genre filmmaking'
","What happens when a relatively normal middle-class American family face off against their evil doppelgangers? Us, the second directorial effort from Jordan Peele, goes above and beyond in answering this question and may have very well set a new benchmark going forward for the Horror genre. This is a film that will be talked about for decades and I will be absolutely astonished if another Horror movie in 2019 comes anywhere close to emulating the creativity, skill and invention on show here.<br/><br/>The main narrative of Us introduces Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and Gabe (Winston Duke) who take their two kids down to Santa Cruz, California for their summer vacation. Unbeknownst to the rest of her family, Adelaide is hiding a dark secret which links back to a traumatic experience as a child at Santa Cruz beach. The vacation takes a dark turn when one night the family of four face off against another family of evil doppelgangers.<br/><br/>From the very beginning I was immediately drawn to the family and formed an instant connection largely due to the terrific performances from Nyong'o and the instantly likeable Duke. Nyong'o will surely be nominated in the Best Actress category come next year's Academy Awards. She is simply terrific in a dual-role which is, surprisingly, her first as a lead. What's more, for me, Us was a film that was greatly improved by the post-movie experience theorising and analysing interpretations from fellow movie fans online. For some this may be considered trivial and unnecessary, but for me was one of the main reasons I loved this film so much.<br/><br/>As much as I felt that it was a spectacular showcase of Horror, Us still had several moments that missed the mark. Tonally, the film takes a while to really find its groove. By the end of the movie the problem had solved itself but watching initially felt jarring at times with comedic scenes dropped in seemingly out of nowhere. There are other scenes where the protagonists behave unrealistically given their dire circumstances. Upon reflection, however, and now knowing how the plot unfolds, I imagine that this will feel different upon a second viewing.<br/><br/>Unlike most Horror releases, Us is a movie that makes you think and theorise for days on end. Some movie-goers may be put off by this, but I honestly believe that the film can still be appreciated as a pure home-invasion style Horror flick. There are plenty of scares and laughs scattered throughout which are sure to grab the attention of even the most pessimistic viewer. Us is a terrific achievement in genre filmmaking and props to Jordan Peele who is now 2 out of 2 in his blooming filmmaking career. Technically speaking this is another major victory where he once again oversees a masterclass in cinematography, score, acting and direction. I cannot wait to see what this highly intelligent and imaginative director conjures up next.<br/><br/>FredOnFilm Movie Rating: A -<br/><br/>Visit the FredOnFilm movie blog for all the latest news, reviews and discussion in the world of cinema ."

"jonasklocke","2","1","1","3 April 2019"," Strange
","Us may be one of those films where I disagree the most with public opinions! In my eyes there is little genius in this movie.The reason why I am so frustrated is that the movie isn't giving any answers not on the mysterious and not on the scientific side whatsoever. And it also isn't the kind of movie you watch and think allright there is this mystery thing going on that I may now accept as a given or that will be left to the sequel. Instead it seems like something it's thrown together and left to interpretation. I think the only way to see quality in this piece is by enjoying the comedy which is sometimes a little bit cringe (there are some high cringe scenes like ""feel the beat"" in the car to the beach) and doesn't feel like supposed and the standard panavision cinematography. But the story itself falls flat because a: we don't understand why things are happening including the end plus we get kind of reasons for things all the time but they don't have any funding nor in reality nor in science and not even in mystery. They sometimes even contradict things that happen before (like the boy that can suddenly make his other self do what he does while Never somewhere else) or pull out ultra important questions that nobody seems to care about (How build the underground system, who were the dudes who started all that? Where do the materials like clothing and scissors come from? What is happening to the police? Why aren't there marines all over the place I mean hallo: People get killed all night and day and US Military is thinking: Another cup of coffee pls! Or are the overrun? But some people in red with scissors? Really? And there are just so much more) Followed by stupid on the hand filmmaking like the dad with his family walks upstairs (normally) than there is someone in red (the twin of his friend) and he starts to back off and all the sudden surprise the knee seems to hurt again - obviously to build tension due his inability to back off quickly. During the Journey I felt increasingly disconnected to the characters and the emotions - I wasn't scared and I was asking myself whether or not this film would begin to make any sense later (it didn't) We just get to see things but they don't fit together. They have no reason for being and No emotional value or value for the character transition or anything that I appreciate with good storytelling."

","I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, just like I have mixed feelings about movie reviews. I think to understand my critique of this film you'll have to know a bit about my tastes, but if you don't agree, just skip to the next section, otherwise here goes: I love movies, good movies, bad movies, low budget, blockbuster, every genre from every corner of the world. The two types of movies I tend to enjoy least are romantic comedies and blockbuster ""horror"" films. I don't understand the hype around the Insidious series or the Annabelle series or really most big budget horror flicks since The Grudge. I am a huge fanboy and therefore I have an innate appreciation for fellow fans and the amount of heart they put into their passion projects. 'Nuff about me.<br/><br/>About the movie: Us shines most through the performances of it's actors- each one of whom was well cast- and it's myriad references to the decade from which it's creator got his inspiration. The latter, might in the end actually hurt Us in terms of mass appeal, because if you are not a big fan of 80's cinema, I feel much of the films charm will be lost on you. I think what actually hurts Us the most though, is Jordan Peele's passion. The movie feels like a freshman project, and I would be surprised if this wasn't something Jordan had been cooking up in his head since childhood. There's no nuance to the congruent themes throughout the film, most of which are shoved in your face, and even mentioned in dialogue at one point. The last act of the film is half exposition used to lend a backstory that's not really wanted or needed, it's actually not unlike a lot of the good sketches on Key and Peele that don't seem to know where to cut it off. Like, you had a good thing and then you drove it into the ground. Ultimately it's a movie I would recommend, I would just caution people to adjust their expectations and understand that Jordan Peele is a nerd who won an award for a movie ha made, and was given the freedom to do what he wanted and so now he's made the movie he's been wanting to make since he was 12, and you can tell. But that's just like, my opinion, man."

","This is an average thriller. I can't find anything that makes it anything more. The characters, to me, are boring and I didn't care for any of them. I found myself laughing more at their stupidity than caring for their situation. I don't get why they couldn't be a bit more compelling. Right from the start, they constantly make stupid decision after stupid decision. Stupidity is the driving force behind the plot just like so many other basic thriller/horror movies in the past. I know that it's probably supposed to be an allegory for what our current real-world situation is but I just couldn't get myself to care for it. The twists were boring and didn't make the story that interesting. It feels, to me, like Peele was so concerned with trying to say something that he didn't bother to wonder if the movie was something worth giving a voice to. Get Out was, at least, different than what most people had seen before. This, though, is just more of the same."

This film is well made, fantastic cast - well acted, cinematography and great music. It starts of fairly well and has some comedic elements.
Though it ends up becoming a very confusing and convoluted plot. It ultimately became childish and almost like a comedy in its own way. I wasn't quite sure what points it was trying to make by the end of it.

We are expecting it to be more when really it's not a deep movie at all. The acting was so good, we care more about the characters than the movie. Questions I asked myself, Why didn't Red just come up like the clone did after and tell the police? Who put the order in for all those scissors and how did the tethered pay for them? Why was there no security measures underground? Where were the scientist? Why was the hallway in the underground so clean? All those rabbits and no droppings!!! Pluto's other version finally mimics him when fire is behind him but before than they were running from each other..."
"jessevasse","7","1","1","2 April 2019"," TOO AMBITIOUS - MY INTERPRETATION ""WE ARE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY""
","CONCLUSION AT THE END OF THE REVIEW<br/><br/>Yesterday I watched Us under near-perfect circumstances for the ultimate horror experience. The cinema, with room for over 500 people, was then filled with barely a handful of people. My friend and I could take a ""mid-mid"" spot while having an entire row for ourselves. As I did not watch the movie trailer, I was not sure what to expect exactly. Nevertheless, I was ready to be blown away, as both Get Out and Lupita Nyong'o are fairly beloved by me.<br/><br/>The first part was great. As soon as the intriguing soundtrack started and the opening credits appeared, the potential to be as awesome as Peele's directing debut was clearly visible. Furthermore, there was a fine build-up towards the actual confrontation with the doppelg√É¬§nger family. The first act made you want to invest in the story - hence, so far so good.<br/><br/>The creepy encounter has to be my favorite part. The image of the motionless intruders, along with the anxiety it evoked, was executed so well. The tension was really there... but evaporated quickly. After the weird conversation, the film reduces itself to one of many ""run and hide"" horrors for too long. Mildly entertaining, but not refreshing.<br/><br/>The end/twist was even unsatisfying for me, since credibility was sacrificed for shock value in my opinion. Still, the concept of the Tethered is fascinating. There are many theories and I would like to give my interpretation. ""We are our own worst enemy"" was a recurrent thought in my mind while watching. Our negative inner critic often 'kills' our self-growth; discouraging us to move our life forward and limiting our ability to take on new opportunities. In the worst case, we live our lives in our safe, narrow comfort zone - meaning we are basically dead.<br/><br/>Being connected with people who you care about is crucial to counter your Tethered one. This is in line with a scene in the movie. The other family was killed easily because there was too much self-interest and a lack of love present.<br/><br/>Still, a lot is not explained by this theory haha. Several cultural references (e.g., Hands Across America) as well as the phrase ""We're Americans"" steers towards an America-centered interpretation. My interpretation makes less sense considering this, but I love how a movie can lead to such a divergence.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to mention that Lupita Nyong'o once again delivers a great performance. Still, she is likely to be forgotten by the Academy if even Toni Collette fails to achieve a nomination for her recent work in Hereditary(!). Elisabeth Moss was a pleasant surprise and unfortunately only had one brief moment to display her talent.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Despite being an ambitious successor, Us does not come close to Get Out. A lack of credibility negatively affects the feeling of experiencing something extraordinary. It is still worth a watch given the performance of Nyong'o as well as Us being more entertaining than most other horror movie attempts nowadays."

","I was looking forward to this one for quite a while. Not sure why, but I was under the impression that it was based on a fantastic creepypasta i heard on a podcast a while back, too bad it wasn't.
This movie had potential, the premis was sound and could have been good if it gone in an interesting direction, rather than the plodding senseless route it took. It explained nothing and was full of contradictions. The acting was terrible and the writing was worse. This was one of the weirdest (not in a good way) dumbest, most disappointing movies EVER. Even more than M. Night Shaymalan's THE VISIT (which could have been great horror or comedy, but failed to fully commit to either)
The storyline made little to no sense and was riddled with plot holes. The characters were flat and 1 dimensional, and poorly acted. But mostly it was just 2 hrs of my life I'll never get back. I am just glad it wasn't my money wasted at the theatre. EPIC FAIL"

"sinks88","3","1","1","1 April 2019"," Great Acting/Visuals/Music....CRAP plot
","I agree with most peoples take on how good the music score and acting and overall feel is with this movie. Its fresh and exciting to see a slightly different take in a genre that has become quite stale.<br/><br/>BUT<br/><br/>The Plot: I left disappointed and felt like I was inside an April Fools Joke. The plot and plot twist is beyond far fetched and scattered at best. I literally feel like Peele is just trying a social experiment. I feel like he almost intentionally left it this way to see what would happen and lucky for him it seems to get majority of good reviews.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The one thing that gets me the most is the Shadow/Regular Moms twist and relationship. If indeed she switched places with the little girl at 8yrs old....the Shadow mom lived in her place and eventually grew up got married and had children (and presumably loved them) all while being a version of a clone. Now I can accept this, but then how Peele wraps it up in the end as if she may turn (bad/killer) really gets me shrugging. So if I were to believe this twist, I can continue to feel that way by chance the story did a better job at: Making the new present Shadow mom a bit odd or weird (we got no sense of that...she even went into depth explaining her PTSD scenario and showed much concern about going to the beach) this would be believable only if there were slight signs of it being a farce or a means to something...but nope it was played dead pan. Now lets go back to the other side....the real mom that now is underground. She is indeed a ""real"" girl and while I can believe that she might have gotten possible physiological trauma to the brain and in turn act weird....what I don't accept is the non-realization of what or who she is once she meets her other version. I just cant accept that she wouldn't have any urge to get the scenario straight or snap into a more realistic version of reality....it would have been better if the struggle then was now to prove she is indeed the ""real"" one as opposed to completely just living the ""clone/shadow/killer"" version without any recognition of the kidnapping/swap.<br/><br/>Also don't forget the ridiculous joke of Hands Across America preformed by ""clones"" being the ""coup de gras"".<br/><br/>Blah~"

However, if your opinion of movies rely heavily on story execution, this movie might not be for you. Have fun with the movie and try to take every scene with a grain of salt. If you think too hard about the story that was presented, you might be as confused as I was and might be left grasping for metaphors that weren't really there."

","Very cool and creepy concept. For the most part, great acting and writing, with just the right amount of comic relief.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Us suffers from a similar trap that many horror movies fall into. In order to keep the scares coming, they choose to make the main characters act like complete morons. I was face palming throughout a good portion of the last 50% of this film.<br/><br/>""Please don't leave the safety of the car to check and make sure the villain is dead.""<br/><br/>""Please don't wade into the blatantly obvious trap being set for you.""<br/><br/>Oh no, they're going to do all of that. Gotta say, great twist at the end, and because most people seem far less bothered by the irrational behavior than me, I don't expect too many people to share my opinion.<br/><br/>I will also concede that I felt Get Out was a masterpiece, so my expectations for Us were probably unreasonable. But what can I say, if Peele is going to set the bar so high in his first film, that is just going to be the reality.<br/><br/>If you enjoy horror movies, definitely check it out.

Didn't like the two friends and their daughters, felt like filler.

","The good: I thought the acting was excellent. The set and cinematography were both also well done.<br/><br/>The bad: in a nutshell, I was too engrossed with deciphering the cryptic symbolism/allegory of the film that I was not scared at any point during the movie. The only thing I experienced was ""confusion"". Even after the explanation of the thethered people was revealed, I had more questions than answers. I understand that experiencing a film requires suspension of logic and reality. However, I am remaining with the logistics and reality outlined by this film when I ask the following questions<br/><br/>1: if the tethered people were forced to mimic the movements of the people above, when did they have time to pursue independent movement and thought to plan and stage a revolution?<br/><br/>2. If Lupita's original version was wrongly held captive in the underworld, how did she then inherit the thethered people's mimic behavior? I mean, the thethered individuals were secondary to the originals. So wouldn't that mean the escaped Lupita would still be mimicking the lupita stuck underground? or was there a mind data transfer that I missed?<br/><br/>3. It was advantageous for thethered lupita to learn the behavior and thoughts of the above ground society. this would allow her to remain unnoticed and free. this was her incentive and motive to keep her true identity a secret. What was imprisoned lupita's incentive to relinquish her old identity and adopt the behaviors of the thethered people? Much like thethered lupita's hard work in adapting foreign behaviors and mindsets, original lupita would also need to work hard at adapting to a new lifestyle. why would she put so much effort and time into wanting to lead a sh** existence of thethered? what's her motivation?<br/><br/>4. ""they can clone the body, but not the soul"". ok cool. that's your premise. but why does the plot of the entire movie rest on the fact that deceptive lupita embodies soul, love, bravery, and compassion for her family until the big secret is revealed at the end. looks like she had a lot of soul.<br/><br/>this movie isn't touted as a B rated slasher movie. If it's supposed to provide social commentary, then it should be subjected to criticism. Here's my response to people who are ""marveling"" at its depth and complexity, but at the same time say ""oh, relax it's just a movie!"". you can't have it both ways. is it just a nonsensical horror joyride or is it thought provoking social commentary?"

Ok, ok, fine, I'm sorry, come back. If they're in their teens they should be a fine. The younger ones might get spooked. Definitely don't take grandma though, she won't top talking.<br/><br/>The Long, Boring and Pretentious Review:
Oh sure! In 2017 Jordan Peele came out of nowhere with one of the most original, suspenseful and entertaining horror thrillers in recent memory, but, can he do it again? Well, yes, of course he can.
But this is not it.
I'll try to explain. Ever since ""Get Out"" blindsided audiences with its well-constructed tale of ultimate indentured servitude we all have been waiting for the next film from the former half of comedy duo Key and Peele. After two years we finally got our wish. With 4 times the budget of his first film Peele wrote, directed, and produced his next offering.<br/><br/>The good news is that Peele continues to mature as a director and shows an expertise than even seasoned veterans can envy. He is not just a skillful storyteller but also proves to be an expert behind the camera. Watch him as he makes a simple shot of rabbits feel unsettling. He is aided by a solid cast all pulling double duty as a normal American family on vacation and the deranged doppelgangers who torment them for some reason.
Lupito Ngyiong'o gets the best parts with the plot being anchored around her story. Ngyong'o's worried mother Adelaide Wilson exudes a sensuality that contrasts sharply with the barely contained lunatic madness of her counterpart. What does she want from the terrified family and why does she seem to know Adelaide? Along for the ride is Ngyong'o's Black Panther co-star Winston Duke as pater familias. A man who finds himself out of his depth in trying to protect his family.<br/><br/>The bad news is that while all the pieces are in place to make a compelling narrative the story never comes together and the film as a whole never quite decides what it wants to be. While ""Get Out"" gave us a satisfying payoff after all the weirdness, ""Us"" never fulfills the promise of its storyline. It doesn't help that at times the film decides it wants to be a comedy before pivoting back to suspense.<br/><br/>But Peele manages to pull one last rabbit out of the hat. Even if it takes a long way getting there the film comes up with a final surprise ending that would make M. Night Shyamalan jelly. The intriguing finale saves the entire thing from being a wasted effort and Peele from being a one-hit wonder. While he may not be the next Hitchcock just yet he has shown that he can make interesting and complex work and I'm still curious to see what he will do next."

"DJPilkington","6","1","1","25 March 2019"," A huge amount of potential, squandered
","Hot off the heels of ""Get Out"", I went into the cinema with absolute conviction that I would be swept off my feet by Peele once again. Those first 25 minutes or so are indeed incredibly gripping, suspenseful and practically oozing with possibilities and potential. Peele once again flexes his chops with great character writing, stellar cinematography and a healthy dose of symbolism, but things take an awkward turn after the full introduction of our antagonists, the Tethered.<br/><br/>The Tethered start out as an awesomely creepy concept -- mysterious, twisted simulacrums of Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family. They twistedly reflect each of their ""real"" counterparts, and their ominous arrival at the Wilsons' holiday home is great. Nyong'o -- hell, all of the main cast -- do an excellent job at portraying these eerie, alien parodies of the family. As the film goes on, however, they suffer from coming off as rather incompetent. I also definitely think it would've been better if the Tethered only copied the Wilsons rather than copying everyone.<br/><br/>At first I thought that Peele would play an almost sympathetic/misunderstood monster angle, that they could be redeemed possibly through their interactions with humanity (there's some remnants of this in the ending 'twist' which I'll get to later). Peele throws these seeds of doubt and intrigue out the window, and the clones just become these screeching, gimmicky comic villains who run around killing people with scissors. It's not like they even have any special abilities or anything (they're not even any more durable than normal humans), so it's not believable that they're positioned to be this global threat. Pretty much any rando with a gun could kill them en masse.<br/><br/>The script quality seems to decline fiercely and noticeably as the film goes on. The human characters become distractingly self-aware and the black comedy starts to ruin suspenseful scenes. Peele ends up falling into the trap of feeling the need to over-explain the Tethers, resulting in a tedious expository scene towards the end that ruins all their mystique and raises far more questions and plot holes that could've been ignored otherwise. How have so many doppelgangers been produced without anyone else ever interacting with them? How have they obtained all these identical uniforms, scissors, etc?<br/><br/>All this feels symptomatic of the uneven tone of the film. Does it want to be a 'pure' horror film? Does it want to be a self-aware screwball parody? Does it want to be a biting satire of American life and history (more on that)? I could've bought the Tethers' origin story if the film was going in a proper psychedelic direction, but for the most part it's pretty grounded until the end. The indecisiveness wounds the film quite a bit.<br/><br/>It's a shame too because I really like these characters. The family and their dynamic are easy to invest in. Adelaide could have easily been written as a bland emotionless trauma victim but she's instead a likeable, good-humoured and mysterious figure throughout the film. Her husband Gabe, in the spirit of Rod from ""Get Out"", provides great comic relief (although it's mostly his excess of funny moments that distract from the horror).<br/><br/>Last main point I want to address is the racial/class symbolism and allegory throughout the film as it's an important part of Jordan Peele's style. It's all well done (if very hamfisted). You've got the classic handcuff-and-chains imagery, caged rabbits, phone-camera footage of brutality, ""angel numbers"", etc, until Adelaide's doppelganger just outright says ""We are Americans."" Way to spell it out, Jordan.<br/><br/>So overall, I'm disappointed with ""Us"". There's a really great idea in there that just hasn't been executed particularly well, and worse, Peele's main claim to fame, his previously demonstrated talent for screenwriting, has let him down here as he makes a lot of rookie errors. That final twist kind of summarises everything that went wrong here; it feels like the cool twist ending to the interesting story that Peele seemingly started out writing, but not a good one to the one he ended up making."

","It was a really good movie. I think the media kinda took some away from it though. I'd classify it as a suspense thriller, but I don't wanna focus on the media hype. It was a great original idea that kept you guessing throughout. The actress Lupita (Adelaide Wilson) did great and the acting of the remaining cast was decent. It got pretty brutal in regards to some of the scenes in the middle of the movie which I appreciated. The score of the movie was good and unique in sprinkling some well known tracks and the dark and ominous tones. The comedic relief was a bit much I thought. I understand it is Jordan Peele and they kinda go hand in hand but to become a ""master of horror"" I think he needs to use it more strategically. The cinematography was pretty straightforward. I feel with the plot of the movie they could have gotten a bit more creative. The ending still has me thinking which is good but i don't want to give any spoilers. I understand the idea of people existing without a known purpose is a theme but I'm definitely gonna see it again to draw examples and correlations emphasizing that point. Overall, there are a lot of lessons to draw from this movie whether it be to face your fears, promote social justice, or simply enjoy a movie.

I am a cinephile, specifically a horror movie/deep-thinker movie cinephile, but this movie just has too many inexplicable plot holes to be good.<br/><br/>I fully appreciate movies that are purposefully ambiguous when those movies really humble you by causing reluctance about yourself and your surroundings. However, when you leave the movie not even knowing what the ambiguity is in the first place, that is a problem. A few aspects of the film make it apparent that Peele is a smart guy, but he still has some things to learn in both his writing and his directing.<br/><br/>Also, whenever I find myself excited for the movie to end so I can leave, that is a bad sign."

The least Jordan Peele could have done was be deeper in what he's trying to say.<br/><br/>Pros: Lupita killed her role and was the only great actor in the movie. The cinematography was good. The trailer and marketing was amazing!<br/><br/>Cons:
Unanswered questions. Why were these Black people talking and acting white? Why did he give everyone a clone in the movie? How could everyone in line fit in that small ass basement? Why did the black guy clone take him on the boat? Where was they going? Why was the white guy zombie walk acting so horrible? Why they tried to connect Bible scriptures with the movie and failed? Why it was typical when she asked ""who are y'all? AMERICANS"" ? How did the meaning in the beginning of the movie correlate? Why wasn't it just deep enough? Why were people laughing in the theaters on parts that was supposed to be deep? Why did the little boy look at his mom as if he knew she was a clone? How would he know that? How could the little girl grow up down in the trapped basement with nothing to eat? Who was feeding her? How did they change clothes?<br/><br/>When watching a movie these questions have to be answered within the movie. You can't just make up scenes and say this will have everyone thinking.<br/><br/>To me Get Out was nothing but luck and that make sense because everything else Jordan created wasn't that good.

I thought it was brilliant when I was expecting the scare during the first scene with the mirror, and they didn't show it. I was expecting that maybe they are gonna somehow show us the scare when it was most unexpected, so I was anticipated with that. But then came the rest of the film, which there wasn't much scares, not even a cheap scare. I silently sighed as soon as the tense broke with idiotic humor, and the audience were laughing. And when they finally show the end of the mirror scene, it was a waste. I don't know what they were thinking, mixing humor during fearful moments. It confuses us and the tense is no longer there.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure a lot of us were expecting more of a thriller, than a mixed humor/horror theme.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't recommend watching it in the movies. But i recommend to have a look when it hits home. The movie itself isn't worth it, but the afterthought is the genius part. The real fear is to theorize what happens if cloning was real? Clones are exactly like us, except they have no heart/soul. So how will the clones act? That's the real fear, just how the movie ""get out"" was about brainwashing, behind the ""racist"" stuff people point out.<br/><br/>Either way, I think the director's aim of this movie is to wake everyone the hell up and think for themselves.<br/><br/>-Riichirichmoviereviewer-"
"Benslie","10","7","18","31 March 2019"," Will be one of the best movies in 2019
","First of all, Jordan Peele knocked it out of the park with this film. He directed, wrote, and produced this film. With every scene, he directed it to perfection so you knew what was happening to this family and what to feel. This wouldn't be possible unless the actors did their job to the best of their abilities and easily they did. Once the invaders come into their house and the tension grows that is when some of their best acting comes out. They make you sympathize with them and want them to survive. The one person who stood out the most to me though was Lupita Nyong'o mainly because she is the main one you follow throughout the film. But she easily stole the whole film from beginning to end. Even the kid actors, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex did outstanding jobs and I hope they will go far with their careers. The music in this film also helped set the tone and mood in specific scenes. Every time the music started you automatically knew that something was going to happen. This film is already one hour and fifty-six minutes and it doesn't feel like it one bit. The movie flows really well from scene to scene and you can easily understand what is happening without knowing what's coming up next. I have to mention that the cinematography, especially in the scene where you don't know yet that the people are them, is really well done. This film isn't perfect but most of my problems are spoilers so I won't mention them but they are minor and still don't take away from how great of a film this is. In the end, Us is a great time for anybody whether you like horror movies or not, especially because I would classify it as a thriller. I highly recommend checking this film out."

"couponsforstacey","9","7","18","23 March 2019"," Bad Reviewers are Dum Dums
","Well-written, well-acted, well-directed movie. For those giving it bad reviews saying it didn't make sense and had plot holes -- they're clearly there for the cheap thrills of a horror movie. Jordan Peele isn't that guy. His movies are nuanced and a psychological mindf&$k. As with Get Out, there's a lot to unpack and well worth multiple viewings."
"sharinganvitor","8","7","18","22 March 2019"," A rising star in its own genre
","After the so acclaimed debut in Get Out, Jordan Peele returns stablishing himself as the new horror revolutionist introducing the audience to a new genre that combines humour and terror adding a satiric social comment on top. Jordan Peele is on a quest to end boredom in Horror films. No more jumpscares and evil spirits. No more haunted houses. And no more predictable plotlines.
In this thrilling and epic tale, Jordan tells us a story of how the scariest creature we can be afraid of is ourselves. Through great characterization and great performances we are introduced to the family doppelgangers, each with their own twisted characteristic that creates a feeling of strangeness and restlessness that stretches not only to the entire Wilson family but also the audience. The duality of the original and doppelgangers personality is beautifully represented by Lupita Nyong'o's performance (one of her top performances so far).
The film doesn't rely on jumpscares and ghosts to be scary, instead it uses a psychological horror to inflict fear upon the viewer. Everyone has a copy of themselves, so everyone has someone set to kill them. A path of destruction set in motion by no other then ourselves.
The social critic becomes explicit with doppelganger Adelaide Wilson explanation of how the underground world came to be. It was the surface people who created them, forced them to live underground, segregating and subjecting them to those conditions. For ones to thrive, ones must be sacrificed, and that's how this world and our world operate. Shadows of the surface people, continue to survive, mimicking their original selves, mentally challenged, inferior beings. And it's only when the major plot twist is revealed that the second social critic comes to light. Turns out, surface and underground people weren't so different, just a product of their own environment.
Although the argument being mined with a few plot holes, I think the film does an excellent job on entertaining the audience, combining horror and humour in a subtle and innovating way. Ultimately it passes its message and due to its ambiguity, will certainly inspire hours of debates among fans and talked over through years to come."

"PyroSikTh","8","5","12","26 February 2020"," A Story of Classism and Nurture over Nature
","Us follows a family on vacation in the Santa Cruz area. The mother experienced a traumatic event in the same place back in the 80s and is reluctant to return, but the enthusiasm of her husband encourages her to soldier through for everyone else's sake. They come home to a family waiting in their driveway that look exactly like them, and then the violence begins. Turns out there's a doppelganger of every person in America living in extensive underground tunnels, mimicking every movement made above ground. That is until this fateful night when the entire population of Tethered emerge for a violent uprising.<br/><br/>This is a movie that can be viewed at multiple levels, and how well it stands up depends on what level you view it at. On the surface it's literally just a movie of doppelgangers killing their originals and taking over. Dig a little deeper and you start to unearth plot holes and ask questions that were never intended to have answers (it's a movie, not everything has to be answered, otherwise we get The Da Vinci Code with a twenty-minute exposition dump in the middle). Dig even deeper than that and you start to reach the subtext and themes of the movie, the most fundamental of which being that of class. The Tethered are the lowest class. They literally live lower than everyone else, underground, and they have no wealth, no purpose, and they live off whatever they can find (in this case rabbits). Everyone else above them are middle-upper class. Of course for this point to hammer home, the only families we really see are middle-upper class by our standards already. Both the Wilsons and the Tylers have these large, modern vacation homes right on a closed lake, with their own boats. These are not people living on the bread line. Either way, they're completely ignorant to the Tethered's existence, living better lives in blissful ignorance, lives that the Tethered covet for themselves. Their above-ground violence is a revolution against the wealthy, as has been seen across the globe throughout history.<br/><br/>But there's another layer to consider with the film's twist (SPOILERS, obviously). The Tethered are seen as the evil twins; violent, sociopathic, unable to communicate beyond grunts and yells. And yet the Adelaide we follow for the majority of the movie is herself a Tethered, with a family she made for herself. While her violent tendencies come out from time-to-time, she's an otherwise well-adjusted member of society. Jason and Zora are her biological children. Gabe is the man she fell in love with and married. There's no hoodwinking there. Despite not being the ""real"" Adelaide, she lives a more real life than the real one does. On the flipside the real Adelaide (otherwise known as Red) is an original restricted to a life underground surrounded by Tethered. She's the only one down there with a degree of free will, and is seen as a leader figure for them, a focal point of some form of religion. She's almost god-like compared to her cohabitants. But she is ultimately moulded by her surroundings. She loses her voice, she grows resentful and violent, she's the only one aware of what's happening above ground and the only one that knows the life they lead isn't a natural one. She's the original Adelaide, and yet she is undoubtedly still the ""evil"" one. But then that's the point isn't it; there's no such thing as an evil Adelaide. They're both good and bad in their own way, in their own worlds. We're all just products of our environments and others' perspectives.<br/><br/>Luipta Nyong'o absolutely earns her top-billing in this film, managing both Adelaide and Red without missing a step. Adelaide is a traumatised and fearful woman who grew so accustomed to her nice life that she forgot who she really was. All she knows is she has an irrational fear of a place. With Red she gets room to play around with a more interesting character, one who has been driven to extremes by her circumstances. The raspy voice she gives Red is just icing on the cake that really emphasises the divide between the two Adelaides. Elisabeth Moss is also really good in her limited screentime, but much like Nyong'o, it's her Tethered character that gets the greater opportunity to impress and be creative. The way she reacts to real make-up, as well as the death of her Tethered husband is fascinating and creepy in equal measure. Winstone Duke is the opposite, really shining as the original Gabe and offering a large part of the film's comic relief. He's a guy easy to like and sympathise with, and it's just a flat-out joy watching him.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Michael Abels deserves a special mention too, and is largely responsible for why I might prefer this over Get Out. The creepy chanting really gives Us its own unique sonic quality, as well as perfectly fitting and emphasising the movie's unnerving quality from beginning to end. It marries so well with Peele's slow establishing shots that like to linger on a detail. Another stand-out is the remixed version of I Got 5 On It by Luniz, which is then adapted further by Abels into Pas De Deux for the film's climactic confrontation between Red and Adelaide. The licensed music is also great, especially damn The Police and Good Vibrations adding a fantastic comedy element to an otherwise dark and violent scene.<br/><br/>Would Us have made it to my Top10 list? Yeah, more than likely, which is a little disappointing, but it is what it is. While I feel like Get Out might ultimately be Peele's better film, I can easily say I enjoyed Us more. Us is filled with plotholes, unanswered questions, and hapdash world-building, but ultimately I didn't find that any of that really mattered in the grand scheme of things. The film is really well-crafted, chock full of references, foreshadowing, and recurring motifs, with a fantastic score, brilliant performances, and a story that begs more questions of us and our role in society than it does about its own plot. I give Us a really good 8/10, and I can't wait for Peele's next movie."

"tpindustries","9","4","9","1 April 2019"," Worth a watch for genuine horror
","This film rolls out a little differently to Get Out (which probably set the level of expectations for most viewers), I found Get Out to be more of a thriller that created an air of suspense and sat with you, and while Us still has those lingering moments; it's got a little bit more attack a lot earlier into the film. Get Out sort of had the more horror-esque moments closer to the end while Us gets that started earlier.<br/><br/>If you are expecting Get Out levels of performance, creativity and direction; then you're in luck, because it is just as phenomenal in those required areas, there is also well-placed comedy to be found in it, just as there was in Get Out.<br/><br/>I also have to say; it's been a while since I've genuinely been scared by a horror movie, probably not since the 70s, but this film really has some well-shot terrifying moments, I don't want to spoil but something happened in the introduction that just had me on the edge of my seat in fear, it was such a well-shot scene, looking at the same scene broken down from behind the scenes; it wasn't as remotely impactful but in the film it definitely goes up there with some of the best classic horror scenes of all time √† la The Shining (that wasn't an intentional reference to the Key and Peele show but I'll take it).<br/><br/>That's really one thing I love about this film; Jordan Peele understands how to create genuine horror without relying on Jumpscares or gore (though there is still gore to be had in this film), something that's inventive and not at all formulaic and very unpredictable, makes you feel genuine fear like something's not right with the picture.<br/><br/>Also want to give a hand to all of the actors involved; not only because of the quality of their perfomances, but also because they technically had to play two people simultaneously."

","This movie is incredible. Jordan Peele does an incredible job showing what he can truly deliver in Us. Every part of this movie is breathtaking, and not to miss at all. Get Out brought a fresh and excitingly new genre of horror, and this takes it to a further level. The movie has solid plot that in Peele's normal fashion makes the audience think to themselves. The movie has solid flashbacks that masterfully add up to the current plot at the time of the movie. Peele implemented dark and twisted scenes and parts as usual, which adds alot to the movie. The most important part of this movie, is that everyone has their own perceptions and thoughts/theories whilst watching. This is what truly makes the movie very enjoyable, and gives a better experience whilst watching too. The movie is very unpredictable in the most unexpected ways. Alot of violence and beautiful blood as expected from Peele by now. Although, one problem was a small plot point that should have been further elaborated on, but was kept as a snippet at the end."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>As a young girl, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) visited the beach, and took a detour into a hall of mirrors, only to find herself faced by a creepy doppelganger of herself, an incident that scarred her through her childhood. Years later, she's married to Gabe (Winston Duke) and has two children of her own, Zora (Shahadi Wright) and Jason (Evan Alex.) To destress from their heavy lives, the family take a trip back to that same beach, only for Jason to head to the same place that Adelaide did as a kid. After that, they find themselves accosted by a group of doppelgangers of themselves, who have plans of their own.<br/><br/>I was a latecomer to Get Out, director Jordan Peele's directorial horror debut, and dodged all the hype surrounding it when it was first released, but was certainly very impressed with it when I did get round to seeing it. And so, on learning of the existence of Us, his follow up effort, I felt somewhat more compelled to go out and check it out, even though from the offset it was living in the shadow of GO. It's received mostly quite positive reviews, and it's certainly worth seeing, it just struggles to live up to the quality of what went before it.<br/><br/>Revelling in the current diversity agenda sweeping Hollywood, Peele helms an entirely black lead cast, in a film deriving much of it's humour from subtle references to African American culture. The main concept is certainly intriguing, and creates a decent air of mystery to what could be behind it all. It's also strongly acted by the lead stars. But it lacks the surreal inventiveness of GO, simply revolving around a concept without having much deeper beneath the surface. While the mystery is suitably resolved at the end, it just comes off as far fetched and outlandish, not helped by moving from the containment of the family's predicament, onto a worldwide epidemic.<br/><br/>In a modern horror climate dominated by CGI, cheap jump scares and shaky cameras, it's great to have a director like Peele around, who keeps things story centred and at least attempts to give his work a cerebral edge. Us in no way represents a downward spiral, it just can't quite match the standard Peele previously set. ***"

Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years A Slave"") throws it out of the park with this home run of a performance. She is beyond terrific. You can see what writer/director Jordan Peele (""Get Out"") is trying to do here, and kind of mirror us a society with these doppelg√§ngers, but what's the actual point of them? I left the movie theatre super psyched but as I kept thinking about the third act, I was left with unanswered questions and that frustrated me. There is no doubt that the film's Peele is creating are some of the most diverse, horrifying, hilarious and original films of our generation; he is a master. The more I think about ""Us"", the more I want answers. Maybe that's what Peele wants; for us to start a conversation and answer these questions. Who knows.

The film did what it's supposed to do. Draw my attention and keep me entertained for 2 hours which it did. A family on vacation being terrorized by what looks like their exact opposites only to find out the entire city is having the same problem.

Keep an open mind and don't take this too seriously as it is a horror film and you will find this movie highly entertaining."
"Offworld_Colony","7","3","6","7 February 2020"," The strangest thing about Jordan Peele finding his voice
","There's nothing more cringey to me in film when a Director over-explains everything in interviews or behind-the-scenes. Sure there are complicated, or layered or esoteric films to which I would love to know the answers, or what was in the Director's head, however knowing it is like a spoiler; I want to know, but I never ACTUALLY want to know, I want to be surprised, I want to come to it on my own.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele, by doing this, doesn't put the elements he likes about his film, in the actual film. By having to explain it means that he hasn't worked well enough or hard enough to fold the themes and ideas into the film sufficiently. If I can't read some theories or speak to some friends and come up with the answers ourselves (a sort of unique and magical thing) and instead I find that the Director has to tell me, then the film isn't as good or as clever as it is dying to be.<br/><br/>That's my most painful comment on the film; Jorden Peele, you don't tell me what i'm supposed to see in your material - thats not how films work - the material should have all the components for discovery in there.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it's got an absolute orgy of half-baked but tremendous ideas, scenes, dialogue, character moments and horror homages. As a home invasion and doppelganger genre flick it succeeds spectacularly, unfortunately as a message-movie, or a science-fiction, it fails mostly. Despite the race and identity politics and the smatterings of post-Trump themes; the most interesting elements of the story are untouched here; it's clearly the experiment that the government did, all that stuff we didn't see; how the clones are born, the horror of it, the discovery of a soul and how it affects those without, the people who feed them and make them, the corporate and government conspiracy elements of it, which could have been a scathing commentary of now, how the tethers work etc etc. All of that is the most interesting material.<br/><br/>Us also has a million stupid ruinous plotholes - even if you can put most of them away to enjoy the true wit and verve and confidence of the picture, and the cleverness of how it uses its cost-effective budget, the plotholes are so supermassive, they derail the flow at every opportunity. i won't even detail them here because they're all so blatant and numerous.<br/><br/>So I appreciate this film, I appreciate Peele's gonzo Black Mirror but bonkers vibe, I appreciate what he's trying to do. It's no Get Out, but it's a well shot flick with a genuinely tremendous performance by Lupita Nyong'o, it's oscar-worthy, it's deeply scary, it's clever and dedicated.<br/><br/>Us has got an Alexa gag that works, a Shaun of The Dead-worthy conversation about kills in the car, and a scene involving a remix of I Got 5 On It that's an elegant and beautiful and memorable and ballsy scene, one of the best.<br/><br/>So Us is a good ride, it's a fun horror, horrific, tense, surprising - just don't look at the nuts and bolts that hold it together. And even though I called the twist at the very start, I'd still re-watch this film in the hope that I'm able to 'get' it better next time."

"andyfindlay","9","3","6","4 April 2019"," 2019 horror to beat
","This second outing for director Jordan Peele has taught me many important thing about this sophomore filmmaker. This man did not get lucky with 'Get Out', he is no one hit wonder. Peele could have easily signed his name onto the list of directors who make one acclaimed film and never recreated that success and followed with several weak films. This is in no means the case. Equally as importantly he is no one trick pony. This is no 'Get Out' repeat. These are two wonderfully different films. Both at polar opposite sides of the genre. I was almost hoping to narrow down Peele's style of filmmaking from this horror, but both outings are gloriously different and completely unique, I am still as clueless as I was before. Peele is swiftly forming himself into a true master of horror and he is here to stay, so if I was you, I would sit back and watch this master at work.<br/><br/>There is a thin line on identifying whether 'Us' is a horror or a thriller, it heavily play into both genres and is a very strategical blend of the both. On one end, the thriller aspects of the film are executed perfectly. The story itself is ingenious, somewhat predictable and unsurprising, but so well written it doesn't matter. The horror aspects are strong, and this is one of the main features that makes this so different to Peele's 2017 hit. Tension is built on superbly, throughout the second and third act it is never dropped. It has the true edge of your seat, nerve shredding tension I so harshly craved from this. One aspect to the horror side of this story I truly adored was the hard slasher vibes littered throughout the second act, it almost felt like a more tense version of 'Scream'. I was in my element.<br/><br/>Having such a reliance of slasher themes did mean the second act did rely on gore factor. The story did take a back seat for a large proportion of these scenes. This benefits the story wildly, by fitting so much in to the story within the first half and hour and the last half and hour, it allowed for a large section for Peele to go full horror on the story, and he goes wild but remains admirably sophisticated.<br/><br/>Relentlessly the cinematography is breath-taking along with wonderful production values. A match made in heaven and undoubtably benefits this watch even further than its exemplary story. The visuals aided the sustained tension, by getting up close and personal with characters really forced the heart pounding pressure on the audience, each and every time you can feel exactly what the characters feel. Each scene is shot beyond perfection and without a question the least critique worthy element to this film. Some shots are highly inventive and the personal feeling that's conveyed due to this is gnarly and really gets under the skin.<br/><br/>Peele provided such richly writer characters and each and every actor in this movie does a faultless job at executed their role. Surprisingly both the younger cast members (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex) excel and give two of the best child performances in a horror in the last decade. Duke is wonderful and Moss is wonderful. The latter is unfortunately underused, but her character is perfectly utilised within the story. No matter how much praise is worthy for the other cast members, no one compared to Lupita Nyong'o. A powerhouse of a performance, she shines and glimmers with perfection, one of her two roles transcends despair and the other is nail bitingly intimidating, both roles are played so different, the talents of Nyong'o go undoubted and leaves you with endless desire to see her take on more roles like this. This is easily comparable to Toni Colette's performance in 'Hereditary', but much like that, unfortunately will most likely go unnoticed by all major award ceremonies.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Peele's previous endeavour can't be helped, and on the most part could be the one thing that harms the reception, however, I can firmly state and in full awareness I will be in the minority, 'Us' has the edge over 'Get Out'. With nerve shredding tension, perfectly executed character and a doubtless conformation of the formidable talents of one Jordan Peele, this is the horror film to beat in 2019."

The idea of clones is obviously not original, but the story and concept here are. It's nice to see a film that's not a remake, sequel, prequel or looking to be part of a multiverse.

"ericatrenise","9","3","6","29 March 2019"," Great Movie!
","I absolutely loved this movie. The plot twist was amazing. I love how complex this movie is. I feel like people who left the theater feeling confused went in with a mindset that the movie was going to be straight forward but it's not. This is a layered psychological thriller. It's not simply about a family being terrorized by their clones. It's about social issues like discrimination and being fearful of something that's no different than you. I will say that I have questions about minor details but knowing the answers to my questions still wouldn't change the message in the movie. We as a society are used to horror films like ""Scream"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Texas Chainsaw""...where there's a killer and a victim and that's the movie but in the movie ""Us"", you have no clarity on who to root for and that complexity is what I find brilliant."
"darthMisaskernew","5","3","6","29 March 2019"," Made no sense.
","Get Out was okay. Like I enjoyed it, had good suspense towards the end and had some top notch acting but it was no Best Picture nominee (if A Quiet Place, Tremors, The Thing, Dawn Of The Dead, They Live, and Evil Dead 2 didn't get BP nominations then neither should've Get Out) but overall I thought it was pretty good. I'd say Daniel Kaluuya's Oscar for best actor was the only that truly deserved a nomination. But I was fairly excited to see Us since I heard it was made on a much bigger budget, was about 30 minutes longer than Get Out, and was supposed to be a psychological horror akin to The Shining. So I saw it and while I liked it I probably liked Get Out more. So the acting is again very good and the cinematography is great (same genius who did It Follows) but the story just didn't make much sense. So there have been these random clones living underground for decades just eating rabbits? The explanation really didn't make much sense. Do these clones mirror people's actions or not? Are their personalities the exact opposites or the exact same? All of this stuff just changes back and forth. I thought there would be some clever scenes of them using their own weaknesses or strengths against their clones, but that only kind of happens one time. And the twist at the end really made no sense. So she just forgot her entire past? Also, the movie has VERY inappropriate bouts of random humor. Like people said Get Out was too funny but that movie only had like two funny scenes. This movie however has random prat falls and people going ""lol girl say wutttt????"" like there's an entire scene were a person is trying to call the police but her Siri mistakes her command for an Ice Tea rap song with tons of swearing, so as she's being violently murdered it's just blaring a random goofy gangsta rap song about being black or whatever. It makes no sense. Imagine if they started playing 'Rock Lobster' during the ""here's Johnny!"" scene in The Shining, or if they played James Browns' 'I Feel Good' during the blood test scene in The Thing. Just...why? Get Out was never that obnoxious. Actually this movie makes me appreciate Get Out alot more because that film actually made a lot of sense and was short. This one doesn't. But on the pluses it does look very nice and some of the moments are very intense. It looks very nice but I wish the script made more sense."

","There's an interesting 30-60 minutes in Us focusing solely on the family, but unfortunately it was weighed down by a whole lot of other stuff that accomplished nothing but confuse the point of the movie and pad it's running time in order to make it a two-hour feature film. That wouldn't have been so much of an issue had the film actually been, ya know...scary. There are a couple of decent scares but not nearly enough. Not enough dread either, the type of sustained tension i want in a good horror movie. It did have some good laughs, but again, its a horror movie. I want it to scare me. Make me think. Have a good story (and on that note). The plot and mythology repeatedly contradicted themselves, exposing glaring plot holes and lazy story logic. So much about Us made no sense. So many of its story elements and visual motifs amounted to nothing.<br/><br/>The only reason it wasn't a total loss was because its home invasion with doppelg√É¬§ngers premise was so cool and the ending, pretty interesting.

"ddbeuth","2","3","6","26 March 2019"," A potentially good movie ruined by a completely implausible premise
","For the first 75% of this movie, I was tense, on the edge of my seat and intrigued -- everything a person is supposed to be watching a horror/suspense movie. The acting was great, especially as everyone in the film basically had to play two very different characters. The soundtrack was perfect. Then came the big reveal of the underlying cause, and it ruined everything. As my friend and I were leaving the theater, we looked at each other and simultaneously said, ""Wow, that was really dumb.""<br/><br/>Spoilers below<br/><br/>************************************<br/><br/>The makers of this movie would have us believe that clones were made of, well, apparently everyone in a network of underground bunkers, and that the clones and bunkers were there, presumably using electricity and generating sewage, for thirty odd years without anyone above ground ever noticing. The clones were ""tethered"" to their above ground double, meaning that any movement made by the above ground person was mimicked by the clone. This was driven home by showing clones mimicking people riding roller coasters and other amusement park rides during one bunker scene (btw, the actors doing this scene were truly awesome). Nyong'o's ""tethered"" character talks to her counterpart about being forced to be with the ""tethered"" husband and have children because the above ground version of her character married and had children (for reasons I won't get into, this also runs contrary to the premise). The son even uses this property to dispose of his clone. Heck, the stated reason for the clones getting all stabby was to ""untether"" themselves from their above ground doubles and be free. In other words, one of the basic premises of the movie was that the clones didn't have much, if any, free will when it came to how and when they moved.<br/><br/>That said, the film doesn't even attempt to explain how the clones were able to avoid the ""tethering"" when the time came to get all stabby, i.e. the above ground people, who the ""tethered"" clones had to mimic, weren't running around stabbing people, so how could the ""tethered"" clones do so?<br/><br/>I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for pretty much anything as long as the writer sticks to his premise. Here, all the action in the movie was counter to the stated premise, which, in my opinion, ruined the whole thing.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a minor point, the tethered people apparently survived in the bunkers after the scientists abandoned the experiment by eating rabbits. However, despite there being bunnies all over the place in the bunker scenes, there was never any sign of anything the bunnies could eat and no plausible means for the ""tethered"" clones to acquire such.<br/><br/>Another minor point, but every clone shown during the stabby part of the movie had identical scissors. Where could they possibly have gotten them? Are we supposed to assume that the scientists who abandoned the clones also left behind millions of scissors?<br/><br/>Finally, I'm not going to ruin the ""big"" twist at the end, but it was completely predictable and, although the music and the actor's facial expressions indicated that I was supposed to be freaked out in some way by it, it was of absolutely no consequence and changed nothing.<br/><br/>In short, great acting, great soundtrack, awful writing."

"BrentKnowles","5","3","6","26 March 2019"," Sophomore Slump from Peele
","I haven't felt this disappointed by a film in a long time. Jordan Peele is one of the best new directors/screenwriters in Hollywood, but ""Us"" will not be remembered as one of his finest.<br/><br/>The film starts out promising enough, with a terrifying opening scene on the Santa Cruz boardwalk where a young Adelaide Wilson sees her doppelg√É¬§nger in a creepy funhouse mirror. As an adult, Adelaide Wilson (played by the amazing Lupita Nyong'o) has been traumatized by the experience but has told no one. Returning to Santa Cruz with her husband and two children, she begins to see strange signs and coincidences (the number 11, frisbee patterns, and other ""symbolism"" repeated ad nauseam) that make her feel unsettled. Eventually, a creepy family that looks exactly like her own shows up in front of the families guesthouse. The resulting home invasion and chase scene by the evil doppelg√É¬§ngers is extremely terrifying and the absolute peak of the film, with Jordan Peele mixing his mastery of humor, suspense, and terror. One scene in particular, involving the song ""Good Vibrations"", Tim Heidecker, Elizabeth Moss, and their evil doubles, is perfection.<br/><br/>However, the film falls flat on its face in the third act when it nearly goes full zombie film, starting with the painfully clich√É¬© scene of a news report depicting widespread panic throughout the United States. Peele then felt the need to explain the reason for the doubles, and the explanation that follows is so uncreative and silly, that it reaches mid-career M Night Shyamalan levels of absurdity. The concept of the ""tethered people"": underground doppelg√É¬§ngers that follow every single person below the USA in tunnels/sewers and re-enact their exact movements for some unexplained reason is simply asinine. The fact that Peele had to start the film with text explaining that there were hidden underground tunnels all across the USA to make his concept believable highlights its own flimsiness. In fact, I haven't seen such a laughable concept/twist since ""The Happening"", and you could feel the air being sucked out of the theatre as the explanation unfolded.<br/><br/>The final ending twist, that Lupita's Adelaide Wilson character was actually one of the underground ""tethered"" people and switched with the real Wilson in the opening funhouse scene, was creative but it came too late and followed too much nonsense for it to be effective. Had Peele omitted the concept of the ""tethered"" people or found a better way to explain it, he could have landed the twist ending and made a more effective film.<br/><br/>With ""Get Out"", Jordan Peele broke horror film conventions by creating something that was not only very original but also a brilliant modern social commentary on race relations in the United States. With ""Us"", the results were neither original nor brilliant. The outcome is an average film that is derivative of older, better, horror films and shares more in common with the worst of M Night Shyamalan's career.<br/><br/>I have faith in Peele as a director/screenwriter, and I know his best work is yet to come. But for the moment, ""Us"" is simply a result of growing pains after a highly successful debut film."

We are given ""Us"". A family goes to the beach for a trip and are soon accousted by a group of doppelgangers that resemble themselves. Lupita Nyong'o (the worrysome mother with a tragic memory from her youth about the nearby boardwalk) , Winston Duke ( the loose father who provides welcome if sometimes unnecessary humor), Shahadi Wright Joseph (very talented young teen actress) and Evan Alex (pyro mask wearing young son) also play their opposite selves , mostly mute. Lupita proves again that she is an immense talent.<br/><br/>The true star of the show is Peele. I see alot of Kubrick and Hitchcock as Peele uses music and light to set the tense creepy mood.

You can see alot of Easter eggs throughout the movie (Jaws t-shirt, vhs of C.H.U.D.) , some are more of clues than eggs. I cannot wait for what he gives us next.
I didn't want to give anything away as there are a lot of surprises along the way.
This is a thinking man's horror for sure. I myself pondered on it for days after. See it, spread the word."
"Equalizer16","8","3","6","25 March 2019"," Fear Yourself
","When the Wilson family arrive for their holidays in Santa Cruz, father: Gabe (Winston Duke) is pumped for the family fun, but mother: Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) feels sceptical for their peaceful vacation, as a past trauma seems to be haunting her. When night comes, another mysterious family appear outside their house, who begin to terrorise the Wilson family, but appear to be a set of doppelgangers carrying very lethal scissors.<br/><br/>Fresh off his Oscar success with Get Out (2017), Jordan Peale cements his course for the horror genre in a new complex episode. Coincidentally being the new host of the upcoming revised Twilight Zone series, Jordan Peale directs an ambitious original tale of terror wrapped in its own dimension of mystery. The notion of the danger coming after you being yourself is a creepy concept, and Peale takes this into a gripping thriller opening up to a fascinating reality.<br/><br/>Taking a more joyful embrace of the horror genre, Us goes full out to scare, disturb and shock. The nightmare beginning with a classic home invasion is familiar territory but patiently frightening. The doppelgangers' lack of movement and intimidating stillness is enough to send shivers, accompanied by their overarching grins; we know that they not carrying those scissors to offer a free haircut. Praise be given to chorography throughout the film for its constant parade of sinister, embodied beautifully by the cast, especially to Evan Alex who plays Jason and his doppelganger Pluto in a feral animalistic physical performance. Even one moment for me during the final climax matched a perfect note of sound and movement, tense but like a ballet.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o carries a fearsome energy all the way, encompassing the victim of terror as well as the terror itself. A magnificent staple of double identities, Nyong'o is unstoppable in both roles, a strong heroine but unnerving villain (but which is which, Peale suggests). Winston Dukes brings the relative breather in the mist of the horror, offering a frequent variety of comical lines, and humorous moments. Peale wants us to enjoy the experience as well as dread it at times. Even Elizabeth Moss's presence is well judged for the scares.<br/><br/>Although stating clearly that this one is not dealing with race issues, Peale continuous a political engagement through an expressive exploration of horror. The scariest thing in the world can be ourselves. An ambiguous statement, but Peale leaves enough blank spaces for this thesis to be interpreted for ourselves. As the title implies and a later a cut-throat line of dialogue: ""We're Americans"" brings clear to the table the ideas that Peale wants to address. With the current state of America, Peale wants to invert some challenging ideas on where a sense of position, identity, and social divide stem from; not all explicitly explored. More subtle then Get Out, Peale again holds up a mirror but really hands it to the audience for what is it they are seeing. It may be confusing, but Peale's efforts are a skilled practise of cinema and genre.<br/><br/>Jordan Peale's new nightmare is an impressive and exhilarating watch, definitely one to come for the fun and fear, but also you're in for an intriguing new socio-political study, along with a few laughs now and then."

And it is not because it did not have jump scare or other tropes, in fact, it had quite a few of those. Every time they built up to a tense situation, one of the characters would say or do something goofy and it would kill the whole vibe. I was in the cinema hall and a lot of the time I and others were just laughing at scenes. If this was meant to be a horror spoof, then maybe it had something to it, but then it was not mounted as such. It left me very confused. Also, all the subtexts that people are reading into it, I did not get any of it. It would be very pretentious if I just had to come out and say ""yeah, it's an awesome movie"".

The ending was predictable from the start and offered little in a cohesive blend between the past and present scenes oddly interspersed throughout.

","When I saw just the trailers, it stayed in an ambiguously supernatural territory, and it sparked so much intrigue, imagination, and psychological tension--(What are these entities are and where they come from? Are the counterparts from a shadow dimension that parallels our universe? Are they demonic entities individually assigned to each person from hell? Are they physical manifestations of our own inner demons that somehow severed from our souls?)
...but I was a little disappointed when it went into sci-fi/clones territory and mixed genres. I hate to label Us as science fiction; the movie doesn't outright say they were clones, but it was alluded...and I love a film shrouded in ambiguity, but science fiction requires thorough world-building and the logistical questions need answers, at least before the credits roll. Quantum fiction is the genre where Us should have stayed (think Lovecraft, Stranger Things, Insidious, etc.); it has more leeway for leaving things in the dark.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o was great as always (as was the entire cast), and I applaud Jordan Peele's creativity and sense of fun (which is missing in the industry) and l still cannot wait to see what he comes out with next."

","""Get Out"" was massively overhyped to the point of almost being a deal-breaker for me. It was a good film, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't THE film people were talking about. Needless to say I went to the first showing of this, avoiding all reviews, to ensure it didn't get over hyped too. I went in blind, knowing only what had been hinted at during the trailer and - yeah... I wished I had stayed at home.<br/><br/>The lead actress is fantastic in both roles (good and bad versions of the mother) and the kids do a good enough job too but the father is lacklustre.<br/><br/>The problem I have with the film is it is a short story idea stretched to a long film which just doesn't work. The ending is a mess which you see coming and any twists they put in are also visible from a mile off. One of the bigger twists in the film is so dumb it just raises more questions which serve only to irritate the more you think about it (one which, if answered, means the WHOLE THING is completely pointless and avoidable). The pace of the film is off with a slow build-up to more of the same again and again when the ""others"" finally do show up. I was bored. My wife was bored. People coming out of the film afterwards were also grumbling of the same.<br/><br/>I respect Jordan Peele for doing everything himself but I am yet to understand why people believe him to be something special. He's good, yes. Clearly talented and trying new things but - I need more convincing and, honestly, I'm not sure he will get further chances after this disappointing mess."

"tomholland2016","8","7","20","22 March 2019"," Us lets you see your true reflection and watch yourself in fear!
","Let's get straight to the points, shall we?<br/><br/>The story is so structurally organized that it has its own stance and knows the direction to where it's going. The third act is a bit off the road because there is suddenly a lot going on that ultimately feels rushed but I'm guessing Peele wants to make a difference, something quite unexpected than the typical home invasion film.<br/><br/>Us provides plenty of metaphorical weight and hidden gems that are intellectually challenging to decipher, even harder than Peele's directorial debut, Get Out which has umpteenth of great inner messages. You must be mentally wise to break the codes. Watch out for every scene because all is important to recognize all the little deets hiding beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Horror and psychological thriller films tend to have bad or the most, decent actors but Us breaks the well-known curse by executing masterpiece performances by all of the actors including extras. They contribute to the horror sensation that you've been expecting for.<br/><br/>The twist is semi-blunt as it is half-cooked and predictable. It is that 'Ohh, I figured it out before the revelation,' or 'Another lame horror twist at the last minutes.' And there are more questions than answers provided that all those metaphors and theories you have gained become tangled, and as for you to unravel the mystery, the key is to untangle them and place them back again into a comprehensive understandable story.<br/><br/>Here, the scale of tension is significantly high up the skyscraper. It produces brilliant sound effects and numbers that make us at the edge of our seat 'till the closing credits. The lighting works in terrific mode which creates an ominous atmosphere to add the level of creepiness that is already tingling our spine.<br/><br/>Yes, Us brings some current political issues particularly in America such as discrimination, racism, corruption, injustice, homicide, identity and disorder. Peele transfers these messages so well, they stay true to the rough world we are in now and at the same time, giving us the opportunity to see clearly (if you smart enough) what's happening and make a change for a better world.<br/><br/>Verdict: Like Get Out, Peele's second directorial premise is an ambitious horror film that succeeds in every technical aspect. Us is not for everyone due to its mind**** nature which may leave you gasping for air and think twice of the reality that transcends us."

","Let this sink in: Oh The Horror of All The Thinking This Film Will Make You Have to Do. First of all, Jordan Peele's brand of QUALITY provoked me back in to the movie theater. That in and of itself says a lot to me on a very deep and personal level. As for this being a ""horror"" film, I wasn't cringing at all. In fact, Lupita Nyong'o's performance is so fantastic that I couldn't take my eyes off of her. So, if you are thinking you are gonna be shrieking and cowering in fear, forget about it. With Jordan Peele what you can and should expect; other than the aforementioned quality of his brand is you will get a solid, very layered and thought provoking piece of art that will have you scratching your head and saying to yourself 'oh, yeah, but what about...' far past the cinema's parking lot. It stick's with you, if not at you - ever probing. Kudos for the fine ensemble (most all play dual roles); Elisabeth Moss is also quite a stand out and all of the children. Nods to the editor and cinematography as well. The payoff is fabulous, but it will take some work to do. Just let it set in. Awards season could be really interesting if the film festivals, critics and industry all embrace this film, as they did for Peele's predecessor 'Get Out' - and I think they will. Kudos!"

"msbreviews","8","14","50","20 March 2019"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>First of all, you can read my review of one of my favorite movies of 2017, Jordan Peele's Get Out by clicking its title. One of the best feature-long debuts of all-time by a writer-director who I wish he discovered his filmmaker skills sooner because the horror genre urgently needed someone like him. Peele is starting to become one of Hollywood's most notable people, and he proves once again, now with Us, that his undeniable talent is going to leave our jaws dropped and our minds confused for quite some years. While I do think that his first film is more consistent and better structured, Us is so far the best movie of the year, and I doubt that it will stop being part of that list by the end of it.<br/><br/>The best films are the ones that can transform a 45-min car ride back home from the theater into a blink of an eye. I spent all that time plus some more minutes discussing and arguing with my partner who I saw the movie with. By now, I have a pretty decent understanding of the film's story and of Lupita's character arc, which will definitely leave you extremely confused and mind-blown by the end of the movie. However, I will see it a second time to make sure my ""theory"" aligns with everything else, especially those tiny little details we don't really think they matter when they actually do.<br/><br/>Peele's screenplay is thought-provoking and suspenseful, filled with brilliant character development, and surprisingly well-filmed action scenes. I guess he knows how to do anything efficiently. The chasing scenes are riveting, and the fights are bloody awesome. In addition to this, most of the action occurs at night which requires the director to know what he's doing, so the audience is able to follow what's happening. I never, not once, lost my place during an action sequence. I knew who everyone was, where were they at, and what were they doing. Nowadays, having in mind how actual action blockbusters are being made, this is the best praise I can give a director regarding these type of scenes.<br/><br/>A lot of articles are calling Jordan Peele the ""next Spielberg"" or ""new Hitchcock"". I'm calling him the first Jordan Peele! I would have loved to be the one who came up with this last sentence, but I wasn't ... and I'm so happy about it. It means that more people are starting to plant into their minds that Peele is one of a kind, not one like the other. His trademark close-up shots right in the actors' faces can show and tell so much about a character. Besides that, the actors will have a golden opportunity to show their enormous emotional range, their incredible expressions, their limitless talent ... That is if you are someone like Lupita Nyong'o.<br/><br/>Right after I watched Alita: Battle Angel, I called that it would get an Oscar nomination for Best Visuals Effects, and I still stand by it. Well, I also want to be the first to call not only an Oscar nom, but a Best Actress win for Lupita. Daniel Kaluuya was outstanding in Get Out, but Lupita surpasses his fellow comrade with two (!) powerfully captivating performances. As the original mother, she shows kindness and endearing traits. As her doppelganger, she's scary, menacing, and evil. Two completely different characters with distinct physical and psychological characteristics are no problem for Lupita. She handles them in such a flawless and effortless manner, carrying the entire narrative on her shoulders like it was nothing. She deserves every recognition there is.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, she still received great help from the remaining cast. Winston Duke (Gabe Wilson) is hilarious, and he's the primary source of comedy throughout the film. With a remarkable balance of tones, Peele lets Duke shine in a role that he thrives on. Us can be very heavy and dark at times, so a good laugh here and there is always welcome. The young actors are also great, but I have to congratulate Shahadi Wright Joseph's performance as Zora Wilson. She has approximately the same age Amandla Stenberg had in The Hunger Games. At the time, I knew Stenberg would be an outstanding actress, and I was not wrong. Now, I'm 100% certain that Shahadi will be an exceptional one if she isn't already.<br/><br/>Technically, I already wrote above how talented Peele is. From his seamless ability to film action sequences in the dark to his brilliantly-written screenplay, he nails almost every aspect of his movie. The score beautifully accompanies the narrative with cool, rhythmic songs when everything seems fine, and with loud, angelically weird voices that instantly change the tone. Flawless editing helps hide some nitpicks I have with some exposition scenes, especially towards the end. While I understand that the story has a lot to take in once ""explained"", I believe Peele does so in a slightly too fast monologue that I think some people won't quite enjoy. For me, I would have loved total ambiguity. If they didn't explain a thing, I would have been ecstatic, but I understand the need to do it.<br/><br/>My other gripe with the film is the other family, portrayed mainly by the always astonishing Elizabeth Moss (Kitty Tyler), and Tim Heidecker (Josh Tyler). Thinking about them and their importance to the story, I find that either they could have been better utilized or they shouldn't even exist. It's the middle ground between these two options that bothers me a little since it feels like these two remarkable actors, especially Moss, were left aside too much. They are indeed relevant to elevate the story as a whole, but I still wish they were explored a bit better.<br/><br/>Sadly, I think audiences will like Get Out more, even though Us has more of the horror genre's traits than the first. Not only due to the story being more comfortable to follow and ultimately understand (some people actually left my theater way before the end ... shame on you!), but also because it has a definite ending. Unfortunately, people don't really like to think about a movie after it finished, so if it has some sort of open-ending, they're going to be mad. That's what happens if you go into Us expecting a cheap horror film, filled with cliche jump scares, and hollow characters. This is not a scary flick. It is a horror movie, and a phenomenal one. In case you want a simple, spoiler-free advice on how to approach the film's story, I'll leave just one small sentence after my rating.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele is one of a kind. He is not like anyone else. Once again, he offers a thought-provoking, deeply layered, and incredibly suspenseful narrative. Captivating and entertaining from beginning to end, with no misstep along the way. Technically seamless, with his emotionally-driven trademark close-ups on the characters faces being a standout. Lupita Nyong'o delivers what I believe it's her career-best performance(s), which should grab her not only a bunch of award nominations, but wins as well. Brilliant cast, tonally well-balanced with hilarious comedy, and filled with excitingly scary action sequences.<br/><br/>Us does not have a single interpretation. My perspective is not right or wrong, it's just my point of view. It's one of those movies you can watch time and time again, and each viewing will give you another insight that you missed before. However, I do think that what happens at the very end, it's true, and I have more than enough hints throughout the film to sustain my opinion. Despite some minor issues/nitpicks, it's undoubtedly the best movie of 2019 so far, and I highly doubt it will be out of my Top10 by the end of the year. Thank you, Peele, not only for giving us great horror films, but for being yourself. Go see it!<br/><br/>Advice: focus on the boy's actions, and how he reacts to everything he sees or does."
"alexd-83603","10","6","17","24 March 2019"," A glorious film characterised by cinematographic finesse and a powerfully riveting plot line
","Us is a film perfectly blended with impressive cinematography, all the frights you'd expect in a horror, plot twists that carry true significance, parallels and motifs concerning our real world, and deep philosophical questions. Jordan Peele has delivered quite simply a masterpiece, putting together a story that actually has some real substance to it by delving into areas concerning themes of class divide, personal agency, manipulation, and moral philosophy. It is in such juxtaposition to the clich√© and typical storylines we have too often been exposed to; one is actually left captured and stricken by awe as the film unravels, against a backdrop of an unparalleled level of nuance regarding Easter eggs and symbolism. The rollercoaster of emotions vis-√°-vis one's stance and feelings towards the characters is also so unique to this film.<br/><br/>On other fronts, the cast were quite brilliant, especially considering they all multi rolled with their respective doppelg√§nger counterparts. The score was equally fantastic, adding further to the impeccable way the film was shot.<br/><br/>It's rather sad to see this film be criticised for it being ""confusing"" or ""rife with plot holes"". For whilst I can understand why some people may struggle to absorb the deep implications on the structure of the story by these aforementioned plot twists, this can't be a considered flaw. It just means, quite starkly, that it's too well made and intellectually stimulating for the average Joe. Without sounding harsh, one does require the necessary mindset to appreciate this film. Black Mirror perhaps would be a good check concerning one's compatibility in this regard.<br/><br/>Overall, Jordan Peele has done a splendid job (only makes the anticipation for The Twilight Zone's reboot stronger). The movie takes flight and doesn't look back. A serious mark has been made on this sub-genre. Superbly done."

","The movie titled 'Us' is best described as a psychological Thriller / social-conscious commentary horror (I kinda made this one up, but more on that later) film. This film is so beautiful due to its use of color, music and camera angles that hold symbolism. The cinematography is brilliant! Themes in the film are actually quite revelatory and cause one to think about (U.S) society as a whole. There were symbolic moments in the film that made me want to scream out ""I get that reference!"". All actors do such a fantastic job and they each are believable on screen. Lupita Nyong'o is as stunning as ever, and Winston Duke is also great. They have such good on-screen chemistry (probably from the time they spent together on the set of 'Black Panther') and make for great leads. The child actors Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex are two examples of excellent child actors. They have some key moments in the plot where they truly shine, and they actually are smart horror movie characters. In fact, this is one of the smartest horror flicks ever made. The main characters/protagonists use their common sense for the most part and they react to the situation like an everday person would, and I found myself rooting for them, heart racing all the while. Jordan Peele has done it yet again! First there was 'Get Out', and now 'Us'. I smell a few Oscars and Golden Globes in this movie's future. I always knew Jordan Peele was brilliant ever since his time on Key & Peele. He knows how to weave plot lines and connect them to real world issues. When you watch and figure out what the themes in the film are, it will scare you because it is a commentary on all of us (ha!) It tries to tell us to take a look in the mirror if you will. That is why I called this a social-conscious commentary horror. I don't want to spoil aby of the plot so that you fully enjoy the experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention the music! The music in this movie actually matches what is happening on screen at times. The I got 5 on it remix in this movie is awesome, and so is the opening theme. The soundtrack is so chilling and awesome. I highly recommend watching this movie! It is a labor of love, and I enjoyed the ride.<br/><br/>P.S. I totally want to wife Ms. Lupita Nyong'o! She is truly beautiful, and also a tremendous actor and talent!"

So I was concerned - even with a pitch perfect trailer - that Get Out could have been a fluke.<br/><br/>After watching Us, I can now confirm what I was hoping for: Jordan Peele's is the 21st Century Alfred Hitchcock. His direction is gorgeous, with clever breadcrumbs of foreshadowing. His writing is smart, fun, and thrilling all at once. Peele is a master of his craft, paying homage to other classics of the horror genre that inspired this latest social commentary.<br/><br/>And the cast is stellar - Lupita N'yongo is perfection leading a cast of greats.<br/><br/>I guarantee, this is a film we will talk about for years to come.

","""They look exactly like us. They think like us. They know where we are. We need to move and keep moving. They won't stop until they kill us... or we kill them."" Adelaide (Madison Curry)<br/><br/>You thought Jordan Peele's Get Out was a smart person's horror film; well his Us is even better because the intelligent themes are there, but the horror elements are amped up, quite reasonably I'd have to say. A sweet family is terrorized by its doppelgangers, who seem to represent the dark side of themselves and humanity.<br/><br/>The thrills are more than the usual horror tropes like jump scares and scary rooms. Each character must face his twin and fight it as if his life depended on it, and it does. When the opening scene has young Adelaide strolling away from her parents at the Santa Cruz beach into a fun-house hall of mirrors, you know she will face her twin, Young Red, and be forever changed for that brief 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Writer Peele lets the growing family prosper slowly until the twin family arrives, when baseball bats and fireplace pokers can do only so much to dispel those creatures. One of the nice touches is that the good guys can be effective against the home invaders but only with cunning and a ton of courage. As with most of this genre, no creature dies easily or quickly.<br/><br/>If like me, you take your horror lite, in Us is plenty of small asides that give a chuckle and also add to the suspense. When dad (Winston Duke, physically resembling Tyler Perry and Jordan Peele and therefore likeable if not at times schlubby), comments that mom has just left the car, the dark humor is that she's left to find one of the twins and armed only with the now iconic scissors. We want to tell her not to go there alone because we know the tradition of a loner going into a forest.<br/><br/>As for star of Us, mom Adelaide/Red (Lupita Nyong'o) kicks butt most of the time because dad is debilitated, and women in general are more apt to take over these days. See this excellent film at a time of year when we could have expected less."

This movie is artist at heart, and a thinker, rather than your simple, entertaining horror flick. If you expect a clear cut horror movie with racial lessons, as Jordan Peele did with his ""Get Out,"" you'll be disappointed. I feel this speaks to Peele's bountiful creativity... he didn't recreate what he's already done. Go into the movie with no one else's interpretation. The people I've discussed it with took different messages away... I will share that initially leaving the theater I was irritated by not being simply entertained, but by the following morning I was enjoying ruminating on the story and piecing together my interpretation - which was totally different from my radio DJ's! I will agree with some reviewers that Mr. Peele packed too much into the movie, but overall, I enjoyed it, would like to see it again, and recommend it if you are someone who can appreciate an artist scary movie requiring thoughtfulness, and that's fun to discuss with friends."

The film tried to call back to so many classic horror films it started to get muddy.<br/><br/>I didn't hate it, but I certainly don't think it's a masterpiece.

The cinematography allways made it look like someone or something was watching, which really added to the overall feel of the film.

"dfranzen70","9","5","14","24 March 2019"," Peele's best work, at least until the next one.
","Jordan Peele's sophomore effort is simply astonishing. When I first saw the trailer for Us, I was reminded of Walt Kelly's proclamation in Pogo - We have met the enemy, and he is Us. On the one hand, the movie works as a straightforward horror film about doppelgangers wreaking havoc on their ""real"" counterparts, but there's so much more going on. Peele forces us to examine what we think ""good"" and ""bad"" actually entail and whether there can be smidges of both in the same person. Watching this film, I found it amazing that Peele got his start in comedy; he seems like a practiced hand at psychological horror, with layers upon layers that will definitely put your brain into hyperdrive. And anchoring the whole thing, with two smashing performances, is Lupita Nyong'o, one of the best actresses of her generation. Us is a powerful film that makes forceful statements about what it means to be a human, an American, a male, a woman, and/or a have-not. The cinematography is surreal (watch out for the house of mirrors!), and the Peele expertly juggles the light and dark tones throughout. This is a masterful work."

So, when a family of duplicates appears on their first night, she - and we - are not too surprised. Horrified, maybe, but surprised - naah.<br/><br/>Certain filmmakers believe their own publicity and early critical success leads them fatally down the path of self-indulgence. Yes, Tarantino, I'm looking at you. Don't snigger, Shyamalan, you're not off the hook. And as for you, Aranovsky... Snyder, come back here! All of you, you need someone to edit you, reign you in, curb your excesses, think things through when you don't do so.<br/><br/>I do hope Jordan Peele doesn't join them although, on the basis of this second movie, he is in danger of doing so. Much of this film is very good, particularly the performances from Lupita Nyong'o. And then we get to the explanation and the shock/twist ending/s.

And then the twist means that it makes no sense at all, twice.<br/><br/>This bit needed thinking through much, much more. I'm not going to list all the many, many things where the explanation simply raised more questions, I'll just say that an otherwise enjoyable paranoia horror with some splatter and some black humour left me frowning afterwards.<br/><br/>There is a very good film trying, and failing, to escape from a film which isn't quite there.<br/><br/>And the husband?

"bdevmalya","8","3","7","31 March 2019"," Bravo.... Mr.Peele
","A huge masterpiece of identity horror & dark reflection on America's past with chilly atmospherics, originality in concept, psychological torment + twists, old-world suspense-building, and one of the best scorings in modern Horror history. 9.4/10. ... A pair of golden scissors. That was all Jordan Peele needed to build hype for his newest nightmare and sophomore follow-up to 2017's psychological race-fueled horror entry Get Out. And it worked. If Get Out was meant to be an appetizer showing glimpses of skill and greatness amplified in the main course: Us is that five-star dining experience we, and the horror genre, have been starved of and craving for years. Let's start with the score since it's so *unbelievably* good. Ever since I first heard that spooky, slowed concerto remix of Luniz's '5 On It' in the trailers and Peele's motivations/classics he wanted to pay homage to from Psycho to Jaws to The Shining to The Babadook to It Follows, I knew it was going to be something different & special. From its staccato-plucked orchestral themes rife with jarring string aggressions reminiscent of Psycho and Jaws iconic themes to its soft-balanced, airy quartet melodies discordantly happy-go-lucky and sweepingly Shining and It Follows-like, plus everything from tribal drums to theme rehashes to even hip-hop, the score is breathtakingly original and disturbing while also culturally authentic and auteuristic. It might not only be one of the best scorings I've heard in a horror film post-2000; but one of the best scorings ever in horror. It's THAT good. The scoring echoes the darkness and effectively-chilly atmospherics in visuals, location settings, and concept. The cinematography is incredible, with strong compositionally-creative shots and innovative camerawork that will make you double-take several times at the artistic craftsmanship on display. The location setting is phenomenal lifting a long-unused setting just ripe with horror potential I'm not sure why hasn't been explored more: the carnival. From its opening scene in the downright-creepy funhouse amidst disorientating mirrors and blue-hued, white-knuckled heart-pounding (that feels positively old-world and almost Hitchcock-like), you are in for a thrill ride that keeps up its psychological horror and identity crisis until the final minute. The concept is breathtakingly original & absolutely brilliant as well: what could be scarier than a dark reflection or evil shadow of ourselves out to get us - a literal personification/amplification of our demons hunting us down in an equally-horrifying and brutal way with scissors? Just like in Get Out, Peele's penchant for bringing back imagination and original flair to a horror genre plagued by endless slasher reboots/sequels is extremely welcomed. The performances and plot structure are equally sensational. Lupita Nyong'o delivers one of the strongest performances in her already-illustrious career as Adelaide/Red, showing serious acting chops and range being able to play both distinctly-far ends of the spectrum so believably (&, at times, simultaneously). Beyond that, there is not a weak link in any other supporting performance either, especially young scared Adelaide in that fateful stormy night, Winston Duke's hilarious Rod-like comic-relief Gabe, and the dark Tethers displaying undeniable skill to play two drastically-different, worlds-apart versions of yourself so convincingly. The shrewd two-way reciprocal plot structure also hits high notes unraveling the mystery and story while getting crazier at every turn as we're through the past and modern day before the two finally converge in the unbelievable joirney. The plot reflects/parallels America's slavery and Native American-genocide past and trying to hide/forget it. Minor flaws includes less screen-time to the tethers which ultimately leads to less character development unlike Get Out where all characters were built with such a great importance that the audience wanted to know more about; on tue other hand.... The concept and so much screen-time of the rabbits didn't help the plot a single bit otherwise-brilliant psych-horror film. Bravo, Mr. Peele. 9.4/10."

Writing this film off because of its narrative issues is completely missing the point.<br/><br/>In this case, it seems to me that Peele was forced to sacrifice a crystal clear narrative in order to stick to his guns and preserve the message he is trying to communicate with this film. The minor plot devices are simply a means to an end. That end being invoking introspection and sparking a conversation about a simple but heavy truth:<br/><br/>We are our own worst enemy.<br/><br/>This overarching message isn't particularly ambiguous (Peele has even outright said it himself in multiple interviews). Some will feel that the message is too overt and will take issue with that. However, the beauty of this film is in the smaller ambiguities that fit under the umbrella of its main idea. A group of several people could watch this and all interpret it in a different way. This is what art is supposed to be and what makes Jordan Peele so good at what he does. Us ultimately communicates its idea in a complex and layered way. It demands multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The theme becomes its most complex when we find out that the Adelaide we have believed to be attached to from the beginning was actually her doppelganger the entire time. This not only leaves the audience questioning who the enemy actually is, but deeply challenges our perception of the ""other"" in a way that is unavoidable.<br/><br/>We tend to be afraid of those who are unlike us and when problems arise blame anything and anyone but ourselves. Earlier in the film, Jason enlightens Gabe that when he points his finger at someone, there are three pointing back at him. Peele uses this classic saying from many childhoods to present this message in a not-so-subtle way.<br/><br/>Us is brilliant in that it forces us to look within ourselves and realize that heart-level change within individuals is the true solution.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the film is fantastic. All of the performances here are phenomenal. Lupita absolutely steals the show. Shahadi Wright Joseph and Elizabeth Moss give bone chilling performances as their doppelgangers. The score is fantastic and haunting. While the narrative may not be as strong, Peele has taken a step forward in developing his craft and has set himself up for a very successful directorial career.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Us has left many disappointed due to its astronomically high expectations. Would it have been a better movie with a cleaner narrative? Definitely. But the story makes enough sense that it should not detract from what it sets out to accomplish. It is well-crafted, thought provoking, and clearly one of the best films of the year so far. Peele has established himself as a pure artist in taking us out of our own world to see it from a different perspective. Us is incredibly relevant to our current cultural climate, which at the end of the day is its greatest strength."

"Gpanther67","5","3","7","24 March 2019"," Peele is 0/2 for me
","""Us"" is one of those films that makes its viewers ask a lot of questions but isn't afraid to answer any of them. Sometimes it can work in a film like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (What is the purpose and source of the monoliths and why does Hal become murderous?) or ""A Quiet Place"" (Where did the creatures come from?) but with ""Us"" the fact that the film never reveals much about the doppelg√É¬§ngers (or The Tethered as they are referred to in the film), their purpose, who created them and how they easily find their originals even though they are on vacation from wherever they traveled from is huge questions that serve as a great source of frustration for me. The film simply throws too many unexplained plot elements and simply asks us to accept them as if we are working with a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces never fit. As far as the film's publicity of being ""the greatest horror film of all-time"" I would ask whoever gave this praise to the film if they had ever seen the original ""Holloween"" or ""The Exorcist"" or even newer horror films like ""The Ring"" or ""It Follows"". These were scary films, ""Us"" never put me on edge or made me jump, not once. I was too busy being confused or noticing Peele's penchant of throwing in humor during the oddest moments. I will confess some of the jokes made me laugh, but it took away from any chance of the film frightening me. One thing that I did pick up on, and that I sort of enjoyed about the film were the many homages, either intentional or not, to many classic horror films of the past. Films like ""Halloween"", ""The Shining"" and ""Jaws"" are cleverly given nods to and it might be fun to watch the film again to find more. The one thing that I didn't really pick up was the social commentaries that people have commented are in this film as well. I didn't really sense that but I have a couple of theories including one that deals with the commercial a young Adelaide watches that plays a role in the ending of the film. Now I will warn you that the film has a huge shocking ending that is fairly predictable if you pay attention, in fact there are many key moments that are extremely predictable. So much so that I could hear other audience members in my theater making reveals the same moments I was thinking them, causing me to believe that Peele really dropped the ball with his script. Where I will praise the film is in its cinematography and its excellent soundtrack, one of the best in a horror film recently. But Peele's efforts as a horror writer and director frankly missed with me personally."

"isaacj02","9","3","7","23 March 2019"," Terrifying and trenchant horror from Jordan Peele
","After his Oscar-winning directorial debut Get Out in 2017, the inimitable Jordan Peele returns with Us, a terrifying look at both personal and societal demons. We are introduced to the Wilsons, led by jovial patriarch Gabe (Winston Duke) and his reserved wife Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), on a vacation to the beaches of Santa Cruz with their two kids (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex). Gabe's enthusiasm for holiday hobbies is unshared by Adelaide, a victim of childhood trauma who begins to feel uneasy after a series of unnerving coincidences start to plague their idyllic trip. Her fears are not unfounded, as the family are soon terrorised by doppelgangers in what proves to be a horror thrill-ride, thoughtfully executed by Jordan Peele.
Peele is a maestro of the genre; he has an uncanny way of knowing both when to play into horror tropes and when to subvert them completely, resulting in a film that grips the audience in its unpredictability. So many elements are combined in Us; there's old-fashioned slasher horror and classic home invasion, accompanied by the suspense and sharp comedy of Get Out. Even more satisfying, however, is Peele's inclusion of underlying social commentary, a subtle satire perhaps echoed in the film's title (are we talking about the pronoun or looking at a critique of U.S society?). Us may lack the deft narrative control of Get Out, but in some ways it's an even more impressive feat of filmmaking, equally thought-provoking and thematically complex, yet more ambitious and inventive. The entire movie is shrouded in a layer of ambiguity; Peele is giving us the freedom to interpret it in whatever way we wish. Some will see Us as more of a metaphor, others as a social statement... many will also see it as simply a gorily entertaining crowd-pleaser and the film functions gloriously even as just that. It's not without the occasional plot-hole, but if these inspire Peele to return to the 'Us-verse' for another film to clear up the gaps, they will all have been worth it.
Us is elevated by a selection of fantastic performances, notable by the fact that every actor plays two roles, that of their character and their throat-slitting counterpart. Lupita Nyong'o is a force of silent determination as Adelaide and oozes steely creepiness as the leader of the subterranean ""Tethered"", Red. Winston Duke's Gabe is the soft-hearted master of the dad joke, yet his twin is wonderfully menacing. The two kids are fantastic and Elisabeth Moss is brilliant as always. In the third act, the film becomes slightly more unfocused, but the cast keep it buoyant with spirited performances.
Visually, the film is absolutely gorgeous, Mike Gioulakis' cinematography making expert use of reflections as a terrifying motif to keep us on the edge of our seats. Homage is paid to other horror classics; an overhead car shot reminds one of the Torrances arriving at the Overlook in 'The Shining' and haunting dance interludes echo of Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan'. Even with this, Us feels like an original product, unapologetically strange and stylish. Michael Abels' score is also a gem, an amalgamation of itchy strings, taiko drums and Satanic choirs. Jukebox choices in certain scenes are also well-judged (let's just say, Luniz's I Got 5 On It will have a whole new meaning).
With Us, Jordan Peele seems to have broken the sophomore curse, cementing his status as one of the most exciting filmmakers working today. It's the kind of film where, with every return viewing, you will notice more and more clever touches that lie hidden in its rich textures. Horrifying, trenchant and unique, Us is another success from Jordan Peele."

"bastille-852-731547","8","3","7","23 March 2019"," Peele Most Certainly Avoids the Sophomore Slump
","Jordan Peele's directorial debut, ""Get Out,"" caught the world by fire, serving as both a major box-office hit and an incredibly acclaimed film. His sophomore directorial effort, ""Us,"" has come with great fanfare, and it certainly doesn't disappoint. Some aspects of it are even superior to such aspects in ""Get Out."" While this is a complex, intricate and incredibly richly layered horror film, Peele's fans will most certainly not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film centers around a family on vacation in Santa Cruz, California, where they are terrorized by doppelgangers of themselves. Peele manages to play homage to many horror films that inspired him in this film, and also crafts astounding command of symbolism and subtext to create distinct motifs throughout the film. While the film does get quite unusual in the third act, as might be expected, its narrative crescendo feels unique and earned (if slightly rushed.) The acting in the film is great, with Lupita Nyong'o as the clear standout--playing both a good-natured yet paranoid mother and her doppelganger. Winston Duke also gives a charismatic performance as the father, whose characterization is similar to someone like Homer Simpson. Peele is outstanding at building up suspense and tension in the film, mostly avoiding lazy jump-scares in favor of genuine dread. While the film is scarier than ""Get Out,"" it's still not too-too-scary, as Peele also manages to incorporate plenty of comic relief throughout. Winston Duke's lines will often draw hearty laughs from audiences, as will a ghoulishly ironic moment set to a well-known N.W.A. song.<br/><br/>The only real flaw of ""Us"" is that some of the film's plot twists are a bit predictable. Furthermore, some of Peele's subtexts run the risk of almost stepping over each other in a way that you would not say about subtexts in ""Get Out."" Much of the film will be open to interpretation and passionate debate among viewers, which is, of course, what any truly great film should do. While the film's use of symbolism and religious imagery might be considered by some to be a bit like Aronofsky's ""mother!"", Peele has clear populist sensibilities and understanding of what audiences are looking for in movies that ""mother!"" most definitely did not. Definitely recommended. 8/10"

Once again, there are sprinkles of clues/easter eggs throughout that you should look out for to get more information.<br/><br/>Although there are a lot of tense moments, I didn't actually find it scary (rarely do for any movie, however) and I thought there was too much humor that didn't fit. I can see it going for a semi-cheesy slasher film tone but it didn't work well. It's eventually revealed to be, at least, a country-wide event, but being confined to a single family gave it less impact. I think expanding it to more individuals would've made it more terrifying. There's also a lingering sense that it played its hand too early.<br/><br/>It is explained toward the end of how the Doppelgangers came to be (which ties in to the whole discussion on racism), but there are some inconsistencies regarding their traits (like what causes them to follow some actions of the ""normal"" version and not others?)"

No doubt in my mind that Peele is a genius, however some of the great ideas were not fully developed in the film ,which left many holes in the film. The acting couldn't have been any more amazing. The cast was perfection. If anyone else was casted for the lead role besides Lupita, this movie would not stand a chance. The chaotic script provided called for expert level interpretation and that's what it got. The plot itself was not generalizable enough for everyone to get exactly the point Peele was aiming for. It's not as simple as ""we're our own worst enemy."".

It reached a point where I simply could not deny this film a perfect 10/10 rating. This level of genius is unparalleled (so to speak). I simply could not believe how many little details Jordan Peele had thought of and included in the film. On the surface this might seem like a simple little horror movie with a twist. It's never that simple with Peele though. Everything is a metaphor and a brilliant one at that.<br/><br/>Peele's style is also incredibly unique and fresh. The way he shoots certain scenes, the camera angles, the character looks, the set designs, the choice of music (particularly brilliant and important in this film) to name a few. In only his second film he has distinguished himself from every other filmmaker. Quite amazing when you think about it like that.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't interested in all that jazz and just want to watch this as a straight up horror film and not think too much about it, you're still going to have a great time. This film is genuinely creepy for the majority of the runtime. I think that would be a shame though.

"cruise01","10","8","28","23 March 2019"," Jordan Peele delivers his second horror film that brings suspense, weirdness, and thrills.
","Us (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Us is Jordan Peele's second outing in directing a psychological horror thriller after his first film Get Out. Us takes the audience into a new ground of a horror movie which feels like it is inspired from the Twilight Zone series or the creepy horror thrills from It Follows. I enjoyed every bit of Us which it delivers some thrills, has some humor, and a shocking story that takes it into a new direction. It may not have a settle political theme or message that Get Out has. There is a message and theme about a social class from the people living in luxury to those living beneath the surface.<br/><br/>The plot is definitely one of those were it is best to see without knowing much about it. The plot follows Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family going on a vacation. They reach their vacation home, and head out to the beach which Adelaide is very anxious about. After having a traumatic past when she was a child at that beach. And she went inside this mirror theme park house. When the family encounter another family that looks exactly like them with some strange look and impaired speech. They have come across their doppelgangers that are out there to kill them. Unless they can escape their doppelgangers and survive the night.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele is becoming my next favorite director with horror films. The film has a creepy atmosphere beginning. A young Adelaide at a carnival at the beach with her family. While her mother step away to the bathroom while the father was drunk and playing a whack a mole game. She walked away to the beach with some eerie storm coming from the horizon of the ocean. That tone is what sets for the rest of the film. Even during the opening credits with that music score in the background. It delivers chills hearing it. Then, to the present day, Adelaide is struggling with her past. Her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) is trying to have a good time with the family on vacation. Their teenage daughter Zora (Shahadi Wirght Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex) who is obsessed with trying to start a fire with his lighter. There is a eerie moment when the family is walking on the beach and their shadows are aside of them was just brilliant in capturing the tone of the movie. Also, the song of ""I Got 5 On It"" by Luniz also is played a few times with a darker score. But it works perfectly in the movie. Right after the family is trying to escape their doppelgangers. The suspense and thrills delivers. I would not say it was scary but it did deliver the intense and suspense build up.<br/><br/>There are a couple of twists and turns on the story with the doppelgangers which is best to see for yourself and have your own interpretation. Especially, in the final 15 minutes of the film. The twist will leave the audience talking right after credits roll. Lupita Nyong'o delivers with her performance as Adelaide and her doppelganger. The doppelgangers are by far creepy with their look and the animalistic sounds they make. Which seemed almost inhuman. Winston Duke was also good as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Us is a great psychological horror thriller film. The plot and direction creates a creepy tone almost like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining when the family is driving to the mansion. Except this family is driving to the beach. The film does deliver suspense and thrills that is worth checking out and some shocking weird twists that may have the audience talking."

Although it can't hold a candle to his directorial debut, Get Out, it still packs quite the punch and is a thoroughly entertaining thriller. The societal message Peele tries to get across is not quite as clear cut as Get Out, where right off the bat there are small racial tensions that build onward. Us serves you the message frozen, and it takes a dialogue with a friend or reading a review for you to thaw it out properly.

So many plot holes where do I begin. When you have to have so many plot holes just for a higher meaning in the overall theme it falls too flat.
So, spoiler one...if the evil doppelg√§nger knew there was potential for the real one to escape back into the surface world why in the hell would she return to the city and beach she traded places with her in the first place? Why not get as far away as possible?!
Next, why is the husband so weak and dumb. After seeing they are doppelg√§ngers he continues through the movie as if it's something it's not, like he can't wrap his mind around the reality of what's happening.
Why did the actor make the choice to use that voice? I had to explain what was going on to family members because we had a hard time understanding what she was even saying!
Also, why did she not escape when she was a child or out the doppelg√§nger when they were face to face?! I don't understand why she couldn't escape a place not that hard to find your way out of and no guards or locks of any kind present.
How had no other doppelg√§ngers escaped before in all their years down there? Or no humans finding the doppelg√§ngers down there?
Why surface to kill and then just stand in a line?
So many more things didn't make sense at all!
I get Peele had an overall larger meaning to each and every detail, but when the explanation and the plot holes don't make any sense for the actual storyline ( like how only selectively the doppelg√§ngers had to actually move like their counterparts without choice or only selectively felt what their counterparts felt based on the circumstances) drove me nuts and it ruined the movie for me. If you want to make a big statement write better scripts. The end was lazy and not even thought out enough to be believed in the movie universe. Too bad, I really enjoyed Peele's previous work. He got to pretentious and in over his head with this one and rushed it."

","I was very excited to see this film following the great trailers for it. Unfortunately, the trailers were superior to the finished project. The acting was great and the atmosphere was on point, all up to the last quarter of the movie or so. So we have a group of people who end up finding out that there are ""doubles"" of them that have been underground for years. Some government program had created clones of thousands of people all for a purpose that is never shown. The clones break out of this place and begin killing the original people they were cloned from. For some reason these clones have absolutely zero problem going around and killing all their own ""doubles."" They form some ""human chain"" that apparently we are lead to believe stretches around the entire globe. Even under water. Yeah, that makes sense. There is absolutely zero explanation for why these clones were created or what the entire secret government program was even made. A huge missed opportunity here with a great cast that is let down by a terrible story."

","Directed by Jordan Peele. Starring Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex, Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Madison Curry, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. (R)<br/><br/>Writer/director Peele's follow-up to his Oscar-winning ""Get Out"" is a similarly social issue-minded horror film with a heavy dose of character-rooted comic relief; it's not quite as impressive an achievement as his debut, but it proves that he's the real deal as a filmmaker. While vacationing, Nyong'o and her family take a trip to a beach where she experienced a traumatic event as a child; the adage about being unable to bury the sins of the past definitely applies here. Bursting with ideas on race and class (and the privilege and identity attached to both), teasing at the clich√©s of scary movie tropes while giddily embracing them at the same time. Nyong'o is terrific in the dual role of the terrified but fierce mother hen and the...something else; Duke and Heidecker provide most of the laughs. Not all the peculiar world-built incident threads resolve or pay off satisfactorily (or even make clear sense), but as with ""Get Out,"" it's a movie that improves on revisit so that everything can be viewed from different angles with forethought and refocused attention.<br/><br/>80/100"
"david_rudy_lee","10","2","4","16 December 2019"," Great Follow-up and Solid Social Commentary
","This was a film that I was highly anticipated coming out this year. It was one that I was looking into showtimes while on vacation, because I was gone the opening weekend. I kept seeing the trailer over and over again, so I finally got a chance to see it when I still had vacation day scheduled when I got home. I then gave it a second viewing when my girlfriend finally wanted to see it. To get into this, the synopsis is a family's serenity turns into chaos when a group of doppelgangers begins to terrorize them.<br/><br/>We kick this off back in 1986. We see a television screen showing us some commercials before cutting to a boardwalk. There's a family where the mother and father don't seem to be really getting along. The father might have a tad bit of a drinking problem and their daughter isn't talking a lot. When her father isn't paying attention, she wanders off into a hall of mirrors. It is there that she comes face to face with another little girl who looks just like her.<br/><br/>It then jumps to the present where the little girl grows up to be Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o). She is a bit on edge to the summer house she is going to with her family. Her husband is Gabe (Winston Duke). They also have two children, Zora (Shadhadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). Something interesting is that Jason has a mask with him at all times and a bit off.<br/><br/>Gabe wants to take the family to the beach, but Adelaide is completely against this. We know because of the incident that happened to her as a child. Gabe or the family has no idea. He does convince her they go meet their friends there. Their friends are Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) along with their two kids Becca (Cali Sheldon) and Lindsey (Noelle Sheldon). When Jason disappears to use the bathroom, he finds an odd man. This freaks his mother out and they go home.<br/><br/>Adelaide feels something is wrong and when the lights go out, she panics. It is then that Jason informs them there is a family outside. Their lives become a nightmare as they soon realize this other family looks exactly like them.<br/><br/>Now I am trying to go as vague with the recap as I can to not spoil the film. I will state that this film has a quote that starts it off that kind of gives away what is going on here. I've decided to include a spoiler section at the end as I really want to delve into this a bit more. I've seen some people are upset about this, but I personally wasn't. I will admit, I was at first, but then I started seeing all of the signs that writer, director and producer Jordan Peele put into the film. Examples are the infamous C.H.U.D. VHS, Jason wearing a Jaws t-shirt and amongst other things. Seeing all of these things, I have to give him so much credit for putting these little things in that only horror fans will probably pick up on for references.<br/><br/>Coming into this film, I had a feeling there was going to be some social commentary going on. I can actually see that some of my friends won't pick up on them or if they do, they are going to hate them thinking that it isn't really something that is an issue, but I have to say, I think it really deepens the film for me. It is looking at the issue of race; with Gabe really wanting to be like the Tyler's as everything they get seems to outdo what he's done. There are issues of class, which is everyone against their doppelgangers. I don't want to delve too much into this, because I think I could probably write a whole paper on the different issues, what they could mean and things to this effect. It is something that knowing Peele from previous works, I had a feeling we would get and I'm so glad they're there.<br/><br/>Much like his previous film, Get Out, I love that we are following black protagonists. I love that Adelaide is our final girl and I will delve more into that in a bit. As a horror fan, I've heard and made the jokes about who would die out of my friends and even seeing the documentary Horror Noire, it makes even more sense. I like seeing things from a different perspective and a film like this definitely helps there.<br/><br/>To the pacing of the film, I think for the most part it was really good. I'm a big fan of the duality the film gives us of things that happened earlier in the film and then come full circle in the end. I thought the ending was solid, even though I thought the reveal was something that probably happened pretty early on. I think it makes sense for the film and why everything happens as it does.<br/><br/>For the acting, Nyong'o was great. I love how her character is so subdued in the beginning of the film and then we see the fear grow within her. It is when she is faced with saving her children and family that she grows into what she has to in order to survive. She makes a great final girl and if she really wants to keep doing horror films, with her ability, I'm completely for it. Duke was solid as her husband. He brings some comedy which I think is good for horror to alleviate a bit of the tension when needed. Moss and Heidecker were solid as well. I thought all of the kids in the film, especially Alex did well. It can be tough for children, as they seem to be either really good or really bad. Alex and Joseph for the screen time they got were good.<br/><br/>Effects for the film I believe were mostly practical. Something else I love about Peele I've heard in interviews is that he loves the genre and I think that amount of respect is there in the basics for sure. The blood and effects look real which really helps. There is some CGI but it is hidden by shadows which hide if it doesn't look good and really keeps the realism. I thought the effects were good for sure.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film is something else that was on point. It seems to be split between score and real songs, but the ones that are chosen are perfect for when they are needed. I will never be able to hear the song 'I Got 5 on It' without thinking of this film. The real songs title or lyrics fit the situation and the others build the tension. It was very well done in my opinion. I especially like the orchestral song we get during the final showdown scene. It is the same one used in the trailer.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I've seen horror fans being pretty divided on this film. I took a bit of time after seeing it to process and then writing this to ensure I got down everything I wanted to say without spoiling it. I'm normally a guy who doesn't like things force fed to me, but I like that this film wants you to know things with the references. I think the social commentary is good and the acting helps bring this all to life. After the second viewing, I no longer have an issue with the pacing as I feel it builds tension to a solid conclusion. The score and the effects were both really good as well. I personally felt this is a great movie.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/><br/><br/>After my second viewing, I decided I wanted to do this section and delve a bit more into it. We get this interesting interaction between the child Adelaide and Red. By the end we see that she chokes her and then takes over her life. This is interesting as when the real Adelaide shows up to confront Red, she struggles to speak.<br/><br/>I was talking this over with my girlfriend as she was confused as to why Red can talk. I equated it to someone with autism. Because she was above ground, able to get the proper treatment through dance, she was able to get over being non-verbal and learn to talk. The switching is also the reason that there's this uprising. Having Adelaide down with the other tethered, she's able to teach them enough about taking over the world above. She needs to make a grand gesture and when she went down in 1986, Hands Across America was a thing.<br/><br/>I used to have an issue with not knowing who or why these clones are down there. It was this time around that I caught on this was an experiment to control everyone above. The comment about tunnels underneath us that don't really have a use is interesting. I've actually heard we have a ton of tunnels in real life there so I like the play on that. So now with that issue resolved. This is interesting as well that Jason has more control over Pluto than anyone else. I think he's more like Red so that allows him this. Going even farther, he is building a tunnel on the beach and he's wearing a Jaws shirt. I took this as the shark comes up under people.<br/><br/>The last thing is to go a bit deeper into the references. Jeremiah 11:11, which is the sign that the homeless man is holding up is 'Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them.' This describes what Adelaide's master plan is with Hands Across America. There's also the C.H.U.D. case which is Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers. These people aren't cannibals, but the rest of it fits. I also believe the A Nightmare on Elm Street box is referencing when Gabe wants to set up booby traps like Home Alone. Nancy does in that film."
"FilmBuff0409","2","2","4","24 November 2019"," What a cringe fest
","This movie was so bad. I really don't have words for how I feel after watching it. None of it made sense, this director thinks he's something he's not because people liked his first film (which I also did not enjoy). There was absolutely no common sense, a few examples are<br/><br/><ul><li>when the woman is told to cuff herself to the table, why not cuff yourself to the leg so you can slide it off and free yourself? Rather than actually trapping yourself. And when she's reaching for the fire hook she couldn't just drag the table? She had to pick it up with her foot? Hmm. And if the hook broke the wooden bar so easily why could you not do it yourself?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when her face is being pressed into the table and the glass starts cracking, I'm sorry but you would suffer brain damage before the force would be enough to crack a glass table.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when the person stabs the car window with scissors and they go through the window, there is absolutely no way in hell that that is possible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when the young girl is running away she runs right in the middle of the street in perfect light, common sense would be to get off the road and out of the streetlights? And when the 'twin' finds her the girl lays on the road. SHE ACTUALLY LAYS DOWN to look for her. That's not a good position to be in if you have to run suddenly. Good way to get yourself killed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the young girl when she's in the neighbours house walks through the hall, not looking around at all. If there are people hunting you you'd better look all around you.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when the daughters twin is on the car and it stops suddenly, the girl flies backwards into a tree, a 3 year old could even tell you that in that situation you would fall forward, I couldn't believe the stupidity of it. And I'm a fan of the Scary Movie series.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The mom 'twin's' voice made me laugh out loud at how bad it was.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on all night about how awful this film was, but I'd sooner just forget about the whole ordeal. I will say that I did like main plot idea (until the half assed explanation at the end that made no sense). I really wanted to like this but every 5 minutes I was shaking my head in disbelief at the utter stupidity of the characters. Elisabeth Moss put your talent to better use next time."

"Olicosmic","9","2","4","20 July 2019"," An excellent horror film that's both fun and dark
","(I give this an 8.7/10, but a 9 is fine, I guess)<br/><br/>After absolutely loving ""Get Out"", it was clear that Jordan Peele is not just a comedic actor and writer, but he's also an incredibly and shockingly gifted director that can make some horror filled gold. This film, thankfully, continues that trend, as it is something truly special. That's all amplified by the incredible performances, as well the excellent pacing and atmosphere. All of this helps the film feel alive and thoroughly investing. It follows the same trend as ""Get Out"" in terms of dialogue, as there is a surprising amount of thoughtful humor that always works, while also having a lot of really good writing in it that helps the characters really feel alive. The idea for this film is phenomenal, and without spoiling anything, I'm just going to let you know to be prepared to have your mind blown at the end. This, also, is kind of where the minor problems start to arise. This film, despite it being fantastic, doesn't have much in terms of rewatchability. What I mean is that once you've fully seen it and understand it once, it'll probably be a while until you see it again thanks to how huge some of the circumstances are in this film (I'm being vague to avoid spoilers). It's still a great time that's entertaining, but the lack of ambiguity sort of rears its ugly head, but only a little, because, as I've said, this movie is still awesome. Really, these blemishes are only minor, and don't ruin the experience, as there are things about it you just don't get in other horror films, and because of that, this is still an easy recommendation, and while I wouldn't say it's as shockingly amazing as ""Get Out"", it's still an excellent horror film that's both fun and dark."

I was going to give it just one star but in fairness, there was some decent acting especially by Elisabeth Moss but the overall story was meh and plain rubbish. It's a shame because the idea was good, just never followed through on that promise. The choice of music was decent until let down by a terrible X-rated anti-police song, with hideous and hateful lyrics."

","Having seen ""Get Out"" and loved it I had high hopes for this film. While not as ingenious as Get Out, this film is still good. It does have minor flaws that I won't go into because they are indeed minor. There are familiar horror movie tropes like hearing a noise and going outside to check it out among other things. The writing is good, shuffling between comedy and scares, I do feel it was reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode or a clever remake of Invasion of The Body Snatchers but neither apples-only hints.

","'Us' is great display of how tension and terror can be combined with laugh-out-loud comedy and how characters that are nightmarish and unnatural can be seamlessly intertwined with a normal family that are relatable and convincing.

"jg_1977","9","2","4","30 March 2019"," A layered, crowd pleasing horror-thriller
","In Jordon Peele's Us, the writer/director gives one of the strongest follow-ups to a revered directorial debut in recent years. Although it will take at least one more viewing for me to fully solidify my thoughts on Us, it's safe to say that I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to getting to see it again. What stood out to me most after my first viewing is how talented a director Peele is; the man clearly knows how to make every frame pop and add layers to his intricately constructed world. Peele's use of reflections and color was the most impressive to me, although I'm sure more will become clear on subsequent viewings. In addition to Peele's talent behind the camera, the actors in front of it also bring their A-game. Not surprisingly Lupita N'yongo is doing tremendous work as both Adelaide and Red, but Winston Duke definitely stole the show as the quippy husband/father. In general, the entire cast is praiseworthy as they each are playing two characters, that move and talk completely differently from their counterpart. It speaks to how well-acted and cleverly-shot this movie is that at no point could I tell when it was the main actor on screen versus their body double. The only place where I can really take issue with this movie is with some elements of the screenplay. At points I felt like Peele was actually telling the audience too much, instead of letting them draw their own conclusions. Coming off of such a tightly-written screenplay with Get Out, the seams of the story in Us are a bit more noticeable, however, at the end of day, it's still a better written horror movie than most. Speaking of the moments of horror, from the beginning it's clear that Peele didn't want to make this movie be about the jump scares but rather about atmosphere and tension, and in my opinion I think he succeeded. Us isn't terrifying, but at no point did I feel like I was supposed to be feeling terror, just a building sense of unease and at times panic. In general, I strongly recommend seeing Us, especially in theaters, because this is a film meant to be seen with an audience. Jordan Peele has proved that Get Out was no fluke and he has met the incredibly high bar he set for himself."

","Hey Movie Lovers! Just saw ""Us"".<br/><br/>Storyline: America is terrorized by doppelg√§ngers of the residents. In my opinion, the storyline seems intelligent and purposeful but it could not come off clearly to the audience. The audience is left guessing far too much and it takes away from the film.<br/><br/>Characters: This is not a character driven film, you do not form any emotional bonds with any of the characters. However that is the purpose of the thriller, for the characters to remain 2 dimensional while serving the thriller as three dimensional. However, the star cast nails it and I will be very disappointed if Lupita does not win all the oscars for her outstanding performance. üëèüèΩ<br/><br/>Production: The production value is very high, so nowhere does the set, costumes or surroundings overpower the main idea of the movie.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Let me be very clear and say that this movie is never boring and keeps you engaged throughout. It is a thriller so it keeps you guessing with a few great jump scares throughout. The climax and ending seem like unfinished thoughts with not enough for the audience to connect the pieces. You will leave this movie slightly confused but that's gonna make for some great after movie conversations and some great movie conspiracies."

Cinematography is good however, the jump scares are predictable and the expositions are real head scratchers. And as always, the dad of the family is the buffoon. I am glad I didn't know of the director and went in without a bias. If this is what is now considered a great movie, I give up.<br/><br/>I've never walked out of the movie but I was ready to go with 20 minutes left.

For example, what did the ""twist"" at the end where we find out that the main woman was ""a shadow"" the entire time... like she seems nice, so it really just seemed like a way the writer wanted to ""shock"" the audience... it also felt like it dragged on for a very long time. I really wanted to like this movie because I think it had a lot of potential, but it just missed what I thought could have been a good movie. Plus, the end left so much to be assumed. Is it the end of the world? Will the ""shadows"" go back to where they came from? Very ambiguous, which sometimes works well with movies, but here just leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. Overall, would I recommend this movie? No. But maybe if some things were explained better, then I would change my mind."

","The quality of the production values and the cast get the highest praise.<br/><br/>What begins has the quality of a different kind of horror film like ""Jaws"" with vivid color and cinematography and a killer soundtrack plus some of the best actors working today. A disturbing prologue set in 1986 in one of the creepiest places on the planet (the Santa Cruz Boardwalk), we cut to the opening credits with the close-up of a caged rabbit and a gorgeous choral composition by Michael Abels that sets the audience on edge because we don't know where we are or what or why we're looking at it. (And for my money, there needs to be a whole lot more of me asking why, not the director/writer explaining it, taking the mystery and certainly the scare out of whole enterprise.)<br/><br/>There's a remarkable affinity by this director to timing and editing that explains his superb use of music throughout the film. It's sensational. But again we don't need to understand the lyrics of ""I Got 5 on It"" to enjoy it. And as the story unfolds, the more we're told...well, the more has to be explained. There was little need to have a title card about the ""underground tunnels"" networking the U.S. Who cares? I started asking questions like ""So where do you shop for groceries?"" or ""What's the bathroom situation?"" since ""we're flesh and blood just like you""...well, not really.<br/><br/>This is basically ""Night of the Living Dead"" with some clever twists, but in Romero's film we're much too involved with survival than wanting explanations. Yet this cast is game and does well at sticking with what they're given to say and do. I finally just stopped listening to the dialog and watched the actors and ""performance art"" set up around them. There's a solid sense of the conflict within family units that was the most enjoyable thing for me to watch.

","An original horror film for a genre desperately in need of fresh ideas. By its very title, we are presented with an ""Us vs Them"" scenario in a clever way. Instead of nation vs nation, it is family vs family. And what makes them ""Them"" is their otherness. So similar it's frightening, yet so different it's creepy. We see it in the intruders' shared dress, mannerisms, beliefs and goals. They're like us on the surface, yes, but in a very odd, odd way that soon sends shivers down one's spine. Even their living quarters have a certain verisimilitude. But what makes it scary is not just the otherness, but the inventive way in which it's presented, the eerie atmosphere, stunning visual shots, and of course, the malevolence.<br/><br/>The real star is Lupita Nyong'o. The main, the one who, for both families, moves the story forward. She plays four characters really; heroine and villain times two. Her vocal work and expressions as intruder are unsettling.<br/><br/>The only really disappointing part was the origin story. The explanations were confusing, incomplete and detracted from the intensity of the film. It may have been better to either explain more fully or, better yet, for a horror film, remove the explanation altogether.

It had so much potential to become a really great movie until the ending.<br/><br/>The ending may have things explained especially on the childhood days on why the mother became silent all of a sudden and the voice of the tethered being all distorted; but the problem is, this lead to holes in the plot as of the movie focused on how Jason reacted in the ending. This lead to some confusion why Jason became so distant. It's not like her mom is the one with the distorted voice because they were switched when they were kids.<br/><br/>Movie is really interesting but I don't really get what the movie is trying to convey in the ending."

","I had high hopes for this one after seeing Get Out, but it just didn't work for me. After the Thedered family took over the house the scary part was off for me and it never really got the tension back to be honest. I don't even know if this should be considered a horror movie, even though I have to admit that movies in the 'slasher genre' usually fail to scare me all together and I get bored after a while (but that's a matter of personal taste I guess). The idea behind is was interesting but to me the explanation of why those Thedered exist in the first place was way too sloppy for me. Also the fact that Adelaide actually turned out to be Red caused many inconsistencies, but that's already been addressed by other reviews over here. Generally for me the movie was a simple 'ok'. Entertaining but in no way up to the same level as Get Out. Though I have to say Lupita's acting was great!"

","Kept me watching as it was tense, especially at the beginning when you were not quite sure what direction it was going in i.e normal home invasion style, or more supernatural or more sci-fi. Liked the casting and they did well in their roles. Script and humour was good. However, as the film develops it's a bit off the wall with the ideas, but, because they are also not feasible, at all, that immediately opens up more plot holes than enough, that does kind of then spoil the film. I did like the concept a lot, but it hadn't been well enough thought through, to the end. Left far too much obvious stuff unexplained. If you're going to be clever and quirky with ideas the clever only works if people can't pick major flaws in the ideas."

"myrddinfyrch","5","0","0","27 September 2019"," Indicative of a promising future, but not a win
","This is only the second movie by writer/director Jordan Peele. Peele is far better known as the Oliver Hardy half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele""<br/><br/>While Key is off making mainstream car commercials, which doubtless yields a tidy profit, Peele is one of those actors who has both the balls & talent to try getting behind the camera and do his best, rather than just expect congratulations to roll in because he's ""him"".<br/><br/>That being said, Peele's no M. Knight Shamalamadingdong, and in no way like Eastwood (yet). M. Knight might have 'come out of the gate' with The Sixth Sense (his 3rd movie) but he's made quite a few stinkers on the way... Eastwood did better but he's been in the business forever.<br/><br/>Peele's problem, conversely, is that while he's got amazing style & capability, he really kinda sucks when it comes to putting a script together. This is surprising because he's got at least 15 official credits as a writer. It's too soon to say whether Peele will be a flash in the pan, both because he's not got that much officially under his belt and because so far he's sticking with ""BLACK!!"" interpretation. My wife believes I saw his first movie, Get Out, but I don't think I did.<br/><br/>US doesn't rely on jump-scares and has a great suspenseful tone, both of which automatically go on my 'favorable' side. The acting is very decent; many of these were probably in Black Panther and do perfectly well performing here, particularly the heroine. There are two child actors, and both do fine with what are actually complex roles. My guess is that Peele's skill as a writer is the source of some amazingly well-executed lines, scenes, & even vignettes/non-verbal moments (if you decide to see this, remember the line: ""We're Americans!"" and you'll realize what I'm saying).<br/><br/>The problem is that style, scenes, & excellently conveyed creepy mood isn't enough to cover up gigantic plot holes & shoddy story execution. It's possible that because he's the writer he figured he didn't need to go through a better drafting & revision process, but that's simply false. There's some absolutely wonderful concepts, including ""Hands Across America"" & steam tunnels (part of the intro so it's not really a spoiler) but the problem is there's very little done in an effective fashion with them. Likewise, the performances are better than ""just fine"", but there's too many loose ends left with the motivation behind them. It would perhaps be as if The Terminator spent screen time showing the theory of how time travel works without showing Arnold or Reese (Biehn) actually showing up (Arnie's flex vs. Reese's vagrant-in-pain). That fails as an analogy but I can't think of a better way to convey it.<br/><br/>So I'm not pretending to have a solution, but I'm hoping that Peele hires some writers and uses someone else's story. Doing an 'ethnic' horror film was novel, he did a great job of it, but it still doesn't work in the final tally. I think he has great potential and it would be an absolute shame for one of the rare out-of-the-box types to get washed up so early in what could be a great career."

It's very well shot, it has a nice atmosphere, I really like the way Peele uses music.<br/><br/>The film is pretty creepy but when the horror starts the film dips in quality a bit.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really love the cast, especially both sets of parents, all are really funny and have great chemistry.
The kids are great actors too which is great, it's nice that Peele cares enough find good child actors.<br/><br/>The film does have its flaws...
While watching the film at the beginning I just thought the twist was supposed to be assumed, but then later in the film there's some red herrings and then a very dramatic reveal of it, I just found that very weird, if you've ever seen a film ever, you know that if they cut away from something then something happened, ex. if they cut away before you see someone get murdered in a horror film, they're almost definitely alive. So by the end I realized it was supposed to be a plot twist... So that's sorta dumb<br/><br/>Also, there's an out of place and boring exposition scene at the end of the film that semi explains stuff, but like if you're not going to explain everything don't do an obnoxious exposition scene. Because then I don't feel as if it's up to interpretation, I just feel as if you're deliberately holding information while giving other information very bluntly.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like the ending, but they use the song ""Les Fleurs"" which PTA used in Inherent Vice like 5 years ago, so it's all I could think of during the ending, it usually annoys me when films use songs other films used but since this film is very new it annoyed me ever so slightly more.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to Peele's next film, in 40 years he'll be thought of as one of the great American directors with a large filmography full of great films."

I enjoyed working on this movie/""puzzle"" but the ""lost pieces"" left an incomplete picture, which let's face it is frustrating and unsatisfying.

Make that exercise, consider this one on its own merits and not ""tethered"" to Jordan Peel's prior success.<br/><br/>We get it, there's room for interpretation in the subterranean puppet show that emerges causing the conflict of the movie. But you have to provide the elements for the interpretation to be something else than mere display of imagination. That's why the critics rate it higher than the public: it leaves room for them to come up with pretentious and witty remarks about aspects where the film remains silent.
That, however, is an easy game to play. We could talk about the duality of parenthood, the persistence of some primal aspect of the self behind our choices, which watches from the shadow as we betray our essence, or about how the face of the other, in Levinas writings, is the foundation of ethic.
But why would we do that? The movie doesn't give enough elements for that kind of strecht. It just mentions some things, come up with a convolluted science and politics behind the tethered existence, and trusts that its visuals and vibe will deliver the rest.<br/><br/>We get it, and it's an okay film.

From the trailer, you already know that a family is being attacked by their ""doppelgangers."" And I must admit, the backstory is clever. The government created clones of people to see if those clones could be used to influence their counterparts. Ok, that in itself is idiotic, but that's not the best part...here come the spoilers --
The mother is the clone, but she chose to forget that -- she switched places with the ""real"" girl when she was about 10 years old. When the clone married her husband, her counterpart was ""forced"" to marry her husband's clone. Ok, that might be possible, but now for the parts that make NO sense. Both pairs had to children who were EXACTLY the same age and looked EXACTLY alike.

The premise is simple and therefore predicable, with the classic tropes coming thick and fast. That's not to say there isn't enough to unpick in what's being suggested, good/evil, nature/nurture, the existence of a soul, but the delivery felt a bit clunky, largely in part to the second act that felt a bit lazy, bloated and packed with annoying exposition.

","The problem with Us is that is somehow is guilty of both over exposition as well as not explaining anything. That deserves an award of some sort, I think. There's a scene fairly early on the the movie in which one of the antagonists goes on a long diatribe providing a whole lot of telling of information that should have been covered by showing. Show don't tell is the very basics of storytelling, but somehow Peele forgot about it for a chunk of this movie. Then the rest of the movie could have used quite a bit more explanation. This movie is guilty of hinting at themes, but not providing a payoff. There are viewers and reviewers guilty of pretending they understand the themes and subtext of this movie when there really isn't any subtext and the themes lack dimension and aren't far from fully fleshed out. Instead, it's like everyone decided, ""I don't know what this movie is trying to say, but maybe I'm missing something. I don't want to look stupid, so I'm going to pretend like I get it and that it's great."" When in reality, there's just nothing going on in this movie.<br/><br/>My final criticism is that Peele breaks another basics of storytelling, this time a specific horror movie rule. Don't show your monsters too early. When the under-side family is silhouetted, standing above our protagonists, I was creeped out. Then Peele brings these antagonists out of the dark and into the light and most of the fear is lost.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, and had the chance to be great, but it falls far short from its potential.

","Just like in ""Get Out"" - The beginning to the mid is absolutely amazing, but from the mid onward it just falls flat and scatters.<br/><br/>The beginning was perfect. Absolutely perfect.
""Who's there?""
""You-hoo""
Like, come on. Why couldn't they keep it up?!<br/><br/>The beginning-
Scary, heart aching, tension, interesting, well filmed.
The premise is quite good. ""Girl allegedly finds her doppelganger and gets ptsd, years later to find out it was true, and even truer than she thought.""
Her daughter talks about conspiracy theories, something that SHOULD have been talked about a lot more later on and more dwelt in. Alas, they don't in the middle of the movie, something that really makes the film scatter off.
The beginning was truly a piece of a quality horror film.
10/10<br/><br/>The middle-
The movie starts taking itself less seriously, but way less seriously.
They add jokes while being in the most horrific situations, like;
""You can take the boat for all I care""
""Dad, no one wants the boat""
While they are all crying and shivering of fear. Like, come one. You see how silly it is?
I figured out they were going to have to kill their own doppelgangers, because come one it's pretty obvious, and the ways they did it were good and interesting but... The movie lost it's ""scary"". It turned to some action film (not a bad one, mind you) instead of a horror.<br/><br/>As a horror film, it's a 6/10, but as an action/thriller it's an 8/10.<br/><br/>The ending-
The worst part. In short - A bloody X-files movie. I'll give credit to the beginning- They hinted that the tunnels are still being used, but the lack of talk and dwelling on conspiracy theories made the ending fall flat - It came out of no where. A huge twist with almost nothing to indicate about it. Only the text at the beginning, but it's a bad kind of hint. A hint that's literally provided on a silver plate instead of being in the movie itself. Might as well given out fliers with the text before entering the cinema.
No (or bad) hints = bad huge twist.
Same goes for the mother twist- It even contradicts literally everything the dop-mom said, about how she was born in the facility and never knew warm food and all. And they didn't show that she was brainwashed after being kidnapped or got her memories erased, there was no indication for that in the film so it's just bad writing from here on out. I did notice the mother's growling and violent behavior early on before the twist, and I thought to myself ""Wow, the mother's character developed to a protecting lioness!"" only then to destroy the image with the bad twist of ""she was a violent clone all along"" - Something that absolutely contradicts the early phases of her character in the movie.
4/10.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 7 only for the beginning and the potential it had."

","After seeing the trailer, and Get Out, I was certain this film had major potential to actually be scary. Of course I was wrong. Hollywood hasn't been able to present audiences with something truly scary for over 30+ years now. Imagination is long gone. Real fear comes from psychological horror. As we all know by now jump scares are played out and weak. At least this film doesn't resort to those to try and present its own version of horror. I appreciate the effort this film made, so I gave at an average rating of 5/10 stars, but it's the type of film where if you have a minute counter staring you in the face on the screen of your media player you'll be wondering at 1 hour 15 mins how it could possibly have another 40 to go.

The joke of today known as ""mumble rap"" should take notes from the tracks presented in this film.<br/><br/>Hopefully Peele can rebound on his next effort."

","This potentially could have been a really good film, but while it is an entertaining movie, the plot kind of falls apart if you think about. The more the film tries to explain it the less sense it makes. The twist at the end feels tacked on as there was no real setup and it arguably also doesn't make a lot of sense if you go back and consider previous scenes. Some minor tweaking with the plot could have made it better, but as it is, it is still and entertaining film that's worth the rental."

"greg-goremykin","6","0","0","19 June 2019"," I must be missing something...
","The big reveal at the end was no surprise for me, I think the film telegraphed that the doppelg√§nger was actually the mother right from the first scene in the hall of mirrors. And there was just too many mundane things that didn't make sense, like not being able to move a coffee table which a character is handcuffed to (must have been the heaviest coffee table in existence) as just one example of dozens. The whole premise seems too far-fetched with too many rational plot holes. The whole doppelg√§nger Hands Across America thing went right over my head, too.<br/><br/>I loved Jordan Peele's last film, and I guess this one is dripping with metaphor maybe as well, but if it is, it is so opaque to me to be impossible to noodle out. I thought the homages to The Shining were cool, but it seemed that the symbolism existed just for it's own sake throughout rather than going anywhere. The best I could come up with is how modern political discourse has gotten so vile and shrill on both sides of the aisle that we do and say things (especially on social media) that in the not-so-reason past would be unthinkable even to ourselves, so we are our own doppelg√§ngers, though I know that interpretation would be a real stretch.<br/><br/>I still think the film is worth seeing, and maybe all the absolutely and uniformly stellar reviews it got is another lesson that I should ignore the critics and ratings and just watch what looks interesting, but there are such a plethora of good films out there from all over the planet that I need someway of figuring out what to give a try... I guess the best lesson I could get from feeling let down by a film like ""Us"" is to never trust critics completely, and never get my hopes up, but easier said than done.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Peele's next film, I think he's a visual engaging director, but I also hope it's a little more coherent with less fantastical plot elements, where even in the realm of the horror genre there were just far too many unanswered questions and far too many things that just didn't make sense from a practical standpoint. It seemed to me like is so common with many other films after a director has a real blockbuster with a huge R.O.I., that they get maybe too much creative control, which can lead to unintentional self-indulgence (like after ""The Deer Hunter"" as a perfect example). Whatever it was, I hope that his next movie is a bit more like his first big success and a lot less like ""Us""."

"Eric1485","7","0","0","19 June 2019"," Review: Us
","Jordan Peele takes his viewers down a path of suspense and mystery wrapped in an ominous blanket of impending doom for the main characters. Each scene is filled with visual and auditory clues that suggest something sinister is upcoming, even as small pieces of the story are revealed throughout the movie, there are more questions than answers as the plot thickens. ""Us"" is a solid and entertaining horror film that capitalizes on smooth pacing, strong acting performances, and great cinematography, The execution of the story itself stumbles toward the end, as the film relies on a great deal of wordy exposition to explain to the audience what is going on and a twist that raises more questions rather than providing a satisfying answer."
"TuesdayThe17th","5","0","0","19 June 2019"," A real review
","This movie is not bad by any means but it is somewhat ordinary. It DOES have an overall good atmosphere, decent sense of terror at points, and a good score/music. However, what could have been a very good story falls short after about 40 minutes and the rest is basically drag peppered with engaging moments. The movie feels unorganized and like Jordan Peele had an idea he was anxious to get out while he's still hot, but he hadn't thought it fully thru. I read about his story from when he was in college with the underpass so it's liked it was ripped from his very own nightmare, which is actually cool because it is art and it feels like a fairly passionate piece regardless. I really liked the sequence involving the family friends and the reveal of what's down ununderground. It's creepy, and to the right person this movie will be terrifying. I am a weathered horror fan and pursuer so movies like this become second to some very, very good scary movies. I'd really like to see Jordan Peele make an all serious horror film, as it's the piercingly bleak sense of dread that keeps us thinking in silence to ourselves after the curtains close."

So far, everything I've seen from him, Twilight Zone, nothing but politics. Get Out, everything that happened was telegraphed and I was calling out what was going to happen 15 minutes before it did. They said Get out was new, it's been basically done before 100 times but most of the younger people won't watcher older movies so how would they know. This movie was really nothing but ""The Purge"" done a little bit differently. I went into it not really knowing what to expect other than what was in the synopsis dealing with doppelgangers.

"jessica-gonzatto","3","0","0","10 June 2019"," Not up to the genre's expectations
","The latest movie from director Jordan Peele follows down the social thriller path once again. This time, though, it didn't leave me so thrilled. Of course I'd never bash a movie for not following up to its genre. I don't think that's noble or very hard to do, for that matter. But what I expected, from watching Us, was a brilliantly made metaphor with strong characters - much like Get Out, Peele's previous success. In Us, the characters were aimless and generic. Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), for example, was a scared grown woman and mother that after a while becomes a vessel for vengeance and nothing more. Elizabeth Moss' Kitty was also a waste of casting. Her and her family's moments in the narrative were nothing new of what we already expected. I'd love to see some clearer source of criticism there.
The cool cinematography and highly stylized visuals are, of course, all there. Peele's got a style and he knows how to create symmetry. Which is why the progression and atmosphere are so important in his stories. Us, for me, lacked atmosphere, and the progression after a while got sadly predictable.
Peele knows how to work the colors on the screen. But I missed colors on the narrative, as the people from ""down there"" failed to carry a clear metaphor for me. I love it when movies don't show you the perfect way to understanding, but when a social thriller transforms social aspects and behaviours in a thriller, I'm expecting some clearer connections with reality. Frankly, I also expected more scary and unsettling elements. Apart from the lossy narrative, there's some interesting directing work. Different acting techniques from what we're used to, all using the same actors, could be a positive point for Us.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Us didn't really deliver its full potential and it's not my favorite movie of the year by far."

","It is impossible to deny that Jordan Peele is a gifted filmmaker. The cinematography is beautifully crafted, and certain shots make me think of Stanley Kubrick, especially The Shining. Peele certainly has a keen eye for visual elements that contribute to that particularly eerie mood required for films looking to conceive a spooky vibe. Lighting, setting and score all live up to the standard of more finicky moviegoers like myself. This indicates a certain level of artisanship that competes with more seasoned contemporary directors like Nolan and Fincher. So there is no doubt lurking within me that dares defy the notion that Peele is establishing himself as a creative force to be reckoned with. Nonetheless, Us does not go the whole nine yards. The intro masterfully guides the viewer into a suspenseful atmosphere, as a thriller should, but then never really capitalizes on that initial absorption. When the mirrored characters are introduced, you are briefly intrigued, but then they somehow fall flat. They are just not that interesting to watch and comes across as a horror clich√© in their contortionist performance. The acting almost feels a bit awkward at certain moments and certainly not scary. Perhaps that never was the intended effect, to begin with, but then the grand twist is revealed and I feel astonishingly underwhelmed. I honestly can't help but feel a bit fooled by the meticulous approach to the visual aspect of the movie. It does remind me of M. Night Shyamalan's earlier movies, which is a good sign since there is a lot of brilliance within those films. But this also frightens me, as Peele might be walking down the same path as Shyamalan did - towards unnecessary mind-boggling twists and away from sophisticated composition, substance and quality in the narrative and screenwriting."

","I am pretty sure this is the only review i've ever done on Imdb, or the last was so long ago that i've forgotten, either way after watching this movie I had to come on here and set the record straight regarding this film. The trailer looked good, the reviews seemed good, video cover looked intriguing, name of movie sounds good, the last film from this person was great, watched it twice, so was excited to watch this. Turned out to be a waste of time. There is a strong level of what the hell is going on and why and it continues untill the point of for god sake, just get to the end and put me out of my misery. I've never seen such a weird film, weird can be good but it was so stupidly weird it just wasn't right. How this film got such a high rating is beyond me? The big 6ft 5inch husband was such a wimp it was PAINFUL WEIRD and very STUPID to watch. The relatively small wife was the man of the movie in every way possible to the point that it was PAINFUL WEIRD and very STUPID. Somewhere near the ending don't worry, no spoilers, wife enters a building searching for a person while husband hangs around outside literally chilling in a ambulance they use as transport!!! Thats right just hanging out chatting with another person casually while all hell has let loose. This film from 10 minutes in got weirder and weirder and stupider and stupider, I swear, and it did it untill the very end. Plus the twist is vaguely explained in 60 seconds near the end and presented waaaaaaayyyy more questions than answers. And the way the crazy woman speaks is so WEIRD and the noises she makes is weird. Plus the noises and grunts all the other nutters make is just. This film is so weird and so stupid it must be a world record. I know some people will read this and still watch it thinking, it can't be that weird. Well, I warned you all."

The father does not act as one would during the attack which lead me to believe maybe it's supposed to be partly a comedy? No.. that wasn't the case.

","After watching ""Get Out"" and ""Us"", I thought Jordan Peele has a very unique style in horror genre. It can be called 'absurd horror'. I like his style and waiting for the movie ""Ma"" which is also one of his production.<br/><br/>For the movie 'Us', I can say that if you are expecting deeper storyline with more meaningful lines, don't watch this movie because you will see a lot of absurdity. But this absurdity can make you laugh when you are watching a horror movie. Usually, horror movies does not build on convincing stories, this movie was not build on a convincing story too, but Us has a different taste with a hard-to-predict end. If you are bored of watching classic horror/thriller movies, I definitely suggest you to watch ""Us""."
"gregscript","7","0","0","17 April 2019"," Is it rewatch-able?
","In my opinion, great horror films are instantly re-watchable. American Werewolf in London, Return of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Poltergeist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers... all of those are worth viewing over and over again.<br/><br/>I think Us is worth a second viewing to see for certain if the story holds up. After that, I'm not sure if it would be re-watchable at all. And that's not to say there isn't a lot to admire about this film. The unique story, most of the acting (the lead is ASTOUNDING), strong visuals, great cinematography, and a very memorable score help to elevate this movie beyond your standard horror movie tripe.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed many of those aspects, I left the theater with a few nagging questions. Mostly, I was wondering if the entire story behind The Tethered was even necessary. To me, sometimes the horror of a fantastic and seemingly implausible situation is even stronger without much of any explanation at all. Obviously not all horror films can or should follow this path, but some horror movies are better told with more mystery and ambiguity. Too much explanation can ruin a story's full potential and I feel Us came way too close to doing this.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that most horror film trailers end up making more of an impact than the full-length features they're based off of. I believe there's two main reasons for that. The first is the combination of visuals and music. You don't need much more than that to effectively pull in the viewers. And secondly, trailers don't give us much information. What we see in a trailer remains a mystery, which, of course makes us want to go see the film. And that's why a lot of horror films end up being disappointing - the mystery is explained and the plot holes are revealed the more it's dissected.<br/><br/>Still, there's a lot to like about Us. It's different and unique. And hats off to Jordan Peele for attempting something that isn't a ghost movie (yawn), a possession movie (double yawn), or a higher budget version of some shlock ripped straight from the SyFy Channel (I'm looking right at you Meg).<br/><br/>And for that alone, I'm recommending Us."

Character feeling to important to die to soon and miss timed family jokes at the canter of it .
this leads to a disappointing 3rd act where the thoughtfulness of the first act is switched on its head and seems explained in detail to much detail with a twist that seems dump in the scale of the ideas at play and extra out of place.<br/><br/>I really do like the larger ideas of this film with some nice detailing the Jordan do best .But also held back by something so impotent to ""get out"" adduces anticipation.

A young family on a getaway discovers that their vacation home is the target of a bunch of deranged, vicious dopplegangers. There's at least a good formula at work here and there are some truly haunting scenes.<br/><br/>So what goes wrong? The film's concept is never fully fleshed out. The events that unfold are menacing and intense but their origin is never adequately portrayed, and is therefore incomprehensible. You might finish watching this with a lot of blanks not yet filled out. The fact that the film has to explain itself so much tells you how confused and muddled the narrative is here. And without giving away too much detail, the plot's conclusion is unnecessary and radical. It largely renders what is already a problematic film null and void.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would have been a better idea to label this as a thriller because it does have its share of suspense. A horror film, this most definitely is not. It never becomes that. You're more likely to be bewildered than scared, despite the film's eye for detail and a Kubrickian aura in places.<br/><br/>It is a testament to Peele's filmmaking ability that he can make even a flawed effort that is well-acted and full of momentum right up to the closing credits.

"ccamp89","7","0","0","7 April 2019"," Solid 3.5 // Peele steps up his visual craft
","Jordan Peele doubles down on his ""social horror"" premise and manages to considerably expand his craft, though without entirely avoiding the pitfalls of Get Out, his lauded debut. Us is once again built on a clever concept designed to mine the horror from a particular American social tension - this time, class. Peele goes even more off-the-wall with the premise here and, for a mainstream horror film, I admire the degree to which he revels in its outlandishness. The visuals are more unique, striking, and even haunting at their best. It's clear that he spent a lot of effort cultivating a singular iconography for the film and that's probably its greatest success, as many of its images linger. And the social metaphor at the film's heart, while not subtle by any stretch, is a crucial element as it gives the proceedings a sense of weight and purpose, both of which are severely lacking in so many throw-away modern horror films.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a shame, though, that Peele waits until the very final sequences of the film to open things up and delve more fully into the themes. He constructs great opening and closing acts (including the fantastically creepy prologue), but the middle section sags with what's essentially an extended cat-and-mouse sequence that feels too drawn-out. Additionally, though it is less of an issue here than with Get Out, I still struggle with a sense of tonal muddiness. Horror and comedy have certainly been blended to great effect in the past, but something about the execution here bugs me. Peele's making quite a provocative and even experimental horror film here with heavy social commentary and heady themes, but simultaneously seems to undermine himself with occasional shots of low-brow humor seemingly to make the film more palatable. Perhaps it's just my personal taste, but I'd love to see him fully commit to the horror tone in the future; he clearly has the talent to make something truly harrowing.<br/><br/>Solid 3.5/5"

So I'll just focus on one that's hugely stupid.<br/><br/>The 'shadows' apparently are doomed to making the same actions as the 'real' people above, so them staging a revolution is simply absurd. This 'tethered' behavior is shown on screen, and figures largely in the copious exposition, *and* one of the principal characters is killed by invoking this power...but only when it is necessary to the plot at that moment. At all other times it simply isn't happening.<br/><br/>This tethered behavior is the *basis for the shadow's existance*, the entire reason they were created, but it's irrelevant to the events of the movie. And the viewer would have no idea it was even a factor if the main antagonist didn't go on a long winded exposition to explain it all at the end.<br/><br/>Don't know about you, but any movie that attempts to make it's absolute failure to make sense work by having a character explain what you *should have* seen, has failed in every way."

","Where do I start with this one? Based on the trailers alone, it seemed genuinely creepy and I was already excited after the amazing Get Out. I went in expecting this new Peele entry to be extremely sadistic, frightening, and tense. I received most all of these feelings; the film was innovative and mostly fresh.
Peele has a talent for drawing in his audience through exposition and character development; we are genuinely interested in Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) and the traumatic experience she went through as a child. The film starts out extremely creepy with a sense of foreboding doom; this draws the audience in completely. It almost begins to fold out as a psychological drama about trauma and its impact on individuals and their families. While this would have been an interesting idea to explore, the film quickly moves on to the infamous Doppelgangers and their animosity towards our protagonists. I feel at this point, aside from the bloody violence, the film is no longer really horror and ceases to be truly scary. While I was initially disappointed, the film continues to be so well filmed, acted, and crafted, I was willing to continue the journey. While the third act is not as compelling as the rest of the film, it certainly ties in many of the film's central themes and delivers an expected, but effective climax. I am thrilled to see what Peele has in store for us in the future."

1. It'd explain why they live off raw rabbit. I don't even buy that rabbits symbolise test subjects and that's the reason for that random nugget, just WHY??
2. Why they survive doing c-sections on themselves without any medical help - cause if they are ""only human like us"" then what the hell?
3. Why they move in a particularly agile way and seem to scuttle about.
4. Why they live in the potentially very spooky tunnels scuttling away under America without the ""it's all the government/a big conspiracy"" excuse.
That excuse isn't actually explained enough to be a justifiable reason why it was happening. It doesn't even criticise the human condition or America like you might expect, it just throws that out there and leaves it as it is. We're just supposed to accept it being those pesky government folks again doing darstardly deeds. Dah. Those guys..!
Even the idea of them being ""shadow people"" instead of text subjects, is much better. When the woman says ""once upon a time there was a girl and she had a shadow"" I thought the idea of shadow people had a lot of potential, as well.
Why were they trying to control human kind with doubles? Who knows? But also by the end, who cares? There's just too many loose ends and something simple would have needed far less justification than this mess needed.

""Us"", although an okay way to spend some time eating popcorn, was a much more run of the mill style horror/suspense movie. The main premise didn't really make much sense and had no explanation. Any ""twists"" were not that surprising nor did they leave you all that entertained. The acting was fine and there were some neat moments, but overall this fell way below what I expected."

","If you're expecting much from this movie then you will be disappointed. It's just another failed horror movie, with God knows why comedy in it. It's a type of movie when you won't understand a thing (because there is nothing to understand/ care about) , but ""critics"" will say that you're dumb, don't get the deep meanings of the movie and should go watch marvel."

","Great acting, great cinematography. The vibes definitely made the movie feel eerie and otherworldly, I may be overthinking it, but the mix of humor and tension leaves you confused and unsettled in a unique way that really seems to reflect the dichotomy of these tortured shadow people and their mixed emotions. Humor helped to keep it from feeling dry but I was underwhelmed by the end. Thought it would have a more sound plot. The dialogue could have been tightened up a bit too, seemed like I was listening to Jordan peele talking the whole time. Great potential, poorly executed."
"djtroycook","6","0","0","3 April 2019"," Had huge Potential
","I agree with the rest. This movie really had potential, but fell short. I understand that Peele wanted to leave some of the plot to the imagination of the viewer, but it just gets a little too confusing and not entertaining. I wouldn't day it's horrible, but I was hearing people compare this to The Shining. FALSE. The Shining has a completely different tone and sure it has some unanswered questions, but it's really nothing near as confusing as Us.
Spoiler alert... I did LOVE the scene when he shower the tethered following along in the underworld. I thought that was extremely unique and rather creepy.
I saw the tethered as a personification of our sub conscious minds. Peele should have gone that route! Haha"

"TheProteanGirl","5","0","0","2 April 2019"," Unique Storyline But Badly Executed/Directed
","So I really liked the unique storyline, it was nice and all. However, I find the writing was sloppy at best and left more questions than answers.<br/><br/>For instance I find that the way they threw you into the scene with the red clothing people was too abrupt. There was a looming sense of the writers trying to convey an idea but not knowing how to properly. I find that other than the killing scenes there wasn't much substance until like the last 30 mins of the movie to explain what was actually going on and why. I also hate how the explanation part was rushed and the story was left open ended; did she switch with the real version of herself at the beggining of the movie or not? And if so, how is it she didn't remember this and didn't have that ""psycho personality"" she had at the end of the movie throughout? Also, how is it sometimes the clone of themselves in red was sometimes forced to copy their movements (like when the little boy backed up making his clone back up into the fire and burn) but other times they have free will to move and do as they please? If the mother was the clone of the real girl who switched place in the beginning surely she could've made her do things to kill her, but she didn't... Very confusing and stupid these kinds of questions weren't answered at the end.<br/><br/>Also, the rabbits were portrayed as though they were gonna be super important in the film but like what did they represent in the end? The intro too with the tunnels in America made it seem like that would be a big part of the movie but was like a 10 min scene...<br/><br/>Overall, great story but not well done."

The positive things: Good performences ,well paced and very stylish . It has a voice,the directors voice is all out there and I believe Jordan Peele has to be on every persons radar because this man knows about suspense and horror.

"BennyBamLegacy","6","0","0","28 March 2019"," It's Us. Sort of.
","""Get Out"" was ambitious, but success and demand can come sooner than you can adjust to them.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele certainly knows how to capture emotional tension in jet fueled scenarios involving racial or abusive undertones. I am left after ""Us,"" to think that may be his one trick, and that the pony has left the barn. I went into this expecting an artistic experience that would leave me wanting to be creative, or afraid, or anything significant... lasting. As the movie ended, I instead found myself saying ""wow, really?"" While the genre of horror doesn't always set up backstories or tell us why something is happening, this movie is more thriller than horror. The performances were by far the most impressive part of this film. I mean, by far. It is not often you see Elisabeth Moss out acted. She's held her own with Martin Sheen as her father and Jon Hamm as her abusive but conveniently endearing boss in two of the greatest dramas to ever hit the small screen. Lupita Nyong'o was phenomenal. The filming of a lot of the scenes in order to prevent you from thinking about how they filmed so much interaction with themselves was also impressive. But the plot was thinner than the intent. The script did not carry the same gravity that the performances did. I have heard others criticize the comical remarks the husband makes throughout the film in a murderous situation. I found that to be human, and how some real people deal with nerves or fear. The bigger issue, and it is a tough one; the entire movie hinges on a reveal. And without ruining it, the reveal is painfully obvious at the start of the movie. What makes it even harder to buy by the end isn't that fact. It's that the script really debunks it as a possibility. There are scenes between characters that should not happen if the reveal is accurate. Many unanswered questions are left to dangle about the how and why of the doppelgangers. Why is this family the focus of a reveal when the problem is not central to them? It tries to say why, but the theme feels weakly put together. Reveals can work, but the surprise can't feel like you couldn't find the right tinder to light so you get smoke then smoulder a fire you never really started. This movie had great potential. There were some iconic take away's and disturbing imagery. But it is not a masterpiece. It is like the characters in it- two things at once without ever caring why they matter."

","Us ist the next big feature film written and directed by Jorden Peele. After the big Success with 'Get out', 'Us' follows a similar formula for success. The introduction of the familiy and overall the built up for the movie was made really well and leaves you with big excitment for the rest of the film. The score is great and really fits the scenes. Unfortunately the movie does not hold up and when the horror part of the movie starts the tension just drops. 'Us' tries do deliever very thrilling scenes but fails. Everyhing feels slow, the tension was very low and you never get scared that something happens to the charakters. The story is just too easy written. Also the villains are poorly exceuted and more laughable than really scary. Even though Lupita Nyong'o and espescailly Elisabeth Moss delivier very good perfomances the viewer never experience that the events are real. The other actors werde decent and did not really deliver something special to the story. After the ending you leave the theather very confused and that is something positive because you can still think about the movie a few days later, even thought after some days it still makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>Overall 'Us' is an very interesting movie that is poorly executed and still leaves me with mixed feelings. On the one hand it had big potential to become something different and special but on the other hand it fails to deliver and becomes another missed opportunity in the horror genre. 6/10"

","Us is Jordan Peele's next movie after his surprise hit Get Out, which I really enjoyed. I had a lot of hype for Us because of it. I came out with a mixed feeling for the movie. I wouldn't say I disliked it, but something about it left me feeling a little underwhelmed. It was well acted (Lupita Nyong was excellent in particular), well shot, and there were some decent ideas in there, but it just felt below what I was expecting I guess.<br/><br/>There is Comedy to the movie as well, which works about half the time I'd say. However, one thing that bugged me in this movie compared to Us were some of the Horror Cliches slipping in there more frequently than Get Out did. The movie attempting to make these Doppelganger characters creepy didn't work that well for me, making people laugh unintentionally rather than making them feel threatening, as well as some of their movements. The more I think about the
plot and the explanations it gives too, the more I start questioning if it's good writing or shaky execution in a film trying to be ambitious.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There are good ideas and premises in this movie. I quite enjoyed the themes around the ideas of the Doppelgangers and the consequences of their existence, as well as the use of music in some of the scenes too. I do wonder if watching it a second time might make me appreciate it more and digest more of the movie. There were twists and turns and things I probably missed on first watch. It didn't help the audience was giggling non-stop and many of them were not taking it seriously at all. For now, Us was a mixed bag to me but a worthwhile watch.<br/><br/>6/10"

","A masterpiece of identity horror & dark reflection on America's past with chilly atmospherics, originality in concept, psychological torment + twists, old-world suspense-building, and one of the best scorings in modern Horror history. 9.4/10.
...<br/><br/>A pair of golden scissors. That was all Jordan Peele needed to build hype for his newest nightmare and sophomore follow-up to 2017's psychological race-fueled horror entry Get Out. And it worked. If Get Out was meant to be an appetizer showing glimpses of skill and greatness amplified in the main course: Us is that five-star dining experience we, and the horror genre, have been starved of and craving for years. Let's start with the score since it's so *unbelievably* good. Ever since I first heard that spooky, slowed concerto remix of Luniz's '5 On It' in the trailers and Peele's motivations/classics he wanted to pay homage to from Psycho to Jaws to The Shining to The Babadook to It Follows, I knew it was going to be something different & special. From its staccato-plucked orchestral themes rife with jarring string aggressions reminiscent of Psycho and Jaws iconic themes to its soft-balanced, airy quartet melodies discordantly happy-go-lucky and sweepingly Shining and It Follows-like, plus everything from tribal drums to theme rehashes to even hip-hop, the score is breathtakingly original and disturbing while also culturally authentic and auteuristic. It might not only be one of the best scorings I've heard in a horror film post-2000; but one of the best scorings ever in horror. It's THAT good.<br/><br/>The scoring echoes the darkness and effectively-chilly atmospherics in visuals, location settings, and concept. The cinematography is incredible, with strong compositionally-creative shots and innovative camerawork that will make you double-take several times at the artistic craftsmanship on display. The location setting is phenomenal lifting a long-unused setting just ripe with horror potential I'm not sure why hasn't been explored more: the carnival. From its opening scene in the downright-creepy funhouse amidst disorientating mirrors and blue-hued, white-knuckled heart-pounding (that feels positively old-world and almost Hitchcock-like), you are in for a thrill ride that keeps up its psychological horror and identity crisis until the final reveal/plot twist. The concept is breathtakingly original & absolutely brilliant as well: what could be scarier than a dark reflection or evil shadow of ourselves out to get us - a literal personification/amplification of our demons hunting us down in an equally-horrifying and brutal way with scissors? Just like in Get Out, Peele's penchant for bringing back imagination and original flair to a horror genre plagued by endless slasher reboots/sequels is extremely welcomed.<br/><br/>The performances and plot structure are equally sensational. Lupita Nyong'o delivers one of the strongest performances in her already-illustrious career as Adelaide/Red, showing serious acting chops and range being able to play both distinctly-far ends of the spectrum so believably (&, at times, simultaneously). Beyond that, there is not a weak link in any other supporting performance either, especially young scared Adelaide in that fateful stormy night, Winston Duke's hilarious Rod-like comic-relief Gabe, and the dark Tethers displaying undeniable skill to play two drastically-different, worlds-apart versions of yourself so convincingly. The shrewd two-way reciprocal plot structure also hits high notes unraveling the mystery and story while getting crazier at every turn as we're through the past and modern day before the two finally converge in that unbelievable final plot-twist revelation and multi-interpretive symbolic ending that reflects/parallels America's dark slavery and Native American-genocide past and trying to cover/hide/forget it when victims aren't always able to move on.<br/><br/>Minor flaws include sometimes-jarring MCU-like humor interjected at unnecessary, serious times and more needed fleshing-out and development/explanation of the government angle - why was it done? how? no back-up plan? etc. These are mostly inconsequential gripes though in an otherwise-brilliant and disturbing psychological-horror film. Bravo, Mr. Peele. 9.4/10."

"ferguson-6","8","4","12","2 April 2019"," Peele is 2 for 2
","Greetings again from the darkness. Jordan Peele first got noticed on ""MADtv,"" and then for his impersonation of Barack Obama. His career got a boost with ""Key and Peele"" with Keegan-Michael Key, and then it simply exploded in 2018 with GET OUT. For that film, he won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and was also nominated for Best Director (his directorial debut) and for Best Picture (as a Producer). With his follow-up to that breakout film, Mr. Peele has squashed any talk of being a one-hit wonder, and has actually elevated his work with this latest.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1986 as a family is on vacation at Santa Cruz, California. While taking in the amusement park along the boardwalk, their young daughter Adelaide wanders off into a house of mirrors where she comes face to face with her doppelg√§nger - her exact lookalike. It's the film's first creepy moment, but certainly not the last. The story then jumps forward to present day where Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o, Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), her husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke, BLACK PANTHER), and their teenage daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and young son Jason (Evan Alex) are on a getaway to a lake house ... one located near their friends Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), and their in sync twin daughters (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). Adelaide is not thrilled when husband Gabe suggests they head over to Santa Cruz beach.<br/><br/>Part of the brilliance of the film is that it works as a straight-forward horror film with some very funny moments (often thanks to Mr. Duke), but its real purpose is to inspire multiple theories along with the corresponding debate. Alternate meanings, metaphors and clues are dropped in most every scene. A toy ambulance, a JAWS shirt, a ""Thriller"" shirt, a TV commercial for the ""Hands Across America"" event, and the corresponding VHS tapes next to the family TV only hint at the numerous nods Peele serves up to other films, especially some horror classics. You'll note the director chooses an aerial shot not dissimilar to that of Kubrick's THE SHINING as the family drives towards their vacation spot. Also present (in a couple of scenes) is the reference to bible verse Jeremiah 11:11, and sharp-eyed viewers will spot other references to the double 11.<br/><br/>While the Wilson and Tyler families are visiting on the sandy beach, young Jason wanders off sending mother Adelaide into a near-frenzy with recollections of her night on that same beach so many years ago. Later that evening, the true horror begins. A terrific shot of 4 figures all clad in red at the end of the Wilson's driveway kicks the film into high gear. More doppelgangers appear and lead us to a subterranean community living in tunnels, and sharing the space with bunnies. We learn of ""the tethered""; those who are (mostly) identical to those living above. Those of identical likeness square off in the ongoing battle for survival, and that's really all you should know before seeing for yourself.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific, especially Ms. Nyong'o, who like the other actors seems to relish playing the dual roles. She also nails the final shot with a smile that will chill you to the marrow. Madison Curry makes a strong impression as young Adelaide, and as much fun as we have with the characters, the true joy lies in trying to ""catch"" all that filmmaker Peele throws at us. That final wall of folks in red is pretty easy to decipher, but some of the little clues and prods require a second viewing. It's fascinating and historic that Jordan Peele's follow up movie could possibly make this yet another horror movie contending at Oscar time. If you are up for a fun little horror movie that's also a mind-bending societal commentary on those who are born into privilege and those who aren't, then Mr. Peele has just the flick for you."

There are elements of pure horror in there just as much as psychological thriller - the movie has both small stakes and large stakes in different acts, creating a film that is extremely personal but simultaneously all-encompassing - the family dynamic, my favorite part of the movie, is amazing. Shoutout to Elizabeth Short, Winston Duke, and Lupita Nyongo for some incredible, seriously disturbing acting, and shoutout to the kids for the best child acting I've ever seen. If I were to compare this movie to anything I've seen before, I would call it a post-modern pure horror/comedy classic in the style of cabin in the woods, the Babadook, or You're Next, with the raw emotion of films like get out or split.

If this was just a family on vacation (in some remote rural place) that is being chased by psychopathic strangers it might not have been original but it could have been much better. Horror movies should be scary not stupid. It's like they were trying so hard to make it original, they didn't notice it ended up being just a huge mess!"

","Writer and director Jordan Peele debuted and scored an Oscar winning hit with Get Out, it was a fantastic film, and when I heard and saw the trailer for his next movie, I was really hoping it would be as good. Basically in 1986, young Adelaide Thomas (Madison Curry) is on vacation with her parents in Santa Cruz. On the beach, she wanders off and enters a funhouse, where she encounters a doppelg√§nger of herself in the hall of mirrors. Adelaide is later reunited with her parents, but she is unable to speak. In the present day, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is an adult, and heading to the family beach house in Santa Cruz with her own family, husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke) and their children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). Adelaide remember the traumatic incident from her childhood, so she is apprehensive about the trip. But Gabe brushes off her concerns, he is eager to impress their friends Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) and buys a boat. At the beach, Jason wanders off and sees a man wearing a red jumpsuit standing alone in the sand with his arms stretched out and blood on his hands. Later that night, a strange family of four appears in the driveway of the beach house. They stand still and do not respond when Gabe communicates and then tries to intimidate them. Eventually they move towards him, attack and break into the home. The Wilsons realise the four intruders are doppelg√§ngers of themselves, led by Adelaide's double, Red (Nyong'o). Each of them is wearing a red jumpsuit like the man on the beach, and Jason's doppelg√§nger Pluto (Alex) is wearing a white mask, to cover his deformed face. Red, the only doppelg√§nger who speaks, tells the Wilsons the story of a girl who lives a happy life while her shadow suffers. The family is then separated by their opposites: Red makes Adelaide handcuff herself to the table, Zora is taken by Umbrae (Wright Joseph), Gabe is dragged onto the boat by Abraham (Duke), and Jason is sent to ""play"" with Pluto in a closet. Umbrae is interrupted by an investigating neighbour while chasing Zora, she stabs him with a pair of golden scissors, while Zora escapes. Gabe is able to throw Abraham overboard and kill him with the boat's malfunctioning motor, while Jason finds Pluto mirrors his actions almost exactly. Jason is able to distract Pluto with a magic trick and escapes, locking Pluto in the closet. Red goes to the closet hearing Pluto's cries, giving Adelaide time to break free. The family regroups and escapes on Gabe's boat. Meanwhile, the Tylers are also murdered by a set of doubles shortly before the Wilsons arrive. The Wilsons kill the Tylers' doubles and turn on the news to see that millions of doppelg√§ngers, calling themselves ""the Tethered"", have been murdering their real counterparts throughout the United States. The doppelg√§ngers subsequently join hands together to form a massive human chain, which the newscasters speculate is a form of protest. The Wilsons drive away in the Tylers' car until they are attacked by Umbrae, who is killed after being launched into a tree from the top of the vehicle. As day breaks, the Wilsons arrive at the Santa Cruz boardwalk, where they find their own abandoned car on fire. Pluto has set a trap to kill the Wilsons by lighting a trail of petrol to the car, but Jason, remembering that Pluto mirrors his every move, walks backward so that Pluto steps into the fire and is killed. Red then reappears and abducts Jason. While Zora and Gabe recuperate in an abandoned ambulance, Adelaide returns to the boardwalk funhouse from her past. She walks through a secret tunnel in the hall of mirrors, which leads to a facility underground, overrun by rabbits. There she finds Red, who states that the Tethered were created by the U.S. government in an attempt to control the public, but the experiment failed and the Tethered were abandoned underground. For generations, the Tethered were trapped beneath the surface, doing nothing but mimicking the actions of their above-ground counterparts until Red organised them to escape. The two fight, Adelaide manages to kill Red, she rescues Jason, and promises him that things will return to normal. When the family leave town, Adelaide thinks back to the night she first met Red in the funhouse, it is revealed that she is actually one of the Tethered and had taken Adelaide's place in the surface world. As the family drives away, helicopters hovering above see the Tethered joining hands together across the United States. Also starring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Russel Thomas / Weyland, Anna Diop as Rayne Thomas / Eartha, Cali Sheldon as Becca Tyler / Io, Noelle Sheldon as Lindsey Tyler / Nix, Ashley Mckoy as Teenage Adelaide Wilson / Teenage Red and Napiera Groves as Dr. Foster. Nyong'o, Duke, Moss and the younger cast members all do their parts fine, it is written and directed reasonably well by Peele, it is a very creepy concept, people on holiday terrorised by evil lookalikes who want to get revenge and kill their counterparts, there are enough thrills to keep up the pace, the social commentary themes are clever (the title spelled ""US"", the quote ""we're Americans""), and it makes you laugh a little, I admit I personally did not find it as inventive as Get Out, but it is a worthwhile horror. Good!"

","This movie felt like it was written by 5 different authors who weren't allowed to communicate with each other. The acting was fine, the premise was OK, but the details fall apart under even the lightest of scrutiny.<br/><br/>After spending some time readings others reviews and attempted explanations of some of the plot holes it's become clear that there isn't some master plan at work here, the authors simply didn't even consider the most basic of plot elements. They failed to give any motive or motivation for either the choices of the humans, or the choices of the others.<br/><br/>In the span of less than 5 minutes they show that the ""other"" both DID own a specific tee shirts, then a couple breaths later that she did NOT, and had to steal one.

","This movie is so good. Lots of people are comparing it to Get Out, but I don't understand why; they're two completely different entities. It's inventive in its approach and concept, scary without utilizing typical horror ingredients, well-acted with a powerful and moving cast, funny without undercutting the horror, and smart in its writing and direction.<br/><br/>Writing/Direction: Jordan Peele shows us, once again, why he's the new master of horror with an original premise and screenplay that gives chills and scares. His script mixes in comedy perfectly; not too much, but enough to give some temporary catharsis when needed. The concept he divised is so original and the steps the plot takes to get to an intriguing endpoint are well-done and carefully calculated. The monsters are explained enough that we the audience kinda goes ""oh, okay, that makes sense,"" but not so much that we're like ""PFFT THAT'S BAT**** RIDICULOUS!"" Peele stepped up his direction a bit too. I'm still trying to figure out how, but now, whenever I'm walking around my house, I'm peering around corners to make sure another one of me isn't standing there. I think that was the intention, so well done, Jordan Peele.<br/><br/>The Performances were phenomenal: Lupita N'yongo is definitely this year's scream queen. She sells her role with a touch of empathy, realization, and in her other performance, sheer terror. Winston Duke was great, and served as a fitting and perfect comic relief; again, not too much and not too little, just enough that we're temporarily relieved. He's also a bit of a badass and one of the best portrayals of a modern day dad. And his other performance was an overbearing presence that scared in the right way. Shahadi Wright Joseph was great; a perfect mixture of teenage girl and teenage warrior (I think it's the right word.) Her other performance is suitable creepy, never faltering or changing from a terrifying face. Evan Alex might be one of the standouts. His portrayal of a little boy eerily curious of the tethered is intriguing, and he sells exactly what a little boy WOULD be thinking in this situation, which is **, ***, ****! ******** ****! ******* ***! (Ha! You thought I'd spoil it. You were wrong.) Alex's other performance as his tethered counterpart is probably one of the best ones; it's terrifying and made me shiver until I got home, and then some. The rest of the performances were fantastic, whether they were on one side or the other. I would have liked to see more interaction between Jason and his counterpart, but what we were dealt will do great as well.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie... how do I put this? Was awesome? Yeah, that's it. The cinematography was fitting and strategically placed; very smart in its execution and letting a few horror techniques through without utilizing typical ones. The makeup and hairstyling department deserves a win, given how they executed some parts of everyone's character. The costume department also did quite well, giving a monster that was both so palatable and so horrifying at the same time with a simple costume. The score was finely tuned and lovingly terrifying, while sometimes going overboard; but I don't mind. Just about everything in this movie was great.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele will make me scared to see my own reflection, and I like it. Making me terrified of Us (2019). This film gets a 10/10"

There is a lot more to discuss regarding this incredible movie.<br/><br/>On the surface, I can see how someone just going for a surface horror film would be unsatisfied, though Us did deliver a lot of suspense and intensity. However, where Us really shined was the subtext, something Peele does with the best of them. As with Get Out, he doesn't stick to one theme, implementing careful crafting to create conversation beyond the film. Where Get Out was a social commentary, though, Us was more of a personal analysis.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, especially considering that each actor had to play two extremes. The score was genius, as was the cinematography, with Peele placing several Easter eggs to dissect.<br/><br/>Overall, the combination of humor and horror came across in an intelligent, introspective way that I would recommend to all, but sadly not everyone will understand or enjoy."

","Let's get right down to it: Is this movie as good as ""Get Out""? No, but ""Us"" is still a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>As you've seen from the trailers, ""Us'"" focuses on a family who is menaced by monstrous doppelgangers of themselves. It begins in 1986, where young Adelaide encounters a duplicate of herself in a funhouse, an event that traumatizes her. Years later, Adelaide is a wife and mother visiting her of family home. Unfortunately, she once again finds herself menaced by her look-alike, now backed up with a twisted replica of Adelaide's family.<br/><br/>There are some stabs (pun intended) at social commentary but, unlike ""Get Out"" , they don't really go to the meat of the story. Really, the horror here is more psychological, dealing with the relationship between the characters and their duplicates. The actors here have to pull of double duty here, which they do superbly, adding humanizing touches even when they are playing monsters. The reveal of where the duplicates come from does not make a ton of sense but by that point you will be so engrossed you won't care."

"gatheringsnow","8","3","9","23 March 2019"," It's US!
","Us, the newest horror creation written and directed by Jordan Peele, is an extremely odd, unsettling, darkly humorous, and suspenseful mind trip of a film that for some, may provide more questions than it gives answers for, nevertheless I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Two sequences in particular, the opening sequence before the credits, and the scene in the Tyler family's house, I found to be extremely eerie and disturbing, and for a seasoned horror veteran like myself, that's no easy feat.<br/><br/>The film itself stars Lupita N'yongo as Adelaide Wilson, who after an incredibly surreal, nightmarish experience with a ""mirror girl"" as a child, is now a grown woman with a husband Gabe, played by Winston Duke, daughter Zora, played by unknown actress (at least I've never seen her before) Shahadi Wright-Joseph, and son Jason, who is played by the similarly unheard of Evan Alex. Rounding out the cast are Tim Heidecker and Elizabeth Moss playing the Tylers, another affluent white couple who are friends of the Wilsons.<br/><br/>The basic premise follows Adelaide and her family confronting a sinister group of doppelgangers called ""The Tethered"" who attack them brutally one night after returning from a day at the beach, the EXACT same beach where Addie had her experience as a child, and has seemingly been haunted about ever since. She is extremely hesitant to go but eventually agrees after being persuaded by her husband. After arriving strange ""coincidences"" or signs begin to occur one after the other, and Addie is convinced something bad is going to happen, and that something eventually does happen, although in a far more horrific manner than she probably could have imagined.<br/><br/>Unlike Get Out, which had a strong satirical thriller vibe in the vein of ""The Stepford Wives"" Us is a far more straightforward horror film that can be enjoyed as such, or if you prefer you can watch the film numerous times in order to go back and see things, little Easter eggs thrown in very clever, often subliminal ways, much like Get Out. All of the actors in the film, especially Lupita but also the children and even the Tylers put forward great performances portraying their original selves and their sinister ""tethered"" doubles. Highly recommended!"

","I struggled to see why 'Get Out' was so hyped and thought it was ordinary at best but this follow up by Peel actually made me angry. The first 20 minutes were ok and after that it was utter tosh. I would rate this in the worst five films I have seen in the 57 years of my existence and I have seen some stinkers. I hate mostly because it thinks it's so clever when it is run-of-the-mill story with the most obvious twist that you will see coming a mile away and which makes no logical sense. Whilst it's less racist than Peel's Get Out it has absolutely no other redeeming qualities. As in Get Out, the acting is like an Am Dram/ Hammer Horror mash up and the plot preposterous.

","Review:
'Us' is a horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele.
Well, I guess I finally found a movie that is very split between audiences and critics where I agree with the critics. A lot of people didn't like this movie because it is so different from most horror or thriller movies that are made today. That's what I love about Jordan Peele. He isn't afraid to put what he wants on screen, and he layers his movies. There is never just one genre or story being told, they have deeper meanings.
The acting all around is flawless, and I mean flawless. Everybody does such an amazing job in this movie. Having to play both predator and prey would be a hard thing to get the right mindset for and it is transferred between the two seamlessly. The standout in this movie however has to be Lupita Nyong'o, oh my god I love this woman. She can do no wrong.
I was worried I was just going to be jumping on the band wagon with this review, because I thought it was being loved by a lot of people. That's unfortunately not the case at all. It's a real shame that filmmakers can't make everybody happy no matter what they do People say that they sick of remakes and retelling of stories, but when filmmakers like Jordan Peele try and give us amazing and original content people say it made no sense or they didn't get the concept. Movies like this should be watched at least twice in order to get the full concept of what is trying to be told. My heart races when things like this happen to good films.
Overall, this movie is great. It wasn't what I had expected, and I didn't go into it thinking I was going to be scared. This is a thriller and there are multiple moments where you feel unsettled. I can see some points that other reviewers have pointed out, but I liked it and can't wait to watch it again to see if other things stand out!
5/5"

"kirbylee70-599-526179","8","2","5","15 July 2019"," THEY ARE US
","In just two films Jordan Peele has shown what a capable director he is. His first film GET OUT earned him an Oscar nomination in that category. I'm not sure his second film will follow but for fans of horror, science fiction and the just down right strange you'll find the film US a movie that will keep you watching.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1986 when young Adelaide Thomas on vacation at an amusement park in Vera Cruz with her family wanders away from her father and down to the beach. She notices a strange building, a haunted house of sorts there and enters only to see something that frightened her and would change her life forever.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present as Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is now married to Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke) with two young children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). The family is on their way for their own vacation not far from Vera Cruz. Renting a house on the bay and a boat as well it seems to be a perfect time. With friends Kitty and Josh Tyler (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their two daughters things should be fun. But that changes suddenly when Jason sees a figure on the beach and discovers the same haunted house that Adelaide did years ago.<br/><br/>That night Jason looks out the front door and sees another family standing in their driveway. Not willing to be intimidated Gabe tells them to leave and threatens to call the police. And then things get really weird. The family begins tormenting the Wilsons by trying to break through the front door and smashing the windows. They eventually gain entrance, taking the family hostage.<br/><br/>At this point the Wilsons notice something about the intruders. They are each an exact copy of the Wilson family. Of this group only one seems able to speak, Red (also played by Nyong'o). Her voice is raspy but she talks about things as if Adelaide should know her. Could this be the person she saw long ago in that old building?<br/><br/>We're less than an hour into the film at this point and so much has taken place. We also discover that not only the Wilsons but the Tyler family have had the same thing happen to them. Who are these people? What do they want? Where are they from? And why do they look like exact duplicates of those whose house they enter?<br/><br/>Peele takes his time revealing the answers to these and more questions that arise as clues are offered. It takes a deft touch to accomplish this task and do so in a manner that will hold your interest from start to finish. He does that expertly here. It's no wonder he was chosen to head up the new version of TWILIGHT ZONE on CBS All Access.<br/><br/>Peele also wrote the script and if anything has a problem here it is minor bits and pieces with that. The standard fare found in horror films, the random stupid move by a character is found in the film. More often than not this usually involves female characters who run from killers only to trip and fall while screaming. In this case most of those moments fall to Gabe. Of all the characters in the film he is the one that most viewers will want to slap.<br/><br/>The performances here are well done by all. Nyong'o has the most to handle playing both Adelaide and Red. As one she's a shell shocked mother trying to save her family while the other is a raspy voiced murderous woman looking for escape and something else. Nope, no spoiler there you'll have to watch to find out just what that is. Duke does a good job as Gabe, the happy husband who thinks everything is fine and just wants things to go back to normal. Both Joseph and Alex turn in solid performances in roles that in the hands of lesser actors would ruin the whole film.<br/><br/>One thing to note is not to end the film too quickly. This is one that keeps giving even after you think you have it all figured out. And then it changes things up again. And then it makes you think perhaps what you thought happened wasn't right all along. An interesting movie that will frighten some and fascinate others and one to enjoy."

","While it may be easy to compare Us to Get Out, they are two very different movies. Us is much more of a horror film than Get Out was. Both also very prominently use social commentary as a means of crafting some of their horror, however, Get Out was much more overt with it. Us uses a rather complex story to offer up great scares and tension, while also making some statements about society. Lupita Nyong'o is simply fantastic and shows her tremendous range. Where Us trips up a little is in its elaborate plot. There are quite a few holes in the story that don't make much sense and the ultimate reveal is a little far-fetched. While the story isn't quite as tight as Get Out's, Us is still based on a terrifically original concept and filmed brilliantly by Jordan Peele."

"saraburtonloving","9","2","5","13 April 2019"," An incredibly ambitious and well made film viciously exploring what it means to be American
","Firstly, I'd like to make some concessions addressing some of the comments made in the negative reviews I read here. Yes, there are plot holes, and much of the movie is unexplained and non-logistical. How could a whole society of clones exist underneath us without us noticing? They couldn't. If they were created by a powerful group of overlords looking to control the general population, why wouldn't they be destroyed instead of kept alive? If you're looking for a realistic and extremely ""believable"" film, this isn't it.<br/><br/>But so much of the criticism, in my opinion, has a fundamental misunderstanding of what the artistic purpose of film is to many great film makers: to use an aesthetic project to convey an overwhelming feeling held by modern society. Like many, I see it as a criticism of the current attitudes towards income inequality. Two distinct classes are distinguished, Us (the relatable and privileged surface dwellers) and Them (the animalistic and deprived tethered). The tethered are terrifying, strange, and hard to sympathize with, and seem to be inherently violent. They're even described at certain points as ""soulless"" and ""shadows.""<br/><br/>But as we discover that Adelaide isn't exactly who she thinks she is, we are still made to root for her. She is ultimately a mother fighting to protect her family, an undeniably righteous cause. She's worked extremely hard to get where she is, and that's something we can all understand, because we all struggle every day to provide for our families and rise above our circumstances.<br/><br/>This movie is full of reflections, whether it be the ominous 11:11 or the consistent shadowy images of Adelaide in mirrors and glass. Even the scissors are two halves reflected. As much as we want to divorce the tethered from ourselves, it's apparent through Adelaide's development that their circumstances are what result in the behavior of the tethered, not some inherent evil in them. Both Red and Adelaide are capable of great violence when threatened, and the tethered are threatened. In my eyes, you can't deprive a whole population of love and freedom and not call that violence. Even the kids are violent when pushed to be.<br/><br/>The acting and casting in this movie are phenomenal, essential in such an ambitious film. N'yongo's performance in particular is breathtaking, and Wright Joseph also did an incredible job, even when not considering her age. (Her tethered, in my opinion, is the CREEPIEST LITTLE B-YAHTCH OF THE BUNCH). The cinematography is incredible, and significant in every scene if you know what to look for.<br/><br/>In many ways, this film is nonsensical and imperfect. However, it is rich in symbolism and dread that still rings through my head and heart long after watching. If we treat people like animals, they will act like them. And if they are made to feel like they have no place in the world, and are deprived of every opportunity and comfort, they will do what is necessary to take what they need. You can't blame the tethered for doing so, they just want exactly what our beloved characters want. Red is an inspiration to the tethered because she can tell them what they're missing, and what they crave is recognition, communication and community.<br/><br/>In the same way, we justify what we do to get to the top of our American society. We tell ourselves, we DESERVE this. Those who have nothing have nothing for a reason, right? And if they weren't the ones who have nothing, then WE would be the ones who had nothing. But in reality, the privileged and the oppressed are only borne of our circumstances, just like Red and Adelaide, and like them, we are essentially interchangeable. Instead of questioning how these tethered got here and who let the situation get so out of hand, we instead just demonize them, even though if we thought about it their violence would be understandable. Peele, in a thousand ways and images, illuminates all of the holes in our logic which we use constantly to justify the conditions which millions of low-and-middle-income individuals in this country live in. They are Us. We are Them. The only difference is, in reality, there are a hell of a lot more unprivileged than privileged. What happens when we realize that we will never be allowed to trade places with the rich?<br/><br/>Or at least, that's how I see it. Regardless of themes, this is a wonderfully made and acted film, every element of which is thoughtfully and beautifully expressed. I loved every second of it, especially considering the GARBAGE in theatres these days. Considering how huge this concept and idea is, it's not perfect, but it's damn close. I loved Get Out, and in a lot of ways it's a better film, but Us is fortuitous in a way that haunts me, and probably will for a long time.<br/><br/>(Basically, learn to not take things so literally and read between the lines. Interpret the symbols. It's fun, trust me, and you'll get a lot more out of movies in general.)"
"arianalong","9","2","5","8 April 2019"," Confusing if no open mind
","Overall this movie was great! It was more of a comedy/horror film. So I would not expect coming into this movie thinking that it is all horror. There were many hidden messages throughout the movie and a lot of scenes that had linked together. If you do not pay attention and are distracted you will be completely lost in the movie. I have also heard from sources that if you do not watch the movie ""Get Out"" that this movie will be even more confusing considering that it does have some part in with the movie ""Us"". Thus meaning why I was probably really confused. It helps to watch on YouTube the explanation of the movie after then watching the movie again for enjoyment."

","The Us of the title are Jordan Peele's 'tethered' doppelg√É¬§ngers of North Americans who live underground. After many years underground the Rapture has arrived as predicted in Jeremiah 11:11 and the human race faces a challenge that it will struggle to overcome.<br/><br/>Peele's second horror is every bit as intellectually challenging as Get Out And like that debut features a fine central performance; this time in the form of Lupita Nyong'o, her family and their 'tethers'. For quite long sequences of the movie Nyong'o shares the screen with herself in absolutely seamless editing and post production that takes your breath away. In fact much of this film does that with its incredible design and vivid photography.<br/><br/>The main cast is almost exclusively black, but a fine cameo by Elizabeth Moss and her family is the exception.<br/><br/>A starting point may have been Michael Jackson's Thriller.<br/><br/>Nyong'o, as a young child in 1986, is drawn into this sinister underworld in a beach-side fairground show on Santa Cruz promenade. Wearing the Thriller T shirt her dad has won in a coconut shy she is taken from this world to a backdrop of Hands Across America, which was supported by Jackson.<br/><br/>It's not the scariest horror you will ever see (although it has enough jumps to keep your heart going) but it's one of the creepiest. It sits neatly in the latest greats of the genre (Get Out, It follows) that treats its viewer with respect and keeps you guessing right to the end.<br/><br/>I won't say much more as it will only lead me to spoilers but, put it this way, we are in the hands of a master craftsman here - his next movie project is a rewrite of Candyman by the way."

"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","5","2 April 2019"," ""Us"" - The Metaphorical Puzzle in a Good Way?
","In Writer and Director Jordan Peele's ""Us"", it's 1986: Little African American girl Adelaide, played by Madison Curry, encounters her doppelganger in the carnival tent on the Santa Cruz beach. Little Adelaide's eyes widen in terror.<br/><br/>Now 2019, on the family vacation car ride, Mom Adelaide Wilson, played by loving and beautiful Lupita Nyong'o, jokes with her children, daughter Zora, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Halloween mask wearing son Jason, played by Evan Alex. Adelaide and her husband Gabe, played by solid Winston Duke, drive to meet up with friends Kitty, played by Elizabeth Moss, and Josh, played by Tim Heidecker, and their twin daughters for their Santa Cruz summer holiday. Yeah, that's Jordan's discreetly frightful foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Funny. Santa Cruz might be an homage to Joel Schumacher's 1987 ""The Lost Boys"". Although, ""Us"" is not about the indigenous vampire in Santa Cruz. Jordan's narrative is somewhat more sinister: Our ""tethered"" doppelgangers (personal doubles) possibly live in the millions of subterranean tunnels in the US. Or so we are made to believe according to Jordan's movie prefaced research.<br/><br/>Scary movies are really not my deal. Yet, my movie critic buddy Michael told me that ""Us"" is worth seeing. That was good enough for me.<br/><br/>The first 2 Acts of ""Us"" are amazing narrative and visually foreboding atmosphere from master storyteller Jordan Peele. Lupita brilliantly disguises Adelaide's unresolved childhood fear, safeguarding her children with all her being. Winston Gabe is comically at a loss in discerning his wife's seeming turmoil. Also Adelaide and Gabe's dynamic with Kitty and Josh occurs as the social status comparison game. Oh, well.<br/><br/>Then one night, the Wilson's receive uninvited guests at their rented beach home. They're also the family of four. Jason says, ""It's us."" They're the evil versions of Adelaide, Gabe, Zora and Jason. Or are they really 'the evil ones'? Terror and havoc ensue on screen.<br/><br/>Act 3 of ""Us"" is totally WTF? No worries. No spoilers here. At a certain point I didn't know what was going on. Jordan seduces with the bloody mayhem. Yet, there is something more subversive in his narrative, perhaps about our own human nature?<br/><br/>I didn't find ""Us"" as so much scary, rather it's entirely disturbing - in a good sort of way. Later, I confirmed with Michael about a storyline that might have been obvious, to others. For sure, other theories surrounding ""Us"" will emerge. Wait for it.<br/><br/>Amazingly, Jordan circles back his story to the movie's seemingly innocuous premise, and he fosters further discussion in his shocking conclusion. Lupita's compassionately humane performance as Adelaide anchors ""Us""; keeping us watching; keeping us in Jordan's master guessing game.<br/><br/>I'd love to see ""Us 2"". I'm also guessing that's part of Jordan's master narrative. Just saying."

","'Us' is the second film from Jordan Peele, after 'Get Out', and is similarly a psychological thriller, with moments of violence thrown in.

The main cast - Mum Adelaide ( Nyong'o), Dad Gabe (Duke), Daughter Zora (Joseph) and Son Jason (Alex) - are all great and clearly have a lot of fun playing their dual roles.<br/><br/>Josh (Heidecker) and Kitty (Moss) also have significant supporting roles, but it really comes down to how the family of four handles their terrible situation. No spoilers, but Peele does well with building tension, using a creepy girls-choir score, colour motifs and flashbacks. It's not a typical horror film, but it certainly has scary moments.<br/><br/>There's an almost Shyamalan-like twist at the end, but the whole thing's probably 15min too long and runs out of steam a bit.

His stories are compelling and thought provoking, and yes, I believe they are important - it was fun to get this lesson on the horrors of nature vs. nurture, on entitlement. I'm a fan and support what he's doing - I think we're only seeing his early films now, obviously, but I just see him taking it all so much further, and I'm excited for what's in store.

","I was suckered into watching this movie because of the rave reviews, and other than a few creepy scenes this movies fails as an horror film. The plot starts off alright but quickly becomes a confusing mess with many holes and makes zero logical sense. I was never excited or tense while watching this, it was really even somewhat boring. The film has no real atmosphere other than about three total scenes that where somewhat unnerving. The acting was fine I guess, but this movie is not a great horror film, and I believe it is very overrated. The movie could have been better if the ending nonsense was left out, it's really bad."

","Okay, there are few things that remained unexplained. I felt that too.
-Why the girl didn't just leave, after she uncuffed herself?
-Why didn't ANY other underworld person leave before her?
We can only guess these things.
But does a few unsolved points make a movie bad? Other movies, maybe.
This one, certanly not for me.
My vision of the movie's main point is philosophy about morality.
1) Was the little underworld girl WRONG for wanting to live a normal human life?
2) Can we change our perspective of a loving and caring mother just because of what she did as a child who desired to be happy?
3) Also, can we blame the actual girl who was imprisoned in the downworld for dreaming of getting back what is her by right?
4) Who actually is protagonist here?
I believe these are the questions to think about. Try to understand every side, than you will feel this movie the right way. To conclude, esthetics are also amazing, as well as the whole composition.
It is a movie worth watching and thinking of."

The main plot that centered around the family was very engaging and had me on the edge of my seat. The problem with it is the plot expanded and got too big and wasn't really developed to get that big. The performances were phenomenal and it did end pretty well. It's a good movie but I wish the plot expansion was handled with a little more care. Definitely worth the watch."
"fpcholcomb","4","2","5","24 March 2019"," Better than Get Out? Get Real.
","Jordan Peele's first foray into directing was a great success. Unfortunately I cannot help but feel with his second movie he has fumbled into too much creative control for his own good. Us has an excellent premise, and a fairly good first twenty minutes or so, but after that you get a taste of the horror this horror movie has to supply and the movie quickly devolves plot hole ridden 80's-horror-movie-reference-fest that is not scary in the slightest. It almost feels like he had too may ideas, too much inspiration, to fit into the idea he had in mind.<br/><br/>Us borrows a lot from 80s horror films, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. I liked the little son in his Jaws shirt while on the beach (which his mother is deathly afraid of), reminding us that having a fear of the beach was not so uncommon after watching Jaws for the first time. But many of the references do not work in my opinion. He borderline rips off moving aerial shots from the Shining except without a modicum of the subtly in the original. He has slow artistic shots of rabbits in cages, uncomfortable close ups with his characters and ""them,"" and foreshadowing heaped on foreshadowing heaped on more foreshadowing. He wears his inspirations on his sleeve. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. On the whole I think he does have a natural affinity for cinematography and he does appear to be a true student of horror, which I can appreciate. A horror fan will find things to like in Us, but most of the time the movie will likely be reminding them of movies that were far superior to this film.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the film is two fold, the ""horror"" and the writing. The costuming and weapon choices for the ""monsters"" are a weird amalgamation of Michael Jackson and Child's Play but the psychos too stupid and weak to be intimidating at all. They are consistently doing things that do not make sense and the only one that can talk has the least intimidating voice in history. I audibly laughed when the main characters doppelganger started talking. Her ""we are Americans"" line felt out of a Key & Peele skit. What should have been a tense scene felt comical and stupid, and not just because of the writing, voice, and consumes, it was the actual actions of the doppelgangers, virtually nothing they do makes sense and it feels like scenes just happen to advance the plot. Hey you go chase her, hey you dump this guy in a lake, you guys go play in a closet for some reason. Why?<br/><br/>There seems to be a bit of a revenge motif going on which does explain why the family is not killed outright but the method by which the mother's doppelganger chose to execute her plan is nonsensical. Why not break their legs? Why not explain to the family why the mother deserves what she is getting? Why not have weapons more effective than scissors? Does no one in Florida own a gun? Don't even get me started on the whole tunnels underground explanation that the goddamned villain literally monologues about at the end of the film, harkening back to one of the least intimating, least interesting intro quote I have ever seen in any movie. People were trying to control people with doppelgangers but they just happened to abandon the facility and leave it with enough rabbits to sustain a massive population with copies of apparently everyone in the city and possible all across America. He didn't even have to explain their origin, it could have been enigmatic, why go through the trouble of creating this lore when it is so obviously stupid.<br/><br/>The symbolism and structure needed to make up for these pitfalls and they simply did not. There are messages about family, race, poverty, dehumanization, nature v. nurture, national identity, mother-father dynamics, mental illness, the list can go one. He threw all the ingredients in the fridge in the pot for this movie and it feels like the overall weight of the film suffers because of it. Get Out was tongue and cheek, simple and effective, this movie has some of the charm but almost none of the intelligence and patience.<br/><br/>Peele truly is making horror for a mass audience that he believes cannot stomach excessive gore, the death of main characters, or apparently a plot that is coherent. If you want to be sacred or intrigued go to another movie. If you enjoy movie references and a few solid jokes Us will entertain you. I am curious to see what Mr. Peele will do next and if he will introduce some restraint or continue to produced substandard movies. Until whoever told Mr. Peele Us had a good script gets out."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","2","5","24 March 2019"," Its time for US to GET OUT of here....
","I did really like this film. However, I felt like the third act gets really messy and convoluted. I get the symbolism that Jordan Peele was going for but from a logistical view, it didnt always make sense and it opened itself up to more questions. But other than that, I liked how original this story was. And I liked that it kept you guessing. I think the music choices for the most part were really good. Especially the score. I did feel like song choice of ""F the Police"" was random. If they wanted to go for the gag of the Fake Alexa/Google Home mishearing ""Call the Police"", that choosing to play a song by the band The Police would have been better. And something like ""Every Breath You Take"" would have still fit in. Cause that song has creepy lyrics like ""I'll be watching you"". But I guess thats a minor nitpick. Lupita is just absolutely amazing in this. The whole cast is good, but in particular Lupita was really killing it. Jordan Peele has such a artistic flair to his directing and I think the film is really gorgeous at times. If we're comparing this Get Out, I think that film is a bit more cohesive and I like the imagery with the Sunken Place better. But, this film still ranks high for me. I think its hard to talk about this film more without delving into spoilers and I think this is a film that you should go into not knowing a lot about."

Didn't seem to make much sense. Several plot holes here and there. The ending felt very rushed and I was not satisfied with the conclusion. It was very long, actually too long. My friend and I were close to falling asleep.<br/><br/>It's very pretty and well-acted, but that doesn't make it good in any sense of the word. I wanted to love this. And I couldn't wait to see it.

","Such a great idea for a film, such great actors (except one, I'll talk of that later), such great visuals! But holy dang was that an incredibly amateur attempt at a horror movie. I live in Santa Cruz so I was very excited to watch it. But.... sigh.... it just wasn't very scary. Not to mention how ridiculously long certain scenes dragged on. Not sure if it was attempt at a slow-burn style film, but the slow burn was more boring that tense. We get barely any family dialog, so we dont know or care about the dynamic, which makes certain scenes totally un-effective.<br/><br/>As I mentioned I didn't like one actor, but rather one character. One of the ""Us"" speaks while the rest don't. I understand there is a reason for this (twist ending) but it just really takes you out of it. It would have been much more effective to have them all silent and grunting. They wanted her to talk so she could explain whats going on, when we don't need context. First of all you don't need an explanation to understand the story, so it made me roll my eyes and think ""MOVE ON"". Many masterpieces of cinema don't explain anything (just look at Kubrick) because a sense of confusion adds to the mystery of the film.<br/><br/>Earthshatteringly disappointing."

"scb_coldsteel","8","2","5","23 March 2019"," Best horror film of 2019
","So I just saw US at the theater. Honestly this was one of my most anticipated films of 2019. Get out was amazing and Jordan Peele has such a promising future for horror. Thankfully, all of my expectations were met. Overall I would highly recommend US to all fans of suspense and horror.<br/><br/>The plot of US was incredibly interesting. The movie was based upon an old Twilight Zone episode, but of course Jordan Peele added a fresh sense of originality that made US a modern horror classic. A seemingly normal family on vacation is confronted by a group of doppelgangers that are out for blood. From there the film spirals into a suspense-filled, blood soaked narrative that will play with your expectations and leave you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The movie is an absolute master class is crafting an interesting and innovative suspense driven horror film. The plot goes in multiple directions, but was still grounded in suspense and classical elements of horror. I genuinely was interested in the characters and the plots progression throughout the entire film. Plus the movie has just enough gore without coming across as unnecessary. I also have to say the movie had some genuinely funny dark humor moments.<br/><br/>The movie did an incredible job crafting a thick and eerie atmosphere that will constantly give you chills. Everything from the timing, lighting, to the exceptional use of sound was incorporated to add to the film's overall suspense. The sound and soundtrack really felt like a central part of the film. The use of sound really added a nice chilling factor to a number of scenes. I love seeing a horror movie put suspense and atmosphere as a top priority.<br/><br/>Directing wise Jordan Peele really did an outstanding job. His love for horror and music really came through in this movie. He incorporated a number of horror references and techniques without feeling cliche. There were so many small choices throughout the film he made as a director that really made US a special film. With US Jordan Peele proves he is not a fluke of a director. He genuinely cares about crafting smart suspence driven films that elevate horror films into legitimately great movies.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned the plot was very interesting, but the excellent dialogue certainly added quite a bit to the film. The screenplay of the movie incorporated a nice mix of suspense, gore, dark humor, and plot twists to keep pretty much anyone entertained. The entire concept of the movie could easily come across as silly if not for the intricate screenplay. I really enjoyed the twists as well and in no way thought it was out of place. It remind me of when M Night Shyamalan actually cared about writing.<br/><br/>Of course I have to mention the acting. There was not a bad performance in the movie. It is so refreshing to see a horror movie taken seriously by incorporating great actors and smart well delivered dialogue. Lupita Nyong'o was so great. It was fun seeing her play two completely different roles, but throw herself at both performances. The doppelganger concept of the movie could have easily come across as a cheap plot device if not for such strong performances.<br/><br/>Now I really liked US, but it did have a few points that hold it back as a film. While I did laugh at the humor, a lot of it felt out of place. The character's reaction to events at times completely destroyed elements of internal believability. Plus the movie does have its share of characters making dumb choices for cheap thrills. With such smart writing these just seem like odd choices to make. I will add that the overall explanation for the backstory of film and some plot points had gaping plot holes. Nothing that really hurt my overall enjoyment, but plot holes are irritating.<br/><br/>US was one of my most anticipated movies for 2019 and it did not disappoint. As expected from Jordan Peele the movie was smart, scary, and all around well-directed. The acting and dialogue really put the movie over the top for the genre. While it did have a few plot holes and cheap thrills, I enjoyed every minute of the movie. I highly recommend US to all fans of the genre as this is just a great example of how awesome a well made horror film can be. A 8.5 out of 10."
"lillyabbo","4","2","5","22 March 2019"," This isn't a horror movie
","Magnificent acting, cinematography and score. WAY too many holes. You can hide your vagueness behind metaphors and politics, but this was just plain messy. At the end of the day, this was supposed to be a horror movie. If you really want to make a political statement, why not at least hide it cleverly AND still make the storyline feel complete.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>-All the tethered were mentally incompetent when we first see them, YET the young tethered ""Adelaide"" was clever enough to kidnap her double, switch T-shirt's, find her family and take her place??? Why was she smarter than all the rest of the tethered?<br/><br/><ul><li>After the switch, why do the other tethered follow ""Real Adelaide"" if their souls were split and they only know how to mirror their doubles? Because she danced which showed she was special and could control her body? Hadn't they seen real people with free will during the government experiment?</li></ul><br/><br/>-How do they communicate with her and understand they need to kill their doubles or even know how to find them if they cannot even speak? Are we really supposed to believe that she is communicating with ALL of them by hand movements, whistles and stick figures on chalkboards? Even though she was just a child when she was kidnapped and barely had an education herself?<br/><br/>-Why was Jason able to control his double and get him to burn himself? That didn't work for anyone else...even though the others SOMETIMES mirrored each other. Sooo...they mirror each other sometimes?<br/><br/><ul><li>Fake Adelaide loved both the real and tethered children - she was upset when bad Jason was going kill himself and when bad Zora was in the tree she reached out to her - even though she didn't birth them and had never met them. But the Tyler family tethereds easily killed their ""other"" twins.</li></ul><br/><br/>MOST IMPORTANTLY, why didn't real Adelaide just leave and go kill fake Adelaide like the homeless 11:11 tethered did to his real double? We clearly see that he did this pre-revolt. Did they or didn't they have free will the entire time? Real Adelaide definitely had free will as evidenced throughout the entire movie, and could have left and told someone what was happening or gotten revenge much earlier, but instead she chose to stay underground, eat bunnies and have sex (and a family) with the mentally challenged Abraham, while she single-handedly staged a revolution for the tethereds.
A revolution, not against the government that created them, but against their innocent doubles that had no idea they existed. Or was it all for her selfish revenge, which she could have gotten 1:1. It's not like once they killed their ""real"" double, they became whole. That would have at least made sense both for plot purposes and metaphorically.<br/><br/>Again, make all the political statements and innuendos about human empathy and self-awareness you want, I love that. But please make sure the movie plot has a semblance of making sense."

","When the trailer for this movie came out, my excitement could not be contained. I forced everyone I know to watch it. I memorized the entire thing by heart. I've read rave reviews (as well as the not-so warm reviews), and I was ready to see this masterpiece.<br/><br/>it's been two hours since it ended, and nothing could've prepared me for the psychotic mess this movie is. I've been unable to keep my mouth closed, and my hands are literally shaking. am I being too dramatic?<br/><br/>no, because Jordan Peele has made a masterpiece that has transcended the limits of what horror is, and what it should be. it's pointless comparing this film to Get Out, because they're literally on two ends of the genre spectrum. Us may feature black leads, but it's no commentary on racism, nor is it a satire of society. this is a pure, unequivocal, spine-chilling horror film. it is filled with jump scares, unrealistic coincidences, and cheesy what's-behind-the-door sequences. but Peele is masterful in the way he uses these tropes, presenting them in a fresh way that I've just never seen before.<br/><br/>at first, the film feels very slow. it feels like nothing is going to happen. it's funny - maybe too funny. but when it picks up, it goes all the way there, until the very last scene, leaving you no room to breathe, nowhere to turn, nowhere to look. the score is breathtaking. it has this chocking effect that is hard to describe. Michael Abels' work here is even more eerie than his score for Get Out.<br/><br/>and don't get me started on Lupita. you can play Toni Collette's Hereditary dinner table scene on loop forever and cry over her snub, but Lupita is on another level in this, especially when playing the doppelg√§nger. Evan Alex is also surprisingly good, and Shahadi Wright Joseph takes it even further. oh, and Elisabeth Moss? yes.<br/><br/>see, your regular horror film is filled with demons, dolls, and an abandoned house. but it's also filled with white people. and although Us probably foreshadows a lot of things, it feels really nice to see black people front and centre in a horror film that is not about race. it's nice to see black people open the door you know they shouldn't. it's nice to see black people scream. catch this in theatres, right now. don't wait another second. but, be careful - Us may not make you scream nor pee your pants. but I promise you, it'll leave you restless, with a pounding in your chest."

"t-viktor212","9","4","15","4 April 2019"," It actually was top notch
","This film isn't aimed solely or principally to entertain, it is much subtler, and requires a lot of attention of the viewer to dissect every detail.
Superficially seen, yes, it's a typical horror movie, but beneath that there's a lot of meanings, themes, foreshadowing dialogues ecc.
Unlike most of horror movies, Us does not rely on jumpscares, it creates an eerie atmoshpere and mostly relies on visual elements to emphasize such elements, something I really appreciated.
A very recurring meaning is indeed the theme of the double very interesting handled, not only with the enemies being the doppelg√É¬§ngers of the main characters, but also under other aspects, such as the duality of human nature (rational/irrational), ecc.
I really find the accusation of the story having plot holes to be nonsensical. The more I rethink about the film, the more cause-effect connections I find as to why certain things happened. It's all there, you just need to find it.
What I also really liked is how there is an almost fully afroamerican cast without the subject of the movie being racial discrimination. I hope not to be misunderstood, I am clearly in favor of diversity representation, and that's exactly why I appreciate that in this movie we are allowed to see an afroamerican family in the lead without the topic of the movie being related to their skin colour, I believe it's the best way to represent diversity correctly and inclusively.
So far, this is probably the best film released in 2019. Awards season is still to come, but I strongly believe that it will still stay among the top releases of the year."

","Jordan Peele gave us one of the most compelling movies with ""Get Out"" helping to redefine the horror genre. ""Us"" helps further to cement his innovation of the genre.<br/><br/>He's not giving us the in your face obvious terror. He's adding to the Hitchcock narrative however with a modern twist.<br/><br/>When ""US"" Trailers were first released, everyone was shook by the idea that doppelgangers are terrorizing this family. How do you call for help when the enemy is you?<br/><br/>Not only is it genius but it also allows for an opportunity to have a cultural dare I say political debate.<br/><br/>One family is affluent the other is struggling. One family has the luxury of options while the other family wants a say over their lives.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so amazing are the details? Subliminal messages that come back to haunt the leading family.<br/><br/>It's the orange jumpsuits with the leather sandals that hint at neutrality because after all, they don't have the luxury of fashion.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o is having quite the year, and with ""US"" she takes another step towards Superstardom.<br/><br/>As Adelaide Wilson, she's protective of her family and as her alto ego she downright terrifying. There are so many things to unpack from her eyes, body language, and that scary voice.<br/><br/>Winston Duke as Gabe Wilson demonstrates that his turn as M'backu wasn't a fluke. In ""US"" he embodies the middle-class dad. He proudly sports his Howard University sweatshirt while at the same time aspiring to gain all of the trappings of success from a summer home to a boat.<br/><br/>If Lupita and Winston are the anchors of this movie, the kids are the engine.<br/><br/>Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex as Zora and Evan Wilson are amazing. It's hard for adults to convey terror as actors; however, to ask children to invite terror into their being is difficult. These two not only allowed it but added extra elements. As frightening as Lupita was these two were even scarier which seems impossible in a movie that has so many twists and turns. Again it's not the killing but in the subtleties such as facial expressions and body language. There something unsettling but delicious about children being dark.<br/><br/>Nice addition to this cast was Elizabeth Moss as Mrs. Taylor. Moss hot of her successful Hulu series "" A Handsmaid Tale"" continues to show us that she's come a long way from "" Mad Men."" Her scenes as her alter ego are some of the evilest ones. I'm also glad that she wasn't omitted in the trailers giving the viewer an additional piece of suspense.<br/><br/>""US"" is a horror movie but it almost seems limiting to call it that because it's so much more. It's political, it's cultural, innovative and just a damn good movie. Jordan Peele has accomplished with two films what many directors have failed to do with twenty. He's making statements while entertaining. I also love that he pays attention to details such as having an African-American family that doesn't only have dark skinned parents but the children match the parents' hue. Mainstream films at times lack context; however, this film makes them an integral part of the story.<br/><br/>Also, the feature of the song "" I got five on it"" adds to the fact that Peele stands firmly in his blackness no explanation needed.<br/><br/>""Us"" is the type of movie that we will see over and over again because there is so much to unpack. One viewing isn't enough."

Every shot is thought out in its own beautiful way. He is not afraid of getting weird with dialogue, music, shots, movement, and humor. He commits to all of it and it really works well. If you enjoyed Get Out, you will enjoy this. Some people have been complaining about a reveal that is happening half way through the movie. I do wish the threat would have stayed a little more personalized to the family, but again, Peele makes it work.

"ericks-86892","9","3","10","24 March 2019"," Worth a second viewing: Scary and Interesting
","This movie had a lot of fun moments, but it's not a ""horror comedy."" Instead, those are moments designed to lower your defenses as the scares come. This movie had some truly terrific horror, as well as some more traditional, less innovative horror.<br/><br/>I say that there are spoilers in this review, but all I mean by that is that when I say ""I totally called the twist at the end"" you now know that there is a twist at the end. Still, after the twist I realized a lot of very strange things made much more sense or had much deeper meaning, sort of like how the second time you watch ""Get Out"" everything Rose does has a completely different meaning. As you watch it you just sort of need to accept that all this weird stuff will make sense at the end, even if it's in a twisted sort of way (again like the twist in Get Out).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie a lot, and now I find myself thinking about it quite a bit. My take on its meaning (which is likely small compared to what is going to appear on Reddit) is that Americans are living in a stolen land, and that we need to come to terms with it. It didn't need to be stolen, but it was. This is most difficult for the children of those who stole that land, because even though they were unaware of the theft and were not responsible, they still benefited from the actions of their ancestors and need to come to terms with their past."

","Obviously many of you are responsible for 6.9 rating of this movie, so I agree this movie is not tough enough but the story has it's own dangerous meaning. So let me clear that my 10* rating is for it's story.
After watching this movie once I had one question only what was the government project really but after reading some theories I got a lot of questions hidden in this movie.
Isn't it confusion why Jason gave that look at the end. So it is really a mess to understand ""Was Jason real or he was always Pluto?"". This is the biggest question of this movie and really hard to get answered. Why?
So Jason always behaved like he was not familiar with humans as he was unable to perform the trick, can't catch the beat and was not good with his language. So I think Jason was also swapped just like Red and I think the Red done this as it seems unfair that Pluto's face was burned in the tunnel where I don't think any type of fire was seen. I think Red done this just because Real Jason was burned and she cannot handle that.
So this movie has hidden secrets, which are really a mess to understand and that is special.
But I am disappointed at the fact that Only one family survived the attack and all others were dead. Is it even possible?"

"andrewmerritt-31652","8","2","6","14 November 2019"," A worthy follow up to Get Out
","Us stars Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, and Elisabeth Moss and is directed by Jordan Peele. The film revolves around a family who decides to take a vacation in Santa Cruz, but their vacation is interrupted by a group of doppelgangers that begin to hunt them down. This movie marks Jordan Peele's second time directing after Get Out. And if you thought Get Out was crazy, wait till you experience this. Jordan Peele takes us on an adventure into his imagination and his imagination never stops from there, as we get deeper and deeper as the movie progresses. This guy has such a wild imagination that when the first trailer was released Jordan Peele takes a simple rap song by LUNIZ and incorporates it in the movie. I always find it interesting to have a comedian like Jordan Peele who has been doing comedy since Mad TV switch from comedy to horror. And not just that, but he created a movie with an original script and a different psychological thriller that doesn't imitate plot twists like Sixth Sense or Memento. I could feel his passionate for horror movies and the inspirations he uses without trying too hard to be the Shining or any other horror movie I can think of. And he still has that creativity and imagination to give us something new without it feeling like a sequel to Get Out even though some of the dialogue feels like its borrowed from Get Out. I was amazed how great and fantastic this movie was that I watched it a second time so I could soak up his genius and creativity. And even after leaving the theatre a second time I found myself questioning the ending or other scenes that I wont spoil for anyone. Also added to the scare factor is Lupita Nyong'o who gives a haunting performance as herself and her doppelganger. And her performance still haunts my dreams as every movement and her dialogue send shivers down my spine that the other characters you forget about. I did have a problem with the humor that Us has to offer as some of it felt forced while some humor was actually laugh out loud funny. There was no balance between humor and the psychological elements in the film. To sum up it up this movie felt like an episode out of Black Mirror, which I hope Jordan Peele hops on that train. Overall this is a terrifying experience that you'll want to experience a second time. And I could talk about spoilers, but I'm not going to because it's worth checking it out for yourselves, but ignore the people who thinks that this is overhyped."

This idea is shown through the main character as we show how are circumstances and settings change who we are.<br/><br/>It's also a statement on how Americans can do a act like hands for life as repeatedly shown in the movie but still feel good about ourselves as if everyone is somehow living a great life now and no one is impoverished.

""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.""<br/><br/>Other thing to look for in watching this film is who kills what with what.

The cast is excellent, each character playing two versions of themselves, but the standout is definitely Lupita Nyong'o who just wows as both main and tethered personalities. The cinematography is spot on, and so is the music score. This is a horror movie that will make your skin crawl more than have you jumping out of fright.

","I can't. I don't have the words. It...wasn't very good. It wasn't fun to watch. I so wanted this movie to be great, but it just wasn't. It tries so hard to be clever and cute, but it ultimately makes a fool of itself with its incomplete story lines, plot holes, and predictability. Yes, the ending was predictable, I figured it out long before it concluded and that's when I came to the conclusion that this film lacks natural fluidity, it was slow, forced, and inorganic. The movie read as if someone sat somewhere in a studio and said, ""I want to make a movie with X, Y, and Z elements, with W twist, and everyone is gonna be like, 'Wow, Jordan Peele, you're movie was really cool and thought provoking,'"" instead of just being naturally good.<br/><br/>This movie had (key word, HAD) tons of potential, but the finished product just doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>Some positives: amazing shots, pretty good acting (I could do without about 90% of the comic relief), fantastic set design, but this is a movie better suited for the home and not for the theatre."
"andrewroy-04316","8","2","6","3 April 2019"," As an excellent follow-up to Get Out, Us nail both the technical side and the intricate plot and symbolism
","Us lives up to the considerable hype Peele created for himself after Get Out. There is nothing to complain about technically - the score, script, and cinematography is all great, and the acting (especially Nyong'o) is phenomenal. While I was worried about the horror elements being too scary or overwhelming the plot and ideas, I found Peele to integrate fear without forcing it. My only real disappointment with Us is the detachment I felt for much of it. I was certainly rooting for the family and was nervous when they were attached, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that I felt a connection to them. I also think Peele spent a bit too much time on pure action, with chase scenes that I didn't feel added a lot to the movie and felt like somewhat empty minutes. Still, I thought it was extremely well made and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>What elevates it to a great movie for me, even better than Get Out for my money, is the exceptional symbolism and depth of ideas that Peele brings to the table. I absolutely believe that Us' primary message is one of social class divide in America. There are many moments that allude to it, but the most poignant one and the one I will remember about the movie is the one revealed by the brilliant twist: Red was the old Adelaide, they flipped places. This drives the point home that people are all just victims or beneficiaries of circumstance: Adelaide started down below but could be an ordinary person in society and someone we rooted for all movie, while someone who started out as a good girl could go down to the tunnels and become a killer. The twist, like all of the best movie twists, explains so much of the movie: why Red is the only one who can talk, or why she was the one who was able to lead the revolution. There are plenty of hints at it - Adelaide saying she doesn't do well with talking, her parents saying she wants her girl to talk and that she wants her daughter back. Generally, I think the twins symbolize the low classes of society (shown in their physical place below the Earth in the tunnels, and wearing red as a working class color) who are forgotten or ignored, and who the high class see as the enemy even though they are just people - ""we're Americans."" I think that central message is extremely strong and meaningful. From a plot perspective, I love the ideas Peele brings, of having a tethered person. I think the complaints of plot holes are completely ridiculous and beside the point - not only are most easily explained, they don't affect any of the message or plot of the movie. I think it's totally plausible that the government tries to clone people and control/influence people with their below ground clones, but they can't clone the soul so the project fails and these tethered people exist in tunnels, eating rabbits as they are an easy and cost effective food source. Red had been a human and knew what she was missing, so leads this revolution of the oppressed and forgotten tethered people to use scissors to untether themselves and take control of the world they were denied. My only real question was: what was unique about Red going into the house of mirrors that made her tether come up the escalator? If mirroring led her there, why wouldn't that happen to everyone? Still, that's a pretty minor point and there are so many brilliant ideas and details in the movie. I do think there's some subtle racial commentary at points (most obvious when the police are of no assistance), and Jason's twin had a burned face because he burned it mirroring Jason's tricks. The plot and exposition at the end, which then give way to so many deep and fascinating ideas to consider, make it a truly great movie for me, even if some of the moments in the middle of the film felt like pure action and my emotional investment was moderate. Peele lands another huge hit that cements him in my mind as one of the great modern thriller writers and directors, and Us is a movie that I would recommend everyone to watch for its across-the-board brilliance. If it doesn't get Best Picture, Actress, and Screenplay nominations I will be disappointed."
"ilovefoodcoma","8","2","6","1 April 2019"," Great performance!!
","WOW! The casts were playing two roles. Love Lupita & her kids performance!! They looked so creapy!! Good script because it got my attention the whole time. It wasn't a super scary movie but definitely made me curious what was going to happen next."
"cranium889","8","2","6","31 March 2019"," So rare to get a movie that can be incredibly intelligent, but remain superbly entertaining at face value.
","US is a fantastic slasher/thriller. Do not go in expecting a Get Out sequel; these are very two very different movies. This one isn't as deeply layered & focused as Get Out, but that's a good thing! It's not suppose to be! It's a fairly straight forward plot, but still a lot smarter & more cerebral than your regular slasher flick. And oh so entertaining...and funny!
The characters are great and the actors bringing them to life in their double roles are absolutely incredible. Lupita Nyong'o is nothing short of astonishing as the two mothers. And Winston Duke is the daddest dad that ever dadded on film. Even the kids, with their creepy stares & odd movements just add a layer of eeriness to it all.
Like all the best mindbenders, the quest isn't to find the answers to everything. It's all a puzzle to put together & demanding of repeat viewings; but the plot is still straight forward enough where you're left satisfied, even if you don't truly understand it all.
It'll go down as a classic in the genre, even if it doesn't have the weight of Get Out. It's message is a far simpler one. The two movies may be more connected than we think, but to explain any further would spoil it all.
Can't stop thinking about & deconstructing US, and it just gets better & better the more I think about it. It's so much more than a horror movie. So rare to get a movie that can be incredibly intelligent, but remain superbly entertaining at face value.<br/><br/>Excited to see it again."
"bdevmalya","8","2","6","31 March 2019"," Bravo..... Mr.Peele
","A huge masterpiece of identity horror & dark reflection on America's past with chilly atmospherics, originality in concept, psychological torment + twists, old-world suspense-building, and one of the best scorings in modern Horror history. 9.4/10. ... A pair of golden scissors. That was all Jordan Peele needed to build hype for his newest nightmare and sophomore follow-up to 2017's psychological race-fueled horror entry Get Out. And it worked. If Get Out was meant to be an appetizer showing glimpses of skill and greatness amplified in the main course: Us is that five-star dining experience we, and the horror genre, have been starved of and craving for years. Let's start with the score since it's so *unbelievably* good. Ever since I first heard that spooky, slowed concerto remix of Luniz's '5 On It' in the trailers and Peele's motivations/classics he wanted to pay homage to from Psycho to Jaws to The Shining to The Babadook to It Follows, I knew it was going to be something different & special. From its staccato-plucked orchestral themes rife with jarring string aggressions reminiscent of Psycho and Jaws iconic themes to its soft-balanced, airy quartet melodies discordantly happy-go-lucky and sweepingly Shining and It Follows-like, plus everything from tribal drums to theme rehashes to even hip-hop, the score is breathtakingly original and disturbing while also culturally authentic and auteuristic. It might not only be one of the best scorings I've heard in a horror film post-2000; but one of the best scorings ever in horror. It's THAT good. The scoring echoes the darkness and effectively-chilly atmospherics in visuals, location settings, and concept. The cinematography is incredible, with strong compositionally-creative shots and innovative camerawork that will make you double-take several times at the artistic craftsmanship on display. The location setting is phenomenal lifting a long-unused setting just ripe with horror potential I'm not sure why hasn't been explored more: the carnival. From its opening scene in the downright-creepy funhouse amidst disorientating mirrors and blue-hued, white-knuckled heart-pounding (that feels positively old-world and almost Hitchcock-like), you are in for a thrill ride that keeps up its psychological horror and identity crisis until the final minute. The concept is breathtakingly original & absolutely brilliant as well: what could be scarier than a dark reflection or evil shadow of ourselves out to get us - a literal personification/amplification of our demons hunting us down in an equally-horrifying and brutal way with scissors? Just like in Get Out, Peele's penchant for bringing back imagination and original flair to a horror genre plagued by endless slasher reboots/sequels is extremely welcomed. The performances and plot structure are equally sensational. Lupita Nyong'o delivers one of the strongest performances in her already-illustrious career as Adelaide/Red, showing serious acting chops and range being able to play both distinctly-far ends of the spectrum so believably (&, at times, simultaneously). Beyond that, there is not a weak link in any other supporting performance either, especially young scared Adelaide in that fateful stormy night, Winston Duke's hilarious Rod-like comic-relief Gabe, and the dark Tethers displaying undeniable skill to play two drastically-different, worlds-apart versions of yourself so convincingly. The shrewd two-way reciprocal plot structure also hits high notes unraveling the mystery and story while getting crazier at every turn as we're through the past and modern day before the two finally converge in the unbelievable joirney. The plot reflects/parallels America's slavery and Native American-genocide past and trying to hide/forget it. Minor flaws includes less screen-time to the tethers which ultimately leads to less character development unlike Get Out where all characters were built with such a great importance that the audience wanted to know more about; on tue other hand.... The concept and so much screen-time of the rabbits didn't help the plot a single bit otherwise-brilliant psych-horror film. Bravo, Mr. Peele. 9.4/10."

It was like running to your car after a bad first date who said she was 125 pounds but really 210 O lineman."
"Cineanalyst","8","2","6","27 March 2019"," Mirror Image
","Writer-director Jordan Peele's prior picture, ""Get Out"" (2017), didn't get enough credit for its cinematic allusions and how they doubled the social commentary on race that grabbed most of the attention. Like ""Us,"" Peele's follow-up film, it was about doppelg√É¬§ngers, about an idyllic world above and a horrific ""sunken place"" below, there was the metaphorical animal motif (deer in ""Get Out"" and rabbits in ""Us""), and there was a haunted artist. In ""Get Out,"" the protagonist was a photographer, who was desired for his artistic eye. Here, ""Us"" features a dancer who is envied for her freedom of expression and movement. Somewhat the inverse of ""Get Out,"" however, the socio-political message of ""Us"" is submerged, while the artistic, including cinematic, references are lifted to the surface.<br/><br/>Some are so conspicuous they are worn on the characters' t-shirts: Michael Jackson's music video ""Thriller"" and, while at the beach no less, ""Jaws"" (1975). On the boardwalk, a reference is made to ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) being filmed, and there are others, intentional or not (I'm not sure whether anyone anymore is intentionally imitating Hans Zimmer's horns from ""Inception"" (2010), but they keep coming back, including in the climax here). As in ""Get Out,"" TV plays an important part, too, especially for narrative and cultural context. There's the ""Hands Across America"" event, as well as some VHS tapes beside the TV of movies that some astute viewers have pointed out bare important themes upon ""Us."" One of them that, at first, doesn't seem to share any similarity to Peele's horror piece is ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). (Another recent movie, as an aside, that I've seen to contain a similar reference to the same film but for, assuredly, different intent is ""Captain Marvel"" (2019). Go figure.) Like the hand-holding charity event, or the declaration herein of ""We're Americans,"" the copy of the patriotic ""The Right Stuff"" seems to hint at the underlying agenda of ""Us""--and reminding that the title's letters also stand for ""U.S.""<br/><br/>I'll leave it to others to decipher that message, which although less succinct than that of ""Get Out,"" seems to be of the muted and downtrodden ""other"" below ""us"" above who are occupied by keeping up with the Joneses (as best represented here by the Tyler family, and Gabe Wilson's jealousy of their material possessions) and the general hubris of the ""us versus them"" mentality at all, and others can investigate the relevance of the Biblical verse ""Jeremiah 11:11."" I'm more interested in the allusions that double, or reflect, the allegory. Plus, I think it's apt that ""Us"" focuses more clearly on the surface with those material references; after all, arguably and at the risk of cynicism, even ""Hands Across America"" was better at selling t-shirts than it was raising money for charity, let alone alleviating any of the social problems it, or ""Us,"" for that matter, raised.<br/><br/>Live-action motion pictures themselves have always been doppelg√É¬§ngers--reflecting us back to ourselves and capturing the essence of the living and since dead. Narrative cinema (and, later, TV) caught onto the possibilities of this early on, including ""The Student of Prague"" films (1913 and 1926), partly based on the novels of E.T.A. Hoffmann, where the student is haunted by his mirror image (long before any ""Twilight Zone"" episode that inspired Peele was made). Although now we have digital processes and CGI, from the beginning, cinema was able to replicate what it had already replicated via effects such as superimpositions (a.k.a. multiple-exposure photography). Even the timelines in ""Us"" are doubled. And, then, there are mirrors and shadows, which are analogous to all of this, and like ""The Student of Prague"" and others before and after it, ""Us"" is full of shots of reflections and silhouettes. Moreover, the narrative's inciting incident--where the doubles meet--takes place in a funhouse of mirrors. Perhaps, Peele wasn't considering Hoffmann and the Germanic roots of doppleg√É¬§ngers. But, he surely had a couple oft-referenced pieces of English-language literature in mind with Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" novels. (Another aside and to highlight how common are allusions to these books, another recent movie I saw was ""The Favourite"" (2018), which also featured metaphor-infused rabbits.) Of course, the surface/underground dichotomy is already rife in symbolism, especially with the explicit religious allegory here, but surely it's no coincidence that the hole is entered through the looking-glass and is full of rabbits, nor that what is encountered below is the fantastic reversed, the shadow, or reflection of that above.<br/><br/>The slasher horror-film and other, general movie conventions that abound in ""Us"" may not always be as refined as in ""Get Out"" (and its humor hits more than its scares do). The exposition-bursting climactic twists especially have the feel of a James Bond villain explaining his elaborate scheme solely for the benefit or us, the viewers, as opposed to the more-eloquent use of TV for a similar (and, thankfully, simpler) purpose in ""Get Out."" But, again, as in ""Get Out,"" the doubling for the control of and the appearance of the characters bring attention, as does the stylistic focus on mirrors and outlines here, to central concerns of film theory, including the cinematic gaze and character identification, and this is felicitously connected to its message--forcing one to look in the mirror, so to speak, and ask who is us?"
"hjcubides","8","2","6","27 March 2019"," The US Manifesto...
","I do not usually watch horror movies, but Lupita Nyong'o in the cast was a factor to give a chance to this movie, no disappoint, Lupita was superb as I expected, but I liked too the side message in the movie.<br/><br/>Seems that not much people see this, to me is almost explicit, from the movie's title to a specfic line: ""... we are americans"", this movie is full of protest, protest against the growing inequity in United States.<br/><br/>It's a great metaphor and also a warning , the apocalyptic outcome of the story could be comparable to the consequences of a revolution derived from this inequity, like the french revolution was.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this was the intention of Jordan Peele, but at least for me this element give substance to the movie"

"bellrat","5","2","6","25 March 2019"," Decent acting, poor script
","After watching this film, I can only conclude that the writer had an idea about the government creating clones to control us, then decided to try and make a story that was a bit different to others that had followed this premise. What you end up with is some elements of potential surrounded by a story that has been taped together with so many holes. The twist is largely expected. But the explanation of the major event of the film is very weak. It would have been better left unexplained. They include things like the holding hands across America, but it doesn't have any real significance apart from showing the scale of how many people have emerged form the underground. Can't really fault the acting or any of the production of the movie,most sense were filmed well, the music was good etc. Unfortunately the script let's it down."

"namob-43673","2","2","6","24 March 2019"," Worst movie of the year... so far
","Is this the worst movie I have seen at the theater? No... but not too far from it. I actually walked out. Yes, I got up from my seat about 1h and 15min into this movie because I could not stand it anymore and left the theater. First time ever. Never walked out of the theater before. I sat through the entire disaster of BvS, I agonizingly sat through both Solo and The Last Jedi, and I even survived sitting through Ragnar√É¬∂k and The Dark Tower. This movie however... no. I could not stand it.<br/><br/>Again this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, it just so inapt, so dumb, so badly constructed I was in a perpetual state of cringe from the first minute until I had enough.<br/><br/>The only entertaining part of the movie was Winston Duke making animal noises... again... And I am sorry, but I couldn't help myself from laughing, which I do not think was the intention. The first 10min or so is pretty good, acting okay-ish and from what I saw of the movie it is not ugly and have a decent music score. Those are the only ""good"" things about this movie. There it ends.<br/><br/>I am not going to give away the plot, mostly because I do not care about this movie at all, but also there is none. Yepp, a plot-less, boring, nonsense ""attempt"" at some kind of ""scary humor"" movie...
Just as ""Get Out"" which was a better movie than this, but also not a good movie, it seem that Jordan Peele is trying to experiment with different styles, mixing them, throwing horror, thriller, drama, political satire, and weird attempts at humor into a blender and what comes out he pour into a water gun and randomly shoots at the audience.<br/><br/>Scene after scene is happening, with no sense of direction, no sense of reason, lacking any form of relevance. The movie is not scary, not at all. The movie is not suspenseful, not at all. The movie is not funny, not even close to being funny. The dialogue is the cheesiest weirdo cringe I think I have ever seen... do anyone talk like this? There is nothing here, this movie offers absolutely nothing. Jordan Peele has completely failed with this miserable excuse of a movie. This is amateurish - did some random people from a hidden corner of youtube make this?<br/><br/>And what is the point? What is the idea with this movie? Where is it going? Sure I did not see this dumb movie until the end, so perhaps something was explain, but reading other reviews I hardly think that is the case.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 2/10... and honestly that feels generous.
The only reason I do not give it a 1 is because I never saw the movie until it ended, so perhaps something was explained, perhaps the ending saved something of the movie...
I cannot recommend this to anyone. Not ""Get Out"" fans, although the weird all-over-the-place structure is sort of the same. Not to horror fans, not to anyone.<br/><br/>This is absolute garbage and actually worse than Alita which I until seeing this thought was the worst movie of the year. At least Alita had some sense of directing and value, this nothing. Empty, boring nonsense.

So if the main protagonist was actually the underground version, and the underground version was the real protagonist, why did the real version have a messed up voice? I don't know. How did the underground version manage to become a normal person? I don't know. Why did the real version decide to hold a massive nation-wide uprising, and what was the end goal other than revenge with massive collateral damage against millions of innocent people? I don't know.<br/><br/>These questions, the last one in particular, took me out of the movie.

","I like this movie and I think it is far from a bad one, but to call it a horror masterpiece, and to say that it is better than Get Out is just incorrect.<br/><br/>Personal point first:
I love and appreciate the subtle homages to horror icons like Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhees, and Michael Myers.<br/><br/>Now for the pros and cons:
The symbolism with the rabbits, the scissors, and the spiders and all that were brilliant! The same can be said about the subtle connections that every character has to something in the movie.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are very likable, which is exactly what a horror film is supposed to do!<br/><br/>There's a lot of clever reincorporation, like the fave surgery thing! Excellent! Just excellent!<br/><br/>There were a few comedic moments that really landed! I laughed the hardest when the boat propeller chopped up you know who. (Yeah, I got a dark sense of humor.)<br/><br/>The cinematography is super well-done! Mike Gioulakis has been absolutely killing it! First It Follows, then Split, and then this. I seriously doubt he is going to read this but I'll say it anyway, ""Keep doing what you're doing man, because you're clearly very good at it!"" On top of the cinematography being very beautiful it also serves as an effective storytelling tool.<br/><br/>The music was awesome! Like the one that played while they were walking on the beach!<br/><br/>The fight choreography was great; it really felt like people were getting hurt! And I love the blood spurts.<br/><br/>And this film as a whole is an incredibly ambitious one. It challenged the actors because they had to all play two different characters. When they were facing off against each other they were talking to nothing and fighting nothing. There's no way that's easy. On top of this, the themes that it tackles are very sensitive ones, and their treated with respect. The premise itself is very interesting (which is what gives the film re-watch value for me). It's very creative and weird, and it really shows how smart Peele is.<br/><br/>As for the flaws, I'm going to start out with the scare-factor. It was non-existent for me. However, it might just be my bias because I'm not easily scared. But that being said, when a horror movie isn't scary to me, it really bogs down the experience for me.<br/><br/>Even though the themes and messages were handled with care and respect, they're not as well-defined as the themes in Get Out. This is due to something that I will talk about in a few paragraphs.<br/><br/>The film did nothing to subvert my expectations when it came to the characters. When I met Elizabeth Moss and her family I was like, ""They're gonna die."" And guess what! They all died! And none of the main characters were killed off, and at no point did I expect any of them to die. Why not kill off one or two of the main characters and let some of the side characters live?<br/><br/>This film had a hard time deciding what it wanted to be; during tense scenes there would be comedy and it would come at the expense of the horror. And it would try to be a movie that you're not supposed to give logic to, but then be a movie you're supposed to give logic, to. When the main family was being attacked, the dad would crack jokes and it would just really get in the way of the suspense. This movie should have taken breaks for comedy like Get Out did.<br/><br/>The doppelg√§ngers rising up and being treated unfairly is supposed to be a metaphor for inequality and what it can lead to, but at the same time there was this whole government trying to control everyone stuff. First of all, the exposition that was delivered at the end was really dumb. None of the dialogue sounded all that realistic to me. Second of all, if the movie hadn't provided literal explanations for the doppelg√§ngers' origins the movie would've been better. It would've just been one big metaphor. I wouldn't have questioned the origins of these creatures. It probably would've made the doppelg√§ngers scarier, too.<br/><br/>The way that the doppelg√§ngers communicate with each other was comical.<br/><br/>And last but not least, the twist ending. It sucks and here's why: It raises way more questions than it answers, and it's a clich√©. Whenever there is a double of somebody, you will assume that there will be that bait and switch shtick. And when the movie started coming to a close I was like, ""I guess they're not gonna do that."" But then I realized there was gonna be a twist ending before it happened, and I guessed it would be the clich√© bait and switch, and it was. Now what questions did it raise? Well, if she's the original girl then why didn't she try to communicate this to anybody? How does she have such an extensive vocabulary if none of those doppelg√§ngers can speak English? And since the doppelg√§ngers uncuffed her from that bed while she was still a little girl, and she spent 20+ years and those underground tunnels, she never found her way out of that place, even though it was clearly shown to us that it was not difficult to navigate yourself out of there? Bull! Crap! The doppelg√§ngers wouldn't have stopped her! And they wouldn't have warped her mind! Another thing that was clearly shown to us is that all they did was mimick their surface selves! This is not a good twist-ending so don't say that it is! This renders that awesome monologue by Red at the beginning of the main conflict really stupid.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie and I do find myself re-watching it every now and then, but like I said, the praise this film is getting is a bit undeserved. I have great respect for Jordan Peele and I will be watching whatever movie he makes next, because he truly is one of the most unique voices in Cinema today."

"Mike_Devine","7","1","2","1 February 2020"," Despite a predictable twist, Peele still delivers
","Jordan Peele has already proven his directing and writing abilities with 2017's horror breakout 'Get Out.' If he really wanted, he could have sold his director's chair and retired to a private Caribbean island having left a lasting legacy on the genre. But that would be a waste of talent.<br/><br/>In 'Us,' Peele returns to a story that becomes increasingly unsettling and sinister the longer it goes on, and the formula once again works. As the Wilson family embarks on a beach vacation to Santa Cruz, old secrets begin to emerge that threaten not only the family of four, but society as a whole. Led by Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke and supported by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, we get to see a lot of stalking from shadowy strangers to harrowing escapes via car and boat. It's not your typical horror film - there's plenty of action built into it, and it's actually well done. Even smaller-scale appearances from Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker do not go wasted in 'Us.'<br/><br/>But the best aspect of the film is without a doubt the underlying current of psychological fear throughout. Regardless of how things unfold and build, 'Us' never loses its edge, even though the major plot twist can be seen from a mile away. It may not be quite as groundbreaking as 'Get Out,' but it's not fair to compare the two - 'Us' should be viewed as its own film.<br/><br/>Whatever you think of 'Us,' it's clear audiences will wait eagerly for the next offering from Peele."
"Leofwine_draca","3","1","2","1 February 2020"," Not for me
","While I thought Jordan Peele's GET OUT was acceptable albeit overrated, US is another story altogether. It's a boringly pretentious 'survival horror' type story filled with annoying characters and rote action sequences. Things begin with an elaborate setup which lasts half an hour but feels twice as long; I felt my eyes dropping at this point. Then the action begins, and it takes the form of those predictable 'home invasion' style thrillers in which the protagonists somehow manage to keep surviving overwhelming odds. Plenty of violence and shrieking, but nothing in the way of originality, while the larger plotline is simply ridiculous. I appreciate the efforts to make an allegory and how realism isn't necessarily a priority, but this just felt like nonsense to me. Then there's the dragged-out twist ending, which anyone can guess from the beginning. Bad times."

The movie played it's concept well in matters of characters, musical setting, and the visual themes involving duality in both scissors and bunny ears (as well as the whole hands around america paper-men being cut by scissors)
the creepyness vibe was highlighted in the third act when the protagonist entered the secret passage of madness beneath the surface...
...down the rabbit hole.<br/><br/>and that's when it went down the toilet<br/><br/>suddenly the movie went from the unexplained to the soft SciFi boring-mystery of faux-conspiracy that has made no sense in either writing, theory, execution, alternative world-building and hypothetical situations.<br/><br/>while the previous cinematic work of Get Out (2017) was worthy of praise for it's surprisingly intriguing psychological thriller aspect that subverted contemporary ideas of racism and privilege... US (2019) destroys it's own premise by trying to explain it<br/><br/>in interviews, Peele wanted this movie to act as an allegory to the idea of privilege, and thus certain leaps of logic were used as bridges for the flow of story-line that ends with a twist so moronic that it almost seemed like it was conjured during a bathroom break.<br/><br/>overall, this movie is wonderful as a horror movie, capable of causing a chill when not being taken with the same seriousness of Get Out (2017), and with that, the social commentary it was intended to explore fails miserably, as a worthless sacrifice on an altar that prefers substance over flavor."
"theminorityreporter","Null","1","2","30 October 2019"," Our House
","Us is basically about a fairly ordinary family confronted by clones of themselves who want to kill them and take over their house and possessions.<br/><br/>We meet to the Wilson family when they arrive at their beach house in Santa Cruz. Discussion at the table revolves around what the kids Zora and Jason are up to, and Mom (Adelaide) is surprised to hear that Zora's not interested in track and field anymore because she feels there's no point. Dad (Gabe) is prepared with the suggestion that getting to the Olympics is the point, and when Zora says she's not going to make it to the Olympics Adelaide says ""You could do anything you set your mind to"". It's usually not really true, but it's the kind of story we like to create for ourselves. And then cling to. Forever.<br/><br/>Jason has a 'magic trick' that basically looks like a lighter attached to a ring on his finger - it won't light. He says ""This thing's kind of bulls-t"" and Gabe and Adelaide are briefly upset with him that he cursed at the table (better in the living room? maybe it's all about location...). In response to their criticism, Jason says ""When you point a finger at someone else, you have three pointing back at you"", and points his hand like a gun at his father. Gabe acts appalled momentarily and says ""What is that supposed to mean?"" But then, it's not really important. Gabe 'corrects' Jason, saying it's four fingers, not three. It's all about technique, really.<br/><br/>In the car on the way to the beach, Zora says with conviction that there's fluoride in the water that the government uses to control people's minds. Evidently paranoid doomsday theories are something she's been interested in talking about (while doing internet 'research' on her phone), so everyone just goes silent and intentionally ignores her. Jason continually tries to light his 'magic trick' lighter and Zora suggests that maybe he could just say what's supposed to happen so everyone could picture it. Jason says ""Maybe you could kiss my anus, Zora"" and everyone is HORRIFICALLY APPALLED at his use of the word ""anus"". It's so much worse than the curse word which refers to the same thing you could picture in your mind. Except that people don't generally picture in their mind what they're saying when they say the curse word. It's so commonly used that it doesn't even seem crass to people anymore; it's just a syllable, so even if a kid uses it it's not the end of the world.<br/><br/>To change the mood in the car, Adelaide turns on the radio and ""I Got 5 On It"" by Luniz is playing. Gabe says it's a classic. Zora knows the song too, and when Jason asks what ""I got 5 on it"" means she says it's about drugs. Gabe is prepared to rapidly 'intervene' momentarily, saying ""It's not about drugs - it's a dope song - don't do drugs."" So dope is both good and bad at the same time in the same sentence about a song that Gabe says is great but probably shouldn't even be identified for what it is. But then, it's not really important. Gabe drops into the groove with some gangsta attitude as he sings along and Adelaide makes sure Jason gets in rhythm to the song under her guidance, snapping her fingers to the beat for him. It's really all about getting the attitude and the rhythm right.<br/><br/>The Wilsons meet their 'friends', the Tylers at the beach. The dads, Gabe and Josh talk about the boat Gabe just bought that Josh is quick to call a ""dinghy"" (sight unseen). Josh then rattles through a list of supplies Gabe should have gotten for the boat and is satisfied when he hits the missing item, a flare gun. It's official: Gabe is running to catch up and Josh has nice things.<br/><br/>Kitty's a heavy drinker who reads fashion magazines and tells her Forever Story about how she could have been a movie star. When she reveals that she had some cosmetic ""work"" done around her eyes Adelaide says ""F- off..."" (she's really just being 'friendly', you know). Kitty seems genuinely happy and comfortable, like this is the ice-breaker she was hoping for, and explains that the idea is to just do a tiny bit to keep looking the same, ""Not that you need anything... wh-re"" It's funny because it's so awkward when the word is fully pronounced like that; it's almost like she meant it. Maybe she should have used ""ho"", which means the same thing and which she also could have meant on some level. At least that way there would be fewer letters in the word, which is so much better.<br/><br/>Back home, Adelaide tidies up as Gabe watches baseball highlights and broods over the nice new car Josh bought. He says he'll see Adelaide later in the ""magic room"". Later in the evening, Gabe strikes a come-hither pose in the bedroom; he is prepared for sex. Unfortunately, Adelaide is brooding over a traumatic incident from childhood when she went to the carnival at the beach and was accosted by her clone, and she says she wants to go. They're talking about it when the power goes out and they discover a family standing like stick figures in their driveway, holding hands and wearing ankle-length red overalls and ugly sandals. Gabe is unprepared for a home intrusion; he's injured by his clone and the clones Get In.<br/><br/>The clones are lethal degenerates who are only capable of an extreme and unattractive version of the originals' tendencies at any given time. They communicate primitively - with clicks, grunts, and bellows more than words, and Adelaide's clone, Red appears to be the leader. Red tells her Forever Persecution Story and describes the rest of her family by their deficiencies. They all carry shears for the task of cutting themselves away from the originals (by killing them) so they can take over their home and have the good life. They clearly won't know what to do with the good life if they get it, though... At best they'll be surrounded by things they don't really know how to appreciate or maintain, the house will be filthy, and their social lives will be shallow and peculiar. With no sustainable lifestyle, no regular income, and no ability to navigate in the civilized world they'll eventually be arrested for tax evasion if not greater crimes.<br/><br/>After several skirmishes with the clones, Gabe's clone is dead and Gabe is limping. The Wilsons regroup and head to the Tylers' place by boat. But the Tylers have clones, too. After a night of heavy drinking, Kitty and Josh are quick to curse at each other and slow to respond to the home intrusion. Josh and the girls are swiftly killed to the sound of the Beach Boys playing in the background. Her throat half-cut now, Kitty drags herself miserably in a bloody smear along the floor. Josh's clone steps in her path and offers his hand to assist her then pulls it away (psych!), and runs it through his hair. It's funny because that's probably the kind of stupid jerk thing that Josh did when he was a kid, so he's retarded. Retarded Funny. Looking up at Josh's clone, Kitty says ""Please stop"" but then Ophelia (an alter-ego version of Alexa) responds ""Stopping 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys"" and the music simply stops. Desperately, Kitty gasps ""Ophelia, call the police"", but Ophelia misunderstands - she says ""Sure. Playing 'F- Tha Police' by N.W.A"" and the track starts playing as Kitty's clone finishes cutting her throat. It's funny because Ophelia had such a helpful and good-natured machine voice when she unhelpfully started that track. Or maybe it's funny because affluent white people wouldn't have N.W.A loaded in their music player to begin with. Or maybe it's funny because she was suffering and wanted help but got N.W.A instead. Or maybe it's just funny because we never really liked her. Funny, funny, funny, funny...<br/><br/>When they arrive, the Wilsons are confronted by the Tylers' clones, and Gabe kills the Josh clone outside in a boat. Adelaide is tied up by the Kitty clone so Zora has to brutally bash the Tyler girls with a golf club to the sound of the N.W.A track, and Jason has to kill the Kitty clone by bashing her over the head with a table ornament. The Wilsons turn on the news and see that there's a society-wide hostile takeover by clones. One argument and a couple Home Alone references later, they're headed to Mexico (in the Tylers' nice new car). It's funny when they factor in kill count while determining who gets to drive. Zora ends up driving briefly and she kills her own clone with the car.<br/><br/>Driving along the coastline, they reach the Santa Cruz beach where the Jason clone has rigged an explosive roadblock. Jason kills him in a fire and is kidnapped by Adelaide's clone, Red. Adelaide goes in pursuit and ends up facing Red in a facility located below some underground tunnels. Above ground, Gabe and Zora see a long line of clones standing side-by-side, silently holding hands. Gabe says ""What is that, some kind of f-ed up performance art?"" Zora rolls her eyes. Funny...<br/><br/>Red has an unduly grand self-image and proselytizes insane notions while making stick figure cut-outs. She tells her Forever Abandoned Story about how the clones were created only to be deserted when the project failed; left to go insane. She then transitions to her Forever Martyr Story about a single 'dance' recital she gave in which she flailed and contorted bizarrely, now collectively accepted as a 'pivotal' event that the clones cling to pathetically as evidence of her superiority among derelicts. (She's probably right though when she says they're human too) Adelaide flails in a violent dance with Red before finally getting the upper hand and choking her to death, then she rescues Jason from a locker he was trapped in.<br/><br/>The film ends with the Minnie Riperton R&B song ""Les Fleurs"": ""Inside every man / Lives the seed of a flower / If he looks within / He finds beauty and power"". As the Wilsons drive away in an ambulance, helicopters hover over a chain of fools standing hand-in-hand in a demonstration about how if we're not willing or prepared to clean up our own house, it'll be overrun by lesser versions of ourselves who then spread across the countryside like a virus."

"bob the moo","Null","1","2","22 September 2019"," Effective horror although the underlying subtext requires too much reaching and doesn't come off as smart as it could have been
","A lot of hype leading up to this film, the second film from Jordan Peele, and with a lot of expectation on it. I admit I too was looking forward to it after seeing the very strong trailer for it. Mostly the film met my expectations. It was not as relentless or as frightening as the trailer had suggested it may be, but it did still have its share of tense, horrific, and intense moments. The pace and style of the delivery makes it work well, and it builds pretty nicely in terms of scale. It is very much a genre film, but that in itself is not a measure of anything, because you can have good genre films and bad ones, and this is a good one.<br/><br/>While it is a horror, it also manages to have a good streak of dark humor running through it. The political element I think was less successful; some have been full of praise for how smart and daring it is, while others react negatively to what they perceive as a 'woke' film pushing an agenda. Personally I found interesting ideas in here but they don't hang together, unfold as the film progresses, or really give you something 100% concrete to then think back over. The ideas are not nothing though, and it is still interesting to read thoughts and theories about certain points, because they are 'interesting' but in the context of watching the film I didn't feel they were there in a meaningful way, and afterwards it did feel like I was reaching a bit to find them.<br/><br/>The direction and performances make a big difference in this. All of the leads are good in their own ways, mostly playing it strong in their two different characters. As everyone else has said, Lupita Nyong'o is by far the strongest in not only her two characters, but the range in which she plays the main one. I wonder if the various industry awards can look beyond the genre and see the performance(s) because it is certainly more worthy of awarding than some which are given to performances of 'worthy' characters. Whether she does or doesn't though, if there are other levels in this film, it is her that finds them more than any of the various political allegories in there.<br/><br/>So not as smart or as brilliant as the hype would have you believe, but it is still a well-crafted, interesting, and engaging horror that works mostly as a genre film, but has plenty in the style, direction, and performances to make it a quality one."

"kuarinofu","6","1","2","1 July 2019"," Tonal mess
","Nice premise, great start, a good attempt at building a sinister atmosphere, yeah, up to around 40 minutes. Then the movie shifts towards slasher comedy, providing a couple of genuine good laughs here and there, but in the long run, it just kills its own atmosphere. It slowly starts making less sense up to a point when it becomes clear that there is no way this plot can hold up or have a somewhat satisfying resolution.<br/><br/>
At around 1 hr mark the movie slows down and really starts to drag. At this point, you're just waiting to be disappointed and forget about it. The ending doesn't make any sense at all. The twist was so lame and predictable I was actually surprised they still went for it and it barely really changed anything.<br/><br/>
I guess the ending was supposed to provide social commentary about how community and environment make you what you are, about people's shadows being their dark sides (there are even a couple of creative shots). Even so, this was done in a very simplistic manner and in the end didn't matter much. I mean, I can come up with some ideas on what they were trying to tell, but the movie feels more like the writers cornered themselves and just came up with whatever stuff that first got into their heads.<br/><br/>
I enjoyed the first act though, nice music, fewer jump scares. The acting ranged from really good (Elisabeth Moss was amazing) and misdirected/confused (Evan Alex can't act scared at all).<br/><br/>
I think I'd still recommend this movie since it had some good scenes sprinkled throughout the movie, some good acting, two or three misplaced but actually funny jokes, even some tension. Well, at least I can surely recommend the first 40-50 minutes, after that you can just stick around and witness the nonsensical ending yourself :)"

","'Us' is the second film written and directed by Jordan Peele (the first being the awesomely-creepy 'Get Out') and I was pretty interested by what I'd heard online about his new film. A family goes on vacation, only to get stalked and attacked by an identical family - in every way!<br/><br/>I was going to see it no matter what, but I never got round to watching it in the cinema. However, from various online sources, not only did I get the impression that it was one of those films that people either absolutely loved or really despised, but also I basically learned the entire plot - practically beat for beat. So, by the time it came for me to watch it on the small screen, I knew everything that was going to happen, including the overall premise as to what was occurring in this unsettling world I was witnessing.<br/><br/>However, even though I'd deliberately removed all forms of 'mystique' from what was going on in the film, I still enjoyed it. Even though I sound like a bit of a hypocrite, I would recommend NOT finding too much about the plot before watching it. I've already given the briefest of synopsis and that should be all you'll need.<br/><br/>'Us' is a bit of a 'mish-mash' of genres. Overall it's a horror and, if you're looking into more of a 'sub-genre,' you could call it a 'home invasion' movie. However, this 'sub-genre' then changes into yet more variants of the overall horror theme.<br/><br/>The main cast are all believable as a unit and play off each other nicely and you won't question that these are a group of people who have lived (and put up with!) each other for many years.<br/><br/>What I liked about the film was the premise. Yes, it borrows from many sources, but the overall theme of what was really happening was original enough for me to really appreciate as something new and not a topic that had been done before (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!). Of course it's not perfect. One of the main reasons I saw people online saying it was far inferior to 'Get Out' was its lack of answers to some questions.<br/><br/>Like I say, the plot is pretty original, but with it brings many things you could ask yourself about how this all came to be. The film doesn't offer any answers and you could well not come up with any feasible ones yourself if you ponder too long on it.<br/><br/>However, almost all films require a certain element of 'suspension of disbelief' when it comes to enjoying them. For any horror fan out there who wants something a little different, just make sure you're in a forgiving mood and settle in for a really creepy premise which is well worth a watch."

","""Us"" (2019 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Adelaide and her family. As the movie opens, the screen informs us that ""there are many tunnels out there, with no known purpose"". We are told it is ""Santa Cruz, 1986"", and young Adelaide and her parents are at the amusement park, Adelaide drifts away from the park and end up in a hall or mirrors, where strange things start happening. We then switch to the ""Present Day"": Adelaide is now married and they have 2 kids, Zora and Jason. They are on their way to their vacation house near Santa Cruz. Husband Gabe talks her into going to the very same beach where Adelaide had that strange encounter, and Adelaide reluctantly gives in, as long as they come back before sunset. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the new movie from writer-director Jordan Peele, who surprised the world (and himself) with his fantastic debut film ""Get Out' (for which he deservedly won an Oscar for Original Screenplay). ""Us"" has equally been getting high praise, and to be honest, I am dumbfounded by it. I couldn't make heads or tails of the movie. It is not a scary movie. It is not a funny movie. So what is it then? Is this supposed to be some social commentary of sorts? If so, I have missed the message completely. Here is what I think: this movie purports to be ""high art"" but in fact falls far short of that. And then there is that stupid ending, which makes NO SENSE whatsoever, and simply made me wonder what the heck I just spent watching for the last two hours. It's a darn shame of all that talent that goes into the making of such a movie.<br/><br/>I was on the fence of going to see the movie but ultimately gave in when it became available on my MoviePass account. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (5 people, including myself). Of course the movie by now has been out for a month, so that is to be expected. Bottom lime: I just didn't care for this movie, but of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","For the first 30 minutes or so, Jordan Peele's follow-up to his behemoth smash ""Get Out"" is an intriguing, unpredictable family drama with tinges of understated suspense simmering below the surface. The familial dynamics are well established and the chemistry among the lead quartet is effectively lived-in, and that warmth heightens the mounting tension as the audience braces for the inevitable. However, once the plot kicks in, the tone takes a turn for the mediocre and it doesn't take long for the once-promising narrative to degenerate into a run-of-the-mill home invasion movie, whose hints of supernatural elements are never effectively deployed. By the time the movie's secrets unfurl in the climax, it's practically impossible not to be underwhelmed by the explanation's laziness, and that disappointment overpowers the extremely effective acting by its four leads. Lupita Nyong'o is extraordinary and she's well-matched by top-tier talent all around, and Peele's keen eye for shot composition remains just as sharp, but the movie's resolution leaves a stain across the board."

","On the tones of 'I got 5 on it', the hip-hop classic by Luniz, we get to know the Wilson-Thomas-family while they're on holiday down in sunny Santa Cruz. Perfectly normal, almost clich√É¬©. But things turn dark quickly when at night they're being assaulted by another family just like themselves (literally). Only these people have red jumpsuits and scissors. Yikes...<br/><br/>The delicious soundtrack by Michael Abels grabs you by the neck from minute one. With experimental combinations of instruments, infectious beats and eerie harmonies he creates a unique pallet of sounds and themes that guide the audience, always putting them on guard, never failing to impress. And where Abels' musical score for 'Get Out' never truly stands out, this score surely demands your attention and makes the film all the better for it.<br/><br/>I know it's hard to act. I also know it's even harder to have a double role. And this cast nailed it. Especially Lupita Nyong'o had me sympathise with her 'normal' character one moment, but left me terrified with her doppelg√É¬§nger the other. It was easy to forget these two characters were played by the same actress! Absolutely wonderful!<br/><br/>After the attack on the house and the slasher-part of the film, the scary parts are largely over and all that is left to do is watch how the plot is tied together. I can't say the twist at the end shocked me though. It felt like the logical conclusion of what had come before and that's fine.<br/><br/>But as much as I enjoyed the movie, the comic relief didn't always work for me. In 'Get Out' these occasional jokes are rather subtle, while in this one they truly broke with the tension of the scenes, pulling me out of the movie for a couple of seconds. Can't say I really enjoyed that.<br/><br/>But overall I think 'Us' is better acted, better edited and better scored than 'Get Out'. Jordan Peele delivered a great film that, without doubt, I'll watch again a couple of times in the (near) future."

","I was chatting about this film with my uber driver after seeing it and my initial reaction was that it was terrible. Now, having processed it, I wouldn't call it terrible. But certain things weren't executed very well at all.<br/><br/>The family's acting was good but the clones' acting was cringey as all get out. Once Red began to talk... These characters were supposed to be so sinister and help carry the plot but I couldn't take them seriously. That was one red flag.<br/><br/>Good cinematography for the duration, interesting concept for a thriller (definitely not a horror film). It starts off well, creeped me out, kept me interested. But it swiftly went down hill during the home invasion. It was a pivotal moment in the film that just ended up being goofy.<br/><br/>The corny humor killed any tension that had been built up every time. This was made worse by how slowly the film moved.<br/><br/>I would've preferred to see the focus on Adelaide's family and their clones instead of tackling government experiments, the holding hands thing that was just kind of there, and other clones as additional throwaway characters. None of these things were done justice, they were rushed. This was the biggest problem I had.<br/><br/>The family's clones had given up so many chances to kill their targets that the chase (and the movie in general) became boring. By the time the explanation and twist were revealed I'd already checked out.<br/><br/>The fact that the film has underlying themes and requires some thinking is not the problem. A thriller that gives some kind of social commentary still has to be effective at delivering thrills. I don't feel that ""Us"" was effective in that way. It barely delivered.<br/><br/>I should've waited to rent it instead of spending more money to go see it. And it wasn't the hype, it was the trailer that got me in the theater. It creeped me out more than the entire film.<br/><br/>Three stars for acting, concept, and cinematography.

","""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will bring evil upon them, which they'll not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken onto them"". The passage is right over everywhere in this film, its up to you to figure it out.<br/><br/>We begin in 1986 in Santa Cruz amusement park with little Adelaide confused and inquisitive about her environment, she proceeds to leave her family. The walk leads to the always hall of mirrors that gets these tales going. Move ahead 34 years, Adelaide and family go to (yes you guessed it) the woods. The usual horror/thriller etiquette takes place and well you probably know the result.<br/><br/>The initial quote above does have relevance in the film that we can interpret what the evil may be.

","I can't believe how, after such a good movie as Get Out, we are given this absolutely ridiculous and pretentious movie that makes 0 sense and it's only good for 15 minutes. Production is spot on (and I bet it was expensive too) but plot and script are so poorly done that the movie becomes unwatchable. Acting is OK, specially Lupita, but there's no depth in the characters and it's hard to know what the story attempts to deliver. The plot is pointless and ends up becoming a total mess of confusion. Looking at the audience around me last night I understand the hype and the 10/10 reviews. While I was regretting to be sitting down at the theatre, they seem to love all the unnecessary-not-funny jokes, and they even looked scared at times (I still wonder how was that even possible). I spent most of the movie either falling asleep or checking my watch to see how long I had to suffer. After almost an hour and a half of boringness, I decided to go home and not waste any more of my time (this must be the third movie I don't finish at a theatre). To give you an idea, Pet Sematary is a masterpiece compared to this. What a joke to get people's money after Get Out!"
"Michaelayeve","8","1","2","7 April 2019"," Jordan Peele has done it again
","After his first directors debut 2 years ago, I did not know what to expect from his second movie, US. Jordan Peele managed to make a name for himself back in 2017 by creating a refreshingly new and unique horror movie brining horror fans around the globe to marvel and discuss his award winning movie.<br/><br/>When I heard he was making a new movie, I had mixed feelings. After he spent many years writing get out, he had managed to write a new movie in less than a year. Many talented directors make the common mistake of rushing their second movie and not putting their soul into it, resulting in a disappointing second movie, which can damage their careers as the first two movies are crucial part of becoming a visionary modern phenomenon.<br/><br/>However I should have not been worried. Jordan Peele seems to have mastered the act of filmmaking in a short period of time. His second movie is quite frankly, as good, or even better in some aspects than his first movie.<br/><br/>Us is a movie that explores one of the biggest fears of Jordan Peele's mind. What happens if you could see, yourself? He puts his fear on the big screen in a fresh and disturbing way, due to his unique writing and directing skills, and everyone else who worked on the movie with a clear passion for what they do. But the performances of the actors within this movie were exceptional.<br/><br/>All the actors in the movie did a fantastic job. There was not a single moment where I was pulled out of the movie because of a slip up or unconvincing portrayal of one's character. But there was an actor, or should I say actress whose performance is worthy of winning an Oscar.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o's performance is not one I will be forgetting anytime soon. Portraying a single role requires a copious amount of experience, dedication, and perseverance. But due to the nature of the movie, she had to deal with playing the characters of two characters in one movie. Both of which felt completely different from the other, with Adelaide being relatable and human, and red sending shivers down your spine, the two characters couldn't be any more different.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was perfected too. Michael Abels, a 56 year old musician's first movie was get out, which he delivered a simplistic but memorable score, but with US, he managed to create such a disturbed masterpiece which suits the movie perfectly. It is a score that will burden your head for the next couple of days after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>
From what I'm saying so far, this review seems to be a subjective 10/10. Not quite. The movie does have its flaws, which I cannot get into details due to spoilers, but one thing I would like to talk about is the ambiguity of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT for everyone. If you're looking for a movie to fill your 2 hours with a little bit of horror, this movie may not be what you're looking for. There are barely any jump scares throughout the movie, and the movie is very ambiguous. If you do not pay attention, the movie will not make any sense. This is a movie that requires you to pay all your attention, to every little detail, every little conversation, and one which is designed to spark conversations and debates. If you do not like the idea of having to figure out key parts of the movie on your own, this may not be for you.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has everything that most horror fans will appreciate, but does get a little too ambiguous at times which could cause confusion amongst casual audience goers.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ayrton_seno","3","1","2","6 April 2019"," Horror genre outlook is the real horror here

"Lewis_Heather787","5","1","2","5 April 2019"," Disappointed!
","The problem for this film and for Jordan Peele in particular is the bar that he set with 2017's ""Get Out"", I assumed that this film would at least be at the same level if not a bit better. However this film unfortunately missed the mark completely with me, its just a real let done because I think I found the trailer to this film more interesting than the film itself.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong even though I didn't like the film there are still some good aspects to it. Firstly Jordan Peele's directing is impeccable once again and actually shows some different directing techniques than he does in ""Get Out"", from start to finish he definitely excels in this regard. Another area of positivity is the performances across the board are great Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke have fantastic chemistry on screen, as does the rest of the family. As soon as the film starts you by into the family dynamic. Also Elizabeth Moss and her family are also good in moments and definitely are in some of the more interesting scenes.<br/><br/>However the positivity, for me at least, around this film has ended. I am going to fully admit that I don't think I understood everything that went on in the film. That was the biggest problem the fact that I was always trying the catchup film the film because I spent half the time trying to understand what was going on. Now don't get me wrong I love ambiguity in films, but when its taken over the edge it doesn't work.<br/><br/>The main thing for me is that I just found the story so boring and never got invested in the main story of the Dopplegangers of the family, it just went over my head. I wanted the film to end, which is such a shame because was really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Although I said there is lots of ambiguity in the film there are also a lot of horror film cliches that you see coming a mile off and are nothing new or refreshing. In some ways, I know you should never compare because they are nothing alike, but this film couldn't be more the opposite to ""Get Out"". Which I suppose is good because it shows the Peele is trying something different however I think he might over stepped the mark in this one.<br/><br/>Overall its 55% out of 100 I'm so on the fence about this film, there are a few good qualities to the film but overall I didn't enjoy the experience. There is nothing to hate about the film but also there is nothing to love about it either. Very confusing and uninteresting story with some good directing and great characters, makes for a very jumbled up film."

","Jordan Peele's follow up to his hugely successful ""Get Out"" is another horror film that has something to say about the world and how we see each other. This time though, the message is a little more overt and the plot a little more contrived which leave ""Us"" in the good/not great bracket.<br/><br/>Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family visit a beach resort town, which was the site of a childhood trauma for her, as she went briefly missing from the funfair when she was a child. Her paranoia and feelings of dread grow across the day, until the evening, when the family notice another family standing on the edge of the driveway. To their horror and disbelief, the second family are their exact doubles.<br/><br/>It's going to be difficult to talk about my perceived failings with ""Us"" without drifting further into spoiler territory that I am usually willing to do in my reviews. I'll start with the positives then. The principle cast are great. Away from Adelaide's increasing paranoia they feel like a realistic family with plausible interactions between each other. I loved Winston Duke as Gabe, the father in the family. The Music is great, the film is often quite funny and the camera work is dynamic and interesting. The early part of the interactions between the families is genuinely creepy as is the sense of dread that inhabits the initial part of the film is palpable.<br/><br/>I get the allegorical nature of the story, and I appreciate that. The class differences that display between us can often be traced to a few, or even just one decision that ends up defining a person. Or even just an accident of birth location. The Mexican or Polish person ""coming for your job"" isn't some sort of monster, they are a human being with wants, needs and dreams just like you. They are ""us"".<br/><br/>Where it falls down is as the film opens up. Spoilers ahead !<br/><br/>Somehow, the horror situation becomes less scary as the scope becomes larger. It's the difference between a slasher movie and a Zombie movie, neither a less valid but one speaks to individual fears and the other societal horrors. At the same time, logically, the film begins to breakdown here. It's just impractical to live underground your whole life, eating nothing but Rabbit and function properly. The rules of ""tethering"" seem pretty ill-defined too, as sometimes they mirror above as below, and sometimes not.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, not at all - I enjoyed my time with it, but it does leave you with more questions that it answers."

This thing was awful. They would have been much better off abandoning ship, even after completion, and reshooting some scene-tweaks in order to spoof the genre. They could have ended up with something great, in fact, because the acting is quite good, considering a poor script and even poorer plot. I'm in my mid fifties; I can't think of any age at which I would have enjoyed this movie. The theater was largely full, and there were a couple twenty-year-old guys next to us who were busting up, early on, which is exactly what I wanted to do, but like the rest of us, resigned themselves to silence out of respect for those who were holding out hope for this dog.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor--figure it for a spoof, and let yourself laugh out loud at it.

","My Rating : 7/10<br/><br/>'Get Out' was a genius movie from Jordan Peele and 'Us' tries to cover similar grounds however due to it's confused, incoherent and childish execution it makes for a good 'instant gratification' horror movie albeit not a timeless classic.<br/><br/>I recommend watching it, there are many interesting theories floating about explaining all the smaller details and symbolisms and that makes it a worthwhile watch - every viewer can take away something and come up with their own way of looking at it.<br/><br/>Good background score and constant tension elevate the movie and keep the viewer engaged. Downside is that it's not exactly a classic Mobius strip like it aims to be - a la 'Lost Highway' or 'Timecrimes' or 'Donnie Darko'."

"rustonreviews","6","1","2","1 April 2019"," A solid sophomore effort.
","Jordan Peele, primarily known for his work in comedy, made waves throughout the horror scene in 2017 with his directorial debut Get Out; a tightly written, intense horror/thriller that impressed both audiences and critics alike. Peele's sophomore effort, Us, centers around a family as they retreat to their lovely beach house in Santa Cruz for a holiday. Adelaide (Nyong'o) remains trepidatious about the getaway, plagued by an incident from her childhood that occurred there. Gabe (Duke), her carefree, fun-loving husband, encourages her to just relax and enjoy their time there, oblivious to the threat Adelaide knows is out there somewhere. All hell then breaks loose when a family of twisted, murderous doppelgangers arrive outside their house, standing on their driveway hand in hand. What begins as a fun family holiday morphs into a horrifying night of unexplainable terror, in which Adelaide and her family must fight and kill their evil doppelgangers to ensure their survival.<br/><br/>With Us, Peele cements his status as a director to watch. There is a lot to like about Us, but there are several things that hold the film back from reaching the heights of Get Out. Front and centre of the film is an outstanding lead performance by Lupita Nyong'o. She's absolutely fantastic and nails both performances excellently, capturing both the twisted malevolence of Adelaide's doppelganger and the frightened desperation of Adelaide herself as she strives to protect her family and end the terror once and for all. Winston Duke is great fun as Gabe, too. Unlike Get Out, Us is a straight up horror film that falls more into the league of the slasher subgenre, abandoning the thriller aspects rife in Peele's debut and going for straight up murderous mayhem that, once it gets going, rarely stops. As for the doppelganger family, they're certainly a menacing screen presence, especially the brother, who's face is obscured behind a mask that appears to have been riffed from The Orphanage (2007).<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were elements of the film that I felt did not quite work as strongly. Humour in horror is difficult to pull off (1998's Bride of Chucky is a perfect example of horror-comedy done right), and in Us, there are sometimes moments of comedy inserted in places that rob the film of its scare factor. There is a particular plot point introduced in the film, roughly around the half way point, that frustratingly diminishes the unnerving, sinister mystique of the doppelganger family that was constructed so brilliantly in the films first act. As that plot point develops, I found myself slowly losing interest in the overall premise of the film. Ultimately, it all leads to a twist that, after some thought, doesn't quite stick the landing as well as it could have done. It is during the third act in which it all begins to falter. Peele displays plenty of interesting ideas here, but they're not as cohesively executed as his concepts in Get Out were, resulting in a rather muddled finale.<br/><br/>Us is a solid second film from Peele, though it's not as strong as his debut. It is an interesting film, for sure, and may be a film that benefits from repeat viewings, but it really is Nyong'o's outstanding central performance that holds the whole film together."

Cons
<ul><li>some pretty major plot holes</li><li>'dumb' actions that are convenient for the writer but no real person would actually take</li><li>never really comes full circle</li><li>the second half seemed directionless, meandering without much purpose, and then adding some pseudo-intelectual symbolisms that are really only there to mask the fact that the script was not ready yet.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall: 6.5
I think Jordan needed a little more time to fiddle with the script before moving forward. Get Out was tight and that's why it worked so well."
"best_ps","2","1","2","31 March 2019"," Disappointing cinema
","The movie is classified as horror genre, but during the entire duration I was looking for a scene which would justify this. I agree that movie has a story even though a pretty lame one but I didn't get what I was expecting from it. Duality of scissors, rabbits signifying test subjects and Jason's skeptical mask are few constant symbols in the movie."
"chill-00738","6","1","2","30 March 2019"," So close, yet so far
","Let me keep this simple and void of spoilers. The acting was top-notch. The cinematography was fantastic. The soundtrack truly superb. Then there is the story, it just simply falls flat. There was an overly explained story arc that was riddled with holes and in my opinion knocks you over the head with the message trying to be conveyed. In my humble opinion, a film such as this is far more effective with the use of subtlety and a bit of vague storytelling. We don't always need to know where the ""monster"" comes from."

","What's left of our humanity, if there's not a single grain of soul left in our bodies?
Pure naked violence, we turn into beasts, animals. Slipping of values of civilization quicker than a dirty shirt. In my opinion that's the most frightening aspect of this movie, because it's more or less the times we're living in now, a world loosing its coordinate system of moral values and human identity. The good turn bad, the bad are the real good one's, the ground under our feet is shaking, safety about who you really are and could be is vanishing.
Unfortunately the many plot twists, (with the inevitable plot holes in this genre), seem over constructed and come with a lack of credibility, in spite of the fact that the whole cast does a great job here.
Entertaining, but it left me a bit disappointed in the end."

"Tempest7","6","1","2","27 March 2019"," Huge let down! Peele still shows promise though.
","I'll do my best to avoid any spoilers, but I need to vent a bit haha. Us was such an infuriating movie for me. It was one of my most anticipated films of the year, and I wanted so badly to love it, but it was so frustrating and dissapointing I couldn't believe it. It definitely was not all that it should have been. The setup in the first third was amazing, and even afterwards there were bits of brilliance sprinkled throughout as well as a lot of genuinely funny sequences and lines (Peele's talent is undeniable, and his roots in comedy are easy to recognize). However, (mild spoilers) from the moment the tethered sat down with the family in the living room, and Lupita Nyongo's doppleganger started talking in that stupid af voice, the movie took a sharp turn for the nonsensical and stupid and it was never really able to recover. The ending was all kinds of bad and seemed determined to make no sense whatsoever. The twist was obvious from the first scene (which maybe was intentional but probably not) and was actually super poorly handled and then beat over our heads. In fact, at times it honestly felt like Peele thought the audience was retarded.<br/><br/>That said, I'll give some credit where it's due, this film is much more interesting than most typical mainstream horror films we get these days. It's also 10x more ambitious and undeniably original (though it still does fall back on cliches now and then). Peele is exploring some very clever ideas, but unfortuneately they are never paid off in any satisfying way. It seems to be trying to say something about class warfare and the United States, as well as the mistake of not pursuing one's dreams, but the messages/takeaways never become even remotely clear. They're quickly abandoned in any case for what turns into a mostly rudimentary survival thriller (with much better than average comedy). It utterly fails at being either a horror film or a sci-fi film, as it's not scary and the sci-fi elements are laughably contrived and mishandled. With that said, even though the film isn't as accomplished as it should be, it still might have worked, or at least been more effective, if Peele had either explained more to the audience or made things much more ambiguous. As it stands, the plausibility of the several of the key reveals that shape the foundation of the story don't hold up for a second, and as a result the whole movie ends up failing in a big way because you can no longer take the premise seriously. Even worse, the few throwaway lines that do attempt to explain away some of these issues feel like afterthoughts, and instead of providing compelling answers they really only make things more confusing and less believable. This really hurts the film because we are expected to just accept them and move on but they're much too distracting and ultimately ruin an otherwise engaging and exceptionally well crafted movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Us was a major let down and I can't say that I enjoyed it. However, while Peele's reach clearly exceeded his grasp on this one, I'll still be first in line for his next movie because I honestly really liked Get Out (seriously, Get Out was so amazing and 100% polished. I can't believe he immediately went on to make this). Even with the flaws of Us, Peele continues to show a ton of promise as a horror filmmaker, and since horror is my favorite genre and I admittedly think he's a really cool dude and have been a big fan of his since his Comedy Central days, I'm being honest when I say I would actually love to see him succeed at making solid and kickass horror movies for decades. Maybe he really could be this generation's Hitchcock. Time will tell. Unfortunately, the chance of that may be diminished by the perplexing and overwhelmingly positive response to this movie, as it seems to have a seriously bad case of the emperor's new clothes going on. I'm hoping the hype dies down around this film and people start seeing it for what it is, a well intentioned misfire littered with pacing and structural issues and a bunch of underdeveloped ideas that have no payoff. Though with the tidal wave of praise and positive validation Us is recieving, I worry Peele won't feel the need to course correct at all and won't learn from any of his mistakes. Let's hope this isn't the case and his next film is a return to form.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>(Get Out was an easy 9/10 for me)."
"craigthomas90","6","1","2","27 March 2019"," Oooohhhh so close!
","Flat out, I was bored more than anything else. So many aspects of this movie embody incredible creepy themes and imagery but, a cohesive explanation as to the overall motivation of these acts are missing. Without a doubt, if you have half a brain which we all do, you can assume many things and probably be right but, is that where the fun is? The beauty about horror movies, is having the darkest aspects of our imaginations titilated. This movie came so close! The actors are amazing(the dad is a little annoying). The scenes are classically horror. If the story was fleshed out a little more, this would be another Oscar nomination on Peele's resume."
"minnguy64","4","1","2","26 March 2019"," Not nearly as good as the hype

The acting was OK, but if you do go make sure you have extremely low expectations or better yet wait until it comes out on redbox.<br/><br/>Not very scary with a story filled with plot holes and an unfulfilling ending make this a very weak film. Giving it a 4 - I think Hollywood can do a lot better than this."
"alexdu_99","7","1","2","26 March 2019"," Another way to see it.

Make your own conclusion if you like it or not."

","Us is made by Jordan Peele (the guy who made Get Out) and it is really good.

I personally think the movie slows down a little in the middle but then picks itself up again. Overall, I would highly recommend."
"shahidafzal86","7","1","2","26 March 2019"," Could have been better..but not too bad
","Seeing the trailer to this film and also enjoying Get Out made this a must visit to pictures.
Film started off well but after the other families doppelgangers came out it went silly. I can watch far fetched stuff and it doesn't bother (like Get Out) but to be showing a whole human race of people living underground who can be accessed through some mirror house just killed it for me.
Also the guy stood on the beach with his hands out. How do the people live off rabbits? Their clothes? The scissors?
It wasn't awful and had some entertaining scenes. In particular the first meeting with the thetereds. If you look at it from metaphoric arty view it may cut it for you but I think it wasn't executed right.
The twist at the end wasn't good either and just raised more questions but I could go on and on with the many holes in this movie.

"ethanbeard","8","1","2","25 March 2019"," Peele is back, and he hits it out of the park!
","Jordan Peele is back and he does not disappoint! Before you read this review, you should know that I am not a fan of horror films and I get scared very easily. I was a big fan of Get Out and although even the concept of seeing this new film terrified me, I just HAD to see what Peele had in store this time.<br/><br/>The cast was absolutely phenomenal. Lupita Nyong'o is the definite stand-out as she plays the protagonist, Adelaide, and the antagonist, Red. Her performances as both characters were convincing and moving; it's hard to take your eyes off her. Playing her husband, Gabe, is Winston Duke, who provides the funniest lines in the film and adds some much needed comedic relief when things start getting serious. The two children, Zora and Jason, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex respectively, were also really great and were compelling as both their normal selves as well as their evil counterparts. Even the minor supporting roles were excellent.<br/><br/>While the film is scary at times, it often feels more like a thriller than a flat-out horror film. This is why, for me, the comedy stood out as a very strong point in this film. Unlike most horror films, Peele knows when to use comedy to lighten the mood and understands the appropriate situations for characters to take a breather and crack jokes. Again, Winston Duke is the highlight in this section, but each character gets their own moment of humour.<br/><br/>The cinematography was well done for the most part. There were times where the film felt like it was simply shot, and not thought out compositionally and aesthetically, however there were some excellent shots in this film and really great use of colour, especially towards the end of the film. Like I said earlier, the film was scary, but not terrifying like it was marketed. As someone who gets scared easily, this is a positive for me. For die-hard horror fans, this will likely be a negative aspect of the film as it only has a handful of instances of true gross-out horror. The film was very well paced and felt like it flowed naturally, however the film changes slightly in its third act and, in my opinion, makes the third act the weakest. The first act is very effective at setting up the characters and situations. The second act is the most enjoyable to watch as the film descends into pure chaos while the Wilson's fight their respective doubles. The third act, however, presents the final confrontation of Adelaide and Red and, while it is very enjoyable to watch (especially one scene in particular featuring ballet that is very well edited), this is when the film starts to explain its plot. One of my hopes for this film was that it would end with most of the mystery still unanswered, leaving fans to debate about its true nature for years to come. While this film will certainly spark conversations once it ends, the third act begins explaining what is really happening in the film and this is where many of the problems come in. I won't spoil the film here, but certain things feel over-explained and I wish there was more subtlety, whereas other things aren't given enough explanation and I was left confused. Honestly, had the ending been a little more subtle with its explanations and the horror be slightly more scary, this film would've been perfect.<br/><br/>Just like Get Out, the best thing about this film is its writing and directing. Peele is in full control of his craft in this film, and it shows. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation due to its incredible writing (as well as a unique-if predictable-twist), and the directing leaves you feeling like you have been brought into Jordan Peele's nightmare. Everything in the film is so purposeful and thought out, it really feels like Peele's unaltered vision, which is something truly exciting to see.<br/><br/>All in all, Us is a fantastic film from beginning to end, though not without its flaws. I am certainly looking forward to seeing more from Peele, who has now cemented himself as one of the best directors working today."

"sohn717","6","1","2","23 March 2019"," I want to love this movie so badly!
","When I saw just the trailer to the film, it stayed in an ambiguously supernatural territory, and the raised questions sparked my intrigue, my imagination and psychological tension. What are these entities are and where they come from? Are they from a shadow dimension that parallels our own? Are they mirroring demonic entities? Are they manifestations of the dark parts of our own identities that somehow severed from the characters' souls? I got really excited at all the possibilities.
...but I was a little disappointed when it went into sci-fi territory. Peele doesn't outright say they were clones, but it was alluded. I hate to label Us as science fiction, but when it enters that territory, it raises a list of logistical questions that can't go unanswered... And I love a film shrouded in ambiguity, but science fiction requires answers, at least before the credits roll... Makes me WISH the film was the (perhaps Lovecraftian) quantum fiction that was in my mind when I saw the trailer.<br/><br/>Seeing Lupita Nyong'o play these two roles was a joy, and the film still exuded Jordan Peele's creative vision and sense of fun. I still can't wait to see what he comes out with next."
"Kristamw","7","1","2","22 March 2019"," Very Convoluted
","First, let me say that there are two things that stood out to me from this film, aside from the obvious omnipresence of scissors. One: The idea of PTSD. And Two: The soundtrack. I will get to both later, but I must mention some spoilers at the end, for I do not see how to skirt around them. Also, the first 45 minutes are very low key; action doesn't happen until halfway in.
Writing Quality/Character Development: More convoluted than Get Out, this movie seems to be Jordan Peele's motivation piece for creating complicated parallel plot points that are so puzzling that you must be willing to expect the strangest most obscure figment of his imagination. The characters don't develop as much as shock us. This isn't a story about character growth, it's a story about the uncanny.
Values: Underground experiments. Family sticking together.
Content (Sex, language & violence): No sex, minimal sparse language, lots of violence.
Scare Factor/Suspense: Maybe one or two jump scares, but Peele's focus is on unfolding one layer after another of this complicated and very dark mystery. What scares us are the strange movements of the ""shadows"", their animal guttural sounds, and the threatening scissors.
The music: Hair-raising and magnifies the isolated events with its screechy pitches and later a blend of high pops over deep guitar riffs.
Bonus: The dog is extra eerie.
Twist: The twist is very unexpected and changes your whole perception of what you thought was happening.
SPOILERS:
What we thought was PTSD was really just a pretense--such a bummer as I thought the movie could have served a stronger purpose if there hadn't been a switch between little girls.
Confusions: How is it that no one else came into the house of mirrors? Why didn't ""Red"" teach anyone else to speak? Why do they mimic people above ground? How does Red know it was a government project? How was little Red intelligent enough and clever enough to trade places with the real Adelaide? And, what's with the 'tethering'? Peele, in a one minute interview, explains that the film explores our ""duality"" and the ""guilt and sins we bury deep"". Still, it's difficult to see that connection as there is such a strange disconnect. We see Jeremiah 11:11 a few times, which, when you look it up, says: ""Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them""--so this supports Peele's intent. Yet, we don't see the sins of the real family, so it's hard to appreciate his idea. And the person we are supposed to be rooting for turns out to be the villain. I probably have more questions, but this is enough of a list."

The entire plot is a great foreshadowing for what the new Twilight Zone will be like. Admittedly, the beginning is a little slow, but once Us picks up, it never slows down.

The ending, on the other hand, where all the people are holding hands and are around the place or land, was something I did not understand, or felt it was not necessary. I don't know how to explain it, but it felt like it was unnecessary.
The movie, overall, was great! It was pretty cool.
I would say Get Out is more better than this, but this was still a great movie!"

"mnpollio","9","2","7","14 February 2020"," Undeniably creepy enigma
","During a trip to a boardwalk amusement park as a child, young Adelaide Wilson wanders away from her parents and into a strange hall of mirrors where something terrified her. Years later, Adelaide is a married mother of two children and is a bit skittish when her husband wants to meet up with friends at the same beach. A string of coincidences and portents leave Adelaide more than a little uneasy. Even worse, that night back at the vacation house, the family is besieged by four malevolent doppelgangers brandishing sharp scissors who seem to want to destroy them.<br/><br/>Anyone wondering what filmmaker Jordan Peele had up his sleeve after the success of Get Out, need wonder no more. As to whether Us equals or surpasses the earlier film, will be up to the respective viewer. That said, the film is undeniably ambitious and creepy. The film looks fantastic and has a sense of the surreal right from the start. The viewers are allowed to tap into Adelaide's unease and the film has the viewer off balance long before the unsettling action begins.<br/><br/>The attack on the house and the dynamic between the different characters and their doubles is scary and disconcerting. Many questions abound. Are these doppelgangers only after the Wilson family or is it more widespread? What do they want? Where did they come from? Why is any of this happening? Some of the questions get answered and some remain enigmas. Undoubtedly if one dwells too much on the details about ""the tethered"" and their existence, one can spot weaknesses, but Peele gives just enough detail without going overboard and allowing us to do too much questioning. Truthfully just the concept of us all having shadow beings that despise us is jarring.<br/><br/>The film is violent without being disgusting. The attack scenes pack quite a wallop, but some of the quieter scenes can be even eerier and more disturbing. For instance, watching Elisabeth Moss's double grotesquely smiling while indulging in lip gloss while alternately threatening a woman cuffed to a bed is a bit nightmarish. As is the strange way the doubles have of speaking or communicating.<br/><br/>Winston Duke is a lot of fun as Dad Wilson and his intimidating double. However, the film would not succeed at all if not for the amazing performance from Lupita Nyong'o as Adelaide. Essentially playing two markedly different roles, Nyong'o manages to be initially frightened and sympathetic as Adelaide before graduating to a tough and resourceful fighter determined to protect her family at all costs. As her double, Red, Nyong'o is scary as hell - speaking in some kind of combination between a hiss and a gasp. We may not be able to discern Red's ultimate plan, but she leaves us no doubt that it does not bode well for humanity and it will cause the most pain as possible. This is a really incredible performance which received raves, but was completely overlooked in awards season, which is inexcusable.<br/><br/>While I figured out the twist involving one of the main characters before its revelation, I was in the dark for a lot of the film and I mean that in a good way. I also had the feeling that literally anything could happen to anyone, so the stakes were high. The up-in-the-air ending a la The Birds will probably not sit well with everyone and there are still questions left unanswered, but the ride is worth taking and the film should be allowed to take its place in the pantheon of terrific ambitious thrillers that seem to be cropping up with some frequency."

","One of the most unexpected and surprising directional careers continues with Us, a new social commentary horror/thriller from one time comedy kingpin Jordan Peele, who proves once and for all that the worldwide box office and critical success of his debut film Get Out was no fluke.<br/><br/>Taking the well-worn and tiresome home invasion concept and flipping it on its head with a devilishly unique concept filled with doppelgangers, underground horrors and N.W.A, Us sees Peele evolve his filmmaking craft to a new level with his darkly realised vision of America, dastardly humour and ability to create nerve shredding tension on display throughout this cinematically polished outing.<br/><br/>It's a joy to sit back and witness Peele create the mood and tension that drives Us through its two hour runtime, from an eerily ominous opening in a 1986 Santa Cruz beach-side, its home invasion with a difference through to its bonkers/brilliant final act, Us is the type of film that can only be made by a director with confidence in their intent, that is most surely evident throughout Peele's wild ride with Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke's Adelaide and Gabe Wilson and their children Zora and Jason as the seemingly everyday American family find themselves terrorised by horrific versions of themselves.<br/><br/>The idea the drives Us is quite out there but thanks to the conviction of Peele and his cast, who all get to play double duties as their normal everyday selves and horrifying counterparts (that grunt, crawl and genuinely behave very badly) you barely get a moments respite from the terror of the situation that never lets up once it arrives on one quiet night in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Much like he did with Get Out, unearthing a career making turn from Daniel Kaluuya, Peele extracts a fantastic central turn from Nyong'o in particular who excels in her duel role as Adelaide and Red. Both menacing, vulnerable and totally in control, it's the type of genre turn that elevates proceedings to the next level and one of those performances that helps Us become the memorable outing it is.<br/><br/>There's no doubt Us sees Peele grow as a director (a sequence featuring a Beach Boys classic as its core is likely to remain one of the year's best individual scenes), his ambition is on show throughout, the pacing is methodically plotted out, the tension constantly there and his storytelling more layered than even Get Out and you get the sense that as his confidence grows as both a man in the director's chair and the man behind the story, Peele's career as a Hollywood filmmaker is likely to be one of the most fruitful and interesting of the modern era.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>You may've seen films like Us but there's no doubt Peele has crafted a unique, thrilling and frightfully entertaining horror outing that feels like an entirely new beast. Filled with solid acting turns, moody and abundant atmosphere and some wildly inventive ideas, Us is a film deserving of its success and further proof that Peele has quickly become one of the most interesting filmmakers currently operating.<br/><br/>4 Home Alone references out of 5"

Now they seem to be kind of zombie-ish mimicking our behaviour, except one, the twinner of the main character, Adelaide, and she has a story to tell, and it is so good! Ok so, at the beginning the audience is told about secret and abandoned tunnels all over the country, so I assume this is where our twinners live, however I also noticed in the familys home video collection they have a copy of C.H.U.D.

"masonfisk","6","2","7","25 March 2019"," I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR SECONDS...!
","Jordan Peele's much anticipated follow-up to his Oscar winning smash is a bit of a sophomore slump which is a shame given the fact a recent Rolling Stone article had him detailing how he watched other filmmakers second string outings to avoid the case but unfortunately his over-reliance on a world encompassing narrative falls short due to logistical problems & issues of character motivations which in total seem harebrained rather than organic in execution. Its 1986 & an African American family are at the boardwalk when the daughter decides to do some exploring finding herself in a house of mirrors where she encounters a doppelganger of herself which leaves her traumatized & unable to speak. Flash forward 30 years, the girl is now a grown woman w/a family unit of her own (hubby & 2 kids, a boy & girl) out on a vacation which finds them (you guessed it!) back on the same beach from years before which leads to series of events where twins of themselves appear to wreck havoc on the world at large & our family has to step up to meet this existential wrinkle to their very being. And this for me is where the film starts to fall apart where the lookalikes, who are imposing their will to survive over their originals, impart a murderous spree upon the populace but the motivations (especially after we find out who the defacto leader is) become specious & crudely drawn. When the film sticks to its chamber horror conventions (the 1 family being terrorized by their 1 set of duplicates) it works but when we see the global implications of the ending (ala The Birds) the ambiguous ending seems ill thought out & hard to swallow but seeing this movie will make its money back (it made $70 mil in its opening week & debuted at number 1) hopefully the filmmakers will use that knowledge to improve their next effort (storywise) instead of wallowing in the land of easy expectations & quick profits."

Sure, like any movie, plot holes exist. but sometimes I rely on the mere fact it is a movie. not everything NEEDS to be explained. others- draw need for your imagination to play.

Without giving too much away, a clone attempts to murder its ""twin.""
That said, there are more questions than answers, and that doesn't do well for a movie that seems to have a lot to say. Unfortunately, it's really buried in some...higher message about mindless underground population that seems to want the world back. Not sure about that. But it does leave you with an uneasy feeling that the hollowed out. I'm not sure if I'm suppose to be scared, or thrilled or what..but it really is dark humored and...well, sometimes satirizes itself.
Look, Jordan Peele is the best under the age of 50 filmmaker we got now. And you know he loves movies because this film is full of horror movie references, but he nails a true horror movie, only...the BIGGEST let down is that you feel one small detail would make it absolutely perfect. And that is frustrating."

","I saw ""Us"", starring Lupita Nyongo-Black Panther, Star Wars:Episode 7_The Force Awakens; Winston Duke-Black Panther, Person of Interest_tv; Shahadi Wright Joseph-making her theatrical movie debut and Evan Alex-Mani_tv, Sesame Street_tv.
This is Jordan Peele's next movie to direct, after his successful 'Get Out'. He is also the writer and producer. I'll try not to give too much away-it's better that you don't know too much before seeing it-but what you have probably seen in the trailers is just the tip of the iceberg. Lupita and Winston are a married couple with two children, Shahadi and Evan. The story takes place in the present and in flashbacks to 1986. The family decides to take a summer vacation at a beach house in Santa Cruz, California. Problems arise when doppelgangers show up. During the flashbacks, you learn that Lupita had a traumatic experience that comes back to haunt her in the present-hint, hint, it involves the doppelgangers, who are trying to kill them. Each of the four main actors also play their own doppelgangers, only more psychotically enhanced-they are really hard to kill, too. The details of where they came from, what they want, why they are doing what they are doing, etc. are all explained briefly, but not in enough details for my tastes-I wish they would have gone into more background. The way the doppelgangers move, talk and act are all really creepy.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-ray."

It was meant to be a horror film that resonates with the audience because there a simple truths of the reality of the human experience within the film. Whether it's the overarching theme of duplicity and duality or the more minor themes of self entrapment, it transcends the traditional horror slasher rules and makes you think. The movies isn't scary until you truly think about. You essentially begin to jump down your own rabbit hole of conclusions and theories. I also love how Peele hasn't really come out and explained many things in the film because he leaves it up to viewers interpretation.

"johngeirmundsson","10","2","8","30 April 2019"," Incredible film that will be discussed for years to come
","Although any people have been confused by this film is, that is not a result of the film itself but due to a misconception people had going into the theatre. The film discusses complex ideas about morals, identity, and the blurred lines between the two. It is at times bizarre and strange, yet this is a benefit of the film not a disadvantage. The shot of the many thousands of rabbits confused me. Yet what was the intent of the shot? To provoke something? If that is indeed true then it succeeded. That may then be the entire point of the film. To provoke reaction, intellectual and otherwise. What was the inherent meaning of the film? That's something that should be discussed at an intellectual level and I don't think I can answer that. The film is and only could be disappointing if you entered the film hoping for a film such as The Strangers (not to discredit that film). It isn't a claustrophobic thriller, it isn't an art-house experimental film, it isn't Get-Out 2, it is very unique in what it is. Peele should go on to have a long career from this and his previous film. Is he the next M Night Shyamalan? Is he the next John Carpenter. Perhaps not. But is that a negative? Truly its not a movie you should watch on Netflix at three o'clock in the morning to. It requires a level of involvement. Whether you like the movie or not is entirely up to you. However, it should be less looked as a block buster simply to enjoy and more as a level of literature worthy of being discussed in 'fancy' schools."

","I've already read some fantastic reviews but feel compelled to add another positive one to counteract the poor and misinformed negative reviews on here.<br/><br/>I went into this film as cold as possible, expecting a psychological horror with underlying social commentary, so was always on the look out for metaphors; I believe that this mindset was a contributing factor in my overall enjoyment. Unfortunately, it seems that a lot of people were expecting a more coherent, spoon fed plot so were left disappointed.<br/><br/>If you are prepared to consider the human condition and the grim reality of government and media control, then I can't recommend this film enough. Jordan Peele is a genius and I am grateful that he has found an outlet to convey his messages so that we can all enjoy a much more cerebral and thought provoking cinema experience, as opposed to the tripe which is usually churned out for the brain dead masses (ironically).<br/><br/>*possible spoiler*<br/><br/>In the third act, Red explains that 'the tethered' were a failed government experiment, created to control the masses. Before this explanation was provided, I had already understood (imo) that they represented our own repressed flaws which we would rather not self reflect upon, preferring to represent our best selves. This was just one of the many messages I took from this film; self reflection is a depressing but important process, and should not be overlooked. I just can't recommend this film enough, if only to highlight this very important issue, especially during a time where shallow and narcissistic personality traits are proudly displayed through social media, and encouraged as a distraction from real world problems.<br/><br/>*end of spoilers*<br/><br/>If you want to watch a film which encourages you to engage in an intelligent conversation about it afterwards, then I highly recommend Us; you won't be disappointed."

It's a very well paced film that sets up the story and the characters, while slowly ratcheting up the tension - much like A Quiet Place did. Along the way we get some nice bits of humor (mostly thanks to or at the expense of Winston Duke) and nice depiction of family dynamics.<br/><br/>It's beautifully shot with an effective score and some well used songs. And while the plot is far-fetched it is still done in convincing fashion within the context of the film - again somewhat like A Quiet Place.<br/><br/>We get a really wonderful performance by Lupita Nyong'o who has once again managed to totally transform herself for her roles. She is supported by uniformly good supporting cast but it's mostly her film.<br/><br/>While some may say the reveal was obvious I thought it was nicely handled and well earned."

Both films are laced with social commentary but unlike Get Out, Us doesn't depend on it in order for it to be impactful.<br/><br/>For example, if the lead character in Get Out was white then the thriller would have been a bit common and cliched. Us ,on the other hand, is just as good of a horror film without the social commentary. The scares are unique and well developed. The details are even better. Most horror films, especially modern American ones, forget about sound or language. Peele uses it to his advantage. Not only is the soundtrack and score placed perfectly, the use of the human voice is perfected. The main villains voice is truely horrific. The growls and grunts that come from the little evil boy is masterful. The mute yells from the fathers doppelgÏ±Ñnger was primal and bone chilling.<br/><br/>In addition to sound, the story was well written and well paced. The intensity increases as the scope of the film increased. I seriously thought the film was going to be more insulated, ie, the home invasion type,but when I realized it was going to be more, I was pleasantly surprised. The twist is minor compared to the final conflict. The reveal is well delivered but once again minor compared to the horror of the imagery and then there is the social commentary. Like I said, to me it's minor, but Jordan Peele does really know how to interweave complex topics like race and social class with horror. It's not done as well as movies like, The Babadook, The Planet of the Apes or Rosemary's Baby, but it's still intriguing and fits well within the jumps and scares.<br/><br/>The only negatives I have with this film is the cinematography and the use of comedy. The first quarter of the film uses lighting and color to its advantage but once the scares leaves the first house, it becomes secondary. Also the use of daylight was wasted. I love films that make use of daylight as a scare tactic. Peele didn't do a good job here. Everything is too bright and would've been better if it was shot near dawn. Also unlike Get out, where the comedy fit, this time it didn't make sense at all. Why would a family who just had to fight for their lives sit around a table and crack jokes????<br/><br/>Other than those small things, this is another horror masterpiece. I'm so happy that the horror genre is getting the respect it deserves and even more happy that a it was delivered by an African American writer, director."

","Us is a movie that I've needed for years. It's not merely the fact that it's great (Though it most certainly is. It's the best film of the year and I can't imagine anything topping it), but it's a return to a more civilized and artistic age of Horror that I had previously thought to be long dead. Us captures the artistry, beauty, melodrama and emotional power of 30s and 40s Universal Horror films in a way I haven't seen since Johnston's exceptionally underrated remake of The Wolfman. It warms my heart that such a well-crafted and captivating tribute to that Golden Age of Horror is getting much more of the praise and attention it deserves the 2nd time around.<br/><br/>The big question remains; is Us a better film than Jordan Peele's previous outing, Get Out? As a major fan of both films, absolutely. Us is more clever, more nuanced, more interesting, scarier, funnier, grander in scale and more well characterized. A big part of what makes Us work (And what garners my comparisons between this and the classic Universal Horror library) is its examination of internalized vs. externalized monsterhood. Peele is able to create a monster in Red and her family that we can accept and sympathize with as both victimized and unprivileged while still making them a truly frightening and imposing threat, all the while never quite demonizing them. The Tethered are figures that earn our discomfort and fear, but increasingly become harder and harder for us to witness the Wilson family butcher, much like the antagonists of a James Whale film.<br/><br/>That's not to say the Wilson family themselves aren't likable or that we don't want them to survive. The character of Adelaide is one of the most genuinely complex and fascinating Horror leads of the decade, deeply morally ambiguous, but still deeply sympathetic in her own right. Without spoiling anything, I think any audience member can sympathize with her wanting to put her nightmarish past behind her and protect the warm, loving family she's built to create a sense of normalcy and belonging, but its her lenient set of ethics in regards to protecting that status quo that's truly divisive. She's certainly an antiheroine if ever I've seen one and the ending gives a strong feeling of intentional emotional emptiness where I'm not quite sure how to register the choices she's made. Winston Duke's Gave Wilson is a much stronger character than given credit for as well, a character that's never really questioned his life as he knows it (Or his place of immense social privilege) to the point where he knows very little of his own wife's personal life. He comes off as a lost puppy of sorts; book smart, but street stupid, bumbling into a world he doesn't understand and barely knows how to stay alive in. I think the argument could be made that Gabe is something of an audience insert, or, at least, how Peele views his audience; well intentioned, bright and friendly, but ultimately naive and ignorant to the larger world around them.<br/><br/>I'm amazed at how well Peele is able to modernize the stylistic choices of 30s and 40s Horror while still keeping the film starkly modern. The film's campy, kooky sense of humor, its grand and luxurious sense of aesthetic style and its theatrical melodrama concerning Adelaide's mysterious backstory and her struggle to cope with what she is and what she's endured would feel right at home in a James Whale or Jack Arnold film. The performances reflect this kind of style wonderfully as well, Lupita appropriately chewing the scenery as the ghoulish, sinister and wide eyed Red; a performance feeling like a cross between Elsa Lanchester's Bride of Frankenstein and Ernest Thesiger's Dr. Praetorius. Alternatively, her emotionally shattered, frantic and increasingly unstable performance as Adelaide recalls a stronger, more proactive take on Bride's Valerie Hobson as Elizabeth Lavender, the previously hopeful and happy Cinderella-esque figure slowly counting the last minutes until midnight. Her nuanced, diverse and animated facial expressions in both roles and especially her chilling, Campfire Story-esque delivery as Red have garnered Oscar buzz and, while I'd certainly argue this is the best performance of the year, it's almost too good for the same upturned noses who gave Green Book a Best Picture award.<br/><br/>Winston Duke's affably dorky and absent minded, but ultimately rather bright, Gabe Wilson also evokes many acting performances of the 30s and 40s, bringing an almost modernized Vaudeville sensibility to the film's comedy. I can only hope Duke grabs more leading roles as he's a very welcome presence both humorous and sympathetic here.<br/><br/>It's additionally charming how well Jordan Peele is able to blend modern aspects of our pop culture with this classic 1930s-1940s style; the use of NWA's ""F the Police"" against a slow, atmospheric confrontation between Zora Wilson and The Tethered in their neighbors gorgeous mansion brilliantly combines the subversiveness, edginess and cultural diversity of modern Horror with the artistry, majesty and tension of classical Horror to create a sequence that's truly timeless.<br/><br/>That lovely sequence aside, all the visual storytelling in Us is similarly detailed and meaningful. Its use of patterns and their repetition in the narrative to foreshadow plot points, the costume choices of its characters being especially deliberate and specific regarding their personalities, the visual parallels in the journeys of Adelaide and Red; the film has as much deliberate artistic vision as any movie nominated for Best Picture in the past 60 years and its a joy to see it get recognition for it among critics and audiences.<br/><br/>Us is a masterpiece. It's a revelation. It's the must-see event of 2019 and a film that can be watched over and over again while still picking up on countless new fascinating details regarding its characters, thematic content and visual storytelling. Furthermore, it finally marks the return of classical Horror into the modern mainstream. James Whale would have loved Us."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","9","23 March 2019"," Jordan Peele adds another gift to the horror genre.
","The horror genre has more appreciated within the last decade or so, with films like IT, The Witch, A Quiet Place, Get Out and The Babadook being able to terrify audiences while simultaneously examining important topics surrounding human nature.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele's Get Out from 2017 was a film that so creatively examined racial tensions in the United States and gripped us to our cores that we'll be analyzing the film for decades. Peele, in his second feature, crafts a film similar in style and energy, yet grounds is film around different societal themes that are executed just as profoundly in Us, a monumental piece of cinema that is a gift to the horror genre.<br/><br/>Us follows the story of a family vacationing in Santa Cruz, California, visiting the same ebach that the mother of the family and the film's protagonist Adelaide (Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o) visited as a child, where she encountered a doppelg√§nger, better known as an exact clone of herself. Adelaide explains this to her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) before their family is hunted and terrorized by not only Adelaide's doppelg√§nger clone, but the clones of their entire family of four.<br/><br/>Peele proves yet again that he's more than a silly comedian, who on his Comedy Central sketch show Key & Peele became one of the country's most beloved comedic talents. Not only is Peele a master on building tension and suspense, he requires his audience to pay attention and commit to being fully immersed in detecting the rich depth his unusual and creative conflicts exert.<br/><br/>With Us, Peele isn't focusing on race relations, but rather society and humanity as a whole. Us demands we reflect on how different environments produce different people, how the past influences the present, and who we truly are as a society. It becomes evident that there are subtle plot references to American history and the current state of American society. Peele wants his audience to contemplate how we view the other, whatever that may be to each individual. In dealing with a family facing the violent duplicates of themselves, Peele goes further as a storyteller and delivers a full-throttle suspense thriller that leaves us thinking well-after we exit the theatre.<br/><br/>Complementing this layered story is the tremendous filmmaking style that Peele seems to have grown comfortable with. Similar to Get Out, most notably the ""sunken place"" scene, Us has a number of visually arresting shots and sequences that give the film a gorgeous style. Filled with vivid imagery that evokes metaphorical visual storytelling, Us is a directorial powerhouse.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o does wonders in playing two roles, one as the protective and troubled mother Adelaide and the other as the strange and dangerous clone of herself. Despite her strong performance, Nyong'o could have been cast differently and may be hard to connect with audiences. Despite being 36 years old, Nyong'o looks very young, making it hard for the audience to identify her as a mother due to looking like she could be the older sister of the kids who she's suppose to be the mother of. Her perfrances are splendid, yet this isn't a role that only she could play. Winston Duke does a great job of adding just the right amount of comedic relief and acting genuinely confused and surprised as the terror and action unfolds. Both kids give stand-out performances and promise further acting careers.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes Us work so well is how Peele is able to use the influences that inspired him to be a filmmaker like Alfred Hitchcock while also being able to craft a fresh and original film that belongs solely to him as an artist. Peele is a gifted director with brilliant visions that define his own trademark. We're truly lucky to live in a time when Jordan Peele is directing movies, for each time he proves that he is in fact much more than a comedian and one of the most profound storytellers of our generation."

","I've wanted to watch this movie for so damn long and jeez i wish I did it sooner. Oh my god, the storyline is so so so so good, the actors also, like even the kids so so good. I really like how the main family was black, because most films don't do that, Jordan Peel did an amazing job can't say anything different. As i was saying the storyline is so original and well thought. My interpretation is that we are afraid of ourselves, we want to fit in our comfort zone and don't do anything that might be scary or have a different outcome than we hope for. Sometimes you might be so insecure that your inner self is terrorising you, that's why you need to defeat yourself. I loved how you were really coming along the trip with the family, I loved the scene were the main woman was fighting with red, and you kept seeing flashbacks to the time she was doing ballet, the fighting almost seemed angelic because of the amazing music put under. The cliffhanger kinda didn't need to be there, but it did make it better no cap. So I think... that red switched herself with herself. But I don't really get why she was still helping her family when the original girl came out and everything. Not that it didn't do the movie any less. Because now you're really gonna think about it which I think is a good thing. So amazing movie, great music, really good actors, beautiful shots and an original storyline.

If you work your brain so hard for some cartoon you watched, you'll be able come up with interesting ideas. The point here is, the crazy theories all around the reviews are not unique for this movie.<br/><br/>Other production of Jordan Pelee, Get Out, was insanely tense and apprehensive. While watching Us, I got bored. Emotions such as thrill, fear, feeling disturbed, annoyed couldn't be seen in this film. Therefore its not an OKAY film.

"DeBBss","6","1","3","13 January 2020"," A Great Concept That Falls Flat
","As a fan of Jordan Peele's Get Out, finding out that he's going to director a second horror film was exciting. Watching the movie however, wasn't really exciting. There's so much that falls flat, and I came out wondering, how did Jordan go from Get Out, to Us. Us isn't a bad movie at all though, but the idea and not delivering well on it is what ruins the movie. I think Us is a perfect example of perfecting an amazing idea, because if it's not perfected, then it taints the entire movie.<br/><br/>The plot on paper is very clever, but filling in the dots is what's important. There is so many plot holes that are left unanswered, that when the credits appear, you're left with so many questions. How has no one found out about the clones, if they're so easy to find? Where do they get they're clothes and scissors from? Why didn't the government kill the clones once they were done with them? All of these questions are surface level and can be explained, but it's never answered. I guess you can't get too deep into the plot, and just watch the movie casually to enjoy the ending.<br/><br/>The idea itself, that the government created the tethered, which are basically clones of citizens in America is a great idea. And I have to give a point for the concept itself. The pacing was done very well; it didn't take long for things to start happening, and when things did started happening, it wasn't constant fighting.<br/><br/>The acting was solid all around, as all the actors did a great job with making the tethered feel like completely different people. The characters, however, are a completely different story. For some reason, none of the characters are likable, except for Gabe (Played by Winston Duke). Zora and Jason (The children) felt underdeveloped, and we rarely get any exposition of those two characters. It seems that most of the focus was on the adults more than anything else, so it really held back the movie.<br/><br/>Us had the potential to live up to Get Out, but the amount of plot holes creates an unsatisfying ending that leaves too many questions. Half of the characters were underdeveloped and weren't relatable. The action was entertaining though, and the pacing was well executed. Us isn't a bad movie; if you're a fan of horror, then why not, but for others, this is a pass."

I kind of guessed the twist early enough, but it didn't ruin or affect my viewing of the film. The main thing to write home about is that the acting is great as is the general dialogue, not often items you'll find in many horror films. We have a fine intriguing film, that like Get Out, it isn't really gruesome but has its darker moments.<br/><br/>I thought the film to be okay, but it doesn't stand out like the director's previous effort. I get the feeling that many critics were judging this more positively than they should have based on the director's last effort, as personally I thought it was fine but nothing more, and really could have had more done to help elevate it.<br/><br/>If you want a good horror film, you'll find this to be worth watching, but don't expect too much more."

Lupita Nyong'o is awesome in her dual roles. Jordan Peele is a genius screenwriter and director with a unique sense of humor that is at times used in that Hitchcockian way...stretching moments when a character misreads situations and intents while the audience holds its breath. In this manner, Peele's films differ from the tenor of most Stephen King films, even in works as situationally absurd as this one is, asking viewers for a fair amount of suspension of belief. I am rather mystified by the tenor of many of these negative reviews on imdb in regard to this film, the majority seem unjustified to me, and want to add this second feature, Peele's first being Get Out, leaves me excited to see this extremely unique and exciting filmmaker's future works."

Great acting, direction, production, funny jokes, but (here we go again) ep-ic story fail.<br/><br/>By way of exposition, the opening titles mention 'thousands of miles of tunnels under the continental USA, some of which have no known purpose'. There are also millions of frames in this movie, some of which have no known purpose. That shows somebody in the cutting room being a bit precious about their movie.<br/><br/>The budget's bigger, the cast is starrier, the script has just as many good jokes (""Alexa - call the police!"" and ""What's 'Home Alone?'""), but oh dear, the story is feeble. It tries desperately hard - and doesn't succeed - to explain 'why zombies', but in a slasher movie, there is no need. Not too gory though, so that's good.<br/><br/>At about the 1 hour mark, I was wondering if the zombies were meant to symbolize a part of Afro-American-ness that wants to reject the aspirations to WASP middle-classness that the protagonist family epitomize. That might have been interesting to explore, and the scene of the black zombies slaughtering the white family is quite edgy for that, but the notion disappears in a flurry of overwrought boss-zombie-clone-combat (zombat?) which GOES ON FAR TOO LONG, Mr. Peele. 'Get Out' was tight; this is flabby."
"AlexKurlan","9","1","3","7 December 2019"," Thrilling and chilling film with relevant theme
","Directed by 2017's breakout director Jordan Peele, new horror-thriller Us starts out with a prelude different than most horror movies in this era of cookie-cutter films. Opening with an ominous sequence in the 80s, the audience discovers the frightening encounter of young girl at a carnival with an identical clone (or doppleganger) of herself. Subsequently, the movie skips into the present day where this girl, now an adult, is visiting the same area with a family of her own. Whilst the film spends much of the first third in a easygoing and funny light (especially thanks to the father played by Winston Duke and the comedic genius of Jordan Peele), there always remains the ominous background to the story. The main character, Adelaide Wilson played by Lupita Nyong'o, has a constant sense of foreboding about the area and is afraid of the beach where the carnival took place. Eventually, the film breaks into all out horror with a tense and unsurprisingly frightening scene detailing a home invasion of the main characters by individuals who resemble them in appearance, yet as a more broken copy (the young boy is scarred with burns, and only one of them is able to speak). The movie continues to evolve and covers a wider scope. However, for fear of giving away the climactic and chilling final third of the film, I will end my storyline there.
In many ways, the film resembles a stereotypical horror film. The traditional teaser, the laidback, ""it's good while it lasts"" feeling enveloping the first part with a strong sense of something about to go bad. Then comes the small scale horror, the first mini-climax of the film, followed by a crescendo into absolute madness and horror that brings the film to it's hopefully scary conclusion. But this film has a depth that lacks in many other contemporary horror flicks. The humor isn't the one-dimensional robotic puns and jokes present in works by writers whose comedic touch is amaterur at best. Jordan Peele's background in Key & Peele, among other comedy works, shines through here. Humor is constantly provided, and it fits the characters and story perfectly. The home-invasion that makes up a significant portion of the second act and constitutes as the mini-climax of the film is claustrophobic and tense, yet provides a different sense of horror than in other parts of the film. The ending of the film may be overwhelming and could seem rushed to a picky viewer, but is in fact rampant with strong symbolism, imagery and meaning tieing itself to the central core of unity, representation, similarities and actual appearances. Not many horror films illicit the amount of depth and provide the same extent of meaningful allusions like this movie. The only other film in recent memory to essentially do this is Peele's 2017 classic Get Out. Whilst that movie was a more contained piece, highlighting contemporary civil rights dilemmas and what not, this film has a broader focus that highlights themes relevant to a grand majority of Americans, if not individuals across the globe. This film utilizes a similar foundation to other horror films, yet manages to escape from the traditional entrapments instilled and creates a wholly original and thought provoking film in the process.
In terms of specific aspects, the film has a beautiful sense of light, with successive scenes receiving considerably darker hues corresponding to the increasingly dark storyline of the film. Shadows and coincidences are strong motifs in the film, and the camera work proves stellar in highlighting these occurrences throughout the movie. They draw just enough attention for the audience to notice, but not too much for it to become a distraction. The acting is superb, especially from the four leads staring as the principal family and their doppelgangers in the movie. The music is perfect, mainly drawing on works from established artists, presenting the pieces in unique and sometimes funny ways (watch the Police scene as a good example). The retooling of the music in a key sequence near the film's conclusion proves stunning and goes hand in hand with expert camera work.
Us is the rare type of original work that manages to match a two-time director's first, already superb, work. The films aren't competing in quality but instead are complementary to each other, touching on different themes, while effectively working to promote the currently declining quality of the horror genre in general. Films like Us are important as they provide an opportunity for us to get scared, while also providing ideas and concepts to sleep on only to be woken up by horrifying nightmares of a personal clone hellbent on killing you."
"bgar-80932","7","1","3","3 December 2019"," Good follow up
","I think some of this film doesn't make the most sense. I also think that the dad was pretty goofy making jokes the whole time his family is at risk of getting murdered. That said I was still engaged and it was still pretty entertaining. The ""evil"" version of the little girl especially excelled. She was creepy. The end was a little goofy but I think overall it just felt a little rushed. I think Jordan Peele was trying to capitalize on Get Out and that's why it feels a little unpolished. Still a very solid effort though in my opinion."

","This 2019 horror-thriller stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke.
Nyong'o (Black Panther) plays Adelaide, a woman who suffered a traumatic experience as a young girl. She decides to go on vacation with her husband, Gabe (Duke) and their 2 children. Soon, they're in for a nightmare when their doppelgangers terrorize them and they also discover that there are
others with doppelgangers across the world. This is a weird film with some suspenseful and violent moments and the attractive, Nyong'o isn't bad in it.
If you enjoy horror or thrillers like director, Jordan Peele's previous film, ""Get Out,"" give this a try."
"jaelaj-87702","9","1","3","26 November 2019"," Good classic horror movie, leaves me wanting more.
","I really enjoyed this movie. Jordan Peele has a great style, and I truly loved the aesthetics of the film. The plot was fun- a bit classical, a little cliche, and to me, the twist was obvious from a mile away- but in a good way. It was a classic horror movie premise with some really fun new visuals, characters, and ideas.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the wide-eyed, crazyfaced, HUNGRY attitude of the ""others."" It was really jarring and strange, and set us up for some great aesthetic moments. I also enjoyed the inclusion of the 90s holding-hands-across-America thing, which is such an iconic thing for those who remember it.<br/><br/>I liked that the film kept me curious. Like I said, I knew the first 15 minutes the twist about Lupita's character- but what is that weird world under the boardwalk? What kind of place is that? Why is it like that? Why is everyone nuts? Is it all just hallways? Why do they hold hands? Who is the man at the beginning holding hands with- or is he just early? How does the little boy know his mom's secret? Lots of questions. I prefer a movie that doesn't answer all my questions, but also makes enough sense that I can try and puzzle it out. It's mysterious without being contradictory or nonsensical, is what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Though, truth be told, I do think that if the movie has a weak point, it's in a few of the questions that I think could have been explored more deeply. What do the ""others"" want? I mean, they want the surface people's lives- but they also are just crazy murderous monsters? So they SAY they want their turn on Earth, but it seems like all they want to do is eat everyone's face off. Why are they like that? If what we learn about Lupita's character is true, it's not genetic, nor is it necessary. A girl came from there at just about age 8, and was able to live a fully normal human life. There are people in there, people who are perfectly capable of acting just like... well, us. So what's going on?<br/><br/>I don't know, however, if I can count my being enthralled and wanting more answers as a real and valid weakness in the film. Overall, I think this is a really fun addition to horror and I'm excited to see what Jordan Peele comes up with next. Cheers."
"bramstayer","7","1","3","26 November 2019"," Not bad but odd indeed. Keep em coming Mr. Peele
","I honestly love how ambitious this was. Some holes in a story this fantastic are inevitable but I just went with it and thought COOL. It is a fiction horror film guys. Logic doesnt need to tie every end up just to make the fantastic seem possible. So thats for those saying all the 'why didnt this happen' i enjoyed the performances and was indeed scared for awhile and stayed interested to the end. Like The Uninvited on Netflix this is still cool but not realistic. Movies of this type require some dismissal of logic. Maybe the whole speech by Red was too weird for some. I enjoyed this weird down the rabbit hole idea and love films this crazy. Tethered is NOT the new sunken place. This is not meant to be a sequel to the brilliant dark comedy of Get Out which had enough realism in the racist overtones to be digested but was also pretty far fetched! I get some didnt find this funny, maybe watch it again. ALSO: Not all large black guys fight or use violence as some suggested the dad was a weak ass man. Maybe he never had to fight before as his size suggests he would win against most, maybe just not a copy of himself who happens to be ok with KILLING etc, I feel like Jordon Peele is getting the M. NIGHT treatment. Please dont do that. People may not have got what they expected but I think the director got what he did expect: Lots of critical comments by those with pre-conceived ideas of what the film should have been; some political message concealed in the story. (Which I assume are many some more overt than others.) I look forward to his next films and recommend people see this and enjoy. I will watch it again with my millennial daughter. See her take it."

","I watched this because I really like Get Out. So I had expected this film to be of a similar calibre.
I don't really have an issue with the acting or anything else specific. It's really just the script that completely ruins it for me.
Unlike Get Out, the script of this film makes very little sense, which restricts its ability to carry a coherent message, or to convey a deeper meaning. With no sense and no meaning, there's just very little to see in a film..."

Also I didn't check the time so sometimes I thought the movie was over, but then it comtinued, so that's another good thing. Also, it was really thrilling! No stupid jumpscares, just tension! Except for the no logical ending. But it is definitely worth watching!"
"postsenthil","7","1","3","27 October 2019"," A VERY GOOD WATCH !
","Jordan Peele had tasted stand-out critical and commercial success with his debut directorial Get Out (2017). It was an unusual horror flick which had strong racial undercurrents and won many awards including an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Us, Peele's sophomore attempt, is also a horror flick with yet another unusual, genre-bending structure.<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1986 when a young girl -Adelaide - accompanying her parents to the Santa Cruz beach front slips away from them and has an unnerving encounter in a hall of mirrors.<br/><br/>Cut to the present day, the Wilsons - Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), Gabe (Winston Duke) along with their two kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) - return to their family's beach-front home in Santa Cruz for a vacation. While Adelaide is still haunted by her childhood experiences at the beach and some ominous coincidences that resonate with that past, Gabe convinces her to relax. They spend a tense evening with their friends - Tylers - at the beach. That night, the Wilsons find a family of four in red overalls holding hands, trespassing into their property. They seem to be doppelgangers of the Wilsons. When Gabe tries to scare them away with feigned intimidation, the intruders attack the Wilsons.<br/><br/>
Who are these intruding doppelgangers ? Where are they from ? What do they want from the Wilsons ? Why are they attacking the Wilsons with murderous intent ? What connection do they have with the events from Adelaide's childhood ? The rest of the movie is a survival saga spreading overnight as the Wilson family seeks to escape this attack alive. It unfolds in an uneven, albeit uncanny and layered narrative that answers these questions while raising some more deeper and unsettling ones.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o is a class act and is equally convincing in both her roles, seamlessly alternating between being chilling and ferocious or traumatised and terrified. Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss and rest of the cast provide able support.<br/><br/>Peele's main narrative arc is almost polymorphic as one can uncover layers of sub-texts that reflect on multiple issues like class, race, gender and many more. It makes minimal use of template tropes such as sudden rousing score, jump scares bloody visuals and adds a good bit of humour.<br/><br/>Overall, Us is an ambitious addition to the genre of horror that seeks to expand its horizons as Peele seeks to make it a journey that is simultaneously thrilling and thought provoking.<br/><br/>And ... To his credit, he succeeds for the most part."

"cjamesdueck","6","1","3","24 September 2019"," Jordan Peele overrated?- Exhibit A
","With the good but way over-hyped Get Out, Jordan Peele rocketed to Hollywood elite and horror royalty after being a successful comic actor/writer, quickly using his ""monkey paw productions"" (stupid name) to get involved in seemingly everything he came across. The new twilight zone sucks, and he stupidly put his name and face all over it, making him the easiest target for ridicule aimed at the show. Then the trailer for ""Us"" comes out, and it looks amazing. The premise was the perfect mix of mystery/danger/absurdity as well as creepy costumes/masks/makeup/music. One year later we FINALLY get to see the movie and... the first half to two-thirds was pretty good, but the whole movie feels like it's just going downhill fast, instead of mounting the tension with building plotline. The more information you get, the dumber the story is. By the end I was rolling my eyes at the terrible attempt at a final twist that was so obvious I was thinking it must be a bait and switch that was playing with my expectations, but no. just a lame, fizzling out of an ending that lasted the last 40 min of the movie. Oh, and the classroom fight? Cringe. 6.5 that would round up to a 7, but the disappointment of teasing a trailer so good so early and then delivering this?! 6."

","I appreciated this movie from Peele much better than his predecessor, Get Out, which, even though I didn't want to feel like that, it felt really one sided, however ""Us"" is a much more universal, neutral horror/thriller, well... at least... I think.<br/><br/>It feels refreshing, and the classic horror narrative works really well, energetic. The satirical side of the movie also gives some giggles, fueling this whole crazy cinema experience. What I don't get though is the symbolism it wants to operate with, and through which it wants to send message to us, the audience. And that, honestly, pisses me off, as I am really into such movies that hold deeper meanings under the surface: I have been watching Kubrik, Tarkovsky, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bela Tarr, David Lynch movies for years, so I thought there is no movie language that could block me.<br/><br/>Well, somehow, Peele's movies do, and I don't know why. I really want to understand what this movie wanted to inform me with: Was it about our inner nature that we oppress by all the behavioral restrictions society forces on us? Was it about hypocrisy? Does it have anything to do with the Trump wall with that ""holding hands performance art"" thing? Is there something really liberal worldview behind it that I might find too naive? I am seriously lost to be honest the more I think about it, I admit it. I kinda feel dumb now, and I hate that.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was exciting to watch from start to the end."

"evanston_dad","7","1","3","8 August 2019"," Same Missteps as ""Get Out""
","Jordan Peele's follow up to ""Get Out"" recreates both much of what worked about that earlier film and the missteps that ultimately made it less than satisfying.<br/><br/>""Us"" ratchets up the tension nicely as it introduces us to a loving family on vacation in a cabin in the woods. It then explodes into an invigorating blend of visceral horror and very funny comedy as that family is attacked by a group of doppelgangers bent on doing them harm for unknown reasons. But as the film draws to its obtuse conclusion, Peele feels the need to over explain, and the creepy mystery at the film's center instead turns into awkward and literal plot exposition. How much more satisfying everything might have been if left unexplained.<br/><br/>Still, most of this film is wildly entertaining, and Peele is one director who makes films that feel completely plugged into our troubled times. He really does have a unique style, and both ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" bear the stamp of a formidable originality. It's just his storytelling that needs some work.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is fantastic, especially by Lupita Nyong'o, who's fierce in a double role as the mom and the mom's frightening twin. It's not an exaggeration to say that her performance is award worthy.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

How come when the doppelg√§ngers arrive they slowly break into the house then pair off with their doubles to each give them a chance to escape. But with the richer family their doppelg√§ngers immediately just kill them. It felt like Jordan Peele had a bunch of scary moments on a piece of paper and then awkwardly crowbarred them into a movie but forgot about logic and sense and also pacing. The film show could get faster but kept slowing down to dwell on a particular creepy moment.

I won't go into the story itself, because even a brief summary would be a spoiler. The idea is original and very interesting, but it seems that they have not thought it through to the end. The film starts slowly and gradually introduces the characters and the plot, and builds up the atmosphere. Everything indicates excellent horror. But when the mystery begins to unfold, it does it quite amateurish. There are holes and illogicalities, and some moments are plain stupid. The final twist is good, but although it is not predictable from the start, you will anticipate it just enough before it happens to spoil the surprise effect. Although the premise is so bloodcurdling that it itself should send shivers down your spine, the movie simply isn't scary. To me, it felt like six out of ten, but I have to raise it, at least slightly, above the stupid slashers of the eighties.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I liked the first part, well acted and enticing. A mysterious intro, a classic portray of the family on holidays, and a strange night with a weird family standing in front of the house.<br/><br/>I liked that things picked up fast from there, showing the ""doubles"" surpsisingly fast and setting up the hostage situation. It obviously gets intriguing and paranormal with the doppleganger theme, but then it drops the ball. It becomes a slasher with useless one-on-one confrontations, and we learn that it's happening in many other places at once.<br/><br/>I have to go to the big reveal from here, and how it makes no sense.<br/><br/>1 - the doubles are shown mimicking mundane daily activities, dressed in the same clothes. This is silly. Where are the clothes from ? How do they replicate the ""surface"" landscape from their small square rooms ? Surely they don't have ""crossing the street"" practice areas.<br/><br/>2 - why the red suit when they practiced in copied clothes ? Either they want to replicate the surface version, or they want to differentiate with the red suit. We get both. (again where do the red suits come from ?)<br/><br/>3 - why did the swapped good version of the mother go insane and behave like that for the whole movie ? The predictable reveal made everything we saw prior to it make even less sense. She grew up underground in this hostile environment, and she had the same children but twisted ? She never used the elevator to get out ?<br/><br/>4 - the reveal has no weight. A good version underground gets bad, a bad version on surface gets good. The vilain is still the vilain, same for the victim.<br/><br/>5 - The red suits lines are just silly. It's just a useless mystery added to the mess. They won't stand against military or police, they're present all over mountains where there are no sewers (""you number 317, walk 2 days and stand on this hill to hold hands with 316 and 318 for no reason"").<br/><br/>I like that the movie dared to give reasons rather early, instead of the usual ""no idea, maybe-its-cliffhanger"". But the execution and especially the background are seriously lacking. It all just makes no sense. At all. It just doesn't justify the watching time it takes to get disappointed."

Nothing is really horrific, but the industry deems it a horror movie which proves once more how the industry knows nothing.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm scratching my head trying to find something to say about this. The experience left me empty in the wrong sense: I came in expecting nothing and came out...dry. Just like Get Out, Peele's previous and slightly more accomplished movie, the ending ruins it all. This is a serious problem for Peele: he comes from the entertainment circle with comedians and funny people... and he just can't seem to follow a good horror thread until the credits roll.<br/><br/>Conceptually, Peele has some merits. He is undeniably creative and original, but he lacks the proper instruments to correctly weave his ideas into a cohesive story, which is a shame. He is still relevant as an african-american author, as his films dive deep into american psyche towards race. But, once again, his nice ideas didn't survive a filming process.<br/><br/>This film will be remembered as a Lupita Nyong'o fest, as she steals everything that can be stealed from this movie. But an excellent actress is not enough to proclaim this an excellent film. I give 'Us' a 7/10 rating, as it is on the good side of what a passable film is."

"Aly200","9","1","3","6 April 2019"," What if the mirror could look back?
","Following his Academy Award win for the superb ""Get Out"", Jordan Peele returned to horror with his sophomore feature. However if you were hoping for the same psychological horror of his debut, well it gets gorier this time however there is still psychological terror to found. This does not take away from the excellent story that Peele has crafted this time.<br/><br/>Following a normal young African-American family: timid Adelaide (the wonderful Lupita N'yongo), goofy husband Gabe (Winston Duke being both hilarious and serious when the time comes), technology-loving Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the troubled Jason (Evan Alex who is quite unsettling), who venture to their summer home for a vacation. However Adelaide struggles with a traumatic experience from her childhood where she might have found her double in a hall of mirrors. One evening the family spots ominous figures on their lawn at 11:11pm (a prominent plot point) which unfortunately turns out to be their doubles (played by all four actors; only N'yongo speaks, but with a chilling grating voice). Will they make it or not? No spoiler here.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant as they each must inhabit both their average Joe characters and their silent (except for Nyongo's Red) counterparts who make their intentions clear to toy with the family and then kill them all. Lupita N'yongo is obviously the most standout as her counterpart is the only one who can speak English and that voice is haunting to the core as Red almost clicks as her voice cuts off momentarily before she finishes her sentences. The explanation comes at the film's climax once Adelaide goes to confront her double to save Jason after Red nabs him, but that's why you must see the film to know why.<br/><br/>While the film's narrative is quite compelling and straightforward, most critics have voiced their displeasure with the ending sequence of the film. I can agree that Red's monologue to Adelaide is long-winded and preachy; probably due to Peele taking advantage of being the sole writer. While others bemoan the final twists of the film I actually found myself surprised at who was actually who and the implication of the final shots were haunting for its real world implication."

This is a rather strange story, an initial slow burn but it does thankfully make sense. Good characters, it is tense but also has quite a bit of humour. Soundtrack includes Luniz, Beach Boys and NWA.

But you know what I can say? This movie was REALLY well done, and Jordan Peele is already a must watch director for me. ""Us"" consistently surprised me, from the story to the characters to the humor. (Plus, Lupita Nyong'o alone is worth the price of admission.) Much like ""Get Out,"" this story worked on many levels. Yes, it scared me...but it also made me think. So while it was a bit more gruesome and the plot had far more holes, I would still line up to watch it again. After all, it is not often a movie sends me off to look up Bible verses and director interviews, but that's where I'm off to next.

"dollypeppers","7","1","3","31 March 2019"," Great Movie For Rewatching
","Wow this one sure is a thinker and to be truthful I'm not fully sure I understand it though I enjoyed watching. The way the story was laid out in the end didn't fully click with me, I was left wondering how that certain character knew all they did when they were a child when a certain event happened. I also feel like there's something I'm not understanding about the movie on a symbolic level. So many things are seemingly loaded with symbolism(rabbits, scissors, the color red, water to name a few) and I feel like these are all pieces to a puzzle but I just don't have them together right to make the big picture. Maybe I'm just stupid? Peele did give his cast a list of movies to watch so they could all be on the same page(Dead Again, The Shining, The Babadook, It Follows, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Birds, Funny Games, Martyrs, Let the Right One In, and The Sixth Sense) and of the list I've only seen 5 so maybe it will help to see the others.<br/><br/>One thing that's really fun is this is a movie absolutely chock full of easter eggs and references to other films and entertainment. Besides nods at the prior mentioned movies Peele showed his cast, which of the ones I've seen were all nodded to, I caught references to Alice in Wonderland, The Lost Boys, The Goonies, C.H.U.D., the Twilight Zone tv series, a possibly one to Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake of '78, possibly The Strangers and Jaws. I bet I'll find more on the next watch.<br/><br/>Besides all the thinky stuff and hidden nods I really appreciated the tense atmosphere at the beginning of the movie. I was wound so tight before anything actually happened. I wish that tension had gone on for the whole movie Peele really knows how to bring you to the edge of your seat. The second half felt more like a zombie apocalypse film though and I think the disconnect between that and the prior tone threw me. All the cast delivered excellent performances but Lupita Nyong'o absolutely killed it. There's lots of little subtle movements and expressions she uses to back up what the dialogue is saying and I just felt her performance had depth to it that improved on the already fantastic script. I loved watching her, she's incredible!<br/><br/>This movie hit more than it missed and I think most of the problems I have with it are my own fault. I definitely recommend this movie and think it's one that's worth multiple viewings."

The twist wasn't even that bad, I liked the theme and metaphor behind it rather than the ""logistics"" of it.<br/><br/>But a better twist or non twist could've been written instead and it would've made the film stronger.

"carlo_simone18","7","1","3","27 March 2019"," Well made with a couple of issues holding it back
","Whilst the film has a lot of positives it has a couple of minor problems holding it back for me. With regards to the positives the acting is superb across the board, with Lupita Nyong'o putting in a very compelling performance. Jordan Peele's direction and Mike Gioulakis' cinematography were great, as like everything else in the technical department, it was clean and effective. What also impressed me was the musical score, with Michael Abels doing great work, much like he did with Get Out.<br/><br/>Speaking of Get Out, comparisons are undoubtedly going to be made to Peele's directorial debut, but Us doesn't hold up anywhere near as well as that. One excellent attribute that does carry over though is the clever writing that delivers subtle yet sublime set ups and pay offs which work brilliantly. Nearly every line of dialogue in the opening act pays off him some way later down the line which for me is very satisfying.<br/><br/>However, the mixing of horror and comedy doesn't work out that well, as it shows too much of a tonal shift in moments that are meant to be quite chilling at points.<br/><br/>Finally, with regards to the ending twist I'm not sure I like it. Whilst it works well on a thematic level, as it explores the theme of othering and being our own worst enemy, it just ends up raising more questions about how that situation worked out the way it did. Why didn't Adelaide go back up to the surface when she got out of the handcuffs? How did she manage to co-ordinate 'the Tethered' to all emerge from the tunnels at the same time?
Where did they get all the red uniforms and scissors from? It's just frustrating that it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.<br/><br/>Overall, I very much enjoyed Us and will look forward to what Jordan Peele does next, as the guy clearly has some interesting ideas and concepts to explore in his work."

Probably some metaphors I am missing but I won't ever watch it again I don't think. I may change my score to 4/10. Complete letdown. Get out was miles better. If you want to watch a great horror movie watch hereditary."
"mindgem","4","1","3","26 March 2019"," A very very bad slasher movie
","The only good thing with this movie is the premiss.<br/><br/>I must admit that I was already in a bad mode when the opening scene was a 3 minute slow pan out of a rabbit, completely pointless. If that would have connected to the movie later doens't matter because at that point you have no clue.<br/><br/>The acting is meh but the dialog scripting is just aweful. The boy is suppose to be autistic I assume but does not play it at all. He plays a normal 10 year boy with stupid ideas and the parents treat him as he was 2 years old. Like the scene at the beach, if the boy is autistic the parents wouldn't let him wander off alone like that but if they were lax then why the enourmous panic when she can't see him, I mean it doesn't make sense at all, the reaction does not fit the scene at all.
Furthermore they panic when they realize he's out of sight but then they find him right next to them a milisec later so there's no time for the viewer to panic over it.<br/><br/>Everything is super strange and boring for a long while til the action finally starts. When they have killed all the things, then the mother and children are in the house while the father is in the boat and has been gone from the rest of the family for a while.
So when he is done killing he walks back to the house and just rings the door bell, relaxed as if the killing was over. For all he know his family is slaughered in there right. So it's a super anti climax.
Okay so that's the end of the movie, they killed them all.<br/><br/>No wait. what's this. I'm about to leave the cinema but the movie keeps going. For another 30min of something I don't even remember because they made it so it looked to be over already.<br/><br/>This movie is so confusing, badly written, badly acted, badly scripted, they have no experience with horror. It's aweful."
"rockinwaffles","7","1","3","26 March 2019"," Could've been better, but overall a good movie.
","The concept of this movie is so interesting. It unfolds like a classic Twilight Zone episode and flows wonderfully between horror and humor. My only real criticism is that Peele clearly went for artistic ambiguity in some details toward the end that needed a deeper explanation, but throughout the film he payed attention to so many minute details that it makes the film worth watching again just to see what clues or nuances you may have missed."

"kjproulx","8","1","3","26 March 2019"," Great Ideas with (Mostly) Successful Execution
","Ever since Jordan Peele shocked filmgoers around the world with his fantastic directorial debut in Get Out, it should've been no surprise that people would eagerly be awaiting his next project. Us marks his second outing as a feature film director and this time, he dives much further into the horror genre than he did with Get Out. I absolutely loved watching this film, but it's not without its flaws. Depending on the way you look at this film as a whole or how you see the ending itself, you may find yourself finding it flawless, but everyone views films differently, so as always, please take my review with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Following the Wilson family as they begin their summer vacation at a cabin on the lake, Adelaide (the mother) begins to recall moments from her childhood, as a family then invades their home. Realizing the family is actually themselves, a large sense of mystery begins to shroud the film. Personally, the overall premise of this film absolutely astounded me and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout nearly the entire runtime. If there's one thing this film does right, it's in keeping the audience engaged.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the film slightly began to lose my grasp throughout the final act. Yes, the storytelling remained clever as everything was being revealed, but the way everything unravelled left a little more to be desired, at least to me. What saved it were the devoted performances by the entire cast from start to finish and a couple neat twists before the film truly comes to an end. There are some bizarre images that still have me thinking, but I believe that was the intention, so I will let them slide.<br/><br/>Other than events in the third act, this is a very tight concept that was throughout engaging throughout. It's fairly early in the year to speak about Oscar chances for performances, but I'll just be completely honest with myself and state that an actress is truly going to have to pull off a miracle to have me believing someone will be more deserving than Lupita Nyong'o for best actress. Her performance floored me and I couldn't divert my eyes for a second.<br/><br/>In the end, Us is the kind of film that gives you a fantastic set-up, presents a very enjoyable second act to back it up and is filled with a tremendously eerie score that sent chills down my spine. I do feel the movie falls into the territory of predictability throughout the third act, but at least it commits to the revelations and doesn't make any mistakes in going for it. I may not think this is a perfect film, but Jordan Peele has put together another great film, worth revisiting over and over again to dissect. I applaud every aspect of this film, even if I didn't quite love it. Definitely check it out, especially if you're a fan of the horror genre."
"meredithkemble","8","1","3","24 March 2019"," Great Sophomore Attempt from Peele
","To start off, US was a great film worth more than one watch. Peele is a master of mixing humor and truly terrifying scenes to build tension expertly. This is the type of horror film where the family is smart, lovable, and the exact type of people you would expect to survive in a horror movie. Peele reverses the ""black person dies first"" trope in a film that is both terrifying and compelling.<br/><br/>The fatal flaw of the film comes from too much information. When the film starts delving into the lore, that is when it begins to unravel. US leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and not in a haunting, mysterious way. As well as a twist that is easily detected early on in the film, some plot points were not as well executed as they could have been. Occasionally we are hit over the head with obvious metaphor as well. Overall, the film may have had too much concept to contend with.<br/><br/>However, US was superbly acted (Lupita kills it) and keeps the pace up until the very end. An ambitious and impressive second film from Jordan Peele!!"
"MovieBuff_sl","7","1","3","24 March 2019"," New age horror movie
","Just like Get Out, Jordan Peele tells a 'semi-horror' story which has comedic bits and one that requires a bit of thinking. Lupita's acting is top notch but I can't help to think that the story just went too long and the ending senseless."
"lilswagga","9","1","3","24 March 2019"," Let's get this straight!!!
","1. For the people complaing that it was a basic horror film. It wasnt meant to be a horror, per say. Thats like saying a romance film is a bad thriller because there was a basic fight scene.<br/><br/>2. There were many twists and turns that allowed the audience to guess and theoruse about what happened and what could happen next. Whuch is one of the best parts of jordan Peeles films, as the answers arent just spoonfed to you and allow the audience to discuss and realise some things after watching the film or even watching it the second time around. Which i found was exhilarating as i realised important factors that i missed in the film. A lot of people are ranting about plot holes and although i agree some things could have had more substance or explanation, to fill all of these so called 'plot holes' would've made the film very boring and removed the mystery.<br/><br/>3. The subtle comedy throughout the film was also a great addition. Getting the whole cinema laughing, it added a new tone which also made the family characters seem more normal and real and less like characters. Which further adds to tge larger dynamic that they represent us, as normal humans, but evaluating the two sides of themself. Which is what Jordan intended as the main commwntary for the film. Can even we, be the evil we despise?<br/><br/>In summary, it was a great film. There was comedy, action, thrills, mystery, exitement and MANY questions that were enjoyable to discuss. And i will definately be watching again, which will offer a new experience. As jordan peele has addressed how he consideres rewatchability when writing scripts and directing."
"clairekalsto","8","1","3","23 March 2019"," GREAT.
","Even tho it may not woth a 10, this movie definetely not worth a 0 nor a 3. Jordan Peele is an ambitious director who, obviously, has no fear about putting his idea directly on screen without really worrying about the audience's comfort. Just like everything new, it has many defaults. Some characters takes questionable (well, dumb, let's be honest) decisions for the good of the plot, and even tho some joke are quite well timed, humor should have been less present imo (tbh the dad's character was definetely the main problem in this for me). There's also some question that eventually stay unanswered, which is frustrating.<br/><br/>However you have to see this movie as a whole; ""Us"" is a movie about society itself, human being's ability to find hapiness to the detriment of other's, and how this ability almost becomes a duty when your own contentement is what's threaten. And it tells it well. Lupita N'yongo is truely tremendous as leading character, and Peel is definetely putting some fresh air in cinemas with what might not be a perfect film, but at least a film with ambition. For all people who saw the film and are stunborn enough to put a 2 or 3, I will recommand you to go watch some further analisises or at least J.P.'s interview in order to understand the ideas that he tried to bring through this film, and for the ones who didn't I recommand you to go and see by yourself, you may eventually like it or not, but it definetely worth the look."

","This movie will divide fans and spark conversations, agreements and disagreements. Bottom line it was a bold undertaking of an idea and I believe he pulled it off.<br/><br/>In the Horror genre you can't always play it safe or paint by numbers. Peele is delivering this and I for one am glad. I grew up on horror and Peele is bringing back some of the off the chart ideas that horror used to aim for. They all won't be hits but US feels like something out of the late 70's into the 80's<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone but what film is. When you can go into a horror film these days and have no idea what you're about to see that is a great thing."
"ropo888","6","1","3","23 March 2019"," Not what I was expecting but not in a good way
","It goes without saying that 'Get Out' was a better film and a different film and should probably stop comparing the two.
'Us' was not what I was expecting because I was comparing it to 'Get Out' as I watched which was a mistake. It was entertaining, there was tension and suspense building but it was also lacking something throughout. It's possible to be scared, tense, laughing and bored all at the same time with this film.
I was bored at various points as I checked my watch several times - so the film was definitely too long.
I like a film that has a few questions remaining at the end, allowing the viewer to create and imagine their own conclusion. But this had just too many questions and aspects that didn't seem to make sense at all.
All in all the acting was good, soundtrack was good and suspense was good but the plot raises too many unanswered questions and is a little boring throughout."
"corynuckels","4","1","3","23 March 2019"," Very scary, very intense, but a little TOO weird.
","Not a bad movie at all. In terms of just judging it has a straight up horror movie, it's unlike anything I've seen in a long time. Brutal, shocking, scary, and sometimes hard to process (in a good way). My only issue, the plot is a little too obtuse, and dragged out at times. It all comes together, and once you walk away you'll have that ""oh now I get it"" feeling, however, throughout the film it can be a little bit confusing. Overall good, 7/10, scary, wild, and Peele is a great horror director."

This movie is scary! The feeling will stay with you way after you leave the theater. I feel like this movie is going to be on my mind for days. This truly has nightmare inducing potential.

"matthewssilverhammer","8","2","10","29 March 2019"," 2/3rds of a Perfect Movie Is Still a GREAT Movie
","God Bless Jordan Peele, who seems to be singlehandedly working to bring oddness back to big horror. You could rightfully compare him to ""The David's"" (Lynch and Cronenberg), but I really think he's our generations Hitchcock. The way he utilizes every aspect of filmmaking to present uniquely terrifying visions with provocative aplomb and even humor is nearly unparalleled in modern Hollywood. With Us, he continues the path he so perfectly blazed by Get Out, only with something much more mysteriously weird and visually bold, even if it's not quite perfect.
A young family's summer vacation is brought to a screeching halt when some unhinged doppelgangers show up to kill them. Things unravel with wild insanity, with Nyong'o showcasing unhinged brilliance as both the matriarch of the family and her menacing counterpart, while Peele gives us a truly unique take on the zombie / alien invasion horrors of yesteryear. So unique that, at times, the tone takes getting into; when you settle in, the mix of demented terror and welcome humor really works. You begin to realize that this won't be a movie with easy answers, but works instead as an exercise in pitch-black absurdity, one that warrants plenty of thought and discussion long after its over.
In fact, as the film ends and hidden plot points come into the light (most naturally, though some pretty clunkily), the logic unravels a bit, introducing a ""twist"" that is both not hard to foresee and also completely unnecessary. Still, just the fact that a movie this entertaining and this gloriously insane is willing to tackle the vast chasm between the haves and the have-nots is more than worthy of recommendation."

","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A good thriller that has its share of scares and jumps, but also some leaps of logic.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Remember that old Twilight Zone episode starring Inger Stevens as a woman alone on a road trip being terrorized by her doppelg√É¬§nger hitchhiker, a ghostly paranormal look-alike? Well, add more gore and suspense, multiple by four, and you have its updated and horrifying new clone by Jordan Peele, simply called Us.<br/><br/>Meet the Wilsons, a typical family on a family vacation at an upscale beach house for a fun-filled week that does not go as planned. One evening, sinister intruders arrive in their driveway and they look strangely similar, but with more evil in their souls. Soon it is a ""them versus us"" scenario in a life and death struggle with supernatural forces.<br/><br/>To say more about the plot would ruin the blood-spattered scares, of which there are many. The less you know, the better the enjoyment of this type of movie. (The film's basic concept reminded me of a lesser but still frightening film, The Strangers (2008). That film built suspense well but delivered an ultimately lackluster and unsatisfying ending. Us has more impact and social relevance, although it edges too ""sharply"" into the slasher film genre and does have some issues in its third act as well.)<br/><br/>Yes, this movie appears to be a standard horror film, with better production values, a strong cast, and skillful direction, but Mr. Peele has much more to say than that. He shows the darker side of the American family, with its wealthy 1% reaping society's rewards, oozing of both black and white privilege. This is a tense psychological study of our polarized nation, a physical battle against our avarice and ourselves, It is his view of America with all its class warfare purged with weapons of mass destruction.<br/><br/>As a director, Mr. Peele sets up his scenes with the most assured and expert touch. (Loved the opening sequence at the boardwalk and funhouse.) As a writer, he uses humor and satire to throw off the audience before the reveal. Where he doesn't always succeed is in his dense narrative and explanation of his plot structure. His film is brimming forth of intriguing ideas, not all of which are made clear when we get to the film's far-fetched ending. Mr. Peele's clever premise just does not hold up logically, even if his moviegoing audience is enjoying his macabre story with all its twists and turns.<br/><br/>But this is a minor quibble to his ability to create a satisfying horror film with genuine class. (Special mention goes out to cinematographer Mike Gioulakis for his atmospheric lens work. His dramatic light and shadows and use of deep reds and sterile whites gives the film its distinctive look. Michael Abel's music score helps greatly too.)<br/><br/>Mr. Peele wisely casts his film with actors that bring the necessary vulnerability to the family unit while doing double time as their deadly menacing counterparts most effectively. Winston Duke winningly plays Gabe Wilson, a likable cool dad (to mostly himself). Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex as his children, Zora and Jason, make a fine tag team and give strong natural performances. Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker provide some comic and tense moments as their entitled friends. But it is Lupita Nyong'o's portrayal of a mother protecting her cubs that literally tethers the film with such gravitas and power. Watching her playing dual roles makes the film work so very well.<br/><br/>Us is a good solid thriller...not as strong as his debut film, Get Out, but certainly a worthy successor by a talented filmmaker."

","Probably one of the more important films in recent years, in terms of social commentary.<br/><br/>I would say I'm biased. Horror is my favourite genre and social progress is important to me.<br/><br/>Horror is often used as a vehicle for criticism of society but this film touches deep.<br/><br/>The film keeps up traditional horror tropes. There are a lot of laughs, and you are immediately dragged into an endearing family, thanks to the amiable father.<br/><br/>Peele then takes you to thoughts that (I hope) are a deliberate diversion, just to set up a turn later. If it is indeed deliberate, it's inspired.<br/><br/>All four main actors ('eight'!?!) are superb. Really drawing you in and keeping a divide you never doubt.<br/><br/>As for the commentary, I suspect we're looking at a criticism of consumerism/ wage slavery and the brash, polished veneer that goes along with the great virtue of success. Hollow, hollow, hollow.<br/><br/>There's a challenge or two for the viewer too.

3.girl was age 10 probably, so has the memories of mom, dad, outside world etc...
4.when she came out of basement, she attacked outside girl (which is evil)
5.outside girl was so shocked and afraid (wait a moment, how come that, when you are a bad girl that organized all of that, now you are scared and don't know what is happening, wtf?
6.a good girl attacks when out, instead of looking for her parents, police, whatever.
7. You hAve to realise that basement girl is actually a good girl, not bad as movie wanted you to think, and outside girl is that evil girl, who acts all movie good girl.
8.finally they explained that down in basement and tunnels live 'that'bad people (i say bad because they were killing their originals in up world), but there is nowhere explonation who create those people, why, what is their purpose, nothing.
9. Ok you watch the movie because of plot twist.
10.actors are really good, but this is kinda artistic movie, so don't expect so much scary scenes, action or something like that.<br/><br/>Enjoy if you can watch after reading spoilers!"

"SouthernViews","1","1","4","3 December 2019"," Very Disappointing
","It's hard to review this movie without giving away the plot. But this is a spoiler-free review. There are numerous surprises in the story, so if you plan to watch it, I don't want to ruin it for you. Let me just say that the movie has major plot holes. It also relies heavily on exposition. When your characters have to give epic speeches to explain what's going on, that means you have a very poor script. A story should tell itself, through what the viewer hears, sees, and interprets. You shouldn't have to spell it all out. What's between the lines and between the scenes is just as important.
The story becomes so convoluted it would have been better to leave it all a mystery. But, when the movie ends, and you go back and try to think of what could have been done to salvage it, you realize that it is just a very bad script. The actors do what they can with the material they have. I'm just shocked that nobody read this and said, ""none of this makes sense.""
Critics that have praised this movie have said there are many meanings that can be interpreted, or that it will be debated for years. No. Not at all. The final act of the movie comes up with a laughable explanation for the story's events. It creates more questions than it desperately tries to answer. There is no deep philosophical set of metaphors happening here - just a bad movie with a high production value.
Watch at your own risk. Just be prepared to be let down."

It was as if he'd rolled all the high quality horror movies from the past few years into an Optimo and passed me that shiz on Friday the 13th! JP knows his 80's horror too. The main reasons I didn't give it a 10 is it did admittedly get kinda trope-y in places (and threatened to derail altogether by the end but...so do all the classic 80's horror movies!) and some of the classic horror logic problems were hard to swallow. But aside from that this was top drawer. Way way better than any of the movies I've never made. The casting of Tim Heidecker (immediately re-watched The Comedy soons this was over. If you haven't seen that cringe epic do so - if you think you can handle it) and Elizabeth Moss just shows the level of JP's taste and the respect that ultra-cool talented actors have for him. I didn't get too caught up trying to decipher whatever political metaphors may have been at work but that's what subsequent viewings are for. Of which there will be many.

","Peele validates with this film his being one of the most interesting debut directors on the current scene.<br/><br/>If already in Get Out Peele had managed to blend horror, suspense with contemporary and complex social and political themes, with ""Us"" he manages to do it even better.<br/><br/>The social and political critique of the moral, ethical and political degeneration of the United States (and of the world in general) is here much clearer and more explicit.<br/><br/>To an excellent execution, he also adds some kind of experimentalism that refers to old-school horror cinematography: like some effective and amusing comic parenthesis that horror movies had long forgotten.<br/><br/>If it is true that horror cinema must be a tool of social criticism capable of frightening precisely by showing the degenerations of society or by creating frightening and destabilizing degenerations, ""Us"" is a horror in every aspect."

Its logical flaws and practical issues don't really matter any more because so much of the film is metaphorical and symbolic.<br/><br/>Its main shortcoming, however, is its characters - bad decision-making is a staple of the horror movie, but the characters were so frustratingly stupid that they made the college chicks from every 80's slasher film look like Nobel laureates.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is incredibly deep and thought provoking, and it's the type of film that would really benefit from a re-watch.

","Not scary. really dumb. so many things that don't make sense... at all. very disappointing. critics are stupid (1 viewing)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
my comments from a convo with samie and ronnie:<br/><br/>I really try to give it a chance, try to move past the little weird stuff that I didn't like. But it didn't amount to anything worth doing that for
Wasn't scary. And as much as I tried to give the weird voices a chance, they were pretty stupid
It seems like there was a lot of stuff that he put in there to try to give it meaning but just seemed random and stupid. Like the opening texts about the tunnels Underground, what was that even trying to imply
Was the holding hands thing a social commentary on world hunger? I don't really understand. I get that it's one of the last things the little girl watched before getting switched
You know what was funny, the whole time I was waiting to see what the little boys magic trick would end up doing, we finally see that it basically just causes a small spark that helps him somehow Escape even though it really does nothing lol
I'm all for making up some weird story but you have to have at least some semblance of something concrete or something you can hold on to that makes sense. Can't just be a bunch of Madness
Or why the shadow lady would try to kill the husband and kids, I guess they're not technically her husband and kids but she wants to kill them?
Yes I was definitely thinking this. This is supposedly all across America but no one ever went down there and notice these people
What about homeless people or little kids
Or construction workers
To me the coolest part about the movie was the fact that I thought it was confined to this family and their experience and then we find out that it's basically the Apocalypse. Not sure if I have seen that before
Man if we really want to get down to it there are so many tiny things that were so dumb. Things that I would normally let slide if I like the movie. Do you remember when she was handcuffed to the table and she was trying to escape or reach the fireplace thing
There are like 12 things she could have done easily
I'm sorry can you not pick up a table
Or slide it over. Or move the Handcuff all the way to the corner so you have more room
You want to know something that makes the least sense of all. How would the kids look look the same. Supposedly these are all clones. But the shadow lady describes giving birth the same time as the real girl. Even if she had sex with the same shadow guy, there's basically 0% chance that the kids would look the same
Another question, why did the little boy all of a sudden have the power to force his shadow to kill himself
Another question, it seems that all of the real people are influencing what all of the Shadows are doing Underground. But when the shadow girl switches with the real girl in the beginning, the shadow girl above ground is now controlling what the real girl underground is doing. So why does the power to control switch"

","8/10 - this movie was pure craziness through and through; however, it was still entertaining thanks to Lupita Nyong'o who brought her A game to an entrancing social commentary horror"
"ericrnolan","8","1","4","20 July 2019"," A review of ""Us"" (2019)
","""Us"" (2019) passes the litmus test for a good horror movie - it is genuinely scary, thanks largely to Jordan Peele's terrific directing and its cast's immense talents. Lupita Nyong'o shines the most here; she gives a tour-de-force performance in the dual role of both a terrified woman and her savage, homicidal doppleganger. (If you've seen the trailer for ""Us,"" you know it portrays a nuclear family of four being assailed by their mysterious, murderous lookalikes.) Shahadi Wright Joseph is also especially good, in the dual role as both the family's traumatized daughter and her cherubic-yet-stabbity twin. This is a creative horror film with excellent shooting and imagery, and I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>I don't know that everyone will enjoy the film as I did, as I don't think it is perfect. Its overlong third act is easily its weakest, when the traditional cat-and-mouse horror-movie antics eventually take a back seat to the film's key reveals. We do get an explanation for the clone-tastic shenanigans in ""Us,"" even if it isn't altogether satisfying. There is actually an extensive fantasy/sci-fi backstory that Peele has prepared, and which I will not spoil here.<br/><br/>But I do think that many viewers would enjoy the story more without it, as I think I would have. The movie's key reveals are implausible and slightly befuddling at first, and then grow preposterous in the viewer's mind the more that he or she thinks about them. They're presented a bit ploddingly, too, in a film that feels maybe 20 minutes too long. As good as it was, ""Us"" would have been a more entertaining film if it had left the genesis of its strange events a mystery. If it had been presented as a simple, violent parable about the id, for example, it would appeal to a far wider audience and might approach the status of a horror classic, as Peele's outstanding ""Get Out"" did in 2017.<br/><br/>But that isn't what Peele wanted. The friend with whom I watched ""Us"" last night sent me a great March 22 article by Aja Romano at Vox that admirably breaks down the movie's ending. Peele indeed had a more detailed and thoughtful message than a general statement about mankind's duality. Long story short - the movie's mythology might not make a lot of practical sense, but it makes a lot of sense thematically. There is some intelligent social messaging here, even if it isn't perfectly delivered. It helps if you think of ""Us"" as a surreal horror story instead of a realistic one. I found that I liked the ending much more after reading this, and you might too.<br/><br/>One more note - this is the first time I've seen Elizabeth Moss on screen. (She's in a surprisingly hilarious supporting role here; I think most readers of this blog will recognize her as the protagonist of Hulu's adaptation of ""The Handmaid's Tale."") She's got great comic timing, and she's absolutely magnetic. People keep telling me that I should watch ""The Handmaid's Tale;"" maybe I really am overdue for that."

The mother acted totally different to the rest of the family upon the arrival of the others. She knew exactly where to go to find her son. She behaved differently when faced with the other versions of her children, she felt sorry for them, she felt their pain, she refused to kill them. The movie had to trick us don't complain! The movie is not supposed to be realistic much like other movies and TV shows that have higher ratings.

I was so so happy that this movie isn't just another standard horror movie, with a haunted house or haunted ghosts that appear when a person is alone in the house or alone in a room.<br/><br/>The story is original in the sense that a normal family faces the evil version of their own. (wich you won't see very often in many horror movies). & Also to be honest some scenes were funny, because let's admit it if you see yourself in a very weird way, acting weird it can evoke conflicting emotions. (shocked, angry and funny as well).<br/><br/>Another original aspect: the spiritual connection the people in red clothes (evil ones) had. But the end is disappointing..... it came over as nothing happened. Like the end of a fairy tale were they all live happily ever after. In my opinion a horror movie should have a bad ending.

The suspense and action are taut throughout and keeps you enwrapped. Little pieces of the plot are paced beautifully throughout and the performances are on point. You're left with questions well past the final reveal and the movie's message promotes inner thought. Any movie that can keep you enthralled from the opening scene to the final one and also promotes discussion is a win-win in my books. May have to rewatch this just to take in more of the messages throughout."

There are several plot holes that I didn't think about until I read other reviews but overall that didn't ruin my experience. I loved the cast, the look, the music. It was a nice job. Not the scariest or the most ground-breaking film, but it wasn't a waste of time to watch.

","I think Jordan Peele is a phenomenal talent. He has completely and utterly revamped the horror genre with ""Get Out"" and ""Us"". I'd say that ""Us"" is the weaker of his two big films at this point, but there isn't much in it. I still think it is creepy and eerie enough to keep me on edge for the whole film, and the emotional beats all work pretty well. The people playing the family and The Tethered all do their jobs pretty well, which is impressive seeing as 2 of them are kids. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this was nominated for best picture (like Get Out) for the next Oscars. He is a masterful writer and director, and I really look forward to what he comes up with next. I guess to bridge the gaps between this and his next film, I'll have to watch his new reboot of the Twilight Zone."

Honestly, in my humble oppinion this film is great. Some of the scenes are so creepy. Some of the plot points only make sense once the ending is revealed. The music is amazing and so well used with great juxtoposition. Plus the actors are great!

The comedic moments that Peele sprinkles into his movies are amazing and hit every time. The more intense moments work as well as Peele finds a way to make the audience care for the characters and what will happen next. My biggest complaint with this movie is the fact that Peele gives the audience too many answers towards the end. It would have been better if he left more concepts ambiguous which would make us go home and think.

","Jordan Peele again shows us why he is a director worth keeping an eye on with his second written and directed movie, Us. Get Out is a tough act to follow and the bar was raised very high and as such my expectations were up there when viewing this movie. It's a shame to say I was disappointed but not displeased with what I saw. All the performances were top notch, especially Luptia N'yango, who does fabulously as the antagonist and protagonist. Everything here is of quality, the visuals, the editing, the pacing, the movie is well made and produced but the thing that brings this movie down is it's tonal imbalance. There are a number of intense and horrifying scenes that are ruined by a attempt at a humorous moment are a silly gag. Once and a while it lands a joke but it's a consistent theme that renders all the suspense and tension of the moment shallow and uninteresting. This movie has the makings of a thrilling and chilling horror movie but it was sullyed by its inability not to take itself seriously consistently, if it did that, this would've been almost as good as Get Out.<br/><br/>It was enjoyable and well made but it had potential.

","Please, do not listen to these 1 star reviews. I am not entirely sure what has given them the impression that this movie deserves a 1 star, nor am I understanding the complaints of boredom as you come to a theater to sit, relax, and enjoy. If you really can't sit yourself down for 2 hours to digress a plot and enjoy a film, then maybe movies are not for you, but let me explain. Granted, this horror film IS two hours long but in the entirety of it all, it proceeds at a slow pace but not in a way that leaves you bored. Some of the actors in the movie were not Oscar winners, however I believe the main character makes up for this, as well as the comedic relief put into it. I thought the storyline, and the crazy plot twist left me leaving the theater really thinking about the Easter eggs in the movie and how creative the movie actually was. I think this movie was a fantastic follow up to ""Get Out"" by Jordan Peele, and while this movie is very hyped, I'd say it's almost worth it. Go give it a shot! I'm very glad that I did."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","1","4","24 March 2019"," One heck of a 'second album'.
","While its political commentary isn't as immediately obvious as in Peele's predecessor, 'Get Out (2017)', it's certainly there; 'Us (2019)' touches upon themes of class, oppression and nature vs nurture in subtle but unmistakable ways. Its majority plays out like more straight-forward 'genre' fare, with most of its metaphor being subtextual. What I mean is that the movie makes a point of being satisfying on a surface level, even though it's undoubtedly more rewarding if you're willing to dive into its allegory at least a few levels deep. Also, I say 'straight-forward' but it's really anything but. Sure, it plays with several tried-and-tested tropes but it always tries to subvert your expectations, and it usually succeeds. Some of its twists and turns are more predictable than others, and may even make retrospection slightly more difficult than you'd perhaps like, but these also tend to form in rewardingly counterintuitive ways. It takes a few leaps in logic and doesn't answer every question but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I feel it becomes slightly too unambiguous for its own good. A final act exposition dump takes some off the wind out of the pacing, even if the information is interesting and well presented, and the snippets of backstory we get often lead to more questions than answers, in a quite unsatisfying way that means it's better to ignore the stuff you don't see than to try and make absolute sense of it. Indeed, the sensory experience outweighs the logical on more than one occasion. Again, I don't think this is necessarily bad; the picture is frequently tense, suspenseful and, even, somewhat unnerving. It's never exactly scary but it knows exactly what it's doing, especially when it comes to getting you on the edge of your seat. The doppelg√§ngers are performed exceptionally well, each with their own creepy little quirks and properly evolving motives. The soundtrack, too, does a great job of keeping the tone in check. Once things kick off (after a rather long but necessary first act which sets up the core family and gets us rooting for them), the piece is pretty much unrelenting. It's brilliantly made, in every area, and actually sticks with you for a while, even if that isn't for the reason you may expect it to. At the end of the day, though, the (somewhat unfair) question on everyone's lips is: is it as good as 'Get Out (2017)'? Well, no but, frankly, little is. In the end, it's one heck of a 'second album'. 8/10"

"theisland2","7","1","4","24 March 2019"," A mixed bag of... greatness?
","This movie has ups and downs. For me the first time we see the doppelg√§ngers of the family, the blend of comedy from the father really makes the entire scene's frightening purpose rather bland and disappointing. Almost to the point where it's slightly cringeworthy, causing some laughs in the crowd, which was unfortunate. Same goes with a couple of scenes earlier in the movie. I don't really understand where the movie is trying to go sometimes. It really lacks the haunting effect of Jordan Peele's previous masterpiece ""Get Out"", because of the inconsistency. The movie is unpolished, which is why it doesn't get a particularly high rating.
The ending is phenomenal though, and it brings everything together. Some moments of confusion previously experienced during the movie disappears. However, the ending for me was a bit confusing. At first, it might be slightly difficult to understand though, but in my opinion that's not necessarily a bad thing. The confusioness of the ending might make this movie unforgettable!
Many scenes in this movie are truly terrifying, without the necessity of jumpscares, which I experienced during ""The Nun"". Jordan Peele is fantastic at building atmospheres. That's why I was very excited for this movie. Unfortunately, I had higher hopes. This movie had so much potential, but it felt like a confused, unpolished masterpiece. However, it's not a catastrophe, and I might watch it again for a clearer view. Maybe it will be even better next time.

","As a big fan of horror-thriller genrre of all sorts (1970s-current: Omen, Let the Rigth One In, Descent, Devil's Backbone, 28 Days Later, etc.), Us feels more like an intense thriller rather than a bone chilling psychological horror. Or, maybe it's because the older I get and more movies I've seen, it's hard to feel surprised or panicked by a movie anymore.<br/><br/>Get Out started out slow, and built up to frigthening scenes of survival.<br/><br/>Us also had a slow start (first 1/2 hr is more of an introduction to characters). The middle part is full of frightening chase-fight scenes, sprinkled with witty dark humour and the cast carried the story well with convincing chemistry. The last 1/2 hour was a bit heady / psychological thriller + social critique.<br/><br/>I'm happy that in the recent decade, more quality scripts, directors and actors are joining the horror/ psychological thriller genre, especially original stories instead of sequels and reboots.<br/><br/>As a movie-goer, the more choices the better: biopics, documentaries, drama, comedy, musical, animation, action, sci-fi, thriller."

","Jordan Peele rocked the world when he made Get Out a few years back. A film that garnered major buzz and even made some waves at the Oscars. I've always been a big fan of Peele and loved Key and Peele. Like most I was very excited for Us. The trailers for the film made it look like a straight up twisted horror film from the mind of a very creative individual. I liked most parts of the film but feel slightly disappointed with other parts. I feel like there are ideas in the film that are not fully developed and could have used more work.<br/><br/>The film is about a family that go to a vacation home. The matriarch of the family suffered trauma at a beach when she was younger and is hesitant to go there with her family. One night their home is broken into by a family, who they soon realize are their doppelgangers. These doppelgangers are more twisted versions of themselves with the intent to harm the family. The family try their best to survive while also figuring how something like this could happen. The film stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke, with Elisabeth Moss in a supporting role.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film is good. Don't mind some head bopping to the Beach Boys and N.W.A. The film is shot very well. Peele has mastered a real thrilling suspense element to his work which keeps you engorged with what might happen next. I felt like the story and themes of the film are undercooked which lead to a lower rating for me. Its acted extremely well by Lupita and is an interesting concept that needed more explanation than what was given. You can tell Peele has a creativity and a penchant for this genre but just felt like the script and main ideas could have been fine tuned.<br/><br/>This will offer a decent theater experience but doesn't resonate as well as Get Out did. Social class themes are examined in this film, much like race was in Get Out but Us doesn't hit the profound note that Get Out did. Its never really scary but has thrilling and comedic moments which make it a fun time at the cinema. I just wanted more from this. It's a film that had the potential to be outstanding but falls short despite being a fairly pleasing experience.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Here we center on a familar taking a vacation near the beach when they are suddenly attacked by their evil doppelgangers, that aspect alone is interesting enough to keep you watching throughout, thinking ""man where in the heck is this going?!"". Though just a warning for ""certain people"", if you are confused by the ending at all, just wait till all the ""ending explained"" videos come out, watch those then ask yourself; ""okay now inserting that information can i understand it more, and do i really need to deduct 3 or 5 points from this movie's score cause im a ignorant fool?""."

"jamalwalid","6","1","5","16 March 2020"," Gripping start, disappointing end
","During the first 40-50 minutes, I thought the film was very interesting. The concept of a clone copy of the family and the mystery behind them and their existence was alluring enough to get you hooked into the film.<br/><br/>I found the dad's character completely unsuitable for the plot, however. He showed an immense lack of seriousness in many parts throughout the film, something that any logical person in that situation wouldn't do. For example, when the family was in the car and the daughter wanted to drive, the family got into a completely unnecessary and stupid argument about who got the most kills, and the dad talked exceptionally slowly as he explained how he got the most kills, all while 'evil daughter' stood there in front of them. This illogicality was not exclusive to the dad, but was most common in his character.<br/><br/>Now, when the plot started getting a little bit more complex (clones of other people as well), the film began to lose it's sense of thrill. What used to be unique to that particular family became common to every other person in the country, so it didn't feel so special and eerie anymore.<br/><br/>As the plot grew more 'complex', it started to quickly lose it's sense of logic. Those people were placed there intentionally? They spent their entire lives in that bunker? How did all of the people in the country (I will assume this is exclusive to the US from the antagonist's line ""we are Americans"") fit in that bunker? Surely after a failed experiment all those specimens would just be rid of? Why did they wait until the family came back to Santa Cruz in order to start their attack? How did the 'clones' suddenly became no longer linked to the original's actions and were thus able to conspire this?<br/><br/>And, after the final failed attempt at a plot twist, it appeared that our protagonist durings this film was in fact the evil version of the mom. When films have plot twists this major, they're basically telling the viewer ""you didn't notice this even though the evidence was right there, we outsmarted you"". And, sometimes, they get to say this. They have fooled us, the viewers, so well that you can't do anything but applaud. A successful example of this was the plot twist in Shutter Island, without getting into detail.<br/><br/>The problem with this twist is that it makes absolutely no sense. All the 'evidence' suggests the exact opposite. Why would the girl be traumatised if she knew what was going on? How was she inserted into the world as a 8-10 year old knowing absolutely nothing, and successfully pull off such a ploy? Additionally, if you noticed, all the clones could not speak English, or any language, except for the mom, because she had some form of foundation in English from her earlier life. However, this would mean that the one in the upper world was not able to speak English, at least at that point, yet she vividly remembers memories of her parents talking in English, meaning that she was able to understand every word.<br/><br/>This 'plot twist' was unnecessary, illogical and a very cheap and unplanned attempt at surprising the audience. And, while we're talking about that, so was the entirety of the last half hour of the film.<br/><br/>However, I feel like the film deserves credit for it's start and general idea. The cinematography and music was very well executed, and it was an excellent acting performance overall, but particularly by Lupita Nyong'o. I think the film could've gone way better, but credit where due."

The ""home invasion"" genre probably has more intense movies but Us has also an interesting premise.
I really liked the ending but I guess that's up to taste.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for people who want a straight up horror movie.<br/><br/>This film is more of a satire and will leave you with many open questions.

You could make the best movie ever, they still would feel the urge to bash it. Not that Us is the best movie ever, far from that, but as a horror/thriller/mystery it's sure as hell entertaining. Okay the story contains flaws, things that don't add up, and that's why it could have been better, but it's still good enough for a nice intriguing movie night. The acting was not bad at all, especially from Lupita Nyong'o when she played Red. Some haters hated the twist at the end, maybe it wasn't necessary, I thought of it, saw it coming, and still was satisfied enough with Us.

","Some of the best experiences in film watching come from terror, from sitting on the edge of your seat, expecting a jump scare, and longing to know who will survive and what will be left of them. Jordan Peele, a brilliant writer and director, returns with a second cinematic nightmare freshly brewed from his imagination, both original and entertaining. This is a guy who truly knows how horror works and how to make the best of it with a wee touch of comedy. He showed it with Get Out and he shows it just as well in Us. Unlike Get Out, however, Us left many plot points unexplained and had a rather unresolved ending. Nevertheless, it deserves at least an 8/10."

I get it, you want to make something fresh and new but for me watching this movie was a huge let down. This movie just left more questions for me that needed answering and the director failed big time if the viewer has to look up information to understand the movie better which should've been explained in the 2 hours length time of this movie. For instance why did the doppelganger just walk up the escalator to the other world way before young Adelaide was captured by her evil doppelganger and switched bodies? What is the significant point of the rabbits hopping all over the ending? The director failed to explain why Adelaide's double, Red can barely talk which I learned by researching the evil one chocked her but in the movie it was not even addressed and how did she get out of those handcuffs as a little girl? What was the point of them ( the doppelgangers) killing everyone if they were just going to hold hands at the end of movie? There is no reason for this. If Jordan Peele makes a part 2 to this movie he better step up his Director skills or hire more director who can check him because the second part will be a huge flop."

","Spoiler! Don't read unless you want the movie ruined. I liked this movie! Not just because I love Santa Cruz, and it was way fun to see it used as a central spot in a strange account of underground tunnels with soulless clones in them! The acting was great, the humor was fun, it was quite compelling and suspenseful. I don't understand why there are so many people giving it a 1 star out of 10.<br/><br/>The thing that I am confused about is that the mother at the end, ""Adelaide"", even though we find out she was actually the original ""Red"", seems to have heart and soul. Red said that they did not have a soul. But the mother (the clone, Adelaide) seems to have soul, and a love for her children. Or, is this just an act? I can see how this movie can inspire fun conversations.<br/><br/>Also what was with the look on Adelaide's face at the end? What did that mean, as she is grinning at her son? Was he also switched? If he wasn't, why was she grinning? I thought it was a super fun movie, and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I would hope that if something like that is happening in real life, we can all come together in peace and love and liberate the clones, and give them love and affection and a start at a new life. I doubt our US govt. would just abandon millions of clones down below. And surely the human originals would find those tunnels and unearth this conspiracy. I hate the thought that one of my children could be cloned and living underneath the boardwalk. I would want them all! and I would want to love them and make them ALL happy. So the thought is disturbing, thank you Mr. Peele, but the movie was a good fun ride."

","I do agree that initially ""real critics"" would have been fairly starry-eyed in their glowing reviews of this film. Simply a mention of ""XXX"" wold probably have been enough to make this happen. However as the reviews on this site show, there has recently been a resurgence of ""reviews"" going in the other direction, which in my view are probably mass-posted by the same rightwing crew that lambasted Get Out as (some kind of) African-American propaganda. This film is great with an incredible cast - the lead lady is utterly brilliant and Elizabeth Moss (and Tim Heidecker?!) are great also. The tension builds nicely at the start and the story doesnt suffer any pacing issues in my view. See it for yourself, dont let a load of fake reviews put you off."

","As someone who thought Jordan Peele's Get Out was somewhat overrated (Best Picture nominee? I don't think so), compared to the atrocity that is US, it in addition to about a million other movies, is a masterpiece! Sorry, but Us is just pure idiocy. Subterranean doppelgangers? The mere idea is silly. And the twist was pretty obvious from the beginning. I'm finding an increasing problem of really bad pacing in a lot of modern movies. Us moves at a fast pace, but it's too fast. It just jumps right to the action without any character development for Adelaide, her family or their friends. Red and her exposition speech was obnoxious storytelling. Talk about spoon-feeding the viewer.<br/><br/>Although the adult characters were decent enough with their performances, especially award-winning actresses N'yong and Moss, the kids were annoying. The daughter always had this stupid look on her face and the son barely spoke. And the comedy bits in this were incredibly ill-timed and unfunny. That part where the family argued about who killed the most Tethers was the most cringe exchange I've seen in a movie this year and I've seen my share of films in theatres. The father and that performance art line? Ugh! And the movie should have been over at the 30-minute mark, but nope, let's killer talk the family and let them get away ON PURPOSE so they can deus ex machina their way to surviving.<br/><br/>Between this putrid piece and Peele's recent incredibly mediocre Twilight Zone reboot, I think Get Out was his 1-hit wonder. This mind-numbing mess is still above a 7 on this site, yet Curse of La Llorona, a genuinely frightful and entertaining horror flick is like 5.5? I guess Oscar-winning movies make fans give the director's next project an automatic pass, despite it being trash. And Us is trash!"

"tania-shoukair","8","1","5","5 April 2019"," One word: Trauma
","Maybe so many people missing the point of this movie is exactly the point? It's just another demonstration of how we refuse to look things directly in the eyes and call them by their names. For me this movie screams with subtle symbolism, mostly about how the human psyche works. Everywhere I look I see trauma, both personal and collective. I see the true cost of not facing and owning your darkest self, be it as an individual or a nation, and how this eventually comes back to haunt you. Just bare with me for a moment as I walk you through all the symbols.<br/><br/>The Tethered and the shadow:
Red introduces herself as Adelaide's shadow, they've met in the fun house which the child psychologist later on dubbed as a traumatic event. She even said Adelaide got PTSD from it, which her father dismissed with cynicism saying that she's not a Vietnam veteran. This illustrates the reality of how most of us deal with trauma, we refuse to look at it or work on it, and we do whatever it takes to just carry on. ""I just want my little girl back"" says the father. But trauma is a tricky thing that doesn't just go away. If you don't deal with trauma it sneaks up on you. In this case, literally.<br/><br/>In Jungian psychology everyone carries a shadow. In short, the shadow is the unknown side of our personalities, it's the dark part that we deny and don't identify with because of its grotesque nature. But the less it is embodied in our conscious life (so the more we deny it) the blacker and denser it becomes. And if you have unresolved trauma it also becomes part of your shadow. The deeper you push your trauma the bigger your shadow becomes and the more ""power"" it gains over your conscious self.<br/><br/>Think about Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Hulk, or werewolves tales, these stories are a perfect analogy of the shadow-self taking control over the personality in vulnerable moments. It's not a coincidence that Adelaide was wearing a Thriller t-shirt when she met Red, as she was about to meet her dual nature and experience her dark self in the form of fear. Adelaide didn't meet anyone, what she really met was her own fear, and unable to understand and cope with the fear her experience turned into trauma.<br/><br/>Why the Tethered decide to climb to the surface:
If you consider the above shadow theory mixed in with how trauma eventually resurfaces, this is a metaphor for collective trauma. The Tethered are our collective consciousness that we refuse to deal with. Now think about the Me Too movement and Black Lives matter for example, think about how much darkness we've shed light on in the past decade and how it has ""torn lives apart"" and cut things open (scissors much?). The Tethered decide to surface because it's time for the upper world to face the truth of its own choices and deeds. To face its true dark nature.<br/><br/>Rabbits:
Rabbits symbolise a connection between this world and the underworld. They can live both above and below the ground, in light and in darkness. The rabbits were locked in the underground world, they had no job but to be consumed by darkness (literally). But notice how when the Tethered were freed so were the rabbits. You can consider rabbits as the messengers between the conscious and the unconscious mind. The rabbits being free is the two parts of the psyche communicating again, it's a symbol of healing.<br/><br/>Red and Adelaide switching:
Because so much of Adelaide became Red in the fun house (so the fear/trauma/shadow) Red took over Adelaide. The real Adelaide was now locked in the underworld, or in the unconscious part of her psyche.<br/><br/>Jason looking at Adelaide suspiciously:
Children with their pure nature mostly see us for who we are and not for who we want to be seen. They're unbiased and honest. Think about ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", it was a child who pointed out the emperor's nakedness. It's also why Jason was the most in control of his shadow and the least afraid of it, he's still comfortable with this duality and doesn't see it as bad. It's why swear words don't shock him, he doesn't see them as bad just yet.<br/><br/>If I've decoded the symbolism correctly then Jordan Peele is one hell of a Carl Jung fan and a true master of storytelling. Being someone who had to face her own shadow (metaphorically and not in the form of a Tethered luckily), I found this movie very unsettling and somewhat true to the experience of getting to know your darkest self."

","""us,"" Jordan Peele's new film is an optimally well-organized, roteristically, artistically and technically flawless scallop. A junction of genres that pass through Slash from invasion to zombie apocalypse movies, through to Blaxploitation and comedy. In addition to remembering some movies, like the great ""Funny Games"" and the recent ""hereditary"".<br/><br/>The script of ""us"" is nicely embedded and cousin Twist in his plot. It is difficult to evaluate the script without spoilers, so I will be succinct, we have some problems of narrative agreement, but every dialogue has an importance in history, its precision is incredible and its ramifications that give back in the same place are delicious to watch, since these Turns have curves, which run away from the common, is almost a joke, because Jordan leads you to a path and takes you soon after, and this he does several times throughout the course. It is an acid script and well-crafted, that leads to a singular ending.<br/><br/>Jordan has a very good and conflicting technique, because the director has always been involved with comedy sketches, and he uses it several times, and mixes the two genres, sometimes gets forced, sometimes gets a little trash, but it is undeniable that this gives a signature to your work. Jordan knows exactly how a suspense movie is directed, the mixture of anticipation with the soundtrack and the camera that always turns against the gaze of the character on screen, are concepts of how to create a suspense that most directors forget, but Jordan does not , he does his homework, and does a lot Well, photography and blending the light to dark along with the sound mix are great, speaking in sound, what soundtrack ""us"" has, a mix of classical music and a vowel which refers to ""The hour of the nightmare"", is scary, talks with the film, is something stylish, that combines with the style of the film, and at the same time causes tension and discomfort, ""we"" has a trail and a spectacular sound.<br/><br/>Lupita is spectacular in her role, the actress is very demanding and performs with pleasure her dubious and conflicted characters, we feel her anger, anguish and violence and deserve an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Jordan is surprised again in his second film, the American, who also made the script, has a very authorial style of filming, but his style reminds me a lot of Tarantino, even in the matter of script and direction, Jordan follows the same line and places itself once in the Hall of Directors' fame in the new generation.<br/><br/>Finally, ""us"" is a pleasant surprise, a different film, well directed and acted, is not flawless, the comic relief and the concordance of its plot can annoy a minority, that even so, surely will go out enjoying the long. ""us"" does something difficult, pleases the critic and the public. 8/10."

","Arriving at their summer home, a family looking to have a relaxing summer vacation are suddenly confronted with mysterious, murderous doppelgangers of themselves who are intent on killing them and anyone else in their way along with their fellow doppelgangers, forcing them to stop the beings.<br/><br/>Overall, this one was enjoyable enough if still somewhat flawed. When this one works, its due to the rather fun concept of this one exploring a really underutilized setup for this one. The nature of the family being tormented by killer versions of themselves created in the fashion that they are here makes for a truly chilling and startling setup that gives this plenty of strong material to work with as the parallel versions of our own dark thoughts. Their penchant for using scissors, dressing in red jumpsuits and being generally creepy looking in their straightforward pursuit of the family is a wholly creepy concept that's incredibly well-detailed here. The connection here to the carnival she visited as a kid and the experiments done beneath the city with the secret tunnels and passageways hiding them as long as they have been is a grand setup here. This provides the film with a lot to like when their entire operation is revealed at the very end down in the lower facility and everything here becomes revealed. As well, this early setup manages to turn out a rather impressive and enjoyable series of action scenes here with the doppelgangers. The initial encounter in the carnival sets this up with a wholly chilling and freaky setup, yet the outstanding home invasion is where this one picks up considerably. With the sheer unknown quality of the family outside standing silently before they move and take over the house, there's an unnerving quality to their movements and behavior which is all the more chilling when compared alongside the stellar confrontations featured with each doppelganger. With the brutality inflicted here and the escape measures they try to employ in order to get away from them, this extended sequence serves the film well with a lot to like and is chilling enough to serve as a launching pad for the rest of the film being out on the run. Later confrontations at their friends' house with those doppelgangers and a series of TV show clips featuring the other doppelgangers out in the community offers the kind of viciousness that makes this one quite fun. That said, there are some issues with this one. The early buildup here with the family, as much fun as they are, stretch the beginning of the film out than it really should causing the film to, in turn, run on longer than it needs to be. These scenes of the father trying to get the family excited about the rustic experience at the cabin or getting together with their friends on the beach which feature some fantastic work setting up the characters but just feel like excess padding that could've gotten to the point sooner. Likewise, the pacing to this one's action scenes are wholly overlong, with the home invasion taking forever to get the intruders inside and then to take over which seems to take far longer than necessary more in terms of pacing and setup than actual on-screen action. Also rather troubling is the finale, where the action is quite underwhelming and it just doesn't end on a high note. These issues end up holding this one down.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence."

I think he overestimates his own intelligence and needs to sit down and reevaluate. And even though it had mild violence and some smattering of blood this is not a horror movie.

"js-66130","7","1","6","28 March 2019"," CLASS DISMISSED
","Masquerading as a political horror flick, ""Us"" is really a steady stream of cultural references thriller with a twist clever enough to get folks all riled up. Much like the the Coen brothers, and Quentin Tarantino, Jordan Peele is obsessed with littering his grand canvas with a bunny farm of Easter Eggs.<br/><br/>The internet is going crazy tracking down everything from obscure VHS covers, to Biblical passages, to this Michael Jackson fella. It's all a bit much really, distracting from what should be a seat-gripping theatre experience. Pilfering an old Twillight Zone episode about an evil doppelganger, ""Us"" takes a brilliant premise and clutters it with needless tidbits. This of course means box office gold, as repeated viewings are necessary to grasp everything needed for proper dissection. Shame that.<br/><br/>""Us"" looks great, revs nicely to a boffo climax, and features some brilliantly complex performances from its leads. Lupita Nyong'o is especially fantastic. But as with all great horror films, there needs to be a suspension of common sense to really dig this movie. If there's time to ponder on the plausibility of what is happening on screen, then the whole thing falls apart. ""Us"" comes close, but short (where the hell are the guns?).<br/><br/>Still, there's enough fodder here (privilege, race, America, revenge, soul, cults) for much heated discussion, and Jordan Peele proves he's not a one trick pony director, but a horse that needs to be reigned in a little."
"TheVictoriousV","6","1","6","24 March 2019"," Well-crafted, with the odd ""beginner's mistake"" or two
","It'll be fun to see what becomes of MadTV alumni and horror newbie Jordan Peele. His 2017 directorial debut Get Out had some problems but it still mixed paranoia-inducing horror with satirical comedy rather well, and for a first outing, 'tis really quite something. Among other things, he's doing a new Twilight Zone series which I will want to see.<br/><br/>Now comes Us, his movie about a black family that goes on vacation only to find themselves terrorized by, well, themselves. The core premise and early parts of the movie show potential; what Peele clearly excels at is crafting an atmosphere through visuals, audio, camera work, and music. However, some would say this one ends on a note of nonsense and a revelation that should not have been made. I can see it.<br/><br/>It all began when Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) was a child, wandering into a hall of mirrors on a summer night at Santa Cruz Beach and seeing herself in what certainly wasn't a normal reflection. Having gotten over (?) the trauma of this outlandish encounter, she is now married to the goofy Gabe (Winston Duke) and a mother to Zora and Jason (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex). The acting all-around is skillful, excluding a few moments where the actors seemed to miss the shift from comedy to horror. Not that I could always tell either.<br/><br/>The family is traveling to Adelaide's childhood domicile, now functioning as their summer home. And alas, after another strange event at the beach of Santa Cruz, familiar faces attack Adelaide's home. Indeed, the family is faced by their own doppelgÏ±Ñngers - their ""tethered"" selves, which are connected to them in some convoluted way that goes beyond physical resemblance. I'm not sure I got all the details.<br/><br/>Other doppelgÏ±Ñngers start to appear, including those of neighbor Josh (Tim Heidecker), his wife Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and their twin daughters. I don't know why these particular doppelgÏ±Ñngers seem more ruthless toward their real-world counterparts than those of Adelaide and her family. Maybe it's because Josh and his family were already kinda jerks themselves. Maybe it's because of what's revealed in the twist: the true connection between Adelaide and Red - her double - which shows that Red's motive is more vengeful. I actually knew the twist going in. So far as I could tell, the beginning of the movie works a bit better without the recontextualization. Mostly.<br/><br/>It also would have been fine if the movie told us nothing of what these creatures are, outside of the connection between, at the least, the heroine and her double. As it is, the movie explains a little too much, which results in it not explaining ENOUGH. When a movie like this starts telling us some of the rules, we start wondering about other rules (when we're forced to think about what happens literally in the film, we may not appreciate its metaphors and themes). In this case we might wonder why some doppelgÏ±Ñngers can seemingly exit their realm freely if they are also ""trapped"".<br/><br/>While these details won't ruin the experience for everyone - especially as Peele gets the scary tone down where it counts, skillfully making mundane objects and places seem ominous, and does fine with the humor - there are still a few beginner's mistakes. The dialogue isn't as believable as it could have been and many of the ""Chekov's Gun"" set-ups are pretty blatant, though there were a few bits of reincorporation I failed to foretell from Peele's clues. (NEAT DETAIL: One ""Chekov's Gun"" is Gabe's boat, which tends to malfunction in a such a way that you ""need"" to pound the outboard motor on its left side. When Gabe's mirror-self ends up in the same situation, he starts hammering it on the wrong side.)<br/><br/>Most importantly, perhaps, is that Us is more interesting and eerily thought-inspiring than most other horror movies being made these days.

","Us is a great new horror film. One kind that, similar to Hereditary, we don't get very often. This is one special film. It's haunting and dramatic, this film has some really good social commentary and comedy interwoven. I love that Get Out was horror comedy with much more social commentary interwoven. Us is more of a straight up horror film which I liked. Lupita Nyong'o was incredible in this film, she gave an Oscar-worthy performance. She had one of the best performances and best characters I've seen in a horror film. This film leaves quite a lot of aspects open to interpretation. This is the kind of film that begs you to watch it multiple times because of how ambiguous it is, which I love because the this is the type of film where you will get something new out of it, you'll notice things that you didn't notice on the first viewing. Which is not done out of laziness, it was very purposeful. In fact I personally would've left the film even more ambiguous. But wow I am very impressed, Jordan Peele is the new master when it comes to horror films and I can't wait to see what he does next. Us gets a 9/10 from me."
"optechfortyeight","1","2","21","24 March 2019"," I wanted to like us! I like Mr. Peele
","Too much of everything!
It like he had so many good ideas he tried to cram them all in and sebsequently ""everything"" landed flat.<br/><br/>He seemed like he had a strong vision. Similar to the movie mother.
But sometimes the overall message gets lost or never found when the director gets enamoured with trying so hard at it.<br/><br/>He would have been better off with shadowing the movie ""Coherence."" A film by james ward byrkit.
Perhaps but differently having everyone a different nationality, creed age ect.<br/><br/>Keeping the shots clostrophobic and keeping the plot simpler would have awarded him the much needed tension, and perhaps the social justice warrior.<br/><br/>Needless to say. I hope next time he doesnt over complicate it and send it through a few times to catch any glaring mistakes.<br/><br/>Better luck next time.

"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","10","1","7","7 January 2020"," ""US"" against us
","""Us"" by Jordan Peele, the once comedian and actor transitioned to innovative/revolutionary horror/suspense movie creator. Much acclaim could be given to this movie but I expect some will be taken away from the brilliance of this film purely based on comparison to his first film ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film gives you exactly what you want in a horror film. It has you watching behind your back, looking around the corner, and looking in the mirror differently. On a completely different spectrum, this film is capable of inspiring dialogue and discussion among friends, family, co-workers and allows you to share some laughs. Peele has struck gold again with this film in the way he's played into people's conscious and subconscious fears and the actual reality we live. Peele also found a way to tie biblical context to current reality seamlessly, further adding to the quality of this film. All of the above makes this a well-rounded film.<br/><br/>Now this film isn't perfect by any stretch. If I have to nitpick, there is some predictability. Also the explanation in the ending, even for a fantasy movie, is unrealistic. It leaves you saying, ""huh?"" and ""how'd they do that again?"". But all in all, that doesn't make me tell a person to not see this movie in the theater. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie gets some Oscar chatter, especially if it can gain a following similar to ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>Either way, go see this in the theater and I'd even say get yourself some popcorn to smack on to ease the suspense he leaves you in."

Lupita is outstanding, this is acting like Jack in the Shinning--and she is better. 3. film started very well, and then....<br/><br/>My word is this a professional filmmaker? How can you get so many things right and then run your own film into the nearest tree and not know? What is up with the dialogue? And seeing his other films it is clearly a problem with Peele. How can you know so much but not enough to keep your film buoyant. It is like two people wrote the film. The start a real script writer and then a novice took over. The films concepts are muddled, random, unexplored and lazy. And I really did not like Mr. Black Panther in this film, what a useless character and horrible acting. The kids were on point.
I am suspect of these so-called critics. Is this one of those "" We need a black film for this year"" thing?"

Whether it be herself or her evil counterpart, she steals every scene, and I see an Oscar nomination incoming. Winston Duke was also excellent; he was hilarious in comedic moments but also fantastic during the thriller/horror parts. Evan Alex and Shahadi Wright Joseph, who played the children, were also exceptional.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is incredible. The way they handled the horror aspect was unique, and I enjoyed it a lot. The comedic moments aren't overdone, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. The score is remarkable, nothing short of perfection. But, the film has its issues.<br/><br/>The second half of the film, specifically the third act is the weakest part. Instead of being unique, it starts to turn into a conventional horror film, and as I said earlier, I'm usually not a fan of horror. The ending is something I didn't see coming, but I didn't like it at all. The end leaves you with so many unanswered questions and adds more complex elements, and that ultimately brings the score down for me.<br/><br/>Although it's not as good as his first movie, Jordan Peele gives us a film that has fantastic performances, great comedy, a ridiculously good score and shows that the sophomore slump can be beaten.<br/><br/>8/10 - Great"

","Lots of reviews on here pointing out plot holes. It's a horror film, and much more in the classic horror genre than the director's ""Get Out"". Horror films have plot holes. They're implausible, hence the ability to reanimate dead bodies, have potentially fatal injuries shaken off (and in the case of the husband here, a pretty minor dead leg seem like a mortal wound!) and have unexplained sub-texts that exist only to set up the pay off. The question when rating a horror film is was it enjoyable (yes), was it well acted (you simply won't get a better actress than Lupita Nyong'o in a horror film ..... ever) and did it deliver on the shock, suspense, gore etc (sort of.... not just after-timing here but I guessed the ending about a third of the way theough), and that ruined the main set up for me). But it was brilliantly shot and directed, had a few little nods to Get Out, and compelled me to shoo the family out of the room and watch it uninterrupted. Good entertainment!"
"truemythmedia","10","1","8","8 August 2019"," Metaphorical Horror
","""Jordan Peele's ""Get Out (2017)"" was a brilliantly devised movie that confronted the face of racism in today's modern society, but not only did it attack an important social issue, it also worked as a thrilling story. Horror is one of the Academy's least recognized categories, so when they gave Peele the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, that was a huge deal, and it really speaks to the genius that went into making that film. As a horror fan, Us quickly rose to one of my most anticipated films of 2019, and let me say it does not for a moment disappoint. I don't know if many people will agree with me, but I'm going to say that Peele's sophomore entry is superior to Get Out, and that is really saying something.<br/><br/>""Us"" attacks another very relevant topic in today's society, but again, it works on so many levels that even without the social commentary it is darned impossible to ignore. The acting is stupendous, the writing somehow balances humor in horror in a way that continuously entertains without ever shattering the tension Peele so carefully crafts, and the attention to detail in the direction is mind-boggling. The symbolism woven into the movie is subtle enough that there are plenty of ways the film could be taken, and every interpretation is more interesting than the next. I'm trying not to overhype this film, but honestly this is one of those films that will be remembered for years to come."
"timetopooptoday","10","1","8","2 July 2019"," The Best Part Of A Story Is Always The Ending
","To truly appreciate this film: If you watch until the ending, everything makes sense and all ties together. I suggest watching it more than once because there are many, many nuances that are quite subtle that you'll remember after watching the first time and say to yourself, ""oh, so that's what that meant, and there were double meanings too!"" The trailer does say watch it once for the scares and thrills and twice to understand it. This is definitely a film that I was able to wrap my head around the first time because I paid close attention, remembering those instructions. However, I wanted to immediately watch it again. After watching the first time you'll wish to watch again, especially if you take any breaks at all. I won't give away any spoilers but let me tell you, I normally don't go for the typical slasher / end of the world / here come the monsters horror flicks but this was definitely worth it. It blended psychological thriller with jump scares and the idea, the simple concept of ""what if."" You'll understand why Red talks and why her voice sounds as it does. So, settle in and prepare for the mind trip you've never experienced before: to watch Us, the typical American family in the US. I hope there is a sequel."

Usually with films I can always figure things out pretty easily and it's very hard to get me surprised - but this got me surprised and I should have seen the clues all the way through the film but it so cleverly done that I missed every single one.

"bankofmarquis","8","1","9","25 March 2019"," Jordan Peele does it again
","2 years ago at this time, the comedian known as Jordan Peele was all the talk as his feature film Directorial debut, GET OUT was scaring mainstream audiences. This was quite the accomplishment for a first time African-American Director with a film that was, predominantly, cast with African American actors.<br/><br/>Director/Writer Peele is at it again with the horror film (predominantly filled with African-American actors )US - and audiences, I'm sure, are going to go back in to the theater hoping that they will get scared again. And they will, but they will also get something else - a truly unique film.<br/><br/>I see a lot of movies, so for me to be (1) scared and (2) completely surprised by what is going on in a film is a rarity, indeed. And Jordan Peele has done both of these things with US - he has scared and surprised me, and I mean this in a a good way.<br/><br/>US stars Lupito Nyong'o as Adelaide Wilson, a young mother who had a traumatic experience at the beach as a child. Now, as 30-ish mother of two who is visiting that same beach with her husband and 2 children, the traumatic experience comes rushing back. To tell anymore of the story would be to spoil it and to spoil this film for anyone would be a shame, for the fun in this film is trying to figure out what will happen next. Even when you think you know what's going to happen, something else happens instead and you are kept guessing throughout the film.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, Nyong'o shows that she can carry a film. I was beginning to fear that she would be one of those former Oscar winners (for 12 YEARS A SLAVE) who fade into obscurity, but this film puts her right back - front and center - on the map, a map that she deserves to be on. She carries this film - and she carries it well. Winston Duke (M'Baku in BLACK PANTHER) ably plays her husband, but is reserved (for the most part) as needed comic relief. I am always concerned when a heavy part of a film falls into the hands of unknown child actors, but Evan Alex (as their son) and - especially - Shahadi Wright Joseph (as their daughter) pull off the acting they need to do.<br/><br/>Credit for all this falls on Jordan Peele who's direction and script shows that GET OUT was no fluke. As I said before, this is a truly ORIGINAL film in plot and content and Peele keeps the action moving forward in interesting ways.<br/><br/>This is a film that needs to be seen more than once. I, for one, can't wait to go back into the theater and check out US again.<br/><br/>Letter Grade A- (but it might move to an A after a 2nd viewing)<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Whites are also criminals and sociopaths (blacks are victims only). From the second half to the end of the movie, it feels the writers tried to create a metaphor with slavery but got lost on the narrative. Fed the leading white female actress with evil. Failed on terror, however. It's definitely not a mature narrative. Character ""Gabe"" is very funny. The leading actress, Lupita, hasn't done a good job. She is just not convincing.

These two things are referenced in the film. There are also a lot of Easter eggs relating to both. The acting was phenomenal, and unlike some horror movies, if you understand the plot it gives you a bit of a sick feeling.

Just enough to lull you into a relaxed state, but immediately jarring you out of it a few moments later. The juxtaposition of certain feel good tunes also creates this sense of safety, but this film manages to make every one of these songs terrifying.<br/><br/>The opening creates an absolutely creepy mood that sticks through the whole film. Peele even manages to make a beautiful sunny beach seem eerie. There was enough blood to satisfy gore hounds, while also enough off screen kills and pain to heighten the tension.<br/><br/>Best of all, the film makes you want to understand what it means.

","The Emperor's New Movie! These 10/10 reviews for a film of such utter lack of storytelling ability upsets me to no end. So many of these reviews are saying people just do not get it or that the film is for critical thinkers. It is NOT. It is an absolute mass of plot holes that continually get larger as the film progresses. So the whole country has been cloned... uh... ok. So people on top of the world meet, have sex and have a baby and boom... the clones also meet up, have sex and have a baby... underground... wearing the same clothing. Hmm. Amazon drones maybe? How do they pay for that? The baby born is identical to the baby up on top. Uh... I think Mr. Peele needs to go back to sex Ed. The sheer number of sperm and eggs and the odds of a baby occurring are long enough, but for that exact ""cloned"" sperm to get to the exact cloned egg? Come on. So much more of this film is equally laughable. They can obviously just pop up top whenever they want. Why did the girl not just go back up right afterwards? I can't imagine she was chained to a bed for thirty years. And why the HECK would she speak like a mentally challenged person when she did? I'm guessing clones get some kind of good amazon deal. Or they open manufacturing plants down below for pairs of red jumpsuits and gold scissors, of which they need millions upon millions. The sheer number of plot holes was staggering. So many more than what I just mentioned. And now the acting... I keep seeing raves for the acting. It was awful. The theater was laughing at the wrong things. The main girl was laughably bad. The husband was a bumbling oaf that should have been in a three stooges film. The behaviors of the characters were all so plot driven that realism was shoved forcefully out the door. I can honestly assume that Jordan Peele is such a force and such a race role model that people feel they need to praise it or be ostracized. It's the Emperor's New Clothes in real life. This move was bad. REALLY bad. And I happen TO be a critical thinker. Any thought at all put forth into this film will leave an honest person with the same conclusions as here. Save your money.

The direction which was made by Jordan Peele who is also the writer, was simply exceptional and he presented very well the characters, their stories and also their feelings in many occasions, something that made us understand and relate with his main characters very much. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie and especially to those who are big fans of horror movies because I am sure that you won't be disappointed by it."

","A thoroughly enjoyable spooky-thriller. The movie definitely intends to be a horror film, but is really more of a suspense/thriller/ comedy. There aren't really any genuine scares in the film but there is a strong sense of dread and the characters really feel like they are in serious danger throughout. There are however a ton of genuine laughs along the way. It's definitely not a horror comedy in the style of Shaun of the Dead or so, but the dialogue and characters are consistently hilarious.

","Us looks quite promising to start with but the films script and story starts to lose it's way 30 minutes or so in.
What the story started to promise begins to flake away because there are too many plot holes and illogical errors. It's an original idea but poorly executed.
It's a shame that the story wasn't thought through properly because it could have been quite good.
Its acted quite well although the dopplegangers voice should have been dropped as it distracts in a comical way.
There's a little bit of tension and you think it will be a decent horror, which it isn't, as there are no real scary moments in the whole movie. The first scene is sinister but little else.
Sadly It ends being a disappointing attempt."

","Right in the middle for me. I enjoyed the photography and top notch performances. The humor was at times perfection, and I love the way the Director makes his commentaries on race relations. It makes me look at other movies with mostly white casts and causes some kind of introspection without hitting you over the head and turning you off. That being said, the sheer amount of plot holes and complete suspension of disbelief are too hard to ignore here. He had too much to say, and didn't have enough time to pull it off. The chalk board scene in the end was elementary at best, like he's the director of a short film trying to get in too much information. After 1:40 the last 20 minutes was a slog."

Hardly any time for character building, in spite of almost 2 hour run time. Twists and turns in the plot were not helpful. Poorly timed humor makes the story line a bit confusing and the finale hardly deserves applause. I'm sure high hopes were expected.<br/><br/>Starring are: Lupita Nyong'o, Winton Duke, Anna Diop, Elisabeth Moss, Madison Curry and Shahadi Wright-Joseph."
"Landon1620251","5","0","2","13 May 2020"," Consider us disappointed.
","I hope this movie is judged on its own merits. Not by Jordan Peele's previous movie, Get Out. Not by it being a Jordan Peele film alone. Because it is not the unflinching masterpiece that Get Out is.
Don't get me wrong, Us is a very good, competent film. The cast is perfect. There isn't a single main or side actor that has a weak performance in this picture (except for the twin sisters). Special shoutout goes to Lupita Nyong'o and Shahadi Wright Joseph playing the mother and daughter. This is also one of the few times where licensed music was well inserted in the movie. There is even an orchestra-heavy mix of ""I Got 5 on It"" by Luniz that is used during the final conflict that I thought worked very well.
That said there is a lot the kept this from being a great film. This is not Jordan Peele's ""next nightmare"" that the marketing so proudly proclaims. There are a couple of twists in this film. One in the beginning of the third act and another at the end. The reveal of who Lupita's character really is was supposed to be this huge, Shyamalan twist. The only problem comes from the fact that I predicted the reveal an hour ago. So big shock here and you will most likely guess it before the movie just tells you. The other problem is how I felt there was no stakes in the movie. This is kind of a spoiler, but Peele wrote the family to be so likable that you assume that the four of them will survive some pretty close calls. The other family in the film is comparatively under-written and not really likable so you know their fate. I appreciated this ""horror"" movie not having any jump scares in it but I was also kind of hoping for some scares of any kind.
This movie is perfect for the masses who don't expect too much from their movies. For those who don't want multiple layers that you can un-Peele (sorry) from multiple viewings from films like Get Out. For everyone else, if you haven't seen Us yet, skip it."

Dario Argento failed to leave Giallo behind so he does Giallo and you are sometimes redeemed by a couple of brilliant scenes.<br/><br/>What is brilliant with Us? It's a total rehash, mainly based on Funny Games which I think is the most horrific movie I have watched (1997).

Things start to get unsettling for Adelaide who notices strange things are afoot; all leading to their holiday home being invaded and them being terrorised by their doppelg√§ngers. Nyong'o's performance is absolutely fantastic; she really captures the paranoid terror Adelaide feels during this time so well and also portrays her doppelg√§nger to frightening effect!

"shivamt25","8","0","1","13 April 2020"," US - Truly a Masterpiece
","Did you ever get a feeling that however normal your life seems, something sinister is always lurking around. Something, hidden in the shadows, is observing you and trying to get closer every second. That feeling came true for Adelaide when she revisited one of her childhood vacation place with her present family. Suddenly, the sweet family getaway becomes a fight for life for her family when they are attacked by some home invaders who share a close connection to them. They ARE them.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele has done it again. He has made another movie which will be remembered in the history of times as a movie which made everyone ponder over it longer then they should. With Get Out, he made a clever satire about the inherent dark side of the elite white families in US. I liked the way how subtly that point was put that many still don't see it that way. In US, he has gone one step further. He has made a movie which can have multiple interpretation for anyone who's watching. Any interpretation you go with, one thing that we are sure of is that it's not just a home invasion movie.<br/><br/>US has layers like an onion. On the front it seems like a horror thriller featuring a family being terrorised by their doppelgangers. But when you dwell more, you'll see how it presents different themes. Saying anything more than that will spoil the experience of those who are yet to watch it.<br/><br/>One great thing about US is that it is a perfect blend of horror and comedy without actually being a horror comedy. It's very easy to bifurcate both moments in the film. You'll be laughing at one moment and in the next you could be extremely terrified. This energy keeps you hooked to it. The performance of almost every one is beyond great. The centre stage is held by Lupita N'yongo and she does everything with finesse. She is almost unrecognisable in as one in both her personas. Other things that make the movie an amazing watch are it's background score, the story and the climax.<br/><br/>Although, like Get Out, I found the big reveal tad bit predictable but it is clearly visible that the reveal is not just the one thing which is holding it all together. Everything about the movie contributes to the big picture and makes it a cinematic marvel.<br/><br/>Leave all the things and go watch US in theatres. It is one such film which has the power to strike long debates. What it more exciting that watching a movie which stays with you even after you're done watching it?!"

","I was terrified of this from the trailer, good sign! The trailer offered us house invasion horror that was scary as hell but the actual film offers so so much more.<br/><br/>From the director of Get Out 2017, Jordan Peele, created Us a film that I was desperate to see and if you click with his style derived from a multitude of horror/ thriller styles you'll love this.<br/><br/>One point I'll make from the get go is don't go into this thinking you will understand everything going on. I find it useful to remember the directors words 'the film is about duality' in the back of my mind while I watch. The film is open to interpretation but I didn't find it any less enjoyable to watch just more intriguing to think about later!<br/><br/>The characters and actors are brilliant! The family is instantly likable and relatable from their initial car journey to the setting where the main protagonists childhood trauma sparks the catalyst for the film. Incidentally they are listening to a classic hip hop song 'i got 5 on it' which I didn't think could haunt me like it does but with the clever and subtle remix it's been given it add to the vibe of the film.<br/><br/>This film has everything, creepy kids (a horror movie go to too freak me out) scary voices, relatable peril, big questions, judgement with a message. On first viewing I was too busy hiding behind my protection pillow (saved for jumpy movies) to take in all that this film has to offer. It left me intrigued and wanting answers but then I went on to enjoy answering the questions it gave me. I'm guessing everyone's questions will be different too giving it even more of a multilayered effect than Get Out did. Showing that the director has his own style, one that I very much enjoy.<br/><br/>I'm drawn to Jordan Peele in the same way I was with M Knight Shamaylan in the late 1990's after the Sixth Sense. Their genres are unique and definite. I cannot wait to see what he's done with Candyman set for release later this year and hope his further releases leave me wanting more as Get Out and Us have."

","Us it's not a bad movie...but it tried so hard to be symbolic, to make references, to engage in the viewer on its twists..that somehow became too fascinated with its own gimmicks and didn't deliver enough.<br/><br/>First it was too long. The rythm was not on point. I think the doppelgangers should've appeared after 10 minutes of film. 2 hours was too much, and because of that, only a few scenes were somehow scary. Also the build up was good, but when the tethers actually show up, the film loses a bit of edge. Probably, again, because they should have come up a bit before they did - the problem was that peele was trying to put a lot of symbology in order to make sense, that he forgot the movie needed rythm.<br/><br/>I don't mind with a movie that leaves a lot of questions unsaid, and uses symbolic measures or metaphors, while not explaining that enough. Heck, i loved movies like holy motors, under the silver lake or mulholland drive. The problem is that this movie doesn't want to be like that. It wants to make sense, it wants to explain to the viewer what's happening - otherwise it wouldn't worry that much on putting so many references thoughout its length, in order for people to go back again and see what they missed.<br/><br/>If you're so much worried on giving easter eggs to the viewers for the twists, you should also try to give meaning to the other parts of the movie - and in this case it didn't happen. Plus, you don't try to give explanations like this movie did - on the most boring and predictable way. Jordan Peele is a good screenwriter, he knows he can't do that like he did here.<br/><br/>All in all: not bad, but it tried too much to be smart when it could just be a great horror film.

But if you enjoy great acting (specifically Lupita Nyong'o) and a deeply horrifying plot, this movie is up your alley. I would not say this movie was scary in the sense of jump scares or paranormal scenes. This movie scares you with its symbolism. Jordan Peele also throws in Easter eggs that you either have to watch it multiple times, or spend an hour reading through the trivia. The music is also astounding, with Michael Abels continuing his partnership with Peele. This film will make you think, and if you can get past the plot-holes, you will certainly enjoy it."

It leads the watcher to ask many questions that will soon get answered by the end of the movie. Also, the ending of the movie was perfect for this chaotic thrilling movie, but you're left with many questions that make you wonder if a sequel will be made.
The sound track in the movie, I'd say is very unique compared to many other movies in this category. It does make me wonder though, in the first scenes of the movie the song ""I got 5 on it"" sung by Luniz, an african american duo; is this anyway connected to any racial stereotypes seen out in the world? Although, I do love the use of minorities as the main characters in a movie, especially when it breaks stereotypes.

Mystery/Thriller Rated R
Your in for a scary surprise, with the Mystery/Thriller mix ""Us""
The movie was directed by Jordan Peele who has proved his potential in the film industry with his hilarious short movies on youtube called ""Key & Peele"" and horror movies ""Get Out"" and now ""Us"" which gives him a wide horizon of content to pick from. Peele has been an actor for many movies, tv shows and short videos to show his experience in the filmmaking industry by producing such well made quality movies. Some consider Peele to be one of the best directors with his work resembling years of experience all the while he is actually quite young. Peele uses horror and bends it to explore cultural attitudes and Identities through a family on vacation who have some familiar guests arrive one evening. Adilade Wilson the now mother of the family had a rather life changing experience as a child that will leave the audience confused but interested. This experience in her childhood takes a turn for the worst when a family looking identical to theirs visits them. The original Wilson family is confused about who is at their vacation home and the father, Gabe attempts to scare them off until the identical looking family split off into the woods and start running towards the house. The original family attempts to defend themselves but the others are to strong and breach their home. Somehow the family escapes and is alive to fight another day. This movie is not only thrilling but leaves room for assumption and suspense. The suspense build ups through the film keep it interesting and leaving the viewer to always be anticipating more. As you watch more strange things begin to happen, including people wearing red prison suit killing themselves and then walking to the line of identicals and holding hands in a single field line. Which has a connection to hands across america. This line is the goal that the identical looking people are attempting to achieve. The Wilson family continuously survive crazy and intense situations and even try and avenge their friends who were murdered by surprise. The filmmaker has a ton of tricks up his sleeve to scare your pants off. He uses sound effects and different camera angles to create an eerie and scary feeling. Adelaide Wilson the haunted mother, her husband Gabe and her two children Zora and Jason must fight for their survival as there identical family isn't over with them yet. The family must pick the others off one by one until it was the two mothers left to battle in the very spot that they met. Eventually one of them comes out victorious and its not without a wicked twist. At times the film and direction can be off putting or distracting but it will reel you back in just as quick. This movie is no ""What are you doing?"" Horror film but instead the characters make the right decisions to overcome their enemies and show great amounts of valiant efforts to save their loved one. Also just a tip, if you see someone on the street carrying a big pair of scissors, run in the opposite direction of that person."

","The movie Us is a horror film directed by Jordan Peele, the same man who directed the infamous Get Out. The film is set in Santa Cruz with Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family taking a getaway vacation to their summer home. That same night, a group of ""doppelg√§ngers"" show up at the family's house, trying to take their lives. This film really is the definition of a horror movie with jump scares and gruesome characters but the thing that is most impressive about the movie is how it makes you think when and after watching it.
The opening scene shows us Adelaide as a child going to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk with her mom and dad. She wanders off towards the beach and finds a ""vision quest"" room that seems to be empty. In the room she finds a girl that looks just like her and runs out of the room to find her parents. This scene creates a sense of uneasy emotions with the audience. It was a quick glimpse at what the rest of the film would be set around and this sequence was a great opener.
The movie continues and Adelaide is married with 2 kids. They are at their summer home in Santa Cruz when during the night, another family of 4 is standing in their driveway. Adelaide and her family are captured only to realize the people doing this are their ""doppelg√§ngers"". They escape though, which starts a chain of running and fighting scenes for about an hour of the movie. These scenes use different camera angles and a lot of different lighting to convey a certain type of feeling. For example, when the doppelg√§nger family captures Adelaide, the director chose to use under lighting on Red (Adelaide's doppelg√§nger) to give her a sinister and evil look. Another thing that adds to the film is the sounds. The film uses sounds to emphasize the moment and make the audience feel like they are apart of what is happening. It also uses a repeated soundtrack during important scenes in the movie like when Adelaide and Red are having their final fight in the underground systems
The movie ends with Adelaide killing Red which then brings Adelaide to a flashback. We see her again walking into the ""vision quest"" room and she sees the little girl (a younger Red). Earlier in the movie when this scene was shown, the screen went black and the audience had no idea what had happened after she saw the little girl. When the scene is replayed, the audience gets to see that Red actually took Adelaide and brought her to the underground system where all of the worlds doppelg√§ngers lived. Through this one scene the whole demeanor of the movie is changed. It is a complete twist in what the audience thought would happen and a perfect way to end. Us is a complete movie, from the chilling horror scenes to the physiological twists it presents, this film is spectacular take on how a horror movie should look, sound, and make you feel."

","All these ""they didn't explain enough"" or ""needed more backstory"" reviews must be from people who like midichlorians in Star Wars... I enjoyed the movie. I don't think a good horror movie needs a lot of explanation, in fact I feel like it really adds to the suspense. The characters make mostly realistic choices throughout, at least in line with how I would handle the situation. I wouldn't change a thing; I think it's really original and can't wait to see more from Jordan Peele."

"nizzambaharuddin","7","0","4","13 January 2020"," LIKED THIS BETTER THAN GET OUT
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>According to the masses, Jordan Peele's directorial debut Get Out is Jordan his masterpiece. Meanwhile, Us is the more average film. I've watched both films, and I'm in the minority actually for liking Us more than Get Out. Here's why:<br/><br/>Get Out is more predictable in terms of the storyline, albeit with its heavy themes. Us is still in the same vein, heavy metaphors and kinda predictable, but it's more light in tone. I find to be more entertaining than Get Out. Okay now for the film review.<br/><br/>Us uses the concept of doppelgangers and evil twins, or in the case of this film the Tethers. If other lame conventional horror films uses the tried and tired formula of jumpscares to get you off your seat, Us uses your own mind to get you on the edge of your seat. What will these Tethers do next? That's what made it more scary than loud noises and stupid / scary faces. It's definitely fresher than a clich√© plot involving a family who just moves into an old scary haunted house. More like these, please.<br/><br/>The film cleverly uses the Tethers to engage the audience to feel the same as the family in the film. Where do they come from? Why do they have the same face as the family? What will they do? What do they want? You could us trying to figure out the answers with the main characters. And that's what make a good film. It doesn't hold your hands, it doesn't necessarily provide answers. It's just there to tell you a story. Whether you understand or satisfied with what you see shouldn't be the question.<br/><br/>But even after saying that, the film does have its plot holes. For instance, for a government to just leave that many tunnels with failed experiments unattended and unsupervised is a bit of a stretch in my opinion. And the plot twist is a bit predictable for me. Jordan Peele's films plot twist definitely haven't been too unpredictable when I watch it unfold. You can kinda see where the story is going.<br/><br/>But overall, it is a good film. Sure there's a few unexplained things in the film, but that's for the audience to think and decide for themselves. A 3.5 out of 5."

","The theme presented by ""Us"" is quite a philosophical journey. Although the acting was solid, the movie still required a script to explain some basic concepts. This may be acceptable in a book, but, in a movie, one cannot interrupt the action with what is basically a narrative explaining what the heck is happening. On a horror film scale, ""Us"" is good. On visually presenting a relevant, deep concept, ""Us"" came close, but, no cigar."

Spoiler to follow.<br/><br/>Like CHUD, US follows a number of films that explore the idea of a race of people who live underground.
Like CHUD, the underground dwellers are there due to an evil gov experiment.
CHUDS eat homeless...US eats rabbits - the rabbits eat - nothing I guess...and that's where the similarities - unfortunately- end.
Where CHUD followed goofy CHUD logic and stuck to the rules it established...US just wings it from scene to scene culminating with an ending twist that smashes the entire premise.
As millions of undiscovered US emerge from the depths - there is no law enforcement interaction. No media coverage. No plucky band of oddballs who work together to stop the US invasion.
...to fair, the acting was on par with CHUD - mediocre...but the humorous CHUD dialog wasn't.
In CHUD, we learn the why and how of the mutants...in US, we get no logical explanation...something about a tether that makes no sense. They just emerge en masse wearing identical red cloths and - somehow - locate their surface dweller clone and try to kill them. No one shoots them.

The problem I feel with US, is that the movie itself was not that good. I found it to be frustrating and at times even boring. This just added to the already convoluted feel, and it makes it difficult to convey. When you feel compelled to go online to understand so much that you know you're missing, it kind of defeats the purpose of watching the film.

The script is a little weak and opens up a lot more questions than it can answer. However, the performances are pretty decent (some are downright terrifying).

","It's sloppy, lacks logic or internal consistency, makes really bizarre and inane storytelling decisions, and has a less than satisfying ending.

Ultimately it doesn't make a lot of sense, and yet there's still something strangely compelling about this film. It's as though Peele tries to walk us through the door, but realizes too late that he forgot to open the door first and we end up crashing through it, Kool-Aid man style, getting a few splinters stuck in our eye in the process. We get the results we ultimately wanted, but it's far from painless.<br/><br/>The problem comes down to basic logic. As the movie goes on, you can't help but wonder how exactly this works. When needing to identify with movie characters, you have to figure out how the world they're in works. Honestly, I found Middle Earth to have more of an internal logic than this world. And this is supposed to be our world, not some weird fantasy realm.<br/><br/>While this movie is plagued by problems with disbelief, it's still strangely fun. Like, really fun! It's a great idea, just sloppily executed and rushed out without fixing the logic part. As such, it's one of those movies that seems to have divided audience everywhere. I myself can see both sides, so it's getting a middle of the road rating from me. If you can consciously suspend disbelief in the face of some major logical problems, you're bound to have a lot of fun. Otherwise, you might want to skip it to save your own sanity."

Thats the ironic thing about youth: their ignorance makes everything new and wondrous.
And so we have an example in this film which clearly, quite often, seems to be about MINDING YOUR DARN CHILDREN! Not only to keep them safe, but keep an eye upon them. Yet if the motvie of all of this was for some clandestine centuries old power or group to control people via unnatural or even natural cloning, where was said group? They just gave up? Quite a few things oculd have been done to add flavor to this, including not having so many random points of slapstick or off beat comedic attempts. Still, it was kinda my type of weirdd. I honestly thought it would go the route of "" when twins are bron its due to a parallel world/reality biting the dust at the moment of birth"" or something like that.

I get that it's establishing mood and character, but it just drags and it's really a waiting game to get to the main event that we know is coming. Even when the big moment does come, the movie really does seem to stroll along in telling its story. This is fine in principle, and even admirable, but it just doesn't quite work as well as it could. A bigger issue for me though is in some plot holes. An interesting thing I've found with Jordan Peele's brand of horror is he really is interested in telling you how things work, and why the weird horrific stuff is happening, and for the most part he actually gives good explanations. However, in Us, there's a couple points where the more we know the more it starts to kind of fall apart. In particular there is a late movie twist that, for me anyway, seemed to betray a lot of the character motivations that happened up until that point. I tried to justify it in my head, and maybe watching it again will make it work, but for now it really bothered me. I mention these problems because otherwise, Us really does work. The interesting thing is that while it never really scared me, there is a genuine sense of dread that holds throughout the whole movie. There are no false scares or jump scares, the horror is very matter-of-fact, and it unravels slowly. It takes you a while to really realize what type of movie it actually is but once you do, you're deep in the thick of it. I also really have to talk about the acting, especially from Lupita Nyong'o. She's one of those actors I always knew was good but never really saw a movie that showcased just how good she was. This was that movie. But all the actors are great, and most have to play two very different characters, often sharing a screen with their alternate selves, and they consistently nail it. Us didn't quite work for me as well as Get Out did. It's not a movie I can see myself returning to and enjoying as much as I can Get Out, and its problems are much more transparent. But in a way, I feel like Jordan Peele has already established himself as such a great director of horror that he's instantly held himself to a higher standard. Us is good, it's original, and it's got some great acting, but I just hope his next is a little more solid."

","I don't really know what to say about this film.<br/><br/>Like I said in the title, it's kind of 1/2 way a zombie style film and half way an intense psychological thriller.<br/><br/>As for the part that was more of a zombie style film... I would give it a 10/10.
As for the part that was psychological thriller... I would give it an 8/10.
Bringing my average score a 9/10.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is just amazing. Lupita Nyong'o should win multiple awards for this one. The rest of the cast is phenomenal as well. I really can't say enough about the acting. The sets are beautiful, the film is shot perfectly... literally, every camera movement in this film was dead on.<br/><br/>As far as saying much about the storyline... I'm going to have to watch some explainers on this one. It's so twisted that it almost takes me to the point of not believing it has a point, but I know it has to.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed the movie, it's just a lot to take in. As far as being a horror film as a whole... I thought it was very well put together. It had just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in to break up the gore of the film, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, it had all the plot points of a horror film that make horror so great.<br/><br/>If you're a horror fan, a thriller fan, or just a Jordan Peele fan...It's a must see!!!<br/><br/>I give it a 9 out of 10!"
"cherold","7","0","3","24 September 2019"," Effectively creepy but in the end you just want to talk about how little sense it makes
","Us creates a great atmosphere of creepiness and some memorable moments. It is well acted and exciting. It also has so many utterly nonsensical aspects to story, plotting, and world building, that everyone who writes a user review marks it as spoilered so they can list the ones that bug them the most. As someone elsewhere noted, Jordan Peele, who wrote the virtually perfect Get Out, was so focused on creating an allegory about class privilege that he couldn't bother to create a story that made even a tiny bit of sense.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed this movie, but I'd rather talk about some of the things it got wrong that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere:<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS BELOW ****<br/><br/>First off, t makes no sense at all that, as it appears in the movie, the underground folk kill everyone in the world except this one family. It's not unusual for a horror film to have a final survivor, smarter or luckier than the rest, out of, say, 8 people. But seriously, EVERYONE IN THE WORLD?<br/><br/>And apparently this one family lives because they have the only doppelgangers who aren't ruthlessly efficient. Why this cat-and-mouse game while with that white family it's over in 30 seconds?<br/><br/>Even little things are done with an almost purposeful obliviousness to common sense, as when the mom is unable to drag the light wooden coffee table she's handcuffed to even one inch.<br/><br/>Then there's the big twist (the mom is from the underground!) that makes no sense for an almost infinite number of reasons (you'll find many enumerations on this site). Again, one reason that I haven't seen mentioned is if the mom is from the underground, and, as is shown elsewhere, the underground people are stronger and faster, then why couldn't she easily vanquish her doppelganger? It's really as though the whole movie was filmed without the twist being intended, and then it was thrown in at the last minute. However, I don't think that's the case, because it's kind of an obvious twist. I think Peele just didn't care that it was BS."

I loses a little steam in the second half, where it gets to be more like a ""survive the apocalypse"" film, but when I didn't know what was going on, it was nice. Lupita was very creepy, and there were some supporting players that added to the enjoyment (I'm thinking of Tim Heideker). I wasn't bothered by the plot holes or unexplained mechanics of how this world would be possible. I just went along for the ride.

"Klinoman","8","0","2","31 August 2019"," I Am Not A Horror Fan
","The horror genre is evolving. I've seen some very good films in later years and it's by my judgement that this contemporary form is quite superior to the classic and late XX century form. I do however feel that films like ""Psycho"" and ""The Exorcist"" are indisputable, as I do with ""Nosferatu"" and ""Freaks"" and a more unknown gem like ""Meshes of the Afternoon"" and maybe even Salvador Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou"". It's in this decade, that has almost passed, that we have been faced with very wise films, that I am beginning to take a U turn and start exploring Its tropes further. I am no fan of supernatural and slasher horror films, in fact I think they are ridiculous, with very, very little exceptions.<br/><br/>Now, if you still follow me, I can read that somehow people feel that Peele's first ""Get Out"" is better than the brand new ""Us"". To compare, both films have a wonderful transition from a supernatural setting to a pulp Sci-Fi dialectic.
In Get Out, the antagonists are a Group from the Golden Age in USA which developed a way to transfer their conscience and memories, with emphasis on the conscience, by repressing a living man's psyche and implanting their own. Something similar, very bad executed though, can be seen in ""Freejack"" and ""Self/Less"", but a progenitor for me would be the Twilight Zone episode called ""The Trade-Ins"", even though that's not implied in the episode directly. In Us exists an isolated government experiment, that also begun in the Golden Age, which could be a project for the Cold War, where clones are created and kept secretly underground, engineered somehow to mimic their originals on the surface for an unknown purpose. This is very unique as a setting, if not as an idea altogether, so, this gives the first points to Us.<br/><br/>Get Out does have the upper hand as it does not have blatant plot holes, it doesn't have any actually. The one that really did bother me in Us was, well -- the Children. The Tethered are clones, and that is stipulated very clearly. The children however, are born. What are the chances of having the children? Even more, what are the chances of having the same sex children? And going even more into percentages, what are the chances of having the children being exactly the same as your original on the surface? I do have to concede that the surreal is much more frightening when introduced into reality, so for the sake of the movie, it had to be done on the expense of the story. It does not bother me as much, but points do go to Get Out on this one.<br/><br/>On why Us is triumphant versus Get Out is the duration of suspense. In Get Out we are introduced with the answer, a very direct and clear, simple even, and then the protagonist simply fights his way out. It's 90 percent that he probably lives, with a little twist, and the other 10 that he dies and we are given a bigger twist, albeit cliche in both cases. Anyway, a lazy ending, not particularly interesting at all.
The climax of the suspense in Us comes almost at the end in a Vader/Luke-esque epiphany, that is followed by a brief brutal confrontation of the protagonist/antagonist. But it doesn't stop there with subjective ethics blurring the lines when we are presented with the twist, which is a devastatingly good finish.<br/><br/>I do not understand why the racial/social agenda in both films is so progressive, but since it's about the USA, I have not come in direct contact with it, so I will skip it entirely and grade it as I do with any other films as I discuss philosophy with friends and colleagues."
"MissSimonetta","7","0","1","25 August 2019"," Enjoyable movie undercut by poorly-conceived plot twists
","I haven't seen GET OUT yet, so I cannot make comparisons, but I find I have similar problems with US as a lot of disappointed fans of the 2017 horror hit do.<br/><br/>US fires on all cylinders when it's being an exceptional horror-thriller. The home invasion scenes and the dark comedy are brilliant. The characters are enjoyable and the dialogue between them is well-written. Much of the movie felt like a 1980s family comedy like THE GREAT OUTDOORS turned into a nightmare, actually. It was quirky but enjoyable.<br/><br/>However, once the twists and explanations for the bumps in the night come in, the movie starts losing my interest. I think the filmmakers try to overexplain too much and too often. Keeping the dopplegangers' identities more mysterious seems a better option than opening the whole can of worms of their existence and their rather convoluted plan to get revenge on the upper world.<br/><br/>I also agree with the high-rated review which argues that the last twist regarding the mother's identity undermines so much of the movie. It felt like it wanted to shock just for a cheap gasp, not because it was a logical conclusion."

"snowfre","8","0","4","22 August 2019"," A horror movie spanning from home invasion to wider social critique
","To start with, Jordan Peele is truly a great director who's love for the medium cannot be mistaken. ""Us"", however, is a film quite hard to grasp in my opinion. Beginning as something of a supernatural home invasion horror film, ""Us"" turns into more of a slasher before rapidly turning into a large scale conspiracy horror film with political undertones fused with - I presume - social critique, aiming for the U.S. class system. Does it work out? Not quite as much as one might hope for. At the end of the film, you wonder why Peele chose to cover up the film's theme with the creepy home invasion and wether or not the film succeeds in telling the overlaying story of classism and (if that's what he wanted) xenophobia. I don't really know. Perhaps, the entire film is just a showcase of Peele's love for the medium, which, if the case, he truly succeeded by delivering an entertaining, well-played horror film."

","After Jordan Peele's 'Get Out', The expectations for the Next addition were as usual very high. And he didn't disappoint. To my frank opinion, this was a better movie overall than Get Out! Many people might not agree but I found this one to be more precise on the execution part! It started with a great note and continued with the same momentum till the end. The story is so engaging, with brilliant screenplay and background score! The performances were top notch, the characterisation unlike Get Out has been done brilliantly well! We actually care about the whole family's well being. That being said, it's not a fully flawless film. It had it's downfall on one part and that is the ""Explanation"".
The main concept, the main ""project"" which have been shown in the film isn't really well explained or have much significance on a motivational perspective! Many questions arose in our mind that were not answered nor we could guess. And somehow I feel they should have gone with an ""open"" ending rather than a general one.

","Us is a puzzling film that slowly reveals its layers but then becomes more illogical and confusing.<br/><br/>It is better to not think about too deeply and just enjoy the ride. It means you lose any subtext the filmmaker had about a society of us and the others.<br/><br/>The film opens at the funfair in the boardwalk of Santa Cruz in 1986. A small girl, Adelaide is on holiday and wanders off while her father is playing whack-a-mole. As she enters a funhouse she sees a doppelg√§nger of herself in the hall of mirrors. This encounter left her unable to communicate for some time and still affects her in the present day.<br/><br/>We then cut to the present day when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason.<br/><br/>One evening the Wilsons see another family that looks exactly like them standing outside the house decked out in red overalls. They look like they mean to harm them and they are somehow tethered to the soul of the individual Wilson family members.<br/><br/>The doppelg√§ngers all grunt except for Red, Adelaide's double who speaks with a raspy voice. Red tells Adelaide that both of them are tethered together and share a soul. These doubles live in a subterranean underground world.<br/><br/>As an home invasion horror it is very effective and chilling, we find out that other families are being slaughtered by their doubles. It leads to a problem. Why are the Wilsons being toyed with when other families are being brutally killed and the violence is spreading as the doubles attempt to enact their own Hands across America.<br/><br/>The moment the film broadens its premise it starts losing it logic. Even when the family try to get away from Santa Cruz and head down to Mexico, after driving all night they are somehow still in Santa Cruz. I've been to Santa Cruz it is not that big!<br/><br/>Jordan Peele tries to underpin his film with some kind of explanation and symbolism but it is half baked. He also wants to tie the film together by making it all about Adelaide. Unlike Get Out there is little humour in this film although Gabe is meant to be a dorky dad."

","Us is by far the most complex film I have seen this year, and one of the most complex films I have seen in my life so far. The film shines with brilliant performances, with Lupita Nyong'o being the greatest. Jordan Peele's direction and storytelling makes for an uneven, yet fascinating experience that is truly unforgettable. The film is also certainly entertaining and absolutely terrifying. However, as great things as this film has, it tends to fall apart with both the early beginning and very end. Both moments have promise, but both seem hesitantly executed, as if they couldn't decide quite what they wanted to do, and instead wanted the viewer to decide themselves. As carefree as this seems though, it granted also hooks the audience, but also takes the seriousness of its own production at fault. In the end, Us is not a perfect film, but it certainly is a really good one with some storytelling flaws.

","Us (2019)<br/><br/>I think if I saw this movie without knowing the director and writer was Jordan Peele, I would have just dismissed it as ordinary stuff. It has all the elements of a kind of zombie twist, with the appealing semi-novelty of featuring a black cast in a normalizing way. That's all fine.
But this is a movie built on clich√©s, and with an awful lot of chasing, hiding, being found, fighting, chasing, hiding, etc. It clicks along fine for awhile, and has an odd twist in the middle. The larger ""twist"" at the end is kind of the overall rationale to things and it's so improbable and silly it doesn't work. Sure, suspend your disbelief, but don't call this a great movie.
The elephant in the room is ""Get Out,"" which of course is Peele's previous movie, a fabulous bit of moviemaking. But that movie, to be clear, has originality, great acting, true suspense (as opposed to scary surprises), and some overlying meaning about race. And I think the main actor in that one was above and beyond and made the movie rise even higher. ""Us"" is none of those things. I almost didn't care to see the end it was so obvious as it went, and kind of playing with the audience's helplessness.
Hopes are up for Peele's next round."

The flick itself starts very well and I was really sucked into the story but after a while when must I say the supernatural comes above it's when I lost my attention somehow.<br/><br/>A big cheer on the other hand that all actors in main lead where black people. Finally Hollywood get's it after a few years of trouble about that fact So after all, well above mediocre but not the most scary one of the year.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5

","Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is the matriarch of a well-off family. While vacationing in a lavish cottage community in Santa Cruz, California, her family is confronted by an alternative family who seem to resemble them. Havoc ensues.<br/><br/>Director/writer Jordan Peale succeeds in frightening his audience with a story that succeeds for the most part. Occasionally, it seems far out and veering in areas that aren't always consistent. It also didn't help that the character with the most information had a voice impediment and was often difficult to understand.<br/><br/>""Us"" seems to be making a statement that sets the well-off against the under-class of society. More might have been explored in this area to make its point but the film still has its benefits.<br/><br/>There is a lot of violence but, to Peale's credit, the gore is left just barely outside the camera frame, sparing the viewer from gratuitous blood and guts. The greatest credit for the film is an amazing plot twist at the end that not only fits the mysterious pieces together (as Peale did so well with ""Get Out""), it creates a very blurry line between heroes and villains. The plot twist is so good that it encourages viewers to see the film again just to see it from another perspective. There is also good twisted humour in the film as well to add to the enjoyment."

","The Coen Brothers, Atom Egoyan, Shane Carruth and now Jordan Peele.

There are many messages to be mined in this movie, all woven expertly into a decidedly disturbing yet darkly comic story.<br/><br/>My key takeaway? No matter how bad you think you may have it in life, there is an alternate path which would have led you to something far more unbearable.

","It's cool to see an original idea in the horror genre. Carnivals and old amusement parks are scary. When you are a little kid, the lights and the smells and the sounds are overwhelming and intoxicating. As a teen, they represent freedom from supervision; and since we are still kids, we ignore a lot of things that are just below the surface.<br/><br/>As an adult, I broke into an old amusement park from the 1930s a couple of years ago. It was daytime in the ""off season"". The park was closed, but it opened every year, seasonally, with no definite schedule. I went to take pictures. I checked the website and it hadn't been updated in years. So, I parked out front, sneaked through a fence, and began exploring. During the day, you notice the age and the dirt. Most people wouldn't ride the rides or eat the food if they saw what I saw. Everything looked like it had been painted over 100 times, yet it all looked like it still needed more paint. Still, there was a beauty to it - an old abandoned Merry-Go-Round kinda seems like the horses are all sleeping, finally being left to rest from 90 years of demanding children. But, as I wandered deeper, lost in my photos, I began to notice that I wasn't alone in the park. There were make-shift shanty towns of plastic tarps on clotheslines and old trailers with busted windows, hiding behind rides and buildings. Someone was living there, and I wasn't sure if they were watching me. I started to wonder... How many people were living there? Where were they right now? How long would it take me to make it back to the entrance I came in, if I had to run? I made it to a lake in the center of the park. I was way nervous at this point and had already decided to leave. As I was taking my last picture of the lake, I veered my camera over to the right. There was movement. I used a zoom lens and, across the lake, I saw a man. He was dirty, he was big, and he was watching me. When he saw me aiming my camera at him, he mounted a four-wheeler and began driving around the lake, toward me. I wasn't even ****ing around anymore. I am a grown man - in shape and strong. But, I ran. I ran fast... I got some great pictures, but I won't do that again. I was lucky.<br/><br/>So, yeah, Jordan Peele is right - amusement parks and carnivals are creepy. Don't wander off alone.<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"HorrorFanatic4Life","8","0","7","26 June 2019"," Very thought-provoking movie
","Starting off for this movie was the intriguing trailers that played. They were intense and eye-catching. Definitely had me excited to see this movie.<br/><br/>Then came the movie. Not all of it was what I was expecting. The trailer hinted at the ""shadowed"" or ""cloned"" characters, but it did not prepare me for how the movie ended up playing out.<br/><br/>You definitely need to have an open mind for this one as it is not your simple horror film. I don't know that I would even have classified it as horror. It is a bit sinister, but also has several light-hearted funny moments and more of the SciFi type, really out there feel to it. Definitely similar to Peele's other movie ""Get Out.""<br/><br/>The movie didn't waste much time getting to the point, but was still able to sneak in quite a bit of background in terms of flashbacks. The actors really brought the story to life and kept it going from start to finish. Considering each one essentially plays two different characters, you would have never known that with how well each one was able to execute the difference between them and their ""shadows.""<br/><br/>Even though the movie was unique and well executed, there were still a few details that dropped my personal rating to an 8. I have so many unanswered questions on the plot twist at the end and I'm not sure it even makes any sense. If the mom was the ""shadow"" this entire time, was she pretending to experience her ""amnesia/PTSD"" surrounding the hall of mirrors scene in the beginning? If she switched places with the other, how did the rest get to the point of wanting to come to the surface to kill their ""shadows?"" And since the essential ""leader"" is killed, why are the others still holding hands at the end? I know that part was referencing back to that commercial playing on TV in the beginning, but what was the point in it? Lastly, if they were copying their ""shadow"" in life, how were they able to break from copying to form a group to kill their shadow?"" Those are just a few of the unanswered questions on the plot.<br/><br/>My second reason for dropping my rating was because of how terrible the dad was... It almost feels like they did it on purpose. He spent the whole movie limping around with no real good scene of how he even got hurt. Besides that, his wife (and kids) got beat up several more times than he did (and way worse, might I add), but still managed to get back up. Maybe it was for comedic relief? But his character was unfitting in that aspect and just irritated me watching him limp around.<br/><br/>Besides that, everything else about the film was unique in every way. The acting was phenomenal, the feel of the movie was very chilling and the music was unlike any other, which is saying a lot as that is a trait of movies that never really stands out to me. The way it was used in this film was fantastic as far as setting the feel for it.<br/><br/>Simply put, the other negative reviews seemed to have been looking for the same original horror film that's been copied several times over. When this one didn't deliver that, weak-minded ""movie critics"" couldn't handle the advanced script or appreciate the uniqueness."

","Out of nowhere came Jorden Peele in 2017 with ""Get Out"". He almost skipped his learning phase, took no time to adjust. Out of Comedy Central and into the highest echelon of cinema prowess. Now its 2019, and with ""Us"" he perfects his trademark directorial style, but do not think to compare him to the likes of Kubrick or Hitchcock--Peele is his own director, making a stand and carving his own ideas into cinema.<br/><br/>You would think that someone who directs, writes and produces has an elaborate history, yet ""Us"" is only Jordan Peele's second outing in the director's chair and already he developed his own brand of visual art and his own brand of horror--no cheap scares, a touch of comedy and a lot of intrigue. Seriously, never has a horror film aroused my curiosity in such a way. If at first I was scared, not soon enough I was stuck to my chair hungry for answers, but by the time they came, I already realized this film's point and I was now looking at it properly.<br/><br/>This movie empowers itself more on multiple viewings. You would definitely see it differently a second time, respond differently to its characters and maybe uncover more. Yet I feel this theoretical and analytical approach would be missing the point. The main idea here is the clever way in which Peele tackles social status, class relations and differences. He is actually quite political and that is not surprising, many sketches on his Key & Peele days revolving around social satire, only now he approaches it with a whole different level of skill and precision. There is visual symbolism everywhere! I will not even bother to discuss it, it's that obvious and that quantifying. Everything from the duality of man, to racial duality, social duality and hierarchy, whatever! Its quite fascinating to take this frame by frame and see what it hides!<br/><br/>It continues even with the music! Hearing ""Good Vibrations"" by The Beach Boys, one of the whitest songs ever play right before a particular controversial piece from NWA only goes to strengthen his point! He throws clues at you constantly, making ""Us"" a rich experience. I was also amazed by his on-screen technique. He displays a natural talent for screenwriting as he stretches one horrifying scene for dozens of minutes! From the time the Wilsons meet their Tethered, he up-scales the scene with careful meticulous planning, balancing horror and curiosity, making you terrified to look, but wanting to! By the time that particular scene ends, the film takes a completely different shape and you start to see it for the actual satire it is.<br/><br/>In a way, I feel Peele never left his comedic roots. He is still doing what he did on Key & Peele, only here he approaches it with a completely different philosophy. But enough about him and more of the actors! Their performances are great, but I have to call out Lupita Nyong'o for her human and inhuman take on both the characters she portrays. ""Us"" looks and feels as if it demanded a lot from its actors, mostly adaptability. I do not think it will be appreciated for redefining horror, as much as it will be for taking horror to places where its never been."

"lavatch","Null","0","1","18 June 2019"," Four Characters in Search of an Author
","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Us,"" writer-director Jordan Peele described his film as an actor's exercise, allowing each of the performers to play his or her double. He also described his main inspiration from the film ""Alien."" Unfortunately, the actor's exercise and the unimaginative incorporation of techniques from ""Alien"" could not sustain interest in this film for two hours.<br/><br/>The film's main premise had some potential in idea of the Doppelg√§nger that occurs in a family of four that is ""invaded"" by their exact look-alikes from another dimension. The opening flashback was intriguing as a little girl gets lost in a subterranean world underneath an amusement in Santa Cruz called ""Find Yourself.""<br/><br/>But once the ""creatures in red"" began their invasion of the family home in Santa Cruz, the film became repetitive and overly violent. The so-called ""untethering"" process of the creatures was never fully explained, and the film became no more that predictable, grade-B horror.<br/><br/>There is a famous Italian play by Luigi Pirandello called ""Six Characters in Search of an Author"" the combines bone-chilling elements of the supernatural with some substantial philosophical insights based on the same concept of the ""double"" as apparent in ""Us."" But the film was a shallow exercise in style over substance.<br/><br/>There was potential to explore the passage from the Bible when a man was standing on the Santa Cruz boardwalk holding up the sign ""Jeremiah 11:11"": ""Therefore this is what the Lord says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them."" But there was no religious context explored other than the creatures in red who worship a god apparently named ""Tether.""<br/><br/>Peele's previous success in ""Get Out"" was due to the combination of the horror techniques and a strong social message. There was nothing special in ""Us,"" was a set of variations on all of the familiar clich√©s of the horror genre."

","After watching Get Out, I was skeptical about Us due to the soaring success Peele had with his previous film. (If you haven't seen it yet, it's seriously worth watching.) Anyway, I watched Us last night and I was amazed. From the plot to the camera work and every single thing in between was directed and executed with such perfection, it allows the consumer to feel the atmosphere and emotion flowing through the scene. The soundtrack worked perfectly with each scene. I particularly like the way 'I got 5 on it' was used multiple times throughout the film. (Spoiler) The end of the film, we see Red and Adeline final fight with one another. During this scene, there are flashbacks to both of them dancing, this works beautifully with the idea of the clones mimicking their 'original' copy, as whiles they are fighting, they both know what the next move isn't going to be which makes the entire scene so intense. Without saying much else, the two fighting one another with the 'memories' of them both dancing gives the scene so much emotion. Fast forward to the plot twist- which I will not spoil- it explains so much and you begin to understand why certain things were said and done between the two women.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid 10/10, I can not wait for Peele's next film as he is a fantastic director with an amazing range of diversity."

If you looking story for logic then will be disappointed, because such clone idea is not clearly described. How was this project going on? Tunnels are not showing properly where these experiments were taken. And most reasonable question is that why are clones hiding from the world so many days and they appeared in now present day? So you overlooked story loop holes and enjoy only movie for thrill.
The most controversial part is the twist at the end. It is mostly illogical and unrealistic only for to shock viewers. As me the twist should have taken at the climax fight scene between Luptia and her clone. It would have been must trustable and effective and open for another sequel. Here chances of sequel are very rare. However movie is watchable at once. Good for horror and thriller lovers. You can enjoy a different type of fear rather than traditional ghost or evil horror.

If it wasn't for that twist in the end, I would not rate this movie high, it was way to much slow at some points, there were unnecessary scenes and some typical horror movie scenes that were not part of the Jordan Peele movie style to which we were introduced before. 7/10"

"peterp-450-298716","6","0","1","5 June 2019"," I don't understand all that fuss about ""Us"".
","Jeremiah 11:11
Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape;
and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.<br/><br/>""Get out"" was a big nod to the racist past (and present) of the United States. A white, prosperous community who use African Americans to replace their worn-out bodies. A cynical story in which the physique of black Americans is being worshipped to some extent. And at the same time, it's also distasteful because these American fellow men are regarded as superfluous individuals nobody will miss. Their disappearance won't be noticed, so to speak. And a protagonist as a future victim, who can escape at the end with a piece of cotton (yes, a subtle reference). It's quite obvious this can be regarded as a kind of allegory with a political twist. ""Us"" containing a political message, however, isn't something I could see immediately. Of course, it depends on how you interpret the whole. I myself interpreted the story as a ""Twilight zone"" -like event. Soul mates leading a symmetrical existence. So no genetic experiments that got out of hand. Or is it all metaphorically intended and a reflection of how we see ourselves as a society? All in all, I put ""Us"" on the same level as ""Hereditary"". A lot of hype-creation, but in my humble opinion a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>However, the film starts very strong. The most impressive moment is the opening scene with the camera zooming out, slowly revealing lots of bunnies (with a choir as background music). Simply beautiful. Then an intense moment with young Adelaide (Madison Curry) who wanders around on the beach of Santa Cruz during a family vacation and ends up in an attraction. There she stands face to face with something frightening. So frightening that she doesn't want to speak anymore and her parents (whose loving relationship clearly disappeared) desperately seek the help of a psychologist.<br/><br/>When Adelaide comes back into the picture as an adult (Lupita Nyong'o), it seems as if the traumatic experience has been processed. But when she returns to the same beach with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), where they meet up with friends, there are all sorts of omens pointing to the event from the past. It's only when a group of weird people in orange overalls appear on their driveway at night that the atmosphere becomes grim and frightening. At first, I had a sort of ""The Purge"" deja vu moment. The moment the Wilson family comes face to face with these strangers, it becomes apparent that they are really creepy and strangely behaving individuals.<br/><br/>And the first turnoff offers itself. The moment Red opens her mouth and a terribly annoying voice can be heard. When the ending draws near (and this time the ultimate revelation isn't particularly surprising), it becomes quite clear why her voice sounds that way. Until that time you are constantly wondering what the reason is for this weird voice. But comfort yourself. You will come across even more mysterious things you won't understand the ultimate meaning of. I do like films that are not too simplistic and do not offer a pre-canned explanation in such a way that every Joe Average understands what it's all about. However, I'm not a big fan of films full of symbolism, so a re-watch is a must such that you can discover the deeper meaning behind it. And then you come to the conclusion that your theory isn't at all consistent with what the director meant.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele has a unique perspective on the horror genre and tries to give it an alternative twist. Only his social-critical message about inequality and the division into classes got through. If Peele once again wants to direct an unusual horror, I hope he will incorporate a different kind of message. Leave out the symbolism and you can speak of a typical ""home invasion"" film of the same level as, for example, ""You're next"". In that area, it can be called successful.<br/><br/>There are also a lot of positive things to say about this film. ""Us"" effortlessly transcends the disappointing film ""Hereditary"". Not only the tension rises in crescendo and caused some terrifying moments. But also the footage is masterful. You can hardly call it the ultimate slasher, but quite a lot of blood splashes around. But foremost, the acting performance of the four main characters excels. It's brilliant how they play themselves and their opposite characters. They underwent a frightening-looking transformation, resulting in two completely different personalities. I'm sure James McAvoy will also enjoy this ""Split""-like spectacle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the end was an anti-climax for me. The concept of horror faded into the background and resulted in a preachy plea about our unjust world and the existence of an oppressed population who feel displeased and misunderstood. A symbolic breaking of the chains and the formation of a human chain for a better world ruined it for me. And at the same time, there are the many unanswered questions that are open to all kinds of interpretations. What's with all those bunnies hopping around? Food for those on the other side? Or test material for cloning experiments? Why the recurring text ""11:11""? And why a pair of scissors as a weapon? But above all, where did they get it? And all those orange overalls? Nope, a rewatch to discover hidden answers and subtle hints, is not something I'm going to do. Films with an accompanying manual. It'll never thrill me!<br/><br/>Ps. Some additional information about the twin sisters from the other couple. You could already admire them when they were really young as Emma Geller-Green in the sitcom ""Friends""."
"martinato","7","0","1","4 June 2019"," Another Jordan Peele's gem.
","After the Oscar winning Get Out, Peele comes back with another thrilling experiment. Us is an incredibly well-made movie, carried on by Lupita Nyong'o's outstanding perfomance."
"evrivali","8","0","2","4 June 2019"," Why all this hate?
","I watched Us without any particular expectations, since I thought that Jordan Peele's previous movie: Get Out was kind of mediocre. I was in the mood for a horror movie so I decided to give this movie a go, without being aware of the reviews or the rating. Had I known how much people hated it I would have changed my mind about watching it but I'm glad I didn't read them. The movie had me surprised and I can confidently say that I really enjoyed it.
PROS
The movie is packed with a great cast,a very creepy score and an interesting plot. Us is not something you see everyday since it's not your typical supernatural horror flick and to me this is really important since I am getting so tired of watching movies with similar plots (something that is pretty much what you get when you are looking for something in the horror genre) and I really appreciate when writers put some extra effort to give you something original. The movie has some solid scares, good action and an upredictable plot so it was pretty exciting and fun to watch.
CONS
I really don't have much negative to say. Maybe I got a little tired towards the end but then again I found the ending pretty rewarding so it didn't bother me that much. The movie is not very easy to understand so there is a possibility that you feel a little lost especially in the end.
CONCLUSION: The movie is an original and decent horror movie with a lot of depth and meaning. It takes a little research and thought to fully appreciate it. Having read a few theories myself I can tell you that I really respect Peele's work and his effort to make a point and throw some symbolism in a horror movie since it's not something that really happens in most hollywood productions. But even if you just stick to the surface and don't want to make any additional research the movie still makes sense and it is absolutely entertaining and worth watching.
MY RATING: 8/10"
"joker-4","8","0","2","4 June 2019"," This is not... Us
","Jordan Peele no doubt wants each of his artistic creations to stand on their own.<br/><br/>They do. And they should.<br/><br/>And yet.<br/><br/>The Academy Award-winning behemoth that is Get Out will always be his benchmark. And rightfully so. That said, for his sophomore film, Us, as enjoyable as it is, is a tougher film to get in.<br/><br/>Whereas Get Out could be plainly viewed as a thriller, the viewer is dared to dive deeper into the social commentary for an ironically more-satisfying story. With Us, Peele is asking for a much deeper, and not quite as refreshing dive.
Us is beautifully made and fantastically acted. Lupita Nyong'o elevates every film she is in. Academy take note: she has space on a shelf for more Oscar gold. She plays the matriarch of a normal family out on vacation who must soon race from death, and scissors, by insane jumpsuit-wearing versions of themselves. ""We're Americans,"" the mirror-mirror version of Nyong'o boasts. True that, but for a voyeuristic film, Peele keeps any origin-story insights in a tight, ahem, twilight zone.<br/><br/>Peele clearly has a message to broadcast on duality. Everyone wears masks; some are simply more noticeable. He is asking the viewer to decide on which shadow runs the longest. Unfortunately this duality makes Us a more uneven film than it should be.<br/><br/>Us isn't sure if it should be slasher horror or a meta comedy. As a result, the horror scenes appear unintentionally humorous. The comedic beats too much of a stretch.<br/><br/>If anything, the film is original. And enjoyable. Unfortunately, his Shyamalan-istic reveal is more of head scratcher than head turner."

"PMetzker","7","0","1","1 June 2019"," Weak
","The new movie, by the still amateur Jordan Peele, has a lot of hype, but he can not live up to expectations. Between slaps and kisses, the film finds itself in a wave of clich√É¬©s, where it gets lost in logic. Despite an excellent social critique, he prefers to go not too deep, leaving holes in the story.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele, known for his work on Get Out, returns to the big screen with a work without salt, where expectations surpass its quality. Although still amateur in the cinema, Peele manages to innovate in its direction. It was to realize that the mistakes made previously served as the basis of what not to do in certain scenes. With beautiful images and enormous intelligence, he surprised me, he overcame himself in a grotesque way.<br/><br/>When one thing improves, another thing gets worse. I agree that the story has some very creative things, but they do not come together. From what I noticed, he put a lot of things into the recipe, but the result was unrelated. With too much information, he got lost in the logic of the events. Besides, the movie itself did not frighten me. I laughed more than I felt afraid in a HORROR movie. You can tell there's something wrong, right?<br/><br/>A similarity between the director's two films is the soundtrack. It sets the tone of the entire storyline, with engaging songs and scary noises, that shivers the hairs of anyone.<br/><br/>The performances bothered me a lot. The actors, taking away Lupita, could not transmit any fear. They could not get even close to reasonable, disrupting the continuity of the film. Uninspired, that's what I felt in the characters, cliches of other films.<br/><br/>In the end, Us brings a worse experience, compared to Get Out, but valid in some aspects. He's quite different from the other horror films out there, so if you like the genre, it's worth watching."

"sforrester-3","6","0","1","30 May 2019"," Confusing
","I must admit that after watching Get Out, I went into this with high expectations. I wasn't quite as disappointed as some of the other reviewers but I was slightly disappointed.
First of all the good stuff. The acting was good to the point that I forgot sometimes that the same actor was playing two parts. The overall feel of the film was good and I never felt bored. I enjoyed the basic story and the soundtrack was excellent.
Now the not so good. I was confused, even when the story was spelled out in an explanation near the end, I was still confused. I think my confusion arose from the quite massive plot holes that were apparent throughout. I got the beginning and I got the very end but a lot of it must have went right over my head.
All in all, I don't agree that this film deserves a rating of 1, there are some very enjoyable elements but I hope for Mr Peele's next film, he tries to be less of a smarty pants and just makes a solid film with a lot less holes."
"ryan_sy","7","0","1","30 May 2019"," Another Great Movie From Jordan Peele!
","As most people, I had high expectations before watching this movie. While it wasn't flawless, it did not disappoint. I think many of the negative reviews were influenced by viewers going into the film with a high bar.<br/><br/>To begin with the positive aspects, the acting was phenomenal with the exception of the clumsy dolt father of the family; seriously, that guy was a joke! The mom, kids, and even the family friends (Tim Heidecker is a gem everyone) all gave compelling performances. It was refreshing to see how normal they could be, yet offer completely disparate menacing performances as their respective doppelgangers. But Lupita definitely stole the show- she plays the fierce, bad ass woman character as good as anyone and apparently can play a creepy psychopath quite well! The doppelgangers mannerisms vs. the real characters mannerisms were definitely the crown jewel of this film.<br/><br/>The musical score with the iconic ""I got five on it"" song and it's menacing remix was awesome and fit well. The action scenes and overall cinematography were fantastic. There was a genuine sense of dread and tension during the fight scenes and I was on the edge of my seat. There were some jump scares, but they were well placed, and I thought the acting and character decisions were realistic for the most part (except the dad!).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the last third of the movie is where I became a bit skeptical. I think that the writers should have chosen a different scenario to complete the plot and provided more explanation. The ending felt a bit contrived and almost derivative. However, this aspect of the film did not ruin it for me.<br/><br/>There are far more positive aspects of this film than negative, and that is why I rated it what I did.<br/><br/>Don't let the haters tell you this movie is a waste of time; just because they may think ""Get Out"" is a better movie, does not mean US is a failure!<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see what Peele creates next!"

The only real exception to this is Winston Dukes character. He's the comedy relief but it doesn't work, he's more slapstick than a slapped stick in a stick slapping factory. He was the only thing that didn't do it for me... Sorry Winston!
Yes the meanings ambiguous and the arty aspects are a bit pointless. Jordan Peel is trying to give us a hidden meaning to think and talk about, and we did.

","If we can categorize movies in two main classes: 1- ones that straightly stick to a subject and follow a solid story line and 2- those that use metaphors and symbolic expression of some phenomenon to deliver a message in a deeper way.<br/><br/>Most Horror movies belong to the first category. Although there are some horror movies in the second group, except a handful of them like ""Babadook"" and ""Oculus"" they are disable to successfully perform the idea beyond the horror shell. I am not sure about this one in the matter of categorizing but I am sure that whichever it is it is a failure. You may consider some hidden layers especially in the first half but immediately you regret of thinking that way, so you have no choice to see it only as a horror tail having some sci-fi theme.

Until the end, but I digress. The writing, almost, was very good. The dialog was smooth, except the ha ha white people. I don't mind having ha ha white people dialog, but make it flow natural. They came off as selfish robots.<br/><br/>The only real issues I have, some things were just way too dark. What I mean is, shadows can make a horror movie, this time the shadows were too much. It was hard to see the actors. But, it wasn't overdone to where I can say that ruined the film. It hindered but easily overlooked. What killed it, was Jordan putting in a twist at the end. Okay, I'm a HUGE Twilight Zone nut. I write myself, and my short stories all have a Serling Twist. I get Jordan was going for that, but he ended up with a M Night Twist. It was SO unneeded. And while I'm thinking on it, the one family member who gets it, really has nothing to complain about. So, not only was it not needed, the impact is completely stupid.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film? Yes. Watch it. It's a fantastic film. Just expect the very end to disappoint you. If you go in knowing that, it should save the film for you. If not, hey, you've been warned."

"karnaq","8","0","5","25 May 2019"," Excellent Horror Stab
","From the moment the film opens up, and everything seems insignificant in the beginning, it all plays ties to the end. And the second we start following our 'main character', the tension is there immediately. And from the opening scene, you can tell how well done the movie was going to be just by the way they shot the opening scene.<br/><br/>Overall, you don't get much from the trailer, and the short summary doesn't give you much either. But if you are trying to sell it to somebody; The film is about a family who comes face-to-face with identical versions of themselves, and to an extent it seems very small scale, however, it is anything but.<br/><br/>This movie wouldn't be anything without the right actors playing the right parts. And luckily director/writer Jordan Peele knows how to influence them perfectly. As each actor has to play a normal version of themselves along with a dark version of themselves. Especially the child actors who have to deal with shooting such things.<br/><br/>Let it be said now, that you need to make it to the end. The ending is what gives you everything, what explains everything, and has the precise momentum of a motion and surprise that any good movie, not just horror, deserves."

"eparazak","9","0","8","17 May 2019"," Us is an ambitious, creepy and thought provoking follow-up to Get Out.
","Considering the fact that Jordan Peele's Get Out was up for several award nominations, people would naturally be expecting a lot from him and his future projects. Case in point, we have Us, which stars Lupita Nyong'o as the lead character of the film as she and her family are on vacation. On the night in, however, they encounter some uncanny doppelgangers that are out to kill them.<br/><br/>This is a risky, ambitious and horrifying film, that is really well-crafted. There were so many moments throughout this film where I was left frightened or terrified for the main characters. This film drives away from a lot of the normal horror conventions that could've made it a mediocre horror film, like how the characters end up making very clever decisions, which that in it of itself gives me respect.<br/><br/>The film's third act in particular is, to me the most fascinating part of the film, as everything comes together in ways that a lot of people wouldn't expect. It's the type of third act that has gotten a lot of mixed reactions from audience members, and for good reason. I think it's meant to make the audience question its view on the big picture and everything they've seen during the first two acts. The closing scene especially highlights Peele's risk-taking with this projects, as it provides the audience with some insightful questions that just beg an answer. While the third act especially is great, some of the questions open up some plotholes, which slightly bring the movie down for me.<br/><br/>If you want a vastly different slice of horror that's far out of the norm, and want to be challenged, I highly suggest checking out this movie, I definitely didn't regret seeing this.

"gbrlfernaldi","9","0","8","14 May 2019"," ""US"" a Groundbreaking Thriller Movie
","After producing the greatest hit in 2017 ""Get Out"", Jordan Peele came back with another psychological thriller movie, ""Us"". Still with the same topic as ""Get Out"", now, he highlighted even further about the life of a particular family. In this movie, Jordan Peele really knew what he was doing with his captivating storyline, flawless characterization, and he also created that realistic feel of terrors and traumas. Even the poster was really frightening, he came up with the idea of a frightening duplicity of everyone, the lead character Nyong'o lifted off a mask of her own face which scared us all. There are many intricate things going on in the film that you really have to pay attention to if you want to grasp the full extent of the film. Lupita Nyong'o as the main character in this movie, performed really well. Nyong'o played was played by Adelaide Wilson, the wife of Gabe (Winston Duke) and mother to teen daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and mask-wearing son Jason (Evan Alex). All the main cast members played two roles, as their character and their doppelg√§nger (their own twins)
""Us"" began back in 1986 with little adelaide and her parents wandering through the Santa Cruz boardwalk at night. She then got separated from them to walk on an empty beach, watching a foreboding flock of thunderclouds roll in. Her eyes found an attraction just off the main pier, and she walked into what looked like an abandoned hall of mirrors, discovering something deeply terrifying-her doppelg√§nger. Not a reflection of herself. A copy of herself.
The movie shifted to the present day, The little girl has now grown up to be a woman, Adelaide, nervous about returning to that spot on the Santa Cruz beach which was the same location where Adelaide had a traumatic experience. Later on that night, Adelaide noticed four stranger standing in front of their house. Gabe went out and asked them politely to leave, as these unknown persons are creeping out his family. The strangers dressed up in red jumpsuits. Unfortnately, they broke into the house instead of leaving. They were the family's doppelg√§ngers, their exact doubles, except angry, and thirsty for blood
Us is a classic horror movie - perhaps the best since Get Out. The editing is flawless, going from present day horror to Adelaide's traumatic experience seamlessly without sacrificing intensity or scares. How, in the end, we can take some moral value that the producer want us to know about. Jordan Peele is trying to use this movie to say that we, as a human, should respect human rights of other people. Sometimes great movies will leave many questions in the audience's brain, and cause many interpretations."

"cdjh-81125","9","0","7","9 May 2019"," All of ""Us""
","With ""Get Out"" Jordan Peele cemented himself as an interesting new director to watch out for and its a movie I've loved the more I've watched it. There was no reason for me not to be excited for ""Us"" and while it was very different from what I was expecting it was still an immensely rewarding experience that I cannot wait to see again.<br/><br/>Peele's writing and directing were both top notch in this film. In Get Out it was more about his script but here he proves himself to be just as good behind the camera. There's a constant sense of tension and unease in his directing. He does many things visually that set up things that viewers can enjoy after repeat viewings.<br/><br/>With basically every actor portraying 2 characters in this film is almost entirely reliant on its actors to carry the film. Luckily Peele brought out the best in all of them with Lupita Nyong'o owning the film in every scene she's in no matter which characters she's playing. Winston Duke and the actors portraying the children are also all excellent in the film even if they're not given as much as Nyong'o to do.<br/><br/>It's also a very intelligent movie that sets up a great sense of mystery. The audience is kept in the dark for so much of the film and it slows the viewers to make their own theories and predictions as the film goes on. It's a great sense of fun in trying to predict what will happen but I wouldn't blame anyone for simply waiting for answers. Even if there is a bit of an exposition dump towards the end that I found tacked on there still plenty left up to interpretation.<br/><br/>My only other real issue with the film was a two sequence at the beginning of the end Act. Both two scenes that work well on their own but are placed next to each other and with them both being fairly similar it feels repetitive and halts the pacing somewhat.<br/><br/>Us is a movie that anyone can watch and still take something away from it. It's a highly original movie that rewards the viewer on their first viewing and many more after that. The powerhouse performance from Lupita Nyong'o carry's so much of the film but Peele's writing and directing is the true star of the film. It's one the best films of the year and is likely to stay that way.<br/><br/>9.3/10 (Phenomenal)"

","I enjoyed this film. I knew about the hype. I loved Get Out and thought it was amazing and was happy for Jordan Peele to win the Oscar. Lupita was amazing as young girl who suffers a trauma that she cant forget when she was young. The film starts with a young version of herself at an amusement park. Something happens that will haunt her for years. We flash forward to present day her family are going back to beach that she knew as a kid. She has a bad feeling something is going to happen. A family that look just like theirs show up and start terrorizing them. They are doppelgangers, Jordan said hes always been fascinated with that idea. He grew up loving films like Vertigo and other Hitchcock classics and similar stories. The dialogue is very funny and the acting from Lupita is amazing playing both characters. Jordan is throwing a lot at the screen, it is very stylish and well made. But there are some plot holes that don't quite make sense. I won't get into them on this review in case people still haven't seen this film. But I will say this film is definitely worth your time. Even with the plot holes i still feel its one of the best films of 2019 so far. It is not as great as Get Out but still a interesting film. On a side not I have watched the first few episodes of Jordan's new version of The Twilight Zone which i think has great potential."

It also manages to include comedic elements that were not cringe worthy and were very fitting.<br/><br/>While being a better horror film compared to get out, it also nails its social commentary, the use of symbolism and metaphors is just amazing to see, making viewers want to pause at every frame to discover the subtle details.

"SweetWilliam63","8","0","5","14 April 2019"," 'Us' Worthy Of Fuss
","One of the nice problems to have when you make a critical and commercial masterpiece is what to follow it up with. (Especially in an industry that is constantly asking ""What have you done lately?"") Tarentino followed 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) with 'Jackie Brown' (1997). Two years after Spielberg's 'Jaws' (1975) he directed 'Close Encounters' (1977). Orson Welles' followed 'Citizen Kane' (1941) with the just as brilliant but largely ignored 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942). On that basis alone, 'Us' is a pretty amazing second film for director and writer Jordan Peele. It is sharp, original, deft and yes.... the fun kind of scary. There are some weak and contrived plot lines to overlook. And whatever the underlying social commentary is supposed to be, it was lost on me. None the less, a strong supporting cast will leave you both looking through your fingers and rooting for the good guys. Lupita Nyong'o is the scariest thing to come out of horror films since Max Schreck in 'Nosferatu' (1922). It's beyond Oscar worthy but the Oscar will have to do. Tim Heidecker ('The Awsome Show') is fun to watch in a surprise bit of casting. See it in a theatre but don't go alone."

","I honestly enjoyed ""Us"" as much as I expected to.
The story is interesting and catchy at all times, even though the middle part of the movie could have been a little faster for my taste.
I understand some of the criticism that has been given to the movie regarding plot holes and what not, but I think that the viewer should think more about the ""why"" other than the ""how"", also considering the fact that these minimal plot holes don't really affect the overall performance of the movie.
The actors in this movie are all incredible and Jordan Pelee proves to be once again an incredible director with a keen eye to details and symbolic meanings all throughout the movie.
In conclusion my rating for this movie is a good 9/10, given the fact that there could have been some minimal (but not strictly necessary) improvement to the storyline.
The soundtrack for the movie is also very well thought."

Once the doppelg√É¬§ngers had entered the house, I was confused about (and never fully understood) what they were trying to do. Were they trying to kill them, scare them, or obtain something from them. It was never really clear. It was like a cat and mouse relationship, which was dragged out and was somewhat disappointing. I think there should have been more twists and turns in that middle portion of the movie, that could get us more engaged."

","US !!!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASE<br/><br/>Jordan Peele has his own way of delivering a message to the people.<br/><br/>He did it in Get Out and he delivered a very strong message.<br/><br/>We all thought US, was relatable or it follows Get Out or a Prequel to Get Out, however it is not related to Jordan Peele first film.<br/><br/>US, is a standalone original new horror film that talks about your own mind and your own Soul, which can be against you, can be deadly and can be pure evil. Can it be controlled?<br/><br/>I am 50/50 about this film. I dont understand why they come from the underground and not through a spirit? Why they come from an a musement park near a beach? Is this film an imagination of the mind? Does it have political and racial signals and messages? No idea more research needs to be conducted. How do the US know where the others live?

"happyendingrocks","6","0","1","12 April 2019"," I got 6 on it
","Since Us is a tale that studies the dualism of opposites (good and evil, light and dark, above and below, etc.), it is perhaps fitting that the film itself grapples with its own intrinsic counterpoints. On one hand, Jordan Peele's second horror feature is a stylish production that boasts some stellar acting, an intriguing concept, and a large handful of genuinely unsettling set-pieces. However, the landscape on the other side of Us's coin is rather blurry, a grab-bag of fantastic ideas that don't ever coalesce into a satisfying whole, a narrative that often fails to adhere to its own internal logic, and a formulaic resolution that lands with a dull thud. Us is at times a very good film, but also a very frustrating one, because both the undeniable talent of its architect and its strongest visceral moments hint at an elusive greatness that the final product never quite achieves.<br/><br/>You already know the plot: a vacationing family whose matriarch is still haunted by a mysterious childhood trauma encounters a quartet of malevolent doppelgangers (""it's Us..."") who stalk and torment them until these ordinary people are forced fight back against extraordinary foes. It's the same basic set-up used in any number of ""home invasion"" thrillers, though Peele tweaks the blueprint enough to put his own unique stamp on the happenings. At first, this is sufficient. Getting to know the Wilsons while the film's creepy subtleties slowly assert themselves drives an engaging opening act, and the initial assault upon their cottage is more harrowing than anything you'll find in the cheap-jump-scare realms of contemporary horror. Yet when Us begins delving into the deeper significance of its macabre scenario, the movie quickly sheds its mask of reality-borne terror and morphs into something far more unviable and far less remarkable.<br/><br/>A comparable film like The Strangers offered up the simplest and most chilling explanation for its cycle of torture and violence: ""because you were home."" Us presents a much loftier concept, but sacrifices much of its potency to do so. Our fundamental fear of the unknown has been utilized as a powerful tool in countless genre offerings; a bit of ambiguity would have served this one very well, especially since Peele supplies enough solid jolts here to let them speak for themselves. Regrettably, Us instead goes to great and disruptive lengths to explain itself, at one point completely derailing the climax so the principal antihero can deliver a 10-minute monologue which sheds light into every dark corner the film has introduced along the way, outlining the ins and outs of the nefarious scenario like an old James Bond villain's obligatory confession of their masterplan. This reveal opens a slew of plot-holes and brings what should be the most exciting sequence of the picture to a screeching halt, and while the ensuing final battle is staged with stunning visual panache, the payoff ends up being rather minimal after such an interminable detour to get there. Whittling away all of this needless explication would have benefitted the bloated running time and made Us a much leaner and meaner killing machine--ditto with the abundant implants of humor, which aren't unexpected given Peele's comedic lineage, but add nothing to the movie besides trivial distractions from its mission statement.<br/><br/>Ironically, for all of its long-winded elucidations, Us makes less sense the more you ponder it. The overarching device crumbles under scrutiny, the ""twist"" is so obvious and futile that is doesn't even qualify for that designation, and the amplified dread we are ostensibly supposed to feel upon being transported into the shoes of a normal family in peril is negated by an omnipresent comic-book sensibility. When traumatized children are cracking one-liners moments after brutally and gorily executing beings who look exactly like their loved ones, whatever tenuous sense of ""this could happen to anyone"" Us is grasping for pretty much flies out the window.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of high-points, the most notable being a charismatic two-role performance by Lupita Nyong'o, who handily steals the show. Peele's gradual introduction of the morbid phantasmagorias that shape the on-screen mythology ensures that the tension level remains elevated as the story unfolds, even if that momentum evaporates once his characters begin ruining the mystery by clarifying everything that's happening. Genre fans will enjoy the sly cultural references peppered in along the way, and the grislier bits of the flick are handled in gleefully vigorous fashion. There are some truly memorable segments in Us that will ensure viewers will be thinking about it long after the credits roll. Nevertheless, like Peele's similarly uneven and similarly over-hyped Get Out, this spiritual sequel is merely okay.<br/><br/>Jordan Peele is an extremely gifted writer who has also demonstrated that he has the directorial acumen to put some excellent things on the screen. I have no doubt he is capable of making an altogether superb horror film. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting."

","'Us' is not as good as 'Get Out'. Now that that's out of the way, I can talk about one of the years best films so far. While all of the performances are good throughout, Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding in both of her roles, delivering the strongest performance of 2019 yet, and makes the film more engaging. The first act is great at setting up the characters and conflicts, thanks to the realistic dialogue and a superb visual style. Things really get exciting in the second act, once the doppelg√É¬§nger family are introduced. Here both the tension and horror ramp up to deliver a truly taut, tense and thrilling middle portion that works so well because we care for the characters involved. The doppelg√É¬§nger family is truly creepy as well, supplying the traditional 'horror' of the film. Unfortunately, the ending is by far the worst section of the flick, as it is severely bogged down by a massive exposition dump that over-explains a lot of the narrative and leaves little to the audience's imagination. There's also a final twist that isn't initially all that impactful as it doesn't really change anything and seems only to have been included for a cheap shock. However, upon reflection it does add an extra layer of subtext and gives the overall message a deeper meaning. Another good thing is that the final confrontation is executed very well in terms of the staging, editing and music and this ensures that things don't end in an underwhelming way. There is also a lot of symbolism and a few hidden meanings scattered throughout, so, while the main narrative is fully explained to the audience, there is still a lot of room for reflection and discussion once the film is over, which is always a positive thing. Overall, 'Us' is a very thrilling and engaging picture with great characters and performances. While the third act could have been handled a little bit better, it's by no means awful and it definitely doesn't tarnish the excellence of what comes before it. 8/10"

","..I was a little surprised at to see all the negative 1~3/10 reviews that I looked at before seeing this film tonight. I confess that the public reviews here at IMDB almost scared me off seeing this movie, and that would have been wrong, by those making these reviews, and a mistake by me for listening to them.<br/><br/>First let me note that some people are going to get fabulously rich from making this movie....Cost, 20 million, worldwide gross so far about 220 million....that's a big, big spread.<br/><br/>Secondly, if anyone is going to deserve the Oscar for lead actress for 2019, it is going to be Lupita Nyong'o...wowzer, what a gripping, almost gravitational force performance by her. (She grabbed me by the throat and never let me go...damn she was great).<br/><br/>Next, most people say the first 20 minutes was okay but that the movie lost them after that. I disagree, the beginning was slow but then the movie picked up a non-stop breakneck pace with a fine internal logic.<br/><br/>Lastly, let us be honest, as the white boy I am, it was at first odd to be seeing a black family, not a black super hero, not a black cop, not black drug dealers, but a normal and respectable black family be so totally the center of an American film, but then to be subtlety yet totally shifted as a viewer to be rooting for this black family to not only survive, but to prevail...that was a nice trick to so flawlessly pull-off.

"fandangosbrv","8","0","2","6 April 2019"," Did I just watch the same movie as the people who are rating this 3/10??
","My Frist review in IMDb. I just had to. After seeing so many low grade reviews based mostly on ""the hype"" and the lack of logic in the narrative, it just makes me feel kinda sad that many people couldn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. My suggestion for you is that you should watch the movie before seeing any reviews (even this one. Go watch it then continue reading , if you like) . Firstly the move starts off showing some old commercials passing on the TV. Those adverts will be deeply related to the plot ,as you will notice. After that , a little girl wanders alone, lost in an amusement park near the beach of Santa Cruz and ends up in a creepy mirror-house whose motto says that you ""will find yourself"" if you enter. And indeed she finds herself ,but in a rather unexpected way. The girl finds an identical copy/clone of herself and freaks out. That traumatic event is set aside for some time and ,years later ,the no longer girl - now a mother of two children - is persuaded by her husband to spend their summer family vacation near that same beach of Santa Cruz. Although had travelled very uneasily , she understood that trip would do good to the Wilsons (her family) and their relationship. Aaand they end up at the same beach she found her ""other self"" a long time ago. We then discover that this ""copy"" of her used all these years that passed to come up with a plan to attack the ""original"" family (the Wilsons). I have never imagined how terrifying it could be to see someone just like myself not as a reflection in a mirror. That is exactly what happened: the ""copies"" ( we find out they are more than one) invade the Wilsons' house and threaten everyone's lives with sisors and violence ,mostly. After a lot of tension and a good deal of true psychological thriller momentum, we get to find out that these copies were actually a failed attempt by humans to make clones. They lived unwantedly in the sewers/underground unused suwbay (if I am not mistaken) below as ""shadows"" from the ""true humans"" that lived above. The problem is that humans failed to clone a ""soul"". In fact, they wanted puppets that could imitate the ""above people"". The ""shadows"" did imitate humans but in a more grotesque and bizarre way. For instance, whereas the atop humans ate wholesome food , the ""lower"" ones ate rabbit flesh because it was the only ""food"" available there and they even ate it with the same enthusiasm. On the other hand, one of those clones was different: she could speak and think outside of the box. she was the main character clone and acted as a leader. She started to disseminate awareness amidst her people. In her appearance in the upper world she said: ""We are Americans too"". I believe Jordan Peele uses this to criticize the American way of life in the sense that many people live very well while others lived in terrible conditions underneath. That is very well translated into the film as well as this lack of equilibrium regarding the lifestyle seen in the USA and also in the entire world. We witness a big struggle between the two main character shadow/self (Lupita) as we begin to understand in depth why she was the leader and why she was different from the other shadows.I can definitely say that Lupita Nyong'o does a brilliant job of conveying the feelings of someone who lost all dignity and is craving for chaos , even if guided by some wicked logic. The photography is superb , there are some marvellous shots of the underground and the beach. The soundtrack is satisfyingly fitting as it is a mix of high pitched notes in the more intense moments and chilling old school hip-hop here and there. There is so much detail to the story and so much more I could explore here, regarding criticism and the depth of the narrative but it would make this rivew more tiresome, I guess. This is the kind of the movie that makes you leave the cinema thinking: 'What in the world did I just watch??' And in a good way, I hope. There is a big plot twist in the end that brings a lot of lucidity to many facts that passed generally unnoticed throughout the entirety of the film. Moreover , the ending forces you to revisit the beginning of the movie itself.
To finish I would just like to mention that, considering the amount of ""It's a masterpiece"" or "" It's complete garbage"" reviews , this movie might not be for everyone, but I can assure that if you like movies that make you think, plus a healthy dose of comical relief added to the thriller genre, you will love it. I hope this more open-minded"" review motivated you to give the movie a shot or at least see it in a different perspective. Sorry if it was too tiring hahaha
Have a great day<br/><br/>

"jaceodemedici","9","0","3","5 April 2019"," We are Americans
","Us is not necessarily as traditional a horror movie as it's being marketed as. It is visually an incredibly beautiful film. The performances from the cast are stellar as well. It seems that many people have walked away from this film feeling like it doesn't have as much to say as Get Out did, and have found it lacking for that. But in reality, this movie is less about the literal plot points and more about the abstract representations of the characters and settings. The Tethered representing lower class citizens that the upper class ignores, so much so in this case that they live in caves underground and no one even knows they exist. The upper class here are represented by our protagonist family, who are maybe not as privileged as some of the characters in the movie but have enough privilege to be ignorant of the Tethered, the way that you or I might be ignorant of the plight of people suffering from homelessness. There's something poignant to be said about the chains that society puts on people of different classes as well. And without spoiling it, one of the late twists of the movie can even be interpreted as a call for all of us to examine who we really are.<br/><br/>If the plot of the movie is taken completely on face value without looking into the subtext it could easily be considered a lesser entry in Jordan Peele's filmography, but taking into consideration all of the concepts Peele has managed to explore with this film, it truly stands out as an instant classic."
"hunter-friesen","7","0","1","5 April 2019"," ""Us"" provokes through terror
","When you hear the name Jordan Peele these days, you instinctively think of his 2017 breakout hit ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>Through impeccable directing and writing, Peele created a pop culture moment around a film that was able to be entertaining and thought-provoking. It was so good that the only real critique people had was that it really wasn't that scary.<br/><br/>""Us"" is Peele's response to that critique as he delivers an out-and-out horror film that is still able to make you think while it scares the pants off you.<br/><br/>In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide wandered into a hall of mirrors and encountered what seemed to be an evil version of herself. Never really convinced of what she had seen, the little girl turned mute and for years wasn't able to express herself.<br/><br/>Now thirty years later, Adelaide and her husband Gabe take their children, Zora and Jason, to that same beach where the incident happened. Adelaide tries to keep calm for her family, but the thought of that childhood moment keeps lingering in her.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, only a day into the vacation, that evil doppelganger returns to get its revenge, and this time it has an identical family all armed with scissors.<br/><br/>With his second directorial gig, Jordan Peele proves that ""Get Out"" was not a one-hit wonder and that he is a fully accomplished director.<br/><br/>While still delivering the scares, he takes the home-invasion thriller genre and gives it a much larger scope.<br/><br/>This feat is accomplished through his expert use of camerawork, which is used to push the narrative as much as possible.<br/><br/>A mixture of long takes and pan shots are used to keep the story moving and give off a constant feeling of suspense. When opting for quicker shots during bursts of violence, Peele incorporates well-timed cuts that perfectly match the tone of the scene.<br/><br/>As noted in Get Out, Peele knows how to use music as a storytelling tool. That skill is put on full display here as he combines usual horror music with modern pop hits such ""I Got 5 On It"" and NWA's ""F--- Tha Police"". Every music choice here is just right and heightens the power of each scene.<br/><br/>*It is quite hard to critique certain story elements as that would reveal essential spoilers that would ruin the viewing experience. In service of this, I will be quite vague when it comes to specific details.<br/><br/>As a whole, ""Us"" is a bit of a step back for Peele.<br/><br/>His script is filled with questions referring to themes of classism in America and the duality of man. Little answers are given for these big questions, seemingly on purpose in an effort to let the imagination of the viewer run wild.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while I do respect Peele's honorable intent, I feel that he has set his sights too high and isn't able to come full circle on his ideas.<br/><br/>A few plot holes pop up from time to time, most notably during the third act when Peele decides to exposition dump in one short sequence. Little payoff was given for important questions that had been building since the beginning, leaving me with an unsatisfying feeling.<br/><br/>Coupling this misstep with the ambiguous ending quickly makes the narrative lose its luster. Many questions I had came more from the film's faults rather than its merits.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o is absolutely perfect in her dual roles. Her performance as the conflicted heroine of Adelaide is top notch. Equally great, if not better, is her turn as the doppelganger Red where she is downright terrifying as she moves around the screen with menacing precision.<br/><br/>Winston Duke is great as Gabe, who offers some comedic relief from time to time. Duke ingeniously uses his physicality for both roles as he loafs around to make his human character seem like a teddy bear and stands tall and bulky for his fearful doppelganger.<br/><br/>Both the child performances by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex deserve applause. They don't fall into the usual trap of overacting and are able to make the audience genuinely care for them.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, consisting of Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker, are fine in their own right but hold nothing compared to the main troupe<br/><br/>While it could be considered as slightly inferior to his previous film, Peele's ""Us"" is still leagues ahead of the usual movies that file under the horror genre.<br/><br/>Best seen going in as blind as possible, this film will have you captivated during its two-hour runtime along with the subsequent days proceeding."

","Jordan Peele played with people's funny bones when he was in 'Key and Peele'; now the guy's leaving his mark on the horror genre with 'Get Out' and 'Us': two films that have been part of the 2010s' horror craze that make commentary on American racism and classism. The guy's got a knack for trying to make people uncomfortable thanks to his understanding of all things funny: so inverting his comfort-zone sense of humour through discomfort and African-American suburbia in his two recent features is an oddly fitting creative choice for the guy.<br/><br/>This film's got callbacks to 'Jaws', 'The Shining' and 'The Birds' whilst trying to make its sense of dystopian different to that seen in 'A Quiet Place': The world of 'Us' is an uncomfortable undertaking of humanity's darkside taking physical form. It's almost indirect commentary on the alt-right movement that's plagued the world since 2016; and honestly it's a bold thing to be doing that in the world of modern horror. The scares aren't in the jumps or monsters; it's ourselves.<br/><br/>Though the film's horrific and unintentionally funny at times, its message and intention is clear and very important in 2019.<br/><br/>I give 'Us' 4/5 stars."
"pesquera-69384","8","0","4","5 April 2019"," Despite deficiencies, it is a correct entertainment
","First of all, I avoided to watch ""GetOut"" before watching this one, so my comment can be something else as ...this is better or worse than Get Out. For a change I am not going to make a direct comment on the film itself but how I believe the script was conceived. It started probably with the idea of a doppelganger family that appears who knows from (and this is the interesting side of the film, not knowing what is happening). The idea is in itself terrifying and promising. This idea was developed with some drops of humor. Chasing to death is probably one of the most typical patterns in the history of horror films, and it fortunately keeps on working. The atmosphere around everything that is happening is adequate, and there is a lot of good work invested in the preface and in the middle part of the film. However it came the time to explain all this mess, and it is there where the film become weak. The story of a tunnel full of doppelgangers might be a last minute add-on to the script, and we get explained in a short minute that all those are a result of a kind of a failed goverment experiment...I did not get why the white rabbits are doing there, I might have missed something since english is not my mother tongue. This thing of the experiment would habe made good for a full film if well developed , but here it is treated like a bad glue to make all the pieces of the puzzle match. My rating was more dedicated to the good part of the film, with proper acting and preface setting , nice execution, light, jumpscares ...until the fillm starts going downhill."

","So, I saw Jordan Peele's new horror movie Us, and it was pretty good. Jordan Peele's directorial debut in 2017 with Get Out is one of my favorite horror films. If I would compare this movie with Get Out, I'd probably choose Get Out, but you can't really compare these two films as the same. While Get Out was more of a racial commentary mixed with horror, Us is more of a full on horror film. Lupita Nyong'o is fantastic in the lead role as Adelaide, and she does a decent job with Red (Adelaide's tethered counterpart) also. Winston Duke is a scene stealer in the film and is overall hilarious. I didn't mind the child actors, as even they were pretty good also. Even the Tylers who are played by Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker are good. The score is good, and I liked the cinematography. While I didn't enjoy it as much as Get Out, Us is still a decent horror movie in an era where most horror movies can go below expectations. I'm giving Jordan Peele's Us a 7/10"
"gortx","Null","0","1","3 April 2019"," Interesting if too convoluted
","For all it virtues, Jordan Peele's GET OUT's greatest strength may have been its strong focus on getting from its creepy beginning to its finale. All of the social commentary, humor and production values seemed determined to arrive at that conclusion (fumbled a bit, but, that's a different discussion). With US, Peele has chosen a much more indirect route. The end goal may have been clear to Peele, but, the path is much rockier.
Give Peele kudos for ambition. US is chock-full of subplots, subtext and, even a bit of genuine subversion. The basic gimmick seems simple enough. A young girl Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) walks into a funhouse in 1986 and exits a scared and scarred victim of a frightful appearance. Cut to the present and the now adult Adelaide and her husband and two children are going on vacation near that same fateful funhouse. Audiences conditioned by horror films can start to guess what is going to happen next, but Peele continues to toss in curve balls and sliders as US flits from childhood terrors to home invasion thriller to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers riff to Zombie flick.
By the time we get to the conclusion, the audience may be forgiven for feeling a bit worn out, not just by the longish running time (110 minutes), but, by the twisty path US takes to get to the not altogether satisfying conclusion. What keeps the movie afloat is the fine acting by Nyong'o, Elisabeth Moss and Shahadi Wright Joseph (as Adelaide's daughter). Peele stages much of the action well and the other tech credits are solid. While there isn't the deeper vein of humor as found in GET OUT, Peele sneaks in a few choice bits in the margins.
To Peele's credit, he has never been shy about acknowledging his inspirations in his work, whether it be The Stepford Wives for GET OUT, or the Twilight Zone episode 'Mirror Image' here (Peele's revamp of Twilight Zone has just begun airing). Some may also see not only the influence of the aforementioned Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, but, also THE STRANGERS, GREMLINS and even the semi-obscure British horror film DEATH LINE (aka Raw Meat). All filmmakers borrow, of course. Unfortunately, sections of US feel like an undigested collections of themes, storylines and plot points. Without getting into spoilers, I'll just state that the more one thinks about it, the less the basic premise makes sense. Peele tries the trick of avoiding direct explanation of what the hell is going on, but, there's enough there to notice that it doesn't add up.
It is too easy to say that US is Peele's 'sophomore slump'. It's better than that, but, it's still a bit of disappointment.
If nothing else, US answers the question of what an early David Cronenberg (70s era) remake of Penny Marshall/Tom Hank's BIG would have been like!"

director:Jourdan Peele
starring: Lupita Nyongo,Winston Duke,Elizabeth Moss,Shahadi Right Joseph and Evan Alex etc<br/><br/>overall rating 72/100<br/><br/>
Us frustrated me, because there was so many excellent components but it was its few big weaknesses that let it down considerably lets talk about why this is.<br/><br/>Lets start with one of the main positives for us, its fantastic acting. Elizabeth,Shahadi and Even all deserve respect and credit for taking on such a challenging role in this film. As they had to play two alternate versions of themselves which requires a lot of skill and they all did an excellent job with both of there roles. And made a very believable close family so they should all be applauded for there efforts here. Also Winston Duke was fantastic here as well as well as having the talent to play two versions of himself he also added a lot of humour and charm to his character and seemed to be a great dad in the film so hopefully this will bring him more work outside of black panther in the future.<br/><br/>Another positive for this film would be its fantastic score. Whether it was catchy songs from the 90,s or to add tension to scenes the soundtrack was really executed perfectly . And it even felt like it had a sci fi feel to it as well. It really added a lot more impact to the more frightening scenes, as it prepares you for whats coming and its never something good.<br/><br/>The next big positive for me would be its very tense and creepy tone. This film despite in my opinion not necessarily being scary it was certainly tense. So tense my fists were clenched for most of the film. The scenes were dragged out and silent which really kept you on the edge of your seat unsure about whats going to happen so this was executed excellently.<br/><br/>Next however i will say that i did not like some of the pacing in this film. The pacing was way to slow, there was often nothing happening in the first 30 minutes, and when something scary or emotional was going to happen it was either cut off so nothing happened or it was disappointing. so I wish they had more consistent scares or interesting scenes only in the first act as they did admittedly make up for it in the later acts.<br/><br/>Next i liked the horror elements and despite being limited the films jumpscares as well. I would call this film a thriller/slasher movie with a flavour of horror. Often the situations shown to us with the doppelgangers were more disturbing and creepy. And the jumpscares from them were admittedly very effective as Jourdan Peele did a fantastic job of misleading the audience into thinking one thing and then surprising you. He is truly becoming as everyone else is saying a master director but he needs to improve on his overall plot which i will talk about in a later paragraph.<br/><br/>The next positive for me would be the films humour. There was a good blend of laughs and terror. The main source of comedy did come from Winston Duke. His character was hilarious he was the stereotype dad who tries to be cool with his kids and it really brought out a lot of laughs with the antics he got into with his children.<br/><br/>The next positive would be the films gore. There was a lot of blood in this film so it is certainly not for the squemish. But i really felt the gore added to the impact of each scene with the doppelg√É¬§ngers. Jourdan Peele went all out and did not hold back with the amount of gory scenes which i loved<br/><br/>the penultimate positive for me would be Jourdan Peeles uniqueness and creativity with his plot i will get into the negatives of this soon. But i have to applaud Jourdan for creating something unique. I cant compare it to anything else so it really felt like a fresh and new experience whilst watching the film i hope he keeps this kind of creativity up.<br/><br/>My final main positive was the shining star of this film Lupita Nyongo. She is an absolutely phenomenal actress. She delivered every role. The caring mother,she was funny and over protective.And did a phenomenal job playing her evil counterpart seriously her performance was horrifying in a good way. The way she moved and spoke really was frightening to watch and i believed everything she did i really believe she is a star and should have a very busy schedule ahead of her.<br/><br/>Finally my main massive negative for this film was that most of the plot in the film did not make sense at all. I got what they were trying to do with the plot twist but it was not executed well at all and just made the whole film not make sense. I walked out of the film asking so many questions to myself about why they made certain decisions in the film. They were all stuck under the tunnels for years but they should not of been under the tunnels for that long as the little girl escaped it just frustrated me the lack of sense a lot of the film actually had as if they had got this right the film would of been nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Overall Us has so many fantastic qualities to it but it was the few big issues with the film that brings it down and Jordan Peele needs to fix this in his films otherwise this will effect the quality of his future films."

","A movie should be well executed and shouldn't really take a whole lot of analyzing and commentating just to understand it. The trailer certainly shouldn't be better than the film itself. The confusion and tons of questions people were left with is why there are so many low ratings. I didn't leave the theater satisfied and convinced (or even scared) rather I was more anxious to read the spoilers I had been avoiding and breakdowns.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6/10 because I love the idea and the thought behind it. After reading the commentaries, I understand it a lot more and is now anxious to watch again and pay closer attention to the tons of clues I missed the first time.<br/><br/>I love Jordan Peele's work so far and have faith in him. I think he's lucky that so many people enjoy breaking down his films and a lot of them didn't mind the confusion and sloppy execution. But then again, give him a break. This is only his 2nd feature and he's better than a lot of what we've seen in the last 10 years. I hope that his next two (he said he has about 4 of these, 'Get Out' being the first) are far better."

","I find US very disappointing after the thrilling and ingeniously intriguing GET OUT. However, the film doesn't work as a thriller or horror entertainment, though you'd never tell from the critics reviews. Critically,that film was critically greeted with an inflated degree of intellectual seriousness, despite its excesses as a racial allegory in which every white character was a villain. Sadly, in US the allegory envelopes everything; and the attempt is too muddled to allow for the successful horror-thriller entertainment that seems to have been intended to accompany the allegory. Happily perhaps for Peele, the enthusiasm awaiting the allegorical efforts of a well regarded creator seems directly proportional to the incoherence of the allegorical effort. (Skeptical readers are invited to go for their amusement -- or enlightenment-- to Kyle Buchanan's 04-27 NYT presentation of 7 interpretations.) Indecipherable grim nonsense."

"kluseba","8","0","5","28 March 2019"," Gloomy mystery
","Us is an American horror movie with and by Jordan Peele who is the mastermind behind the Academy Award winning Get Out, a horror movie dealing with social issues such as racial discrimination. His most recent film doesn't deal with social issues and balances horror elements with mystery sequences.<br/><br/>The film's weakest point is the plot. Even though it sounds intriguing at first, it leaves many questions unanswered and even comes around with quite a few plot holes towards the end. The predictable twist can't save the messy script either. The movie revolves around a young girl who encounters a mysterious doppelg√§nger in a hall of mirrors which leaves her mentally tormented. Several decades later, she reluctantly returns to the region where she experienced this trauma and soon starts noticing strange occurences. She tries to convince her husband to depart with their two children but her doppelg√§nger and her family soon break into their cottage and attempt to kill them to take their places. The family manages to escape and realizes that citizen all around the region are being attacked by their doppelg√§ngers. The young woman must confront the demons of her past in order to find a way to stop them.<br/><br/>This horror movie convinces with numerous elements. It has an uneasy atmosphere right from the start that never lets go until its partial conclusion. The acting performances are authentic and especially lead actress Lupita Nyong'o is incredible as tormented soul with a heart of gold and remarkable resilience. Even the child actresses and actors deliver the goods in this film. The opening sequence takes place in the eighties and has a cool nostalgic flair. The locations are carefully chosen and especially the scenes in the hall of mirrors are memorable.<br/><br/>Even though the movie isn't particularly scary and frustrates with a few plot holes, it is overall very entertaining and its strong acting performances, intense atmosphere and intriguing locations pardon for the film's minor flaws. I hesitated between giving the film seven or eight points but since I was thoroughly entertained by it at the local movie theatre, I decided to give it the better of the two grades. If you like mysterious horror films, you are going to appreciate this film."

Jordan Peele attempts the sophomore jinx with this decidedly Shyamalan turn (not a good thing) in this horror film about a nuclear family facing a sudden attack by their deadly dopplegangers during a much needed vacation retreat. Claustrophobic and atmospheric (largely thanks to the pin-pricking score by Michael Abels) the film rests its huge agenda (people need people even if they are supernaturally so) on the slender yet capable shoulders of Nyong'o who successfully scores the hat trick in playing both good and evil versions with aplomb and empathy.

","All of us have problems. I might wake up with a cold, making me more tired then usual to do what I love. You might be worrying about how to pay an expensive medical bill when you don't have health insurance. Parents might be worrying about how their going to put their kids through college when the tuition keeps getting more expensive. The point is that when we have problems, the last thing we want is to make them such a big deal we cannot function. This is why we suppress these stresses rather then confronting them. Often, this will come back in bad ways. Perhaps as a bigger issue or a darker part of you personality.<br/><br/>I believe that we are often our worst enemy when were not honest with ourselves. This also happens to be a theme of Jordan Peele's newest movie. For a guy who originally came into the business with his comedic skills, he sure is showing hick knack for suspense. Even though I really enjoyed Get Out, I count that more as a social thriller then a horror, kind of like a Twilight Zone story (considering that he's about to reboot The Twilight Zone). Let's see how that compares to Us.<br/><br/>A mother of two Adelaide (played by Lupita Nyong'o) is on vacation with her family, but cannot shake her memories of running across a clone of herself back in the mid 80's. This makes visiting Santa Monica beach hard, but she puts up with it to please her husband Gabe (played by Winston Duke) and her children Zora (played by Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Played by Evan Alex). Their beach trip goes fine, even meeting with friends of theirs. The only slip up is when Jason finds a random guy standing still with blood dripping, but tells no one about it.<br/><br/>When they return home, things seem to be going fine until four random people show up in their driveway. Gabe tries to call them out, but they don't respond. When he threatens them, they run off, but later return. To the family's horror, the four people are all clones of themselves, only to be wearing red jumpsuits and seem crazy. The only one that can talk (though slowly and with a raspy voice) is Adelaide's that calls herself Red. Throughout the night, the family tries to outsmart and escape the clones, but there may be something bigger facing them.<br/><br/>I can say without a doubt that Get Out was not a lucky situation, as Us is just as entertaining and fun as the latter was. I'm more convinced that Jordan Peele really understands what scares people, not just black people. This is probably the most literal example of ""the past coming back to haunt you"" I've seen in a while. It's a staple within a lot of ghost and horror stories, but what this does different is that its more layered then you'd expect. I won't spoil how, but it takes the home invasion thriller in a different direction then you'd expect.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch with Lupita Nyong'o doing great as both Adelaide and Red. In fact, I also realized that since the plot calls for each main player to have a clone, everyone had two sides they had to play; themselves and their darker reflections. This is a gamble, but I couldn't see anyone that was weaker then the other. I think it's success comes from it's script, which was also written by Jordan Peele. He's a guy who certainly knows how to make good comedy out of these moments, but it's drama and suspense are still just as real.<br/><br/>Now when comparing this to Get Out, is Us better? I'd say the two are even, but for different reasons. Get Out showcased a darker story that probably scared me more then Us did. Us will probably have more of a rewatch, mainstream value as it's scares were a bit more expected, but it's story was simply larger. If I had any problems with the movie is that I wish the bigger twist was different. I won't spoil it here, but let's say if you've seen a lot of movies about clones, then you may already know what the twist is, as it's been done before.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight red jumpsuits out of ten. Horror and thriller fans will love this. If you liked Get Out, then I could see you also enjoying this. Whether your with someone or your shadow, Us is a fun ride through darker shadows."
"jeffperi","5","0","1","26 March 2019"," Disappointing
","Yes, the acting was great, the production value fantastic, some really enjoyable parts with elements of terror and suspense but the most important element of a film is the story and the environment it lives within. I am all too happy to suspend my belief and take that leap of faith for art, but the back story here does not really make any real sense. In a zombie movie you get that a virus might cause these effects and that somehow it continues to be animated until the corpse is completely decimated. This film does not address why there are so many of these doppelgangers were ever produced. How they built all these vast tunnel networks without anyone noticing is just silly. They abandoned this project after creating enough to replace everyone in the country. They probably would have figured out the issues after a much smaller experiment. And they left enough rabbits for them to eat for decades in cages. Yes, rabbits, rebirth, cliche. BTW, humans will die if they only eat rabbit. So they wander aimlessly and couldn't figure out a way to escape from a place that wasn't even secure. And why would the government allow this secrect experiment to continue? Wouldn't they destroy the evidence? So these doppelg√§ngers had sex and birthed children? From their behavior it seems that they would just crap themselves. Did they use a restroom? How was this facility all over the country maintained and cleaned for decades? Who paid for these enormous electric bills? Science fiction is great and makes sense within it own world, but this story doesn't follow any sort of parameters. To me this seemed like a self indulgent attempt to fit a square into a circle - it was so esoteric, I'm not even sure anyone but Peele could understand the structure of the story. I've seen B-movies that make more sense - Sharknado or Attack of the Killer Donuts At least they're satirical.<br/><br/>In one scene the leader of the clones says a throw away line that she's an American. Peele says this film is about the current state of our country. How? Why? How are we supposed infer this concept. He seems to have tried so hard to be deep and artsy he lost perspective. Peele seems to be pulling an M. Night like after Sixth Sense. With all the hype and probably the pressure to one up on Get Out which was great, this film fell flat. Let's hope the next one is better."

The ""dopplegangers"" are intent on killing the members of the family in sadistic games. That's what the trailer & synopsis says, but the rest of the film (the slashing & twists) are pretty much hidden from the audience, enticing them in as it were...<br/><br/>Though I must say from watching the film I was pleasantly surprised. From the previews I took this film to be more psychological, but the film has quite a lot of slasher infused moments in it. Which is great as I love slashers.<br/><br/>The core of the film was pretty great, but sadly the ending climax quickly looses momentum and starts to drag. Furthermore, the film turns strange and begins to loose its novelty pretty fast. Then the twist comes along with a backstory which is alright, but a bit dumb and over the top. The end twists especially was contradictory & pretty plot hole like. It felt added in to have an uncertain ending or a so called clever ending. But unfortunately, despite a good start & a strong middle, the climax leave lots to be desired and finishes pretty weak anti climatic ending.<br/><br/>Critics & cinema snobs have hyped this up once again like they do with lots of mediocre horrors and boring films of today designed to be ""unique"" & not cliche. But this one was borderline decent, not quite amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, worth a watch, but the ending will leave you confused and left with more questions than answers. 6/10"

My understanding/reasoning for some of the things people seem to be confused about here is thus:<br/><br/>The scissors and red jump suits were probably left behind by the mystery people who made the Tethered, though I don't know the significance of the bunnies.<br/><br/>I'm guessing overworld Lupita didn't escape from the underworld because when they met, underworld Lupita found proper free will perhaps and then took the role of the overworld Lupita, thus forcing the actual Overworld Lupita to take the role of the mimic.<br/><br/>It looked to me that the Tethered were being forced to mimic their overworld counterparts and knew and felt on a primal level that their movements weren't their own but didn't know what do to do or maybe just accepted it as normal, seeing everyone around them doing the same. I know that would drive me mad...."

","I am not a fan of Jordan Peele, so I didn't go into this movie expecting anything amazing or gente defining. What I got was a serviceable suspense movie that had some well done cinematography and some convincing acting by the main cast. The film itself did nothing new or unique, and I've felt like I've seen this same story told so many times, that even the ending was cliche and expected. What it felt like was an overly long Twilight Zone episode that had some ham fisted imagery and allegory, but didn't quite know the best way to present it.<br/><br/>Overal, I don't realky have much to say about the film. It wasn't scary, it was original, and it was somewhat cliched. But did I enjoy it anyway? I can't say that I did. It was just meh to me, to be perfectly honest. I didn't think about it much after it was over, and if I find a movie to be that forgettable, it must not have been as good as people were making it out to be.<br/><br/>An average film overall, stay for the acting and the cinematography."

","The first half of the movie made me feel like I'm watching some kind of cheap wannabe horror movie. Although the story eventually saves it, I still have the feeling that they chose the main actors just to fit a racial/political profile, without any regards to how well they actually fit their role. At some points during the movie, the audience was even amused by the terrible acting. There are also controversial racial and political statements that serve no purpose to the plot, probably trying (and failing) to create amusement.
The story had a lot of potential, but sadly it was poorly executed."

","The new Jordan Peele movie... if you enjoyed ""Get Out""(2017) then you will most likely enjoy this movie. Its the same director, writer, composer, cinematographer the whole package, me personally I found ""Get out"" to be mild but, I'm gonna give that one another view anyways. In my opinion Jordan Peele is very good at provoking your mind and making you think, so to the casual viewer ""Us""(2019) will definitley get your mind going but to me I saw a lot of elements from things i've already seen. In Summary this is gonna be a lot for most people but to me it was A horror twis on a National Lampoon's Vacation series family dynamic with Black Swan(2010) and Invasion of the body snatchers(1978) as fundamentals and a nice Monster(1994) twist in there, thats how I percieved this movie at least in a raw point of view of it without looking at it from those perspectives ""Us"" was enjoyable because I could see how the director was leading the viewer throughout the movie with his style of filmmaking this movie will make you ask and it shows you things in detail like hiding the answers in plain sight but without giving you the whole thing."

","Jordan Peale'd true skill as a writer isn't his masterful ability to seem pedals blend allegory with narrative, but it is his ability to write his strange creations with an uncompromising vision."
"lmadorski","8","0","2","23 March 2019"," I have no title for the review
","I don't know what to say about this movie without spoiling it. The preformences were all good, the direction was good, I enjoyed the writing. I've seen a lot of complaints about the story, and I believe it's because of the logistics of how it's supposed to work. Without spoiling it, I had a discussion on the way home from the movie, and I was able to come to conclusions for most of the questions I had. I see a good anoint if the people here on imdb aren't liking it too much, but I'd definitely say you should see it. It's a bizzare expirence, which I really enjoyed."

","Not in the same league as Get Out. The opening text was reminiscent of M Nighy Shyamalan's style back in the day and If you think JP is following in the same footsteps, forget it. The acting and soundtrack are good but the plot is awful. The pace is quite slow too. It wasn't scary at all and sadly failed to match the anticipation of it's terrifying trailer. PS. It might be useful to read Jeremiah 11:11 beforehand as it's referenced but never revealed."
"moviesmaniax","8","0","3","22 March 2019"," Lupita Nyong'o deserves an Oscar // more REVIEWS on instagram @moviesmaniax
","First off, Lupita Nyong'o probably delivers the best performance I have ever seen in any horror movie EVER. Her performance is just so genuinely creepy and deeply unsettling, especially those Oscar moments with her other self that unfortunately seems to overshadow the inferior nature of the film itself. (Also shout out to Elisabeth Moss for her intriguing performance too). But, ""Best Horror Movie of All Time""? Hell no. It seems to be clear now that Jordan Peele doesn't seem to like showing the gores in his movie, which in this one, is quite a let down, because there are lots and lots of opportunities to go hard on that R-rating, which in my honest opinion, would make this a much more horrific and terrifying experience to watch as a whole. The film also has some humorous, some scary moments, and decent twist, yet nothing over-the-top that would give you nightmares or shock you in any way, which again, is quite a let down. Instead, Us drives you toward that thrills on the 'why' rather than the 'how', triggering your curiosity while delivering a bloody fun ride along the way. Nonetheless, Us is a thoughtful, well-crafted, funny, thrilling, and inventive horror film fueled by Oscar worthy performance from Lupita Nyong'o, with that alone, is more than enough to highly recommend this movie for."
