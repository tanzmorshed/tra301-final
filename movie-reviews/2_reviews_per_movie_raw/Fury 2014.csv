"barjo-915-203229","5","717","910","26 October 2014"," Gritty but unrealistic hocum and very silly final scene.
","OK, lets face it. We are over movies where one American kills 20 Germans who seemingly can't hit the wall of a Barn. They were big in the 1950's, and 1970s, but not any longer.<br/><br/>Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. The acting is good, but it is let down by tow things.<br/><br/>Clichéd characters. There is the tough commander, the new kid, the slightly crazy guy. There are a lot of clichéd characters here.<br/><br/>Unrealistic battle scenes. Seriously I just switched off in the last scene. 20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilied Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 CRACK SS soldiers can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a road????? The tank only has machine guns facing forward, so most of its sides are unprotected. Germans are carrying bazookas, but instead choose to shoot the tank with machine guns, which would not do anything? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in any war movie. Really spoilt what could have been a good movie."

","If you want to know about the war, then watch the amazing 'World At War' documentary series.<br/><br/>If the point of this film was, as so many other reviews have said, to demonstrate the carnage, pain and suffering or war, then why is there no real context to any of the action.<br/><br/>Why is Brad Pitt's body in one piece when the Germans explode 2 grenades at his feet, inside his tank.<br/><br/>Why does a crack SS battalion continually commit suicide by walking in front of the machine guns of the crippled tank (instead of walking round the back) <br/><br/>Why did the Yanks leave the spare machine gun ammunition on the outside of the tank when preparing the ambush? I know, it was so Brad could look heroic and get shot trying to retrieve it.<br/><br/>The SS troops fired 2 or 3 RPG type rockets at the tank, caused damage and killed one of the men, then stopped firing them.<br/><br/>The premise of keeping the crossroads was ridiculous. Anyone could just have walked through the adjacent fields if they wanted to get past.<br/><br/>This film has pretensions of being a serious movie and the cinematography/soundtrack etc. are very well done, but the whole thing just lacks any reality or validity."
"staercke","1","603","817","4 November 2014"," Action movie, not ""realistic""
","SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>I've seen the movie and I would rather have them describe it as a WW2 action movie instead of ""authentic"". Just because you show gore doesn't mean it's realistic. The last combat scene is a disgrace. I wanted to leave the theater.<br/><br/>The Allied campaign in the West was NOT A WALK IN THE PARK. The allied casualties were staggering. Even when the Germans lost millions of troops in the East, battling at 3 fronts (Russia, Italy and the West) and the Luftwaffe was all but destroyed. After June 1944 the Anglo-American loses were as high as 2.000 troops per division per month. <br/><br/>Educate yourself, don't believe Hollywood. Read books! Anthony Beevor has great books (Stalingrad, The Fall of Berlin, Normandy,...)<br/><br/>SPOILERS!<br/><br/>1) The scene with the German anti tank guns hidden in the woods. Very slow moving Shermans while the Germans had plenty of time to aim. They missed all shots. Of course the Allies quickly destroyed them.<br/><br/>2) Brad Rambo commits a war crime by shooting an unarmed German prisoner. Although this happened on both sides, it was still a war crime. Funny thing is that they called the German a murderer because he wore an American jacket. Yet a few minutes later we see dickhead Shane from the Walking Dead wearing a German helmet and jacket... Double standards. <br/><br/>3) The scene in town. Fury comes driving slowly from behind a corner with a German anti tank gun aiming at them from within a store from 50 yards away. Yet they miss AGAIN.<br/><br/>4) Don't get me started at the scene with the 2 women. <br/><br/>5) The Tiger battle: somewhat realistic that the Tiger knocks out 3 of the Shermans. Yet Fury gets hit twice (2 times) and survives. A good Tiger crew would just turn their tank on the spot to hide the thinner back side. Also, why do the other Sherman tanks blow up while getting hit from the front, while Fury survives 2 shots from close by? Also the Tiger is close enough the get destroyed by the standard Sherman gun. <br/><br/>6) last scene. A battle hardened Waffen SS battalion with every other soldier wearing a panzerfaust (bazooka). Fury stands disabled on the road. The Germans run like dumb chickens in front of Fury's machine guns over and over again. Even when the Germans start using the Panzerfausts, they seem to miss from a few yards away. They only use 3 panzerfausts... Yet they continue to shoot Fury with their machine guns... The Fury crew shoots around and throws grenades blindly, killing Germans with every shot/grenade. In reality the Germans would go to cover after the first fatality's, regroup, get anti tank equipment and take out Fury within minutes after the start of the fight. Fury doesn't have machine guns at the back or sides... Brad Rambo gets out starts manning the 50 cal but still NOT A SINGLE German hits him, until the worst sniper in German history hits Brad Rambo 3 times from 100 yards and he still survives. Also his corps seems untouched even with 2 German hand grenades exploding within a yard from him. <br/><br/>7) The last survivor of Fury hides under the tank. A young Waffen SS soldier sees him, but decides to let him be. Of course... every Waffen SS soldier would do that after they killed more than 100 of his comrades... <br/><br/>8) The last scene where the camera zooms out showing Fury with a mass of dead Germans around it is just plain dumb. ﻿"
"hiebertkj","4","765","1063","17 October 2014"," A horrific and emotional journey through every war movie cliché
","I had high hopes that Fury might end the dry spell of good WWII movies. I could have forgiven the checklist of war movie clichés Fury manages to work in had it not been for a laughable final battle more akin to something from The Expendables than a serious war movie. The final battle consists of scenes where a battalion of seasoned SS soldiers run back and forth through our heroes' machine gun fire, only stopping when it is time for a forced emotional exchange inside the tank. While the director chose to have every other enemy brandish an anti-tank weapon in the ominous lead-in to the final battle, for some reason only three of them are fired, two which miss at unrealistically close range. The ridiculousness of it all turned me into that obnoxious movie goer that laughs out loud during what should be a serious and emotional scene. <br/><br/>On the positive side it does manage the singular achievement of most war movie clichés fit into two hours:<br/><br/>Kill a German officer on horseback - check<br/><br/>Christian singing hymns - check<br/><br/>Mexican crew member made fun of for speaking Spanish - check <br/><br/>Hardened leader with a unknown pre-war history who has a private emotional breakdown - check<br/><br/>Young replacement who struggles to fit in with seasoned veterans but wins them over in the end - check<br/><br/>Soldier falls in love with local girl only to watch her die - check <br/><br/>A final mission with impossible odds - check<br/><br/>Moment of doubt when facing certain death but where everyone decides to stick together in the face of certain death - check<br/><br/>Retarded enemy is almost defeated only to remember how to do war, and only after our team has completed their emotional bonding and character development - check<br/><br/>One member escapes death against all odds-check<br/><br/>Enemy soldier shows mercy by not revealing hiding soldier - check<br/><br/>....and many many many more."
"boiannus","3","426","586","6 November 2014"," The movie insults our intelligence
","One of the crappiest war movies I've ever seen, if not the worst!<br/><br/>Firstly: No story, no real plot. War is almost over, maybe in 2-3 weeks and there are just 5 guys driving around in tank and fighting still resisting Germans. And than suddenly everything depends on them. Namely unit with cooks is left defenseless and if they got beaten whole division would be lost. OMG!!! And we all know what could happen then. The war would be lost! Luckily for mankind there is this Sherman tank equipped with Brad Pitt eager to do whatever it takes to hold the Germans and save the cooks.<br/><br/>Well, to this point it wasn't so bad. Battles were OK displayed. It was interesting to see from tank's crew point of view how it looks to fight. But then, we have most ridiculous and naive war scene since ""Rambo 3"".<br/><br/>They got stuck on some crossroad in the middle of nowhere. Tank can't move and 300 SS troops are approaching towards them. Typical cliché scene where everybody (normal) wants to abandon tank and retreat, but no, Brad just won't do this, even if he must fight alone by himself. Naturally the rest then decide to stay(and to die like idiots).<br/><br/>When battle starts, man just starts wondering how Germany managed to beat anyone and occupy anything with so dumb soldiers. And this is SS company, not some regular soldiers. Even they are so retarded, so they are attacking tank only from the front side practically running to the bullets. Sure they have bazookas, but why using then?!? Let just shoot the tank with machine gun. Then one blind SS soldier with IQ over 80 came to side of the tank with bazooka to try to hit it from 2 meters distance.... AND MISSED IT!!! OMG, if they are not stupid, they are totally blind.<br/><br/>Epilogue: Long story short. Brad Pitt & Co. resisted until they are out of ammo. Brad got shot by sniper 3 or 4 times in chest, but it is just not enough for him to die. He still has time to chat with Norman then to kill one more German, more chatting... Ordinary men would die instantly, but this is Brad Pitt for God sake. <br/><br/>Anyway acting was pretty good (3 stars are for this), but script was so awful. Cliché scenes, cliché characters. I'm truly sorry, cause this could be descent war movie."
"richard-543-683365","8","141","195","12 July 2015"," Excellent but painful journey of male bonding
","Reviewer after reviewer criticizes this movie for its phony depictions of the war, clichés and unrealistic battle scenes. There is only one significant fact that is crucial to know when it comes to the accuracy of the depiction; Shermans were going to be your coffin in a face-off with a Tiger. If you want serious historical detail then consider watching a WWII documentary. I think the overall depictions were secondary and only serve as the backdrop for the director's real message which was the painful slow process of the relationship that was built between these guys in a tragic situation. I think Ayers did a masterful job at this. You think Brad Pitt is a second rate actor? Watch his facial expressions during the scenes in the room with Logan Lerman and the 2 women; Watch his nervous breakdowns. Watch him in the ""Why are you such an asshole?"" scene. Watch him as he jokes with his guys about Hitler and chocolate bars. Even with Wardaddy's personal weaknesses, by the middle of the movie you understand why these guys liked, admired and respected him, and I'll bet you do also. His timing and delivery, in my opinion, are better than Tom Hanks on this best day. Watch LaBoeuf's nervous leg, and a list of other endearing nuanced details; He plays a very convincing religious proselytizer. During the tank battle if you didn't feel like your life was threatened then you were probably on xanex. I'm not sure that there is another film that conveys this kind of claustrophobic camaraderie from a tank crew's viewpoint. If there is, I've never seen it."
"marklv","1","362","551","31 October 2014"," Garbage movie - designed to make money for Brad Pitt
","This film gave me a feeling of initial distaste, which rapidly grew to anger, and yes FURY, as the story line progressed. Compared to the masterful 'Saving Private Ryan' this film was a prime example of how to make a piece of garbage and, with a major star in the leading role and good marketing, turn it into a box office winner. Where do I start? Well, the tank crew is a bunch of thugs who look as if they just came out of jail - yeah we saw it all before in the 'Dirty Dozen', the 'Bridge at Remagen' and so on. But these guys had no redeeming features at all - just a bunch of psychopaths with guns. Even the Brad Pitt leading character took pleasure in killing enemy prisoners and encouraging the innocent young recruit to do likewise. Yes, these ugly incidents did happen in the war, and US soldiers were often guilty of such 'heat of the moment' atrocities, but they were exceptions, NOT the rule! And to make this behaviour seem normal is highly irresponsible, not to say defamatory to the US Army. Then there is the perpetuation of the old myth about the Waffen SS being cruel maniacs etc when in reality they were highly disciplined and effective soldiers who often behaved more correctly than the Wehrmacht. The apex of stupidity came in the long climactic final scene in which the Pitt character and his three colleagues kill hundreds of SS troopers with a single broken down Sherman tank before finally being overwhelmed and killed - the naive young recruit being the only survivor. I could not believe what I was seeing. This is war for the video gaming generation, not for anyone who has actually gone through this hellish experience. The Germans ran around like headless chickens and let themselves be mowed down by machine gun fire like turkeys. This is so unbelievably moronic that it makes one cringe with embarrassment. I felt I should have asked for a refund after watching such crap. Awful."
"phatrick88","2","233","353","2 November 2014"," An insult to our WWII Vets
","I walked out of the theater speechless, that it is 2014 and we can still produce movies that are so historically inaccurate. Heck I dug up my old IMDb account just to neg this movie.<br/><br/>Like my title says, this movie is an absolute slap in the face to the millions of World War II vets who fought to secure our freedom. The conduct and parlance of these soldiers was extremely out of character with the 1940's. Please, don't curse like it's 2014 when you're portraying an event that happened 70 years ago. They couldn't even display proper military discipline. <br/><br/>I knew it was going to be bad just from a the first few minutes of dialogue and acting, then the combat scenes began!<br/><br/>So totally unrealistic you can't even suspend your disbelief and enjoy it. Were the Germans firing blanks? Hundreds of dead Germans with only a few GI casualties. The Waffen SS - the most revered fighting force of the time - running aimlessly into machine gun fire like a cheap video game. Missing their mark at point blank range. Germans typically portrayed as weak, inferior and dumb. <br/><br/>I think you could live in a test tube and probably be smart enough to realize the final battle was a JOKE. So silly nothing more needs to be said. <br/><br/>The reality is, all four tanks would have been likely knocked out in the first battle by the Germans in the tree-line with their AA and panzerschrecks. The Tiger tank in the second battle would have knocked out all four Sherman tanks, on the first shot, Fury never would have got behind it to make the kill (research some famous tank battles). The SS in the final battle would have made short work of their disabled tank in a few short minutes. <br/><br/>This movie best exemplifies the quote:<br/><br/>""History is written by the victors"""
"jagreen70","1","301","462","5 November 2014"," Modern Hollywood WW II, not the real one.
","I recently saw the new movie ""Fury"" with Brad Pitt, and keep reading how ""realistic"" it is supposed to be. Here is my take on this movie (SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills an unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member ""how to kill"". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him. His company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank platoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march discipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire platoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very cynical version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with some ""Cross of Iron"" thrown in. It reminds me of those ""Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"" comic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the ""Ghost Tank"" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that this scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The vast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not psychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and knowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of Hollywood WW II, not the real one. Brad Pitt's character needs to be given a Section 8."

","Why is it that WWll lasted as long as it did? After all the Germans in all these movies are killed by the bushel and have absolutely no tactical battlefield ability! Fury brings this to a new height with the final battle scene. An entire SS Battallion armed with Panzerfuasts decides to attack a disabled Sherman Tank frontally not once but repeatedly! Say Hans you think it might be better to pin them down with fire and circle round to the rear of the tank to finish it off with the Panzerfausts? No I think sacrificing the entire battalion in a frontal attack makes more sense. Besides doing it the right way destroys the tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war. Please Brad stop playing Achillies in every movie!"
"madmace29","2","135","213","6 November 2014"," Hollywood strikes again
","First, the good news: Brat Pitt plays Achilles again! Callous, cynical, merciless, he piles the corpses of slain enemies a mile high around him. Everyone who likes old John Wayne movies, in which the heroes slaughter faceless masses of victims without work up a sweat, will love this one.<br/><br/>Most interesting is the fact, that obviously most (even 'professional') critics fell for the completely artificial psychological aspect. The heroes are unhappy with what they see? Bad luck, man, you went there by own choice. What did you think war would be like? The characters in the movie doesn't depict something like men following a comprehensible downfall due to what they witness or do. They're plain sociopathic lunatics! There's been millions of men in that war, and though only a small fraction has really been in the midst of fighting, postwar society would have broken with legions of burnt-out killers, ripe for padded cells, flooding back. No, folks, think again: this movie isn't about psychological trauma and gruesome but necessary hebetude. It's most voyeuristic carnage with embedded paltry excuse. The disability of most authors to tell enthralling stories lead more and more to the simple idea to just add more blood and gore and atrocity and cover it with flimsy homemade psychology. <br/><br/>To enhance the bulls**t even more, the director fantasized a completely hilarious made-up scenario: the lonesome, heroic tank crew, standing strong amidst a sea of raging enemy troops - in 1945. Too bad, though, that in that phase of the war the western allies outnumbered the Germans multiple times, having total air superiority and more tanks on the western front than the Germans had built during the whole war. Forcibly generate old fashioned underdog heroism without any logic isn't just bad storytelling, but a slap in the face of any thinking audience. So the glorious final battle degenerates as expected to utter ridiculousness. Our larger-than-life heroes slaughter masses of enemy soldiers who seem unable to hit a barn from the inside and being void of any experience or even basic reflexes. By my opinion, this always is the worst insult to all real WW2 vets: when the enemy soldiers were that completely inapt, how did so many of you die? So far, directors have proved completely unable to think war as not glorious, not heroic and not a great adventure in which people die just so their friends have a reason to take revenge. David Ayer failed likewise.<br/><br/>I gave two stars for good effects and for using real tanks instead of ugly dummies."
"mjjusa-1","2","304","498","17 October 2014"," War, and watching 'Fury', is hell.
","It is hard to put into words just how loathsome a movie 'Fury' is. The self hating writer/director must have correctly calculated that any WWII veteran of the European Theater must be in his or her's late eighties by now, thus avoiding the real potential of one of them slapping the living scheisse out of him for this atrocity. It begins with a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German soldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our anti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for opportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts American soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs. See: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially after 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie following, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that. High marks (pardon the pun) though, for the German soldiers surrounding the tank, who stop firing for inexplicable reasons, but which coincide with long discussions on war and friendship by the tank crew."

Yes of course, it highlights strained relationships in very stressful and violent situations. I enjoyed the movie and being ex military in the 3rd Armour Division you do tend to pick things out BUT I could do that in just about any military movie I have seen especially from WWII to date.

"rtp4242","1","163","269","25 October 2014"," Fury Infuriatingly bad film-making.
","Tank Commander Don Collier (Brad Pitt) leads a group of soldiers on a mission to hold a crossroads from a Nazi SS division in 1945. His loyal subordinates have fought with him from Africa to France on D- Day and now into Germany. The veterans, Boyd Swan, (Shia La Bouf) Trini Garcia, (Michael Pena) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) try to break in a new assistant tank driver, Norman Ellison (Logan Lehrman) who used to be a clerk typist before entering combat. Can the tank soldiers hold the crossroads until reinforcements arrive?<br/><br/>I have heard that Fury is based on a number of true stories from World War II. If that is the case, the collection of stories seem awfully disjointed, and lacking in continuity. Every movie about WWII had a mission to complete. In Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers try to recover a missing soldier, in the Great Escape, a group of allied POW's try to escape a Nazi POW camp, In Stalag 17, the allies try to uncover a Nazi spy in their midst, and probably the best of these is Band of Brothers, which follows the exploits of Easy Company the first parachute infantry regiment during World War II. There is no mission here, no cohesive story, the soldiers just hop from mission to mission, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. It's supposed to be a character study, but the characters are paper thin. Pitt is the leader of the group, but why do these soldiers follow him around through the whole war, and why are they willing to lay their lives on the line for him. The rest of the characters are little more than stereotypes, Swan spouts scripture at every turn, which is an insult to a true Christian. Garcia is a loutish Hispanic character, Grady Travis is the stereotypical Hollywood redneck, which is an insult to Southern people. And Lehrman is the new guy being put through the requisite amount of hazing before being accepted by the group. To top it off, the ending is shockingly unrealistic. If it wanted to concentrate on how muddy, and filthy and bloody war is they succeeded, but again, what kind of story do they want to tell, a heroic war story or a gritty anti-war war movie? The length of the movie, is far too long, and one scene, where the soldiers hold two women prisoner, encapsulates the problem. The scene goes on and on, and doesn't provide any insight to these men, or why they behave they way they do. 2 hours and 14 minutes is horrendously long for a movie with seemingly no point.<br/><br/>The acting is underwhelming. Pitt gives a dull, listless performance, and expects the audience to follow him regardless. It's like he's saying, ""I'm a star, that's why you should spend 2+ hours watching me."" Sorry, that's not good enough. After two lackluster performances in 12 Years A Slave, and World War Z, I'm beginning to have serious doubts about Pitt's acting ability. He is capable of giving a good performance, he did give a great performance in Inglorious Basterds, ironically a World War II movie. Logan Lehrman gives the best performance, but the character is so hackneyed and clichéd, that it's hard to appreciate his performance. Shia La Bouf easily gives the most insincere performance of his life as a Bible thumping evangelical, and Michael Pena should be ashamed of the lines he has to say. If I want a sermon, I'll go to church, if I want a negative Latino stereotype, I'll watch John Leguizamo.<br/><br/>There is one scene with outstanding cinematography, unfortunately it's the first scene, and then the rest of the movie is filled with a dull sepia imbued film. This is undoubtedly done for effect, but instead of illustrating an uplifting tone, it adds to a depressing tone. The pacing is slow and ponderous, much like a tank ride though Germany. The story meanders for a long time, before trying to build to an exciting ending. It doesn't.<br/><br/>For more Pitt-thy reviews visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com."

Apart from pathetic sight, I believe such movies are an insult for the (true) heroic sacrifices the men of the US Army made during World War II in order to make the Nazis kneel. Kind of hard to imagine another reason for which Hollywood continues to produce such bullshit from time to time. A great disappointment, if you are a fan of war movies, DEFINITELY stay away.

","Brad Pitt killing Nazis again. This time in a tank. Possibly, no probably, the worst movie I have ever seen. Horrible. Last scene: Brad Pitt's tank is set to hold an important crossroads. Loses tread on mine. Lookout spots 250 SS infantry troops on the way, with an armored car or two. Brad Pitt says were gonna duke it out. (um, I haven't been in the army, but I would at that point hide in the woods and call an air strike. Long columns of troops hate being strafed by fighter planes.) SS gets up to the tank and then the tank opens fire. Kills a bunch of SS. Germans send wave after wave of infantry guys with machine guns against tank. (somehow, even though it is April 1945 and the Germans have been fighting for 7 years or so, they don't realize a machine gun can't hurt a tank.) They have a guy with a bazooka but he positioned himself at the front of the tank and the tank shot him first. Not sure why he didn't walk around to the rear to the immobile tank and blow it up. After a hundred or so Germans have been killed by doing wind sprints in the limited field of fire, Brad Pitt says the hell with it with it stands on the top of tank and shots more Germans. He is silhouetted against a burning building and a wily German sniper sneaks up. He hits Brad Pitt 3 times, but Brad Pitt crawls back into tank. (Hmmmusually one shot is all a sniper needs. This sniper goes for the rarely used ""shoulder shot""). At this point there is only Brad Pitt and one other guy left. The other guy says ""Sarg, Im scared."" Brad Pitt also discloses that he too is scared. German opens the top hatch and drops two of those weird looking hand grenades a foot away from Brad Pitt. Must of maxed out the timers, because Brad Pitt has time to tell the other guy its OK to run and there is a bottom hatch he can use. The guy opens it and drops to the ground. Two explosions rock the tank. The guy crawls in a hole beneath tank. Bunch of SS troops are milling about the tank. One peeks under the tank with a flashlight, he sees the American, but pretends he didn't. Lots of the SS guys were pretty OK dudes I guess. American goes to sleep. Wakes up next morning the Germans are gone. He goes into tank, instead of the turret of the tank having Brad Pitt wallpaper, his body is resting peacefully. He looks good. He is Brad Pitt after all. Looks like he passed away from embarrassment from being in such a horrible movie. Last guy covers him up. He gets rescued, medic says to him, ""you're a hero."" I think that was suppose to be meaningful, ironic or something. Its called ""Fury"" because thats the way I felt after spending $10.50 on it."

","I would have given this movie a 10-star rating if not for the last 30 minutes. The first 90 minutes perfectly showed how every war is ugly and disgusting. The Americans, although on the side of the justice and righteousness, were equally ugly and disgusting on the battlefield. Unfortunately, the last 30 minutes of the movie tried to turn it into a heroic story, which was not in accordance with the first 90 minutes and became a political propaganda of USA."

","Well, I had high hopes for this movie. I had awaited it's release and enjoyed the build up... hearing that Shia Lebouff didn't wash for weeks in order to get into role; much to the annoyance of the other cast members... <br/><br/>Though, in truth this movie didn't reveal a lot about what it was like living and fighting through the war. I understood nothing after watching the movie about how cramped or what it might be like to live, fight and die inside a tank. Instead it seemed like ""it's the best job ever"" - alcohol in the pantry and (seemingly) plenty of space...<br/><br/>The movie did provide loud noises. Colourful explosions. Some gruesome and somewhat shocking deaths. Some love. Some hate. And about as many war movie clichés as could be fit into the running time. Seriously, the end of the film will have you thinking - This is definitely an American made movie. <br/><br/>I would still rate it as a 'decent' war movie. Though, do not get your hopes up. There has been such a dry patch and nothing can come close to Saving Private Ryan or the characterisation of band of brothers series...<br/><br/>This movie played all the stereotype characters and yes they did play well. But I wanted so much more from the film. I wanted to feel like I had learnt a bit of history or at least a bit of insight after the screening. Instead all I learnt was that American blockbusters still play the stereotypes, the clichés and SO much cheese at the end the movie ends up stinking. <br/><br/>Enjoy for an easy war flick but don't expect too much."

","Even though I said this may contain spoilers, I will try hard not to write any. I think the writers made a big basic writing mistake: The main characters weren't likable(OK, I kind of liked the ""new guy"" character). They were jerks and bullies and immature acting and I ended up cheering for the Germans hoping they would kill them. And also, one of the main battles was just plain goofy. There were like 200 German soldiers trying to take out one tank, but there were waves of them running in front of the tank one way, then later another wave was running the other way with no real purpose. It looked really stupid. I actually started laughing because they looked like the Keystone Kops. It is just a really bad movie all around with very unlikable characters."
"vass_sap","3","84","144","13 December 2014"," Good production - Mediocre acting - Awful plot
","I still don't understand why Hollywood movies have to be like this... These people have millions of dollars, some of the best actors out there, unlimited resources and still they manage to screw up.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this: <br/><br/>A bunch of American soldiers with the most unintelligible accents ever, ride on a Sherman tank kicking ass during the end of WWII in Germany. They have fun killing children and executing surrendered PoW's. They even help capture a city and have romantic sex (it is not rape if you caress her hand first) with German women. More tank riding follows, more killings, a Tiger ambushes them but at the end they kill it too!<br/><br/>Finally they have this mission to defend a crossroads against a German SS battalion that is going to attack the allied supply train. The tank breaks down however and instead of abandoning it, they prepare an ambush for the unsuspecting SS battalion. Suddenly, while preparing (by drinking whiskey and smoking, not looking out for enemies), they realize that 300 Germans are (litteraly) on their tank. Time for battle!<br/><br/>Our heroes randomly throw grenades out of the hatches killing 3-5 enemies with each one. Then they fire the machine guns (that only aim at the front of the tank) killing everyone who approaches. The Germans follow the old and reliable tactic of ""running headlong towards the front of an immobile enemy tank that has only front facing guns"". The attack is furious and the Germans show their ferocity and tactical prowess by crouching 100m in front of the tank and firing their MP40s and MG42s. Not until almost half of their men are dead, their officer remembers that they have some antitank weapons with them. They attack the immobile Sherman with Panzerfausts from 5m away and they miss. Thrice. After so many misses there is no use firing the rest of the Panzerfausts. Our heroic crew kills even more of them until they run out of ammo. Then the evil Germans throw grenades in the tank that manage to kill (gently without dismembering or even drawing blood) every one but young Norman. <br/><br/>While not shown in the movie, there is an additional scene where the German SS officer having lost 90% of his men and all of his trucks and weapons, realizes that they could just go AROUND this IMMOBILE tank and destroy the allied supply train completing their mission. But who can think of basic military tactics when you have Brad Pitt looking at you seductively through his commander's hatch?<br/><br/>TL;DR: Americans good, Germans bad. Americans clever, Germans stupid. Americans heroes and strategic geniuses, Germans retards without basic military training.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you liked the Expendables and the Rambo movies then Fury is for you! Nice action scenes with lots of blood and killings! Never mind the plot or historical accuracy, who cares about such stuff?"

"Troy-Tempest","1","83","144","16 January 2015"," Worst. War movie. Ever.
","If you don't know anything about the war, it was a great movie. However, where does Troy start? How about with the opening credits! According to them, Hitler didn't declare total war until April 1945, not in Feb 1943. Credit for showing the personalised detail of the tank, inside and out, where each crew stows gear etc differently from other crews. Well done there! However, on the inside there is a collection of medals that have been taken as trophies. Fair enough you'd think. Except there is a Mothers Cross as well! As if any mum would be walking around Germany in late '44 or'45 actually wearing her Mothers Cross! Even if by some chance there was such a mother, are we to believe Brad would strip it off the body of a (presumably) dead women as a trophy? From memory there was also an EK2 on ribbon in the tank, they weren't worn with the ribbon attached, so where did he find that Troy wonders? These are very simple things to research, blunders like this do not and should not happen. <br/><br/>The deplorable scene with not one, but two German anti-tank guns failing to hit Shermans from 100 metres, maybe with school boys firing them but not with experienced artillery crews, those Shermans would have been toast. Then there is the scene where the Sherman comes into a town, without clearing the houses out with infantry first. What is stopping some of the sneaky Germans who are hiding up in the houses from blasting the Sherman with a Panzerfaust? Nothing! Except apparently, even though it's April 1945, and there were a gazillion made, well, only over six million, these guys didn't have any? So they attack the tank with a machine gun - d'uh! <br/><br/>Then there is the atrocity when the 75mm anti-tank shell BOUNCES OFF the Sherman from 30 metres range! It would have gone straight through not bounced off. Now we get to the disgraceful Tiger tank scene. A Tiger could knock out a Sherman from well over 1100 metres away, so what does the dumbest Tiger commander in the Heer/Waffen-SS do? He misses with his first shot from 700 metres away, then proceeds to drive forward and engage five Shermans from way closer than he ever needed to do. While he does knock out four of the five, he ends up engaging Brad Pitt from FIVE METRES away! Naturally, dumbkopf lets Brad get behind him and gets knocked out. <br/><br/>A travesty if ever there was one, he could have just stayed 800 metres away and knocked out all five Shermans. Oh, Troy forgot the pointless (and war crime indictable) exercise when Brad makes the new guy shoot a German prisoner in the back just to toughen him up. Now, the horrendous and totally ludicrous end scene. Fury hits a mine and blows off a track. Whilst being repaired, they become aware of 200-300 crack Waffen-SS men, armed with MG42's by the score, and Panzerfausts, marching and singing towards the disabled Fury. They're looking for trouble! Brad says he's staying, and then the others stay too for the final showdown. <br/><br/>Did Troy mention the Waffen-SS had shouldered Panzerfausts? Brad has this ingenious plan to pass the Sherman off for a knocked out tank, while the five valiant US tankers hide inside. When the hundreds of Waffen-SS stroll into view, and a couple of them climb up onto Fury to check it out, when they open the (unlocked) hatches, they are quickly shot and then it begins! Did Troy mention they were carrying Panzerfausts? They start getting mown down left, right and centre by the Sherman's machine guns, not to mention the main gun taking out scores of evil Nazis who are just running around in a panic, instead of reacting like well-trained men who have years of Eastern Front experience. <br/><br/>Literally a hundred must have been shot! FINALLY someone remembers they have some Panzerfausts! Someone brings over a BOX containing four of them, what the hell happened to all of the ones that were being carried only minutes earlier? From point blank range, one misses! And another! At last someone scores a hit, and all it does is kill one guy inside the tank! It would have TOTALLY destroyed it from 3 metres! Not Fury! On and on it goes with SS guys getting killed like flies, until Fury runs low on ammo. The commanding officer rallies his remaining SS troopers with a sterling speech, then walks in the opposite direction while his men charge off! He'd be leading from the front! <br/><br/>Finally it's down to Brad and the new guy. Brad jumps out and starts hosing even more SS with the .50 cal on the outside of the tank. A sneaky SS sniper is crawling towards Fury, and fires...only to wing Brad! And he's only 30 metres away! He fires again...and only another flesh wound! He fires a third time...this one hurts! Brad slumps back into Fury, then a couple of stick grenades get lobbed through the still unlocked hatch, but these ones don't have the regular four second fuse, not for Brad! Brad has time to order the new guy out through the bottom hatch and as he's crawling away, they explode. <br/><br/>Satisfied that everyone is dead, the SS come to order and start to march off. THEN one SS guy decides to look under Fury,and sees the new guy still alive. Now bear in mind he's just seen hundreds of his kameraden killed, so what does he do? Looks at him then walks off! WTF!?! The only good thing in the movie was that Brad was toting an StG44! No stars! 15 mins · Like"

","People seem to think that war films are pretty hot right now, but they aren't. Having my ear so close to cinema I know for sure that there is always one or two war films floating around in the projection booths, but people are making somewhat of a big deal out of Fury, so I suppose the reel question is will this be a Flag For Our Fathers or will it make us wish for Apocalypse Now?<br/><br/>So lets get this out of the way now. Fury isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan, but then I don't think it ever meant to be, comparing the two movies is like saying that Saun Of The Dead isn't as good as The Book Of Eli, just because both films has similarities (in as much as they are set at the end of the world) doesn't mean they are anything alike. These are two films that are near logger heads with each other.<br/><br/>You see Fury is contained, and given an almost claustrophobic feel to it, the entire film is either inside or at close proximity of the tank that Collier commands. This gives the movie a focus, and a focal point. We are never given a rest from the tank and it's enforcing nature, we are given no repreave from it, just like the men themselves, we are trapped in a steel giant that is only purpose is to kill people.<br/><br/>To say that Fury is bloodthirsty would be an understatement, actually that's not fair for me to say. Fury doesn't enjoy itself in gore, it only tries to give us an accurate portrayal of what it must have been like for those brave men and women who faced death on a daily basis.<br/><br/>That's what David Ayer does really well, he controls his audience. In the opening scene we are shown Collier (Brad Pitt) ambushing and attacking a German officer, it is crude and desperate and over quickly but we can tell even then that is a man who cannot cope with the horrors he has had to endure.<br/><br/>Looking back there are so many moments in Fury that stand out as impressive. There is a single second where Collier shows his true emotions and it is incredible to view. Collier is a man who is forced to be a hero, he never chooses it, he wants only to survive this war.<br/><br/>Any war film can be impressive in it's action sequences, anyone can make loud noises and explosions and fighting, but if a war film can still shock and grip and captivate you in the slower periods, in the silences, that's when you know for sure you have an outstanding movie, and that is what happens with Fury.<br/><br/>Like all war movies, Fury ultimately builds to a climatic finale and truly I think it's one of the best I've ever seen, not because of the action or it's quality of visuals but because we have invested too much into the characters we have seen on screen.<br/><br/>The film of course would be nothing without the men inside the tank, those being Brad Pitt (who helms the best), Shia LaBouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. With these men there is no star, or main character, outside the tank the two leads are Logan Lerman (Who plays the new recruit) and Brad Pitt, however once we are inside the tank all men are equals, and dare I say it, but Shai LaBouf is actually quite good in his role. It's also always nice to see Jason Issacs on screen (hello to you).<br/><br/>Fury is a poignant and painful reminder of how much war can take from each of us, it is a film that never wants us to relax and we never do. Gory and gripping, Fury deserves a high spot in the history of war movies."
"CalRhys","Null","320","607","4 November 2014"," Emotional, Visceral, Gritty
","I can gladly say that David Ayer's World War II flick 'Fury' lived up to my expectations. The audience are confronted with the horrors of war, accompanied with some truly spectacular well-crafted battle scenes that proves Ayer's desire to create something new and profound. Ayer keeps the gritty realism he employed on his other acclaimed films only this time uses it to depict the journey of a tank crew in Germany in 1945. The performances are strong from Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman and even Shia LaBeouf has proved he has a hidden acting talent after his heyday on the set of 'Transformers'. An emotional war-drama that packs a punch with visceral action scenes and an atmospheric score, definitely worth a watch."
"bkoganbing","8","39","65","28 December 2014"," Those last bitter days
","Fury has Brad Pitt starring as a battle hardened tank commander in those last days before VE Day. Russians to the east, Americans, British, Canadians and assorted other allies invading the Third Reich that was supposed to last for a thousand years. These were the last bitter days of the war when what was on the west were kids and die-hard S.S. troops.<br/><br/>While the Russians were facing a desperate resistance from the German Army because Germans in general knew what to expect from the avenging Russian bear, the western front had everyone surrendering or trying to cut deals for themselves. Not so the S.S. troops, Hitler's elite. And those we kill.<br/><br/>In those last days Pitt gets a new replacement, a clerk typist suddenly drafted into the tank corps. It was Logan Lerman's misfortune to miss the end of the war in Europe by only a few weeks. He has a really bad time of it with Pitt and his crew, but eventually gets into the savage spirit of impatience for these men who just want these people to surrender and get it over.<br/><br/>In the end Pitt gets what could be a last stand mission, hold a vital checkpoint crossroads to prevent a Nazi counterattack.<br/><br/>Pitt and his soldiers are not from Hollywood World War II era films. They are a savage crew. But heroism sometimes can just be a case of\ opportunity.<br/><br/>There might be an Oscar in the offing for Pitt and Lerman. Both are incredibly good and incredibly dynamic. The battle special effects are first rate. It's one unvarnished view of World War 2's final days."
"trublu215","9","281","548","15 October 2014"," Fury captures the horrors of war perfectly
","Fury pits a tank filled with five American soldiers at the tail end of World War II as they struggle to fight off a small army of Nazi soldiers that are closing in on them. David Ayer directs this brutal and grim war film with no romance to it. Ayer's film is grim, bloody and unrelenting and fully captures the absolutely horrific nature of war. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is far from Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds, he is a man who is truly run ragged by this war. So much so that it is all the character knows. Followed by his brigade of miserable men played by the likes of Michael Peña, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal, Fury depicts not only the atrocities of war but the ideology of brotherhood with this film. Each of these actors, especially LaBeouf, give their all in roles that are merely supporting on paper. Ayer has an extremely keen eye for chemistry on screen and he directs each of these actors to deliver performances that are well beyond anything that could be scripted. These men truly feel as if they are brothers in arms and you buy into every second of it. The film on a technical level is terrific. Ayer ditches his hand held method for still shots and dolly rigs and it pays off ten fold. The film is visually stunning, a pure grit to the desaturated frame is present from start to finish. As I touched on before, Fury is a violent war film much so in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Lone Survivor. You are subjected to every bullet wound, every explosion of sharp shrapnel, every wound with the utmost visceral imagery. It is disturbing yet necessary for a film like this. Deapite these dark tones and brutality, Fury does feature lighter moments especially with Logan Lerman who gives a seemingly bare-bones performance as Norman Ellison that is subtle but extremely effective as he slowly becomes desensitized to all the violence around him. His performance is constantly evolving along with his character, letting us see layer after layer until he comes full circle in a bloody final act. The best way to describe Fury is by comparing it to Wolfgang Peterson's Das Boot just with a tank instead of a submarine. Its claustrophobic, up close and personal, making the scenes of harrowing violence even more effective. Overall, Fury is a brutal war film that shows war exactly how it should be shown. Its disturbing, its violent, its scary. Fury really hits a home run between the sweeping cinematography, the phenomenal performances and the near perfect direction, it is one hell of a film that shouldn't be missed."

"BrentHankins","8","182","352","16 October 2014"," A relentless, unflinching account of the horror and carnage of war.
","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""<br/><br/>These words, delivered by Brad Pitt's scarred and battle-weary Sgt. Don Collier, are meant to bring some level of comfort to Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), the young man who found himself snatched unceremoniously out of the clerk's office and placed under Collier's command in the final days of WWII. Despite having no combat training to speak of, Ellison has been assigned as the new assistant driver of Fury, the Sherman tank that Collier and his men call home. Ellison has spent most of the war behind a desk, hammering out correspondence at 60 words per minute, but over the last few hours he's been gunning down Nazis in spectacularly gory fashion, and he's struggling to make sense of the carnage.<br/><br/>Collier offers no other thoughts on the subject, having already forgotten about the previous battle and instead thinking about the skirmishes yet to come. He's a fierce figure who inspires confidence and loyalty among his men, who affectionately refer to him as ""Wardaddy."" But he's also terrifying to someone like Ellison, who finds himself woefully unprepared for the demands of his new vocation. During one of the film's early battle sequences, Ellison hesitates just long enough for tragedy to occur, and his subsequent brow-beating by Collier is followed by one of the most frightening and gut-wrenching scenes ever depicted in a war film. Ellison is quite literally forced to shun his own moral code and forsake any shred of humanity he still clings to, because Collier knows that if he doesn't, everyone in the unit will be dead.<br/><br/>And what a unit it is, a motley crew of the highest order, comprised of a deeply religious gunner (Shia LeBeouf), a pugnacious redneck with a severe mean streak (Jon Bernthal), and a driver (Michael Pena) who drowns the filth and death in bottle after bottle of whatever booze he can find. But these soldiers are bound together by the sort of brotherhood that can only exist between men who have seen combat together: each is more than willing to die for the other, and the introduction of Ellison into their group is met with a hefty amount of resistance. The kid is an unknown, a variable they hadn't anticipated, and viewed as little more than a liability.<br/><br/>But after proving his mettle during a nail-biting engagement with a superior German tank, Ellison gets the seal of approval from the rest of the boys. Collier even takes Ellison with him to explore an American-occupied village, and the two stumble upon a small apartment and its two female tenants. The film takes an interesting turn at this point, allowing the audience a glimpse into the exhaustion and sadness behind Collier's rugged exterior. A bath, a shave, and a nice dinner are a welcome respite from the day's butchery, but it's the second half of this sequence that truly shows how even the best of men can be transformed by the horror of war.<br/><br/>Every member of the cast is at the top of their game here, even LeBeouf, whose well-documented public meltdowns feel like a distant memory. Despite being hampered by a script that regulates everyone but Collier and Ellison to skin-deep characterizations, the actors make the absolute most of it, bringing depth to characters that could very easily have been one-note portrayals. Pitt and Lerman, on the other hand, are given plenty to work with, and their dialogue exchange during the final moments of the film is one of the most emotionally gripping cinematic moments of the year.<br/><br/>Director David Ayer does a superb job with some of the more human moments in Fury, but his skills are best showcased in the thrilling battle sequences, the majority of which were filmed using actual working tanks from the era. Interior shots are skin-crawlingly claustrophobic, especially when surrounded by the shouts, explosions and machine-gun fire that signify the chaos of battle. Exteriors are also handled well, although the film's frequent use of tracer ammunition makes some of the combat resemble the major clashes in the Star Wars films. Yes, it's historically accurate, but sometimes it's more distracting than engrossing.<br/><br/>While Fury never quite ascends to the level of excellence offered by other WWII epics such as Saving Private Ryan or Cross of Iron, it remains a relentless, unflinching account of the unspeakable nature of war. To quote LeBeouf's character, ""Wait til you see what a man can do to another man."" When we see it, it's certainly not pleasant, and yet we can't look away."

","I don't know where to start with this. Let's concentrate on the cast first. Brad Pitt shows his weakest performance ever in this movie. You can hear how he had just memorized his German phrases phonetically. He is supposed to care for the crew of his tank, but most of the times he just looks annoyed and bored. I remember that look, I had the same after watching this film. The rest of the crew is just a collection of stereotypes; the untrained Bambi, the ruthless bible thumper, the annoying redneck and the Mexican as a stand-in for a black guy. The story has more holes than a Swiss cheese. A cliché love trope between the Bambi and a blonde trophy chick. The crew behaves in ways that would have gotten them court-martialed ten times over. A lone Tiger in the middle of nowhere with gasoline in the tank. Sure. A battalion SS marching with an abundance of Panzerfausts slung over their shoulders, and yet they get horribly butchered by a tracked tank in the middle of a road that has roadside ditches left and right and they all of a sudden have to bring in their ""last"" Panzerfausts in crates and still don't get the job done. Film, story and acting are bad. Do not watch this film without some friends and lots of beverage around. If you make a ""Spot the Cliché"" drinking game, you'll be half dead thirty minutes into the film."
"l-vrtis","4","48","85","21 November 2014"," What a waste
","I really wanted to like Fury. The director talked about how he wanted to be accurate, how he consulted with veterans, got the only still functional Tiger and so on. Well, he couldn't fail harder.<br/><br/>Firstly, you will notice all the clichés that every Hollywood war movie needs and the good ones avoid. I almost think the writers have a cliché checklist and make sure they don't miss any. Now the tanks are pretty well done. Too bad they only got a single Tiger to represent the German panzer might so if you expect tanks battles in a tank moviewell, not today. While the tanks are pretty accurate the fighting made me laugh. The Germans managed to miss fully visible tanks at 300m but whenever they hit, the tank explodes or is at least set on fire. While this did happen the chances were pretty slim. If those chances were low then the Tiger fight involved 1 : million chance represented by diverting a shell with some logs attached to the side of the tank. The FX guys are clearly StarWars fans as I find no explanation for tracers being as bright. On the other hand, the grim reality of war is well depicted and some of the dialogues and crew interaction work well.<br/><br/>*Heavy spoiler ahead!* I can't find words to describe the final fight. Imagine the most ridiculous fight you've ever seen. No, Rambo doesn't cut it because the enemies are mostly trying to kill him. Now, here we have 300 SS idiots whose only purpose in life is to stand in front of Fury and get shredded. Then they take a break and repeat. While they did carry panzerfausts 10min earlier, they probably dumped them or just prefer to use handguns to engage a tank. When frontal handgun assault fails for some reason their wise leader decides to use some panzerfausts after all. At 10m all you have to do is to point it at the tank with the right end but a certain Wafen SS expert manages to miss anyway. To compensate for their stupidity, the crew forgot to stock up on shells or decided that 10-15 shells will do when heading into enemy territory. They did not, however, forgot to bring hand grenades, which are very useful inside a tank and are a must for another cliché from the checklist. There is more but I believe you get the picture."

","I can't make my mind up about ""Fury"". As an escapist war film, it delivers well in a clichéd sort of way. But is it a true reflection on what the latter stages of WW2 were actually like? I doubt it. This film certainly doesn't paint American soldiers in a good light, although after slogging their way across Europe for months on end, facing sense-numbing death and destruction on a daily basis, perhaps it is a realistic portrayal? I just don't know, and would be interested to hear the views of any veterans who were there.<br/><br/>In many of the classic war films of the 50's and 60's, such as ""The Longest Day"" or ""The Great Escape"", when people were shot they just threw their arms in the air and fell down: sanitised death – – ""war is hell"", but let's not show it on screen. Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" rather changed all of that, with 15 minutes of the most visceral footage seen to date, which even D-Day veterans agreed was frighteningly realistic. Spielberg followed that with the remarkable ""Band of Brothers"", with some of the scenes – notably those in the Belgium forest – showing a realistic level of violence but more importantly bringing home the true mental anguish of war. Brad Pitt in (and on) Fury David Ayer's ""Fury"" differs from this masterpiece in two notable ways: firstly, the 'Tarentino effect' seems to have been brought into play with a level of violence and gore that seems to have gone over the top: heads fly off and faces come off with gay abandon; secondly, the US tank crew at the heart of the film seem to be so cold and brutal that you care very little about what happens to them – cracks in the hardened shell of Brad Pitt's character are not referenced again or followed through satisfactorily. Even the rookie crew member (a very good Logan Lerman) turns from pacifist shirker to hardened nut-job faster than you can say ""Dead Nazi"". As such, your emotional attachment to him gets severed pretty early on (in fact this is such an unbelievable transition that a ""1 month later"" subtitle could have been judiciously added at this point).<br/><br/>The tightly knit tank crew (Pitt, Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña, Jon Berthal) all spark off each other well, with LaBeouf as the bible-quoting Boyd Swan being particularly memorable.<br/><br/>The gorgeously vulnerable Alicia von Rittberg plays Emma as the one and only love interest in the film: and for once, Brad Pitt doesn't get the girl! This tense encounter is one of the best dramatic moments in the film. And Harry Potter's Jason Isaacs also delivers a great cameo as a scarred and embattled Captain Waggoner.<br/><br/>In terms of the film-making, it is an effectively put together film by David Ayer (""Training Day"", ""The Fast and the Furious"") who also wrote the film. Real life tanks, from Dorset's Bovington Tank Museum, were used with South Oxfordshire standing in for rural Germany. The 'Zulu-style' climax is tense albeit very far fetched, with German's conveniently choosing to regroup and think about it for a few minutes while dramatic and more reflective moments go on inside the tank.<br/><br/>Music is by Steven Price (his first film score following his Oscar success with ""Gravity"") is effective – mixing electronica, orchestral and choral to good effect in the more dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, an enjoyable if rather gory romp with some memorable scenes that stick in the mind after the lights come on. If you watch blood and gore films with your hands over your eyes, this is one you might want to miss: your viewing time will be severely limited! Certainly not as bad as it could have been, but more and better character development could have perhaps turned this from a good war film into a great war film.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please sign up to receive my future posts at bob-the-movie-man.com.

I never knew the SS taught running around enemy tank is an effective counter strategy, neither was I aware that a a more powerful tank with far better range would blow its cover and charge forward for no apparent reason. It's also normal US crew killing 300 German soldiers in a few mins only to have a SS German soldier to have a change of heart and let the discovered last living crew member live. Yes it's that much retarded.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt should stop doing southern accents, it's as bad as his German and his movies."
"mkbrrn","10","23","38","9 January 2016"," Forget all reviews under 9 of 10
","I can't believe that people are reviewing this movie unfavorably. I have never reviewed anything on IMDb but I absolutely must make a stand here. This movie shattered me and made me reflect on my own mortality, the horrors of war and life itself. This movie takes what people are calling ""cliches"" and makes it as if it is the very first time that those aspects of the film have ever touched the screen. I never once noticed anything that was cliché at all, really. Only after I read the reviews on here did I find that people were not up to the task this movie demands. It runs deep and the acting is brilliant. These actors prepared for months and lived in a tank to achieve this level of acting for the film. The clash of personalities and the blend of tension among the crew at times is perfectly rendered. This gives us both the indulgent character of man as well as the regretful side that never leaves after one has taken something that is not theirs.<br/><br/>The humanity of the characters is utterly obliterated but every so often, you will see it peak out a tiny bit from under the heavy burden of war that they carry. The contrast with the new face among the crew brings this out perfectly as this character attracts all of the humanity this film has but seems to fumble and drop it giving us more complexity and more to reflect on. These are complex characters given full room to breathe in this film.<br/><br/>On the last scene- The last scene in this movie is absolutely brilliant. Is it realistic that this could actually happen in the war? Probably not, but the movie and scene gripped me in the inferno of combat that I never cared. The last scene is meant to illustrate the futility of war and the complete waste of human life it costs us. It is a metaphor. The enormous tenacity of Pitt's character and his futile clinging to his few ideals are what drive this scene. The brutality of his character is fully owned by Pitt. There is no more Pitt left in him. There is only the objective, the end that is inevitable but so far out of reach. I just can't believe that people are reviewing this movie unfavorably. IT is a fantastic movie that gives us what art about WW2 should do: remind us about the past and never let us forget the lessons learned."
"supatube","5","38","68","2 April 2015"," Overacted and underwhelming WWII story with a Tank
","Five months before WWII comes to an end, in the heart of Nazi Germany, five militants become increasingly agitated at the prospect of being defeated by a soulless movement. Rookie soldier Norman (Logan Lerman) is thrust into the middle of unapologetic battle with war-hardened sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), whom is tasked with getting Norman up to scratch with the other soldiers in the tank, imaginatively named Fury.<br/><br/>Every scene seems flooded with mixed emotions fuelled by overacting that doesn't really add up together to form a proper sum. Not to say that the acting was terrible, rather misdirected from shot to shot. The emotion does not read the same in one singular scene. And at times is a complete left field emotion, thrown in to much confusion. Why does Shia LaBeouf look like he is about to cry? Why is he now crying? Why does he look mad, and about to cry?<br/><br/>Another jarring aspect is the use of slang, which is not WWII language circa 1945, more like hip- hop video circa 2010. It's slight, but not at all guised. <br/><br/>Lets run through the many cliché's ever so quickly: Savage horseback murder, Christian Hymns, hardened leader with a rookie whom should not be at the front line, fleeting love story with deadly end, the verbal moment all the soldiers decide to stick together, they all die (and not at once as each one needs their moment to perish) except one (doubt it's the rookieright?) and the enemy wins - the battle - because we all really know that the enemy lost the war.<br/><br/>Its not an epic war drama that offers anything new, informative or unsurprising to a tale that's been told with variable angles, covering a large part of all types of emotions that were felt by anyone who was effected by WWII. The story could have worked in any war setting, even a made up world caught in conflict, as the film did very little to dig into a topic that's been covered thoroughly in a school subject called History. We know it. We want more.<br/><br/>Then the film felt more of an American puff piece about how heroic they are, which is probably why WWII was used as it was probably the last time Americans were seen as a hero in war. <br/><br/>Lets remove history from the story then what we have is a very watchable action film."
"quincytheodore","8","66","127","29 October 2014"," Fury is a straightforward ride into the center of war. It's a less flamboyant, certainly not romanticized, but a damn fine one.
","Strikingly far from mainstream war movie, Fury is unapologetically messy and brutal. The crude nature affects more than the visual, with the cast uttering unrefined profanity along with some military jargon. While the cinematography is splendid, it's nothing near the glossy or cinematic flair of other war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, this is am unfiltered portrayal of war. It goes out of its way to display the gritty, sometimes intentionally overlooked aspect of war, the entire dirty ugliness of it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Wardaddy provides a solid leader persona. He's as consistent as he could be, and with the experience of war movie under his other belt, albeit a rather different one, it comes as no surprise that he performs amazingly. It's not a macho leader character as Wardaddy occasionally has doubt, mostly heavily suppressed. Shia LaBeouf as Bible is good, displaying better on-screen flair than most of his recent ones. Michael Peña as Gordo and Jon Bernthal as Coon-Ass (classy name) round up the crew.<br/><br/>Peña works well, delivering a couple of good scene when least expected. Bernthal from Walking Dead has a certain niche, as an ally who sometimes looks like about to snap. Perhaps the highlight of Fury is Logan Lerman as Norman, the newly recruited crew. He's suddenly thrust into battle at its bloodiest. He gradually trades his innocence with experience of the horrid war out of necessity. Screenplay and dialogues are great, using direct, occasionally rude approach. The characters sound and act like soldiers, and it's not the usual presentable ones for cinema screen.<br/><br/>What gives it more depth is how it's rooted on military. From inside of the tank or down time between skirmishes, every bit seems realistic. The strategy is sound, thus giving more weight to action sequences. This one is not for the fainthearted however, as limbs will fly or get chopped off clean. The movies doesn't dwell on particular gore for shock purpose, it simply brushes fatal graphic and burning bodies as if they are normal occurrences. Soundtracks are effective as well. While most tunes are subtle or orchestra for tense scenes, a few hymns, as if chanted by the soldiers themselves, are eerily moving.<br/><br/>If there' are some minor complains of the movie, it's that the plot progresses in predictable way and the action in darker scenes are murky. Fury is a straightforward ride into the center of war. It's a less flamboyant, certainly not romanticized, but a damn fine one."

","Ideals are peaceful, but history is always violent. And the history of humanity has been violent as hell. What is it in us that we fight over land, women and wealth? It is survival? Or is it the sense of power? These are some things I wonder about usually in a war movie. Fury was no different.<br/><br/>Fury, released in 2014 is about an US Army Sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) and his crew of 5 men. One of them is a rookie who was trained as a typewriter but was enlisted in the war. The story is about the last leg of the allies marching into Germany with Wardaddy and his Sherman tank called Fury. It shows the soft side of Wardaddy and his seasoned group of men and traverses how the kid, a typist, turns from his ideals to violence for survival.<br/><br/>Story - There are parts in the movie that give you the chills. Like the story Gordo narrates at the table of the German house and makes you wonder just how violent and disturbed men and women become during war.Wars wound you psychologically and those wounds probably never heal.It also shows little instance of normality like Norman thinks he can stay in touch with the young woman he met in Germany after the war. Something I am sure many men would have liked to hold on to. Shows a multitude of emotions - fear, wrath, cruelty, warmth, generosity and rage. Some of it is unbelievable like the climax where they show one tank battling an entire regiment. That is where Fury lost out for me.<br/><br/>Acting - I think the performances are stellar. Each of the main characters stands out in his own way. Brad Pitt as Wardaddy is a pleasant to watch. Pitt has been doing good movies and I think it is high time he wins an Oscar. Shia LeBeouf as Bible is serious and plays his part well too. Logan Lerman as Norman is the hero in the movie for me - as a rookie he portrays the disbelief and the innocence that young boys go into war with but come out as hardened men. The story shows how Wardaddy trains Norman to be someone who he is not.<br/><br/>Direction - David Ayer, known for Training Day and the first Fast & Furious has provided specifics that a lot of American movies do not show. Rape, cruelty and homicides were part of American troops as well - they are no different from other countries. Its how humans react in extreme situations - some adapt to survive and some cave in. But some of the scenes (especially the last sequence) were not really believable. But having said that the camaraderie that Ayer wanted to portray comes through really nicely.<br/><br/>Cinematography - I really liked the camera work. It looked real (maybe not as much as Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line). It wasn't shaky and the sound effects were great with almost real sets.<br/><br/>Special Mention - I really liked the dinner scene with Wardaddy, Norman and the two German women. It was at a completely different pace compared to the rest of the movie and I think it was supposed to build character. That's where you see the soft side of Pitt and how his crew has become what it has.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good one time watch but I wouldn't go back to it. One reason could be that though the performances were great, I didn't really connect with the characters as much. I would give it a B+.<br/><br/>Let me know what you thought of it."

","I could not get to the cinema to watch this so went out and got the DVD and sat in front of a wide-screen TV (for effect!). Damn, what a big come down.<br/><br/>The hype said it was the best ever WW2 movie since Ryan.. blah, blah, and I knew that the Director was getting as much authentic kit and equipment possible to make the film as 'real' as he could, so I was ready.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they obviously did not research WW2 Infantry and tank tactics at the same time. I thought.. this has potential, with the opening scenes showing a rear area of a battlefield. It looked good, fine detail etc.<br/><br/>Then the 'war' started a proper. Dug-in German anti-tank guns with surprise on their side, cammed up and just waiting for the yanks to enter the 'Killing ground' that they had set up! Wiped out by a few Sherman's with (WTF!) a long gaggle of infantry strung out behind. <br/><br/>The German infantry decided that the best place to be was in small holes in the ground in the middle of a field, rather than the perfect tree line behind them where the anti-tank boys were! Shame on the Director for allowing the execution of the unarmed German prisoner. Yes it did happen, but it was a rarity. The guy was not even SS. And to show the GI's watching and apparently enjoying it, turned my stomach. A stain on those brave men's honour.<br/><br/>MG in the basement... a normal German tactic which the GI's would have known about so would have been prepared for. There were also enough troops to go in and clear the place before the tanks moved in.<br/><br/>Tiger battle. The only good thing about this was the Tiger itself. This was the original Bovington 'Tiger from the tank museum, originally captured in North Africa. I have to admit, I did wet my pants a little watching this beast in action! Unfortunately it was crewed by half- wits and not an experienced Waffen-SS crew with a kill tally as long as my arm. Remember, these heavy tank battalions (which included Michael Wittmann, credited with the destruction of 138 tanks and 132 anti- tank guns), were the elite, often with experience on the Eastern front where the odds were always stacked against them. They were masters of their game. 4 Sherman's would have been a gun-cleaning session for them!<br/><br/>Firstly, they would have taken out the main threat, Old Braddy-boys Firefly, ending the film right there and then. Then, from their concealed position, they would have picked off the charging Sherman's one by one in the time it takes to count one-two-three! Tiger crew... back into the woods for a cup of coffee and some Yank rations for breakfast!<br/><br/>Oh no, Braddy boy was not having it! Let's get to the Tigers rear and waste him that way. He will oblige us by not turning his turret around and driving in a wide circle. Lord forbid that the Tiger driver slews the tank around (on a penny) and pops him first. On the Eastern front, the Germans were destroying 7-10 tanks for every one of theirs and were often outnumbered 10-20 to one in a fight. Enough said!<br/><br/>Final battle. Crossroads... key point... vital apparently?<br/><br/>One crippled Sherman verses a battalion of Waffen-SS. Sherman wastes hundreds of Germans before finally getting overrun. Hurrah for the yanks! Cr#p!<br/><br/>Waffen-SS see crossroads, send in recce to check it out. Rest of battalion move into defensive positions... because who knows, it might be a perfect ambush site? Sherman opens up, a few die. Bring in Panzerfausts (to the rear). Pop a couple in the rear and watch it brew up. Finish off Braddy-boy. March down road and clear up the cooks! Get wasted later by the Grenadier Guards (perhaps... tongue in cheek).<br/><br/>Instead... mass wave attacks (Russian front early war). Not a single Panzerschreck (German Bazooka) in site, no support weapons... no tactics, no blooming idea! Finally, and this really p'ssed me off. Waffen-SS man discovers Yank survivor under tank. ""That is all right,"" he says in very poor German accent, ""Zee Yanks have just wasted a lot of my mates and totally humiliated the Fatherland. I Vill let him live 'cos he is good egg. Have a nice day Amerikan. Ha, Betty Boop, Vat a dish.""<br/><br/>Or.. ""Gott in Himmel, a Godampt Yank!"", Grenade, second grenade or perhaps a flame-thrower?<br/><br/>Very disappointed, the whole film sucked. But, Bovingdon Tiger, yeah baby!"

It is harrowing. It is cleansing. It teaches that violence begets violence.

","Its April 1945, the war is almost over in Europe and the Allies are pushing into Germany. No one wants to die in the last few weeks of the war and such is the challenge facing the crew of the Sherman Firefly 'Fury' - When their assistant driver is killed, newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman, an actor clearly with a long career ahead of him) is assigned to a tank crew in what almost seems like a clerical error. His crew are veterans since Africa and unsympathetic to his nerves and fears. As the unit pushes into Germany to relieve various stranded units and capture a town he is forced into a baptism of fire he will not easily forget. <br/><br/>I went to see this film with my wife (Who hates war movies normally and I kind of tricked her into going) and a make up artist friend of mine and all three of us enjoyed it for different reasons. So hats off to the Director because my wife rarely enjoys a war movie, but she felt the film was good because it concentrated on the intimate relationship between the five men that is formed in such a small space and that is the focus of the movie. <br/><br/>It has many similarities to the movie 'Lebanon' (A film set inside and told entirely from the perspective of a crew of a tank in the Middle East) in many respects - and although this film isn't quite totally tank interior POV as that one was it captures the grime, the sweat and the oil of the confined space perfectly. <br/><br/>Writer / Director David Ayer has managed to present us with a environment that we have rarely seen before in a World War 2 movie. Despite the very English countryside being a bit of a giveaway to some of the location shooting, the Production Design here is top notch and for those into their history there is much to enjoy, not least of which is that this is the only movie in history to feature an original working Tiger tank, care of Bovington tank Museum. <br/><br/>The acting by the five leads is solid with Jon Berthanl being especially unpleasant as the tanks gunner. Say what you like about Shia LeBeouf being an oddball, but he clearly can act and that is all I care about when I go to see him on the screen, Micheal Pena and Brad Pitt come over as the Mother and the Father of the group, with Pitt's pragmatic Commander teaching some lessons to their latest recruit with brutal reality. He doesn't want his men to die, and therein at least lies the one fault in the movie.<br/><br/>Given a mission by local Commander (Jason Issacs rolling off his American Army Commander accent with ease) they find themselves alone having to defend a vital crossroads. Aware that the enemy are coming and may charge head long into a company of cooks and clerks down the road we're told they're all that is left to get in the way, but this doesn't really ring true. Its April 1945 and the Allies were superior everywhere and after the Battle of the Bulge Cooks and Clerks were well aware that occasionally they might have to pick up their rifles and could have done so here. But Brad Pitt's Don 'Wardaddy' Collier growls he is going to 'stay' and the rest of his men decide to remain, even though earlier he was very clear he wanted his men to survive the war. This was perhaps the only bit of the film that wasn't entirely convincing, but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie though the battle at the end began to border on the unrealistic after a Germans began missing a tank with Panzerfausts from a range of a few feet. <br/><br/>All in all this is a good solid film which is hard to fault. It presents a realistic depiction of war and shows things as they were. One scene where the G.I's capture a town and what can only be described as a consensual rape effectively happens will leave many people feeling uncomfortable but that is the reality of Germany in 1945, women weren't just raped by the Russians, but the Western Allied soldiers too, even if some of them were a little more polite about it. We might not like to talk about it, but it happened - In victory in war men do not always behave like gentleman and even the greenest of recruits can soon become a harden killer. <br/><br/>My wife said she enjoyed the movie because she felt as though she had experienced and lived in a tank after seeing it on the big screen (we saw it on an Imax) and yes, while the final confrontation was more for entertainment than for accuracy, this is a film I urge you to see none the less."

","I'm amazed at how Hollywod directors keep insulting the intelligence of movie-goers, by doing this kind of ww-2 movies and claiming to be realistic. Don't get me wrong, the scenery and props were top-notch, real shermans and tiger were used in the film, so it has a slick image and production. The acting is also decent, but here it all goes downhill.<br/><br/>The epic adventures of Brad Pitt begins in Germany, soon to surrender, ready to save the world. They quickly introduce a lot of characters that don't contribute to any of the already lacking plot and die just as fast.<br/><br/>Early on, they charge at some German PAK anti-tank guns, in a fight that you can pass as being plausible. Next, they clear a town where again, this time, the PAK crew misses from less than 200m and having the surprise advantage. Moving on...<br/><br/>Now we experience some boring scenes, just so that the characters develop a little emotion and morals, even the soft-hearted kid begins to obsess over killing Germans. <br/><br/>We soon get dragged into a tank battle that starts off promising, with 4 Shermans pitted against a Tiger. Looks like the Allies have slight advantage. Yet, again, for the sake of grief and suffering, we see some epic John Woo tank combat, 3 secondary Shermans take the fall and our heroes emerge victorious after missing about 3-4 shots each.(As a side note, Tiger's armor was all-round the same; 80mm).<br/><br/>Now it gets insulting. The last fight is basically a Call of Duty 2 mission made to movie, easy difficulty, Germans just swarm a disabled tank just to get crippled by heavy losses and retarded path-finding. This scene might be called ""so bad it's good"", in that it often produces laughter in the viewer. <br/><br/>tl;dr Watch if you want to see the greatest piece of WW2 action- movie ever."

Simply cause I have never seen him play lead in anything worth watching. I've seen movies where does a good job, by all means. But he was never the lead in those movies, he starred alongside actors bigger and better than him. <br/><br/>That's not the case her. This movie they have gathered a bunch of B/C grade actors (seriously. Who the H*ll, cast Shia LaBeouf in anything serious?? The guy played in transformers for Christ sake) But brad Pitt is suppose to carry this film on he's: I'm-a -larger-than-life- seen it-all-bad ass-war-veteran,with a thousand-yard stare look. The problem is,he's not believable, not even remotely <br/><br/>He's too baby faced, and don't really have what it takes to play those types of roles, which for me he proved pretty much in Inglorious bastard. He look like someone impersonating a war movie character. It gets stupefying when they portray the Sherman's as a super tank,that can go head to head with a tiger. It was a piece of sh*t casserole with a gun turret, and everybody knew it. <br/><br/>The Sherman was simply not created for Tank vs Tank fight. The Tigers would have turned them into pot stew in 5 minutes<br/><br/>I've seen interviews with the poor people who drove Shermans,were they stated that it was no match for the German Tigers. So when a Sherman takes up to 3 direct hits from a tiger at close range, and the shell just bounces off,then you start laughing. Its just too stupid and unbelievable. <br/><br/>It gets even more amusing when there's German artillery coming out of nowhere and manage to pulverize everything all around their position,but not one tank. Especially when they stand in a town square surrounded by buildings that get blown to pieces. I find it a bit amusing that they seem to have unlimited ammo. Cause whenever they face a sniper or an ambush by machine gun, they just load the main gun, and blow em away. <br/><br/>Every little problem they have, they just load up the main gun and blow it up. Though as other have stated its a truly gritty movie, the poor acting,the missing story line,and the gaping plot holes just destroys it. They don't use tactics, everything is just charge forward come what may,guns blazing etc. And the story line is none existent.

And what was the big show down at the end all about?Brad holding this big speech about holding the crossroad come hell or high water. It's a cross road in the middle of nowhere,and holds no strategic purpose whatsoever.

","I was hoping to to see a gritty war film along the same lines as Saving Private Ryan or the excellent TV series Band of Brothers, especially given the cast and the generous budget. I was sadly mistaken. This is just another one of those WWII films where a handful of heroic US soldiers take on and wipe out whole battalions of elite German troops in a totally unconvincing and ridiculous way. The action scenes are just not believable. Using a Sherman tank, not the best choice as they were known as a 'Ronsons' after the lighter, because they caught fire very easily, this sort of 'A' team' takes on hundreds of elite German troops. Their machine guns seem to have unlimited amounts of ammunition and the German troops having been surprised by the tank continue to run around like headless chickens for ages allowing themselves to be mown down by the score. There were many impossibilities and inaccuracies in the action scenes, but by golly it must have made the American audiences back home in the US puff out their chests and feel great! This film adds nothing to understanding WWII and it's horrors and I just don't understand why it was made at all other than to make shareholders a profit. Basically this sort of garbage should never have made it to the big screen or small screen for that matter, it should have been quietly left to rot in some dark corner or better still put on a spacecraft and blasted off into outer space where a million years from now some unfortunate alien might stumble upon it!"

"BeneCumb","6","81","170","15 December 2014"," Pathos and elation at the expense of logic and realism
","Panoramic war movies with the participation of famous actors have always caught great success and ticket income. No exception is Fury, where Brad Pitt for ""older"" generation and Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf for ""younger"" generation are definitely the names to attract audience. And yes, they do great in this movie, pity that LaBeouf's character was not so elaborated and spent limited time on screen. All three have successfully diverged from plain ""nice-guys-with-cute-faces"" roles and have (Pitt, LaBeouf) or attempting to (Lerman) participate in something more versatile and dramatic.<br/><br/>Fury has firm expectations for this, but unfortunately the script has focused on action and battling rather than smooth logic of events. Clichéd characters and unrealistic events and solutions prevail too much, and feeling of time and space is impaired on several occasions (the time-frame between Lerman's character detecting German soldiers and first shots from their tank is especially odd). Moreover, the ending is trivial as well.<br/><br/>Thus, 8 points for acting and 4 for the plot from me, but if this movie has made the younger people pondering on and over the essence of war, then it has gained its end. Anyhow, there are too many movies focusing on visual effects and reasoning out there."

","Fury has one of those ""the only good morality in wartime is no morality"" themes. I admired the sound effects in the battle scenes. They'll probably win an award for those. But I hated the script and the dialog and gave up on it altogether after about 40 minutes. It lacks class. It is in many ways the opposite of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, which were about redemption through suffering and sacrifice under extreme duress. Fury was about degeneracy becoming the new righteousness. Ugly, and maybe even downright revisionist and historically inaccurate. Almost like a pornographic comic book version of history designed to appeal to adolescent boys raised on Game of Thrones episodes and Grand Theft Auto video games. As somome who actually spent a couple of years as a cavalry scout in the army, I can also say that the battle scenes lacked authenticity. Particularly in the amateurish way the troops talked to each other and moved during combat. Again, much more like a dumbed down and superficial comic book or a video game than something trying to simulate historical reality."

Brad Pitt did a good job playing a leader who has to make decisions that will not please everyone. I was not into Logan Lermans acting that much and there was something about him I disliked.

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","41","82","22 October 2014"," It's a film disturbingly unconcerned by psychology or battle scars but celebrating how many kills a single tank crew can score for their country
","Set in the final year of the Second World War, Fury is the story of how a young man enters combat and becomes a killing machine. How the film and its director David Ayer feel about the premise is ideologically confused and contradictory. On one hand the film is a brutal representation of the final tank battles of the war and how merciless the Allies were to Germans and their prisoners as a way of saving their own hides. Yet the film's fascist politics are exemplified by showing how young men become accepted into the brainless, macho brotherhood of their peers once they are capable of murdering enemies without hesitation. Some will dismiss the film as a silly boy's club adventure, but this does little to dispel the unsavouriness. Fury's timing is as misjudged as it is deliberate. In an era of contemporary global warfare, it's a film disturbingly unconcerned by psychology or battle scars but celebrating how many kills a single tank crew can score for their country. <br/><br/>Fury doesn't have a plot but is a road trip, compromised of a series of battles and the occasional pit stop for male bonding. Brad Pitt stars as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier"" the leader of a five man Sherman tank vehicle named ""Fury"". Wardaddy believes in the kill or be killed rules of war. In a troubling early scene, he physically forces Norman (Logan Lerman) to shoot a captured German soldier in the back with a revolver. Norman is the young rookie who is our only emotional entry point into the crew. He has only been in the war for eight weeks as a typist and has not see combat before being inserted into the crew. He cries and says he would rather die himself than to shoot a prisoner. The early scenes allow Logan Lerman's performance to standout by emoting Norman's fear and passivity. However, the character's inexperience is highly contrived, predictably segueing him from a rookie and into a raging machine gunner, mowing down Germans as he screams at them.<br/><br/>The other characters in Ayer's own original script are lazy stereotypes. Shia LaBeouf is Boyd ""Bible"" Swan who, would you know it, quotes passages from the Bible. Michael Pena from Ayer's last film End of Watch, which was about the friendship between two police officers, features as Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia but his role makes little use of his charisma. The most unlikable part is reserved for Jon Bernthal as Grady, a knuckle-dragging brute, who might have been too unpleasant for the Dirty Dozen. There is almost no backstory, aside from the original tank crew being together since Africa and their dialogue is primarily inane, blokey conversations, compromised of homophobic slurs and primitive views of women. Some of this material is inaudible due to the slurred, mumbling line deliveries. <br/><br/>One unexpected detour in the film is a long sequence where Wardaddy takes Norman aside and into a home with two German women. As Wardaddy takes off his equipment, we fear the worst. But the scene shows an unexpected side to his character. He encourages Norman and the two women to share a meal together. The other members of the tank crew enter, behaving like barbarians. They complain they weren't invited and upset the youngest women by making her cry, until Wardaddy pulls them into line. It's a strange scene for a number of reasons: it's one of the few moments of mercy and while we appreciate seeing a new side to Wardaddy it makes little sense how someone so dogmatic about serving the company would risk dividing his team by helping Norman. Maybe war makes people act in funny ways or Wardaddy has spent too long in the tank. <br/><br/>While his script is disappointing, Ayer hasn't wasted the eighty million dollar budget. The production values, including the filthy, grimy look and diluted grey tones, are of a high standard. The scenes are very well populated with plenty of extras including wounded soldiers, prisoners and other tanks, which are important details because it means Fury's crew isn't the only tank group fighting in the war. But the realism is undermined in the last battle where Fury alone must withstand a huge swarm of Nazi troops, too stupid to immediately use anti-tank weapons. The corn in this sequence, compromised of bromancing and personal sacrifice, is a lame retread of war movie conventions and lacks further power since it's difficult to care for these generic characters. The battle itself, with an implausible body count, will appeal to Michael Bay enthusiasts and teenagers who think video games like Call of Duty resemble real world politics.<br/><br/>The film's ending further typifies the film's indecisive political viewpoint. A moment of compassion between two soldiers is immediately undone by a final high angle shot, which shows a single tank and the masses of bodies it has laid waste upon. War films aren't an untouchable genre today but when the budget and the talent are this big a filmmaker should sustain a clear ideological viewpoint. At a time when real war affects so many people's lives, wouldn't a genuine act of courage today be if a Hollywood director could be forthright about how they feel about warfare and give the audience something to dwell over once the movie has emptied its barrels?"
"scottmackenzie01","5","40","80","20 October 2014"," Let down by battle scenes
","I felt the film was strong in some parts and week in others, the acting was superb and the core story of the tank crew and how they interacted and reacted on their journey was terrific and felt realistic, where the film failed for me was in the battle scenes, many of the scenes were a bit like watching a game of battleships, an example is a field scene when the Germans open fire with some machine gun fire, the Americans then return fire, this goes on until the machine guns are taken out, then the Germans open fire with an anti-tank gun, the same thing goes on until that is taken out, then the Germans open fire with another anti- tank gun, again the same thing. The final battle scene which should have been the most exciting and terrifying part of the film was the most disappointing, Germans just running about in front of an immobilised tank getting mowed down by its machine guns. Brad Pitts character spends an amazing amount of time on the outside of the tank which is surrounded by hundreds of Germans before a German sniper eventually gets him, two grenades are dropped into the tank and yet when the remaining crew member crawls back into the tank the rest of the dead crew look remarkably intact. Even the Tiger tank scene failed to raise the excitement levels as it was all too predictable as to what the final outcome of the scene was going to be, another fail was whenever someone was injured or died there was a silence as if the Germans decided to stop fighting to let the Americans come to terms with their latest causality. Fury made me recall the battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan because they were done so much better in that film, the scene with the Tiger tank gave me flashbacks to Kelly's Heroes again another film that done it so much better. Part of the problem is our expectations are raised at the beginning of the film as the opening credits state that the Allies encountered ferocious resistance in the end days of the war, what we end up seeing is the Germans being military naive and suicidal. The core story is good, the film is gritty and brutal but in the end what should have been the films strongest card the battle scenes, let it down."

","Do you like Walt Disney, but also violence? Do you love all the anecdotes that you hear on History Channel and want them to see in the movie? Do love all the cliché not smart bad guys ala James Bond. Read no further this movie is for you! <br/><br/>But if you don't recognise yourself with it? Please do read. I start with some good points. At first the soldiers do look human and movie is raw, it has also(Imo) a good scene when the two main characters visit two German ladies in the village. But But, the things are going downhill from the moment that they meet the Tiger tank. If would expect that the veteran US tanker would have grown some steel and know some tactical grammar and their machines. But no! They first make a smoke curtain, but they just back off and loose the surprise momentum. Yes, even the toughest soldier would have some second thoughts if he is confronted with something superior that his machine. But hey. Every German tank (Pz IV, Panther) is dangerous. Not only the Tiger. Cliché number one: Every Sherman crew did and did his pants when confronted with the Tiger. Than they change their mind, and instead of fleeing attacking the Tiger. Cliché number two. Every, Sherman could penetrate only the rear of Tiger tank. US army knew by April 1945 that late models of the Shermans(the E8 for example) could easily penetrate the side armour of the Tiger, even with the standard Ap, the Apcr or other more potent Ap round, could even penetrated the front of the Tiger form 100 meter!!! But no! Lest show them the cliché. That the horror the horror. The last scene. Lest start with act one. When the boy sees the Germans, well not just the Germans, but the German! I see about 12-20 Rpgs. They soldier are carrying them on their shoulders. Remember this! After that another mind boggling thing happens. Well a lot of them. The action is not even started. Sergeant Major must make a choice, make a heroic stand (because well duty) or retread. He chooses the first one. He let the tank look like it is knocked out and crew is dead. Because he wants the German get closer and engage them first before they engage them. Clever. The German comes near, and they also have a choice. To just ignore it and walk past(it happened). Because the officer and his men already sow a lot of the dead Shermans, they just ignore them. Or the officer is always on his guard and wants to be sure. Than he has two choices (maybe more but I see only two reasonable once). Get down and let couple of men through hand grenades. Without completely open the hatches and stick their head in, only to be shot. Or(or and) spread out, surround the tank, let 6 or 8 man aim with Panzerfaust at it. And one soldier will check it out. If he get a head shot. The Panzerfaust men would shoot and boom. Goodbye tank. But no. He is not so smart, and so are his troops. Cliché number three. The commander of the tank had only one choice at that moment. Before the engagement load all the ammo. And load He, not Ap. At shoot them when they are far(but not close enough to have good shot) with everything. He's, 50 cal, everything. In one minute half column would be shot to pieces. No he let them get closer. So infantry is now a real threat. nice So, things happening because, well, script. But what, wait, were are the Rpgs? Why are the German just blindly running up the tank? Why are they unpacking the Rpgs (4 boxes with 3 Rpgs each). And they only use three? Why is everybody shooting and thus giving away their position? Why is nobody shooting in the back of the Sergeant Major standing outside the tank? Why do you need a f sniper?"

Let me put it another way. This film is as bad as it gets - from the detestable characterisation through to the absurd, simplistic story line - and beyond. It is an insult to your intelligence, to German women and to the memory of some very brave Germans (including children) who died defending their homeland in the final months of WW2.<br/><br/>When confronted by the murdering, psychopathic sergeant ""Wardaddy"" and his band of low life degenerates (excluding the obligatory, sensitive mommy's boy), you feel like climbing in there and giving the Germans a hand. I mean, what manner of sorry, disturbed, self-absorbed prick would call himself ""wardaddy"" anyway? Oh yes, that's right, he's from the US.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I kept watching the movie in the hope that some very accommodating German would put us all out of our misery by taking out ""wardaddy"", his pig ignorant crew (excluding the obligatory, sensitive mommy's boy) and his whole damned Sherman tank. Of course we're made to withstand an eternity of driveling dialog until the great climactic moment at the crossroads - which is farcical to the point of comical.<br/><br/>I really can't understand how anybody can score this film higher than 1.

"ZChrisJ1995","8","33","65","28 October 2014"," A perfectly competent war film, bolstered by impressive performances and fierce action set-pieces
","While nowhere near as good as it obvious influences, such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Fury' is still an effective and competent entry in the war genre, aided by its talented cast and intense, harrowing battle sequences.<br/><br/>'Fury' follows the five-man crew of the titular tank as they travel across Nazi Germany during the later days of WWII, focusing on the atrocities they encounter, and sometimes generate themselves. <br/><br/>Though the performances of all five primary actors are great, the two that stood out for me were Logan Lerman as Norman, who gradually evolves from an inexperienced typist to a battle-hardened warrior, and Joe Bernthal as Grady, a brutish, ill-tempered loader who constantly mumbles. Brad Pitt does his usual leading man gig without difficulty, and Shia LaBeouf and Michael Peña aren't given enough screen time, but work well with what they're given. <br/><br/>The film's numerous set pieces are brilliantly choreographed and stylised but claustrophobic and intense at the same time. The scenes in which Fury's crew take on a German Tiger, as well as its stand against 300 Nazi soldiers, are some of the most effective I've seen in recent years. <br/><br/>Like many of its forebears, 'Fury' strives the capture the insanity and chaos of war, not only that created by the 'enemy in the distance' but also by Allied fighters. Just as Nazi soldiers are displayed gunning down civilians, in several scenes Fury's crew harasses German citizens and coldly executes captured unarmed soldiers. In contrast, there are other scenes where not only Fury's crew, but also German soldiers, are seen acting selflessly. The message would appear to be that war can bring out both the worst and the best in people, regardless of their affiliation. <br/><br/>Sure, it doesn't have as much emotional impact as say 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon' in this revisionist, attemptedly unbiased approach, but 'Fury' still manages to be a hard-hitting, perfectly acceptable modern war film that doesn't shy away from portraying its protagonists in a morally ambiguous light."

","I should start this review by stating that I have read a lot of WWII military history which sets the tone here. The look of Fury was excellent and the special effects in the battle scenes were mind blowing. However, they just aren't realistic and seemed to revert back to films of the 60's and 70's where soldiers charge around without any regard to their own safety or how to deal with threats to their life. David Ayer should probably have watched Band of Brothers, Pacific and Letters from Iwo Jima before making this film. On top of that I felt the story lacked any real substance and the viewer never really engages with the characters, which made their nonsensical self-sacrifice at the end of the film all the more baffling. All in all a very disappointing film for one that showed so much promise."

I spent most of the film hoping they would all come to a gory end.<br/><br/>The final scene, much commented upon before, was a travesty of stupidity, and continued the contention,well-established in so many post-war films, that German soldiers were useless. These ones certainly were, but then they did not write the moronic script, did they? It has all been said before, but crack SS troops, even at the end of the war, would not be as stupid as to attack a stricken tank from the front; although it has to be said that the final shot shows German bodies splayed out front, sides and back, so perhaps Fury had deployed some hidden weaponry, which we were not to know about.<br/><br/>The denouement reminded me of that other great leap of the imagination, the final scene of ""Gauntlet"", hardly Clint Eastwood's finest hour, in which hundreds of Policeman, armed to the teeth, stand either side of a flimsy bus and pour torrents of bullets into it. Apparently, film bullets do not ever miss their target, nor indeed penetrate through a glass windowed bus to emerge the other side.<br/><br/>That was tosh, and so was this.<br/><br/>With different lead actors, a different script, better direction and just a little proper research and common-sense, this could have been a good film; but even then I doubt it."

The rest of us in the room agreed with him wholeheartedly and in fact, some of us had voted to stop it before then but he kept hoping it would get better.<br/><br/>I remember the exact moment he, and the rest of us gave up on it; the scene were they're eating a meal with the German women in their apartment and acting like knuckle dragging Neanderthals, My Uncle told us, almost in tears, that no one he ever saw in the service acted like that toward Germans or anyone else, they never executed prisoners in cold blood, not that he ever saw although he admitted it may have happened he knew it wasn't common. Overall they were just trying to do their jobs, stay alive, and come out of the war alive with their sanity, their humanity and their minds intact. This movie disturbed him, and the few service friends he has left, greatly and I'm sorry he ever saw it.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much going into this movie to begin with because Brad Pitt is a terrible actor and overall, his movies aren't that good.

I read some positive reviews four and five times...while the negative ones seemed to only appear once. I wonder what is happening there?<br/><br/>It's just a shame that a clueless dolt like Brad Pitt and everyone else involved, got the green light to dis-respect WWII soldiers with this project, I wouldn't expect him to understand that, I doubt he has the sense god gave a donut and Hollywood is generally anti-military, and at times anti-American anyway, but somewhere along the way someone should have realized that this piece of drek was an insult to the men and women who served, and those who died, in World War II."

","A typical American war movie. Great production value, great effects and visuals, pretty to look at. The story however is rather dull and often not credible. What makes the film just bad is the often seen, stupid-as-bread behavior of the German soldiers. They all seem to suffer from the stormtrooper-syndrome, being unable to hit anything and charge into enemy fire while trying to attack tanks with their bear hands and small arms up close, just to get mowed down like lemmings. Laughable. Fury also features what must be the kindest rape scene in the history of movies. If the director decides to include a brutal face of war like that (and I think it's definitely good to do that) it has to be done in a credible way. But the way it turns out in Fury it's more that Emma is just a cheap slut who, silly enough, falls in love with the soldier after just a few minutes.<br/><br/>The climax of silliness is of course the final scene, where the heroic soldiers die their heroic deaths as expected, while taking out a whole battalion of aggressively shouting SS-Lemmings.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a proper war movie set in the second world war, watch ""Das Boot"" or ""Stalingrad"", if you want cheap entertainment without surprises, watch Fury."

","Fury strives to depict the true nature of war. There isn't much of a plot to discuss, neither any historical events worthy to mention within its World War II setting. It simply just pictures the job works: violence is scary, war changes people, and their journey could be a lot dreary than exciting. Director David Ayer is perfect when it comes to this strategy; this bleak, unfeeling atmosphere alone makes it quite compelling for its themes. But it also moves a little backwards when it starts featuring the main action. Though the precision stays faithful, the loudness and spectacle rob the focus of its more ugly view at war. In the end, Fury still deserves credit for both elements, even if they don't seem to fit appropriately for the central message.<br/><br/>As said, it is not about the plot. We're basically just watching what soldiers experience in the field or inside the tank. There is no historical background needed to explore other than the fact that this is WWII. Another story here is about a recruit, whose only skill in the job is typewriting, forced to kill no matter how old or desperate the enemy is. His point of view is meant to portray a soldier's growth into the battlefield; we first encounter him known for his incompetence towards violence, and then slowly subsides his sensitivity and starting to gain the same attitude of his crew. Not only towards humanity it tries to examine, even the war itself may not be easy nor adventurous after all. Traveling through places, although getting attacked in unexpected minute and discovering bodies around the road, can be boring, which suddenly makes the crew bond every once in a while. Not everyone at the enemy side are bad, neither everyone in their side are nice. The film succeeds at breaking the misinterpretation of the context of war, giving awareness to what people actually struggle in this conflict.<br/><br/>Once we get to the action, the tank battles are impressively constructed with consistency at showing each of the soldier's duty beneath their tank. There is suspense, violence driven in every set piece. The only setback in these sequences is how it tries to build some bombast at the explosions. No matter what, it's always going to be loud and there will always be lights flashing (especially when they have tracers,) but during the fighting, it suddenly becomes one sided, no longer feels for their enemy, unlike the complexity at the smaller scenes. The characters also don't get the development they deserve, they do have some intriguing backstory, but still remains being in one note. Thankfully, the cast helps adding some depth in them.<br/><br/>Fury is solid enough, but the anti-war element can be a little unsatisfying. It portrays the horrors of war by heart and soul, and yet finds glory at the actual battles. The action could have suited better if the movie's only intention is to be accurate in a military work, but it come into question when it also have this strong sober perspective to human violence. The climax as well feels it like it belongs to a movie built for blockbuster filmmaking. But the thing is, none of them are actually bad; it effectively pictures what kind of hell war is and the action is terrifically directed. It's just that both aspects tell a different opinion. In spite of that, it's still one of the most absorbing films you'll see in a while, with excellent production and filmmaking. These are the qualities that endures the value of Fury overall, also witnessing real military routine, firearm, dirt and battles already makes it quite interesting."

","I watched the movie after I saw it has 7.8 stars. So I expected it will come close to Saving Private Ryan. Well, it didn't. (may be considered spoilers) There is just some decent acting, but this could not save the movie from the missing plot, abundant clichés and terrible and awkward final fighting scene. The movie begins by saying that the German tanks were superior to the American ones, and thus US tank units suffered high losses. You would expect some tank battles in the movie, right? Wrong! It is April 1945, not so many German tanks to resist the American advance. Actually, only one German tank features in the movie. Truth be told, the battle with the German tank (Tiger or PIV) was somewhat realistic, assuming that the German tank crew was not experienced. A lot of strange things in the final fighting scene: First, the Germans are in a war zone, but they are marching in a column, singing, like they are on Unter den Linden in 1939. Then, the tank crew had plenty of time to prepare the ambush, chat and drink in the tank. But they left part of the ammo outside. The fight starts in daytime and in a matter of minutes it's dark. The German soldiers keep running to the bullets, frontally charging against the machine guns. Yeah, Schwarzenegger would have been a better choice than Brad Pitt in this scene. Concluding: if you are in the mood for a war movie, skip Fury and chose between watching again Saving Private Ryan, some episodes from Band of Brothers, Full Metal Jacket, Black Hawk Down ..."

There's the hick, the Mexican (???), the beta-male new guy Percy Jackson, Shia LaBarf trying to be southern, and a total rip off of Lt. Aldo Raine from Inglorious Basterds played by the one and only Brad Pitt whose haircut on the movie poster drew in so many viewers. I'm sure there was a small surge of patrons at barbers and salons who wanted ""the fury"" haircut. <br/><br/>All I wanted after that movie was that hour and a half of my life back. <br/><br/>From the beginning, the audience is presented with Brad's character who we know has had a troubled past and has suffered devastating losses in the war based on his facial expressions and grease covered hands and nose... spoiler... nobody really gives a f***. All of the asides and diatribes of the characters are so so so bad that they actually made me wish the Germans had won the war. The writing, acting and editing are sub par to say the least. <br/><br/>Honestly, you should just watch it for a serious laugh because it is truly hilarious to think that the people who made this movie quite possibly thought that they made a film that would undoubtedly touch the hearts of its viewers and show the grimness and despair of a WWII tank crew... I laughed just typing that. <br/><br/>No joke, one of the death scenes of one of the characters is priceless - it made me spit my drink out of laughter and joy."

Unfortunately it turned out to be just another Action Movie whose only historic background is that the war in which it plays actually happened, also not following real world physics.<br/><br/>It is flooded with errors in physics and history in detail and the big picture, sometimes contradicting itself within the movie. The plot is filled with clichés, to me it seemed like the script was ready and then somebody brought a list of things that have to be added to give the movie a (fake) impression of high moral and were squeezed in.

","My title is how I imagine the brainstorming session by the production team of this movie was kicked off. The writers of the movie have made the error of forgetting that Inglorious Basterds wasn't actually supposed to be taken seriously. The movie takes itself so seriously it is actually offensive. It is the film equivalent of the 'Commando' graphic novels of the 1960's My fear is that as time goes by, subsequent generations might see films like this and think that it represents some form of factual representation. The one thing that I find really tiresome about this and numerous other films of the past 10 years and television series such as 'Band of Brothers' is the assertion that the treatment of the Jews during the war and the other horrific actions of the SS was somehow common knowledge to the troops invading Europe. It wasn't, it barely was known to the public even years afterwards, so stop using it as an excuse for characters to commit fictional war crimes in retribution. <br/><br/>I won't get bogged down in the dozens of other historical inaccuracies, historically revisionist statements and attitudes of the characters and pure idiocy of the plot and just say that films like this take us back to the bad old days of the post war vainglorious posturing where the only good German is a dead German.<br/><br/>Avoid this and hope they don't make any more."

","Starting well, if slowly, and not very coherently, the look and development is quite good, though much in the wake of Private Ryan, all those years ago.<br/><br/>The narrative does the old trick of the new recruit and his immersion in war. The tank crew, tight and loyal, are all there to instill what is required to the new dude. It's not a new presentation; it's not bad and looks very good and the early battle scenes are realistic, in tension and dramatic flow.<br/><br/>And then it fails. There is the final cataclysmic battle. Films like this can only go in two ways: either everyone lives or no one does. If no one does they are heroes and that's the formula here. What is quite repulsive is the length of the final battle scene which has an immobilized tank and its crew outwitting hundreds of enemy troops. It turns into mass slaughter as if this is what what heroism is all about but it also deceives the viewer - as all those 1950s and '60s movies did with German soldiers running into a hail of bullets as target practice for the smart US/Allied soldiers.<br/><br/>It defies sense, and also the historical record as to how the German troops were led at this time, in their capacity to improvisation and battle tactics, which makes this final scene so completely sickening as a violent fantasy; it undermines the ideal of heroism and how battles are fought in real wars. It plays to the juvenile male spectator who is accustomed to the thrills of software games, not actual battles.<br/><br/>In all, it's a Hollywood fraud, worse so because it starts well and with the virtues expected of the material, but leans to the cheap and moronic, and as such, deserves nothing but contempt."

"Leofwine_draca","7","13","23","21 May 2016"," Gruelling tank action in this war epic
","David Ayer is an up-and-down director for me. For every film of his I love (STREET KINGS, SABOTAGE) there seems to be one I equally hate (END OF WATCH). Thankfully, FURY is at the top end of his scale, a straightforward war epic centred around the crew of a single tank as they trundle through the German countryside and encounter Nazis at every turn.<br/><br/>This is a war film as it should be: gruelling, violent, and dehumanising. The attention to detail is remarkable and the action scenes are expertly staged, as you'd expect from the experienced Ayer; you really feel like you're on the ground with these soldiers and taking part in the combat. The first tank assault is my favourite scene, as it's an example of blistering, never-seen-before action, although the extended powerhouse climax is almost as good.<br/><br/>Yes, the story is predictable and the clear-cut characters a little too simplistic. But Ayer counters this by incorporating interesting actors into the tale. A weary Brad Pitt plays virtually the same character as he did in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and is fine for it, while Shia LaBeouf gets to play a character support role for a change. Jon Bernthal (THE WALKING DEAD) remains a scene-stealer, and Logan Lerman shows a little more experience in his acting than in previous years. FURY is a dark and depressing film, but the vibrancy of the cinematography and all-out action makes it one to watch."

"bryank-04844","8","12","21","12 August 2015"," 'Fury' is an ultra-violent and bloody war film and is a solid entry into the WWII genre, however it almost imploded on itself at the end, leaving a bitter taste.
","When Brad Pitt signs up to kill Nazis in a WWII movie, you say, ""YES"". This particular movie is called 'Fury', and is a solid, very good war film. It's brutal, violent, raw, and has enough of a fresh feel to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire 134-minute runtime. Instead of being out in the open, walking the fields of France or another nazi occupied country, 'Fury' takes place mostly inside a small steel tank with five guys led by 'Wardaddy' (Pitt), during the final month of WWII. The claustrophobia sets in quickly and gives us an ample amount of time to dig deep into each soldier inside the tank.<br/><br/>Writer-director David Ayer is known for his cop drama films, ('End of Watch', 'Sabotage', 'Street Kings', and 'Training Day') to name a few. And he pulls from his past work to take on the fierceness of this merciless story of a squad of U.S. tanks, winning the war against the Germans. It's a story you won't soon forget, yet in the final moments of the film, Ayer pulls a stunt that almost ruins everything that came before it. Despite that horrible aspect, 'Fury' is quite good.<br/><br/>Wardaddy is a tank commander with the 2nd Armored Division who has been around for quite a few wars. He's a seasoned soldier, rough, tough, and has seen it all. However, there is something deeper inside him going on that shows us there's more to him than just being a nazi killing machine like we saw in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'. But his sheer barbaric ways show when he initiates a newcomer named Norman (Logan Lerman), a young kid who is a trained typist for the army, who is literally thrown into Wardaddy's tank as an assistant driver, even though Norman has never seen the inside of a tank. Wardaddy forces Norman to shoot a captured S.S. Officer point blank in the head, and that will be the first of many things Norman is forced to do over the course of this movie.<br/><br/>The other soldiers inside 'Fury', which is painted on the tank's gun barrel are Boyd (Shia LaBeouf), a rough solider who is also super religious, Trini (Michael Pena), the driver with a drinking problem, and Grady (Jon Bernthal), the aggressive red neck jerk of the highest level. These seem like stereotypes, but I can assure you, Ayer has written them with a good amount of depth, particularly LaBeouf's character who hasn't been this good in anything for many years. As the war is coming to a quick end and as the Nazis are still fighting to their last breath, the Americans are taking town by town, usually led by Wardaddy's tank unit.<br/><br/>After the successful take over of a nazi occupied town, there is a moment for some down time where Wardaddy takes Norman under his wing and up to an apartment where a mother (Anamaria Marinca) and her teenage daughter (Alicia von Rittberg) come face to face with the two U.S. soldiers. They are terrified at first, but Wardaddy puts them at ease, and the women end up making a meal and drinks for the two soldiers. This might be the best scene in the film as we get a small glimpse at someone who has been through hell and seen such horrible atrocities, still trying to have a normal life of routine and genuine pleasantries. But war is terrible, and this nice situation doesn't last long as the rest of Wardaddy's crew heads up to the apartment and ruins this seemingly nice setting. It's not their fault really, but it's rather what the war and the stuff they had to do to survive and win has done to them, turning them into animals.<br/><br/>The climactic scene doesn't seem to make any sense as the Captain of the unit tells Wardaddy and a few other tanks go on a big mission to stop a treasure trove of Nazis that are headed to a certain location. Even though the war is quickly coming to an end, and this mission doesn't seem to have much of a reason, it's unclear why the captain would send these great soldiers on what seems like a suicide mission. And this we are in the steel tank again as our soldiers fight a never-ending stream of nazi soldiers. But again, Ayer pulls this wild card out of his back pocket, that completely negates anything that came before it, and almost destroys his own film.<br/><br/>Pitt is great in his role and gives a few layers of depth to his brute soldier character. Lerman ('The Perks of Being a Wallflower') plays the newbie who is forced to hold a gun and kill any German soldier he faces very nicely. And the rest of the crew turn in amazing performances as well. The set pieces, uniforms, and tanks all add to the realistic setting of 1945 Germany. And Ayer's direction keeps you on edge, particularly during one of the tank battle sequences. 'Fury' is an ultra-violent and bloody war film and is a solid entry into the WWII genre, however it almost imploded on itself at the end, leaving a bitter taste."

","Once in awhile one sees a movie where you want to tell Hollywood that all of the people involved, the director, the writers, the actors, the producers... everyone... needs a time out from making movies for like 5 or 10 years because what you just saw was atrocious. Fury is worse than that. Do not ever allow David Ayer to make a movie again. This flick is an insult to the senses, the sensibilities, the everything. What character development? What plot? What... aw, I could go on but why? As someone else said, what's the point? This easily had to be the worse war movie I have ever laid eyes on. I ended up skipping ahead on the remote control, it was that bad. One of the worst insult to the senses were the scenes with the women. Absolutely pointless. Scripts, scenes, lines, are intended to advance the story. It was an absolute black hole of uselessness. Those scenes with women were not only useless, they were reviling. Yeah yea, the fog of war, high emotions, youth (tho these ""commercial actors"" were in their 30s and 40s when tankers in WWII were fer crissakes, 20s) not only were 100% of the men offensive, the scenes served absolutely zero purpose in creating advancement of, oh right, what story. In terms of character development, Pitt was a empty can of nothing. Why in bloody hell was the direction to just sit there like nothing is going on? I found these scenes to be vacuous and insulting. Created not a scintilla of emotional attachment to any of the characters. I could wax on with analysis about those scenes but, why. They were an insult to... there were an insult. The fighting scene at the end has been examined ad naseum... also an insult to everything a thinking, person, aware person would know. Pauses from githing for emotional responses. Completely opposite of the rest of the movie. I cannot express enough how I found this movie revolting. What lingers in my mind were seeing seeing previews where the ""commercial actors"", and I use that term derisively as there are actors, then there are commerical actors which are a dime a dozen of which this is the latter... but remember the promos where these people were going on about how proud they were to get thumbs up from real tankers from WWII. I have news for you commercial actor kiddies... these men were likely thrilled to be recognized by Hollywood. This movie is pure and simple crap. Red Tails was a bad movie. This exceeds that movie by magnitudes. An insult to moviegoers, to WWI vets, to vets everywhere, to what the hell.. to the Waffen SS. Do not give any money to the director for any more way efforts. Do NOT do it. I have not been this reviled by a movie in a long, long time. This one did it."

Never mind tracer, the guns appear to be firing laser bolts. Pew-pew-pew. Ami grenades explode handily on impact, Kraut potato mashers with their 5 second fuse just sit there patiently waiting and waiting for tedious dragged-out scenes to play out.

","I already quit watching the movie after seeing the lousy performance of those two 7,5cm PAK 40 AT guns, which would had ripped all four Shermans to shreds in seconds at that distance. No, the MG42 nest had to fire first (can't imagine why), and all four Shermans drove in a row towards the AT gun nest, surviving without a scratch. Yeah, sure! Normally those AT guns would had got the initiative, plus with an averagely capable crew firing 15 rounds per minute, meaning a 4 seconds reload time for each shell.<br/><br/>I later saw the Tiger battle on youtube. No better with the Tiger driving towards the Shermans instead of just remaining in place to maintain accuracy and distance.<br/><br/>Would be nice if American's would factor in some true issues the German military had, which wasn't stupid soldiers, but low resources (ammunition and fuel; the Germans even had their ammunition nummarised within each tank, AT gun or artillery piece due to those shortages), while allied forces had air superiority and sufficient ammunition to even constantly bombard and crossroad or important supply route 24/7 with artillery. That WG involvement (counselling?) obviously didn't help much.<br/><br/>That movie just is another proof that aside from Clint Eastwood Americans should probably can't and shouldn't do war movies. Also when looking at 1917, or perhaps Dunkirk the British seem to be better at that. David Ayer clearly achieved nothing here."

"CANpatbuck3664","9","7","11","3 July 2016"," Fury is Dark and Unforgiving but it Shows How Terrible War Really is
","I was so excited when Fury came out. I loved End of Watch (I still do, I re-visit it often) and seeing a gritty war movie with actors like Brad Pitt, Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena seemed like it was right up my alley. With Suicide Squad (David Ayer's new project) coming up, I decided to watch it again. I think this movie has a lot to offer, it does give an absolutely grimy look at World War 2 combat showing the evils of both sides but it has its flaws too and while I think it's easily one of the better war movies to have been made lately, it falls short of the very best of the genre (Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List just to name a couple).<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start Fury on a deserted battlefield in Germany. The battle has already ended, the soldiers and the machines of war that remain are lifeless. The year is 1945, the tide of the war has already turned but the Nazi resistance has yet to stop. If anything it has gotten more fanatical for some and that much more desperate. A lone German rider trots across the field, surveying the damage, perhaps looking for survivors. He comes across what looks like an abandoned tank when something leaps from the shadows. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) tackles the rider and stabs him right through the eye. He lets the horse go and returns to the tank. The tank has merely broken down and his crew is trying to fix it. His crew consists of Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal), Bible Swan (Shia LaBouef) and Gordo (Michael Pena). There was another member of the crew but his remains will need to be scraped out of the tank when they get back to camp. After Wardaddy wails on Coon-Ass to get it started, the tank roars back to life and they head back to camp.<br/><br/>You don't see too many movies about tank crews and one of the best things about Fury is that it's determined to show something different when it comes to WW2 movies. Every war movie shows you combat tactics and the civilian casualties but Fury really dives down into how appalling things got. The remains of soldiers get literally hosed out of tanks, food is traded for sexual services and child soldiers are forcibly recruited and murdered. It's really unpleasant to watch at times, there's a scene where Wardaddy and Norman (Logan Lerman) try to play house with a couple of German girls and it goes terribly. A lot of people complain about that scene and while it is disturbing and uncomfortable, I think it was important for the development of Norman's character and it's so tense you can't look away. We've seen a lot of movies about WW2 and it's a credit to Ayer and his crew for finding a different way to show how things really were.<br/><br/>There's a pretty good cast here and while this probably isn't the type of movie that gets people nominated for Oscars, they all perform well. Although this is Norman's story, Brad Pitt is the star of the show. He's got a commanding presence as Wardaddy, he becomes a father figure to Norman over the course of just one day but to Pitt's credit he's never made to be completely likable. He's been through the ringer and he's the type of soldier who does the dirty work (both for the good and the bad) to get things done and Pitt is very good in the role. Logan is solid but he's not given a lot to work with. Norman doesn't have a lot of backstory but Logan is great at looking scared. Bernthal and Pena are both excellent, they're playing the more unlikable members of the crew and you get where they're coming from. The biggest surprise was Shia who was really good as Bible. If anything this movie proves that no matter how crazy he is, when he gets good material and he commits, he's actually a good actor.<br/><br/>Getting to the action scenes, most of them are actually really great. You get to see ground assaults (they include the tracer bullet effects which was new to me), short air battles from the ground and actual tank battles. One of my criticisms of Fury is that the action scenes are so good earlier that they kind of point out the implausibilities of the final battle. There's a scene where the crew goes up against a German Tiger tank and it was awesome. The ending just doesn't seem as grounded and while it doesn't ruin the movie, it was a little disappointing.<br/><br/>The only other thing that I didn't like was that it the movie took place over one day. The characters that they created were fascinating and I wish I could have seen them play out over a longer period of time (getting to know a little more about them). I get why they did it this way but there's so much in just a short amount of time, spreading it out might have been better.<br/><br/>Fury isn't flawless but it is a good entry to the war movie genre. You get to see some different things including how awful the Allied soldiers could be at points compared to how terrible the Nazis could be at the end of the war (coming from Canada you only get the Allied side of the story). You also get to see the atmosphere inside a tank, how claustrophobic and dirty it was. David Ayer's commitment to creating an authentic ""on the ground"" war movie comes through and while it might not be my favourite movie of his (End of Watch), I liked Fury a lot. There's a good cast, a realistic environment and a good story to be told about how the lines of morality get blurry when a World War comes to a close."

","I realize this is a war movie and guys in those situations don't exactly speak like choir boys but to have the movie be filled with cussing and vulgar speak the whole time is just insulting to the audience. Again, I know this is a movie to depict the horrors of war but it's as if the director went out of his way to depict blood and gore. The characters were completely under developed and if anything were extremely unlikable from the beginning. So when they began to get shot at, you almost hoped they'd get hit. We all know that American soldiers weren't saints as we trampled through villages trying to take over towns and win wars. But the director did nothing but portray American soldiers as savages who wanted nothing more than to kill for the sake of killing. Not kill for the sake of winning a war or kill for the sake of survival. Just kill because they could or because the person was a ""Kraut"". And it couldn't just be a gunshot. It had to be let them burn to death before shooting them, blow them away, etc. This movie was horrible and SO not worth the time or money. Pitt should be ashamed! I honestly found myself rooting for the Germans because the American characters were such animals. If you like movies with vulgar language on a constant basis, gratuitous violence for the sake of shock, bad acting, unlikable characters and no real plot/storyline....then this is the movie for you!"

Fury (2014) looked to be an action packed war movie and in the marketing for it that is what I had hoped to see, well it wasn't fast paced and action packed. Fury turned out to be a war/drama film just as it states in the genre listing; this film kept true to that. It's a good movie, the cast is great and their acting in this picture was performed very nicely. The cinematography and green-screen work was flawless, a very well made film.

","'Fury', is a heroic tale of a tank going by the same name and its crew. It tries its best to be a realistic war movie but unfortunately it feels like a typical blockbuster action flick where the heroes carry out missions with impossible odds and the enemies are ridiculously dumb. The writing here is very poor. The production values are great; all the tanks, warfare, costumes are very good. The background score by Steven Price is also arousing. Cinematography was also good. Its doesn't fail to portray the gritty and horrific effects of war. You get the entire feel of war. But the characters were very clichéd and boring. Acting was nothing great, Brad Pitt was way better 'Inglourious Basterds' compared to this average act. The dialogues were repetitive and there was not a single thoughtfully quotable line. Many scenes felt unnecessary and filler, like the one involving the 2 German women. The ending maybe again bit too far fetched, unrealistic still it was heroic and worked for fine. 'Fury' is worth a shot if you just want some heroic war action with big stars like Brad Pitt, but bad clichéd writing destroyed the potential the movie had.<br/><br/>RATING: [2.5/5]"
"lionelp-91853","8","12","22","8 December 2015"," Absolutely Worth Watching!
","The thing that instantly attracted me to the film was the claustrophobic atmosphere.I can not even imagine how it feels to be in a place like a tank while enemies are shooting from all over the place. Just the thought that a few inches of steel are separating me from death, is enough for my stomach to tighten up and force me to huddle myself to the fetus position and cover my self with a blanket. I think the greatest strength of this film lies in the creation of this divided vision of tank. The tank initially seems bulletproofed and a massive iron fortress, until the moment when we realize that the big hill of steel can be blown up and destroyed to the ground. What is definitely the most interesting in the characters is their attitude about the war, which is actually a great paradox. Although they were discussed with what they were doing but we can see that the heroes of this film show in many moments how really proud they are of what they do."

And only an idiot would send unsupported tanks to hold ground and only Hollywood would have German soldiers be unable to stalk armour. What nonsense.

"vandergoes","1","15","29","9 April 2015"," Spoiler * Why do they Still produce Rubbish like this*
","I don't know why in this day and age anybody would make a movie this bad. There are plenty of books, military advisers etc who can help by putting realism into these movies and by this I don't just mean the equipment and blood and guts I mean tactic's, standards of dress and military behavior etc. Good parts of the movie are few and far between. They did use a real Tiger Tank in the movie and it is massive. They did use real Sherman's and it seemed even the half tracks and anti tank guns looked correct.And at a time when superiority of the air was totally in the Allies hands it was nice to see Mustangs doing a fly over (once). Apart from that the movie failed badly. I suggest people read books that are available to get real pictures of what happened. There are a lot of books written in English now from the Germans point of view and you would see how much different it is from the Hollywood version. There is also a good book written by Belton Cooper titled :Death Traps, all about the 3rd armored Div. Its quite a bit different from what you see in this movie. If the producers/directors had used this it may have made a better movie, but probably no money at the box office so I guess that's why we have the very bad movie we have here.<br/><br/>It shows the US soldiers as undisciplined (basically gangsters) and the Germans as Nazi incompetent idiots. Some realities shown are the murder of POW or surrendering Germans (Most SS because Brad hates them)but this did happen and one scene with a German soldier caught wearing a American coat is shot. This did happen a lot.Theft of German medals, lots of blood and guts when people get hit(except for Brad and his crew who survive pretty much everything or obtain minimal damage when hit including grenades in confined spaces, bullets etc until the end). <br/><br/>The anti tank guns in the field with German troops having pinned down a American platoon was pathetic. How three anti tank guns could miss the Shermans in completely open ground is beyond me and unrealistic. The battle with the Tiger looked good to start with but as it went on it just went from bad to worse. A Sherman deflecting 88mm shots at that close range just didn't happen. Not to mention the several high shots from the Tiger when firing at the Shermans. These tanks were know for their Armour, high velocity flat trajectory guns and deadly accuracy due to the gun and sighting optics. One round even goes through the side of Brads tank. OMG, do the producers even know how lethal these tanks were? Sherman's weren't called Ronson's and Tommy cookers for no reason. It is so unrealistic at this point its hard not to laugh. <br/><br/>The village scene is just as bad with yet more Germans who cant shoot or destroy tanks at point blank range, POW being shot because he is SS, a old German being shot (by the German hidden soldier) for pointing in the direction of the hidden German troops while Brad stands proudly in his commanders hatch in the tank (I would have shot the commander myself. <br/><br/>The final scene was like watching a end skit with the music from the Benny Hill show (google it)with the Germans firstly marching in open country, 3 wide singing, no cares for marauding Allied fighters or soldiers. They take 10 min to cover the same ground the American can run in 1min giving plenty of time for brad and his crew to do the typical ""lets get out of here , I'm staying"" hero BS. Despite superior numbers, lots of Panzerfaust's they seem to loose all recollection of basic training and get slaughtered. However in the end, after some heroic acts by Brad and his crew including, holding a grenade to your chest inside a tank so it want kill the rest of the crew (Really!!) all but one of the hero's die. <br/><br/>I think if you view this as a Play Station or Xbox Game on God mode you'd be pretty close to the truth. Its a shame as said, that Hollywood still produces rubbish like this. If you really have a few hours of your life to waste, go watch grass grow. Its more real."

","Fury was awesome. The camera work was wonderful, the sound was great, and it served very well as an unflinching look at the last weeks of WWII in Europe through the eyes of an armored crew.<br/><br/>The primary flaw with the movie is its lack of originality in characters. You have your typical veterans (The leader, the vulgar one, the religious one, and the drunk) and a new fish-out-of-water thrown in with them, but they are all developed adequately in this case. Likewise, the plot is not so simplistic and clichéd as the trailer would imply, but it's still somewhat predictable. If you can get past the slightly formulaic plot and characters, it's generally very well acted and has some great talent driving it.<br/><br/>As a WWII reenactor, I sincerely appreciated the effort that went into historical accuracy in the movie. While some of the stars had questionably accurate additions, the movie as a whole went very well. The units portrayed in the film (B Company, 41st Armored Infantry and the 66th Armored Regiment) were real units in the 2nd Armored division in 1945 and served with distinction, giving the characters some great background potential, and the tactics shown weren't too heinous either.<br/><br/>You may need a drink afterward, but it's a very, very well done film and I'd highly recommend giving it a chance."
"TheGrippin","7","2","2","19 April 2020"," Great movie with some flaws
","This movie is great, since it depicts war as it should be. There ar no good guys or bad guys, no heroes or villains, just people on the edge on both sides. I really liked how it included authentic and real WW2 vehicles, which boosted the atmosphere a lot. From various kinds of Shermans to the real Tiger borrowed from Bovington tank museum, amazing attention to detail! The scenes inside the tank were amazing, gave a realistic claustrophobic tone, as we can see how the crew lives, fights and struggles inside. The attention to details, like family photos, battle trophies in form of iron crosses or captured weapons, hidden booze it all gives a cool atmosphere. I also liked how the movie did not try to praise the USA or demonize the Germans as a whole and both sides had good and bad people. The acting was superb throughout the whole movie, everyone did an amazing job. Only exception might be the ones playing the US infantry. No soldier would ever shoot like they do.<br/><br/>On the other hand there are some serious issues as well. It doesn't seem logical to send tanks against AT guns in a tree line, especially when you do not know certainly where the guns are located. Also the fight with the Tiger makes no sense. It was a common practice by the Germans to target and take out the lead vehicle in a convoy first, then the last one to trap the inner vehicles. The Tiger going forward out of cover was plain stupid. Most likely the Fury should have been knocked down by the first hit as well. The whole scene looked amazing, but made no sense, just like the tree line attack. Same situation with final act. We see the Germans marching with the Panzerfausts (AT rockets) on their shoulders, yet when it comes to using them, suddenly they are stored in boxes for like the second wave. Also the German officer says those are the only ones, yet at the end of the movie you can clearly see more of them. The whole ending is so weird like, why would you send infantry to attack a tank like that? They clearly had all the tools to easily win this fight, but for some reason in this movie the German commander rather has his men mowed.<br/><br/>In general the movie is not perfect, but tries it's best to showcase the usage of tanks in WW2. The atmosphere is awesome, the acting is brilliant, only some story elements are illogical, but regardless of those it is a spectacular movie, that is definitely worth to see."

My favourite scene being the Tiger battle against the Shermans, and sadly, my least favourite would have to be the ending.<br/><br/>The ending was your typical cliche hollywood last stand as the 'heroes' of the film face off against the germans in a last ditch suicidal effort because 'reasons'. Reasons that are never really explained other than a sense of hatred for the SS, and it so happens that an SS Platoon is making their way to them.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointing finish with a last stand that made absolutely zero sense because of the german inability to flank and surround an immobilized tank. But hey, if it made sense, then we would probably get a very different film.<br/><br/>And maybe just a slightly better visual experience than what we ended up getting.<br/><br/>Regardless, Fury is a great watch up until the ending, and should be enjoyed for what it is; TANKS!"
"sealover19","6","2","2","15 October 2018"," Good performance, bad plot
","The movie as a whole is an average war movie that doesn't convey deeper theme or deliver any good thoughts except, ""war is war and you have to kill because it's war."" There are pointless violence and unrealistic battle scenes. If the plot and the story contains something more meaningful to our intelligence, it would be better.<br/><br/>The production is fine for me, who doesn't know much military stuff and doesn't know what the real things are like. The performance of all actors and actresses are solid and believable. Each character has its own personality. But the battle scenes seem silly that the American win so easily and the bullets of the German seem to miss the point all the time in every battle scene.<br/><br/>But what I dislike the most about the movie is the idea that war means killing and it's good to kill others whom we consider enemies. I don't like movies that support war and portray killing mass of people as something great and brave. Some of the characters almost look like they enjoy killing. It just makes me feel sad and resentful. Nevertheless, there is a gentle scene with the two German girls that conveys humanity of some soldier characters. I like the performance of the two girls, expressive without a word spoken. <br/><br/>In conclusion, action-movie lovers . patriotic American people, and those who enjoy violence and killing probably like the movies. Peace lovers should stay away."

","SET
starting off with the most positive aspect of the movie, the sets and set designs of the film are fantastic, from the prop design to the locations and sets used, this film really shines when it comes to the visual aspect. <br/><br/>EFFECTS
The effects are on the whole pretty good, except for the gunfire, which is pretty laughable, and looks like it came straight out of Star Wars and not World War Two. <br/><br/>CHARACTERS
There might as well not be any as we've seen them all before in every other war movie. Brad Pitt, John Bernthal and Michael Pena have proved themselves good actors in the past but no one brought their A-game to this movie, with Brad Pitt turning in one of the most mediocre performances of his career.<br/><br/>SCRIPT
The script ranges from average to boring. When a character re-tells a war story it usually tells us a bit about the character as well as providing context to their past experiences with war and how they feel about what they've done and how it has affected them and is affecting them now. In this movie this trope (because that's what it is by now) is used for no other purpose than making the audience and main character feel uncomfortable, and tells us pretty much nothing about the characters.<br/><br/>PACE
The pacing is all off, start stop start stop start stop, one minute we're watching a tank division bond in the battlefield the next we're sitting round a table with two characters who can't speak English (and might as well not be there) and talk to us about, what amounts to, a whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>MUSIC
It sucks and is used in all the wrong places, musical cues are completely off and kill any tension scenes build up. Not to mention it's probably the most uninspired score i've ever heard.<br/><br/>RELATIONSHIPS
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
Oh look an American soldier who's mean.
I get it, war sucks but saving private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Apocalypse Now and We Were Soldiers are all war movies with likeable characters and probably pay better respect to the American military than this movie does (as a non-American I'm curious as to how Americans view this film's portrayal of their military).
Not to mention that this film possesses one of the most insulting sex scenes in film history, when Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS has more tasteful sex scenes than your movie, then you know you've made a mistake.
<ul><li>The first real female character to appear in the movie and she's little more than just something to be exploited, a more intelligent movie could have made this into a good point about how treats all men and women like objects but it's here just to create conflict within the platoon and no other reason. -</li></ul>The main dynamic of our main crew is also laughable, ""we bond through our masculinity"", ""we shout a lot"", ""we're mean but still human underneath"". 
It may have worked if Logan Lerman had more of an arc rather than it being split between Lerman and Pitt, Pitt's an established enough actor to take a backseat role, he's done it before, but I'm pretty sure he just wanted an Oscar. I like Brad Pitt but he should have been more of a supporting role.<br/><br/>PLOT
Was there one? If you want to make a Nihilistic movie fine, they've worked before but what was going on, they drove to a town, killed some Nazis, rinse and repeat.
There's also this ridiculous scene where 200-300 Germans are marching towards a broken down tank with 5 guys in it, and they decide to stay and fight, saying ""I didn't run before"".
WHY. Long Lerman has been in the war for about a day and now he's ready to fight and die with men that he barely knows despite never showing he held these values before.
Also - you pride yourself on killing Nazis, so you decide to throw your life away to kill some more knowing you're going to die, even though they could have run, so they let the Nazis kill them, and get a moral boost as they took down a tank. (Okay they slowed them down from attaining the town behind them but they didn't have any artillery with them, as it is clearly stated in the script) so the marching battalion was woefully unprepared to take a town in the first place. <br/><br/>HISTORY
""Settle down we hit a mine that's all"" - so we'll just wander round like the people who set the mine aren't here despite the fact we established that we shoot corpses to make sure they're really dead - what? Who wrote this?
The history is hard to judge as inaccurate because the backdrop of the war is ignored, we're in a small part of Germany where the key points of the war are far away so it's hard to have a go at the film for accuracy.
I'm no military historian; so the props, dress and colloquialisms are beyond my judgement for historical accuracy but it distances itself from the key areas of the war enough so that it couldn't really be inaccurate.
The Germans are also dehumanised to the point where they might as well have been the Orcs or Uruk-hai from the Lord of the Rings, not all Germans were Nazis and we get it NAZIS WERE BAD, how about putting some humans in there among them.<br/><br/>USA
I like the USA, I have American friends, I like American movies and a lot of my favourite actors are American, but would it have hurt to show some other nations (you know Europeans, because that's where it takes place, who aren't the Germans to be mowed down). 
I think it's safe to say we're all a bit sick of USA's World War Two shown in movies, but like I said its not a real problem and is a nit pick on my behalf.<br/><br/>EMOTION
I felt nothing when the characters died. And when Brad Pitt is ""dying"" he's sitting there like he's just got back from a long day of work and is gathering his engery back up, rather than facing his own mortality and reeling from being shot three times by a sniper.
Lerman's character also places his coat over Pitt's body and no one else's despite them all bonding, but Pen, Berthnal and LaBeuof aren't A-listers so their characters mean nothing."

","Fury is a 2014 movie which takes place in germany during world war II. It is the story of a crew in a tank who survives a german attack, and ""try"" very hard to survive.
It is quite a brutal movie who shows without censure the horrific nature of war, the battles scenes are very realistic and that it a plus. It also shows us that no matter the issues, the brotherhood between the soldiers is at the center of their survival.
However, expcept the morbid scenes, this movie does not teaches us anything about the events of world war II and is very biased on a specific point of view.

","Based on actual events. As the war was grinding to a finish, Nazi Germany was nearing total collapsing. The five man crew of an American Sherman tank, nicknamed Fury, guided by a battle worn and tested Army sergeant named Wardaddy(Brad Pitt)gets the assignment of their most dangerous and deadly mission into Nazi territory. Because of loss of a crew member, a young desk jockey(Logan Lerman)has somehow been assigned into their ranks. The private of course is getting his first look at battle. The Fury is assigned to cover the flank of primary forces forging toward Berlin; the crew find themselves facing the brunt of the battle, out-gunned and outnumbered. The fate of the Fury darkens as the enemy fire becomes desperate and relentless with no hope of reinforcements being available. Against the staggering odds, Wardaddy's crew stays together as the Fury stands its ground to complete the mission.<br/><br/>Strong war violence with grisly images and the expected strong language prevails. Even unlikeable characters change your opinions. For certain, war is Hell.

"christophwc","9","10","18","4 November 2015"," Absolutely brilliant telling of a tall tale.
","If you are familiar with Nabokov's, ""Pale Fire"", you may notice David Ayer is using a similar ""secret perspective"" to tell us the story of Fury. Just as Pale Fire uses crafted anomalies in the narration and index, Fury uses (less subtly) visual elements and vocabulary to suggest our watchers' vantage is somewhere else entirely. From the tracer rounds and Gordo's/Pena's fashion articles to the logic defying final battle, the seemingly cliché and predictable picture is transformed into an uncommon and welcome vehicle of storytelling. We are witness to history not through documented fact, but through a tale having long ago already transcended to legend.<br/><br/>One can reasonably expect Fury to be a serious war film, which it certainly is, but not from adhering to historical accuracy. It is a serious war movie in the vein of all war stories as exaggerated and changed over many years and retelling through the participants (and later, their succeeding generations).<br/><br/>I would ask people treat legend differently than sterile history. By doing so, you might find Fury to be a masterpiece in far-fetched war story (like many WWII tales our grandparents told us) and no less gripping or important than say, Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Follow David Ayers on-screen cues and let the movie reveal itself! A movie of a powerful myth with grandpa's story as both screenplay and script!"
"fung0","9","10","18","25 October 2015"," Not the film I was expecting
","Having scanned the reviews of Fury, I was expecting a typical 'how we won the war' kind of B movie, with all the clichés in place. But that's not what I discovered upon watching the film. This is one of the more powerful anti-war statements I've ever seen on the screen, cleverly put together, tightly directed and remarkably well-acted.<br/><br/>The title tells you what the film is about: *fury*. The fury that overcomes soldiers in war. This film, better than any other I've seen, demolishes the myth of the heroic warrior. Instead, what we see are the degraded, brutalized monsters that war creates. Brad Pitt, in particular, is brilliant as an utterly horrific character. He perfectly represents what a person must become in order to be an effective soldier.<br/><br/>The focus of the story is on Pitt training a new member of the tank crew, a young guy who's previously only been a clerk. Pitt tries to tear apart this man's humanity as quickly as possible, for his own good and the good of the whole crew. At first, we can only see Pitt as an evil madman. But events in the film gradually prove that his attitude is the only valid response to the insane circumstances.<br/><br/>The focus is on the US troops, but there's no favoritism. The action takes place at the very tail end of the European war, with the US marching through Germany. But the Germans (quite accurately) are shown as still highly disciplined, still dangerous, willing to fight to the last man. This movie isn't even remotely about which side was 'right' and which was 'wrong.' It's about the experience of the troops who are forced to make up in blood for what the politicians have failed to achieve with diplomacy.<br/><br/>Previous war films have always held back a bit, stopped short of showing us the full horror of war. This one goes several steps further, and is therefore far more successful at showing us why soldiers return to society as crazed wrecks. This is the only film I can think of that really gives us a gut-feel for what PTSD is all about. We see what happens to men when they're forced to abandon their humanity in order to simply 'get the job done.' Ultimately, even survival becomes a secondary consideration. By the end, we begin to understand - with massive irony - what a 'good soldier' truly is. What he *has* to be.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend Fury to everyone. The level of violence is gut-wrenching, partly in terms of visual gore, but even more strongly in terms of emotions. Things happen in this film that are truly beyond all reason, logic or morality. But that's exactly the point. Fury is a brutal, nasty movie, but it does give us at least a dim sense of war is *really* like. And therefore, what a heinous, unforgivable crime we commit when we allow wars to happen."

","There should be a second rating for truth and accuracy. I read an article in the New York Times that praised this movie for being very accurate. The Times got it wrong and the film makers got it very, very wrong. Why is it so hard to make an accurate movie about World War II? Many of the participants are still alive and they are always very offended with filmmakers present nonsense, like this movie. First of all the film makers chose to have this story take place in April of 1945, then they ignore the situation as it stood at that time. The war in Europe ended on May 7, 1945. The fact is that the five man crew of this tank had to know that the war was almost over as they were fighting deep in Germany. At that time the Allies (US, Britain, USSR et.al.) had more than twice as many soldiers and way more equipment than the Germans. Most of the German army was trying to get to the West to surrender to the Americans because they knew that they would be treated better than being captured by the Russians. In April alone 2.3 million German soldiers surrendered. To watch this movie one would believe that the Germans outnumbered the Allies and outrageous acts of valor were required. In fact, the allies were aware of the mass surrenders and trying to minimize their casualties. It is true that the US Department of war gave the armies inferior tanks. They chose to manufacture Sherman tanks which had far less armor and artillery. It was chosen because it was cheap and could be manufactured in greater numbers and the allies had far more of these tanks. But the German tanks were better, that much is true. As a result the Allies attacked in mass formations. Not one loan tank. This brings us to the final climatic scene. The five man tank crew are all alone in a broken down tank. There is battalion of about 250 Germans coming they're way. Pitt decides to stay there and battle the 250 Germans alone. In a broken down tank. In the last month of the war. His heroic (stupidity) attracts all four of his comrades who agree to a pointless fight to the death. The terrible part is that the Germans mindlessly walk into the Tank's line of fire as if they were Zombies. Maybe they were left over extras from Pitt's last movie World War Z. Maybe Hitler was so desperate for soldiers he enlisted the very old, the very young and even the recently undead. Anyway, even though the Germans co-operated in being slaughtered by the Americans they eventually overwhelm them. But there is more: in the closing scene we see scores of dead Germans surrounding the disabled tank. Notice that none of the dead Germans fell on the rough road. They all managed to die on the soft grass. I thought for a moment that the newly arrived troops moved the bodies off of the road, but they would have laid them in rows. This was not the case. The Germans were lying about as they had fallen. Just not on that rough, dirty road!"

I would say this film is like The Alamo inside a tank. Yeah, it's that awesome.<br/><br/>What i really appreciated with this film is that i was absorbed and immersed in the movie to the point where i wasn't aware i was viewing a movie at all, but simply an unspoken member of the team inside the tank. This happened because they avoided using the annoying, cliché, over-used hand-held camera crap that's ubiquitous today.

","There is no need to point out the most significant flaws of this movie since it was done in many other reviews. The most annoying thing about this material for recruitment events is the transported morale. In descent war movies war and its cruelty is shown as something inevitable. ""Fury"" does not stop to point out that it is necessary. It is necessary to kill people and especially when they are wearing the wrong badge. So a SS-Officer (even when he is a wounded prisoner) or a German soldier wearing an American coat is just some pig that needs to die. This kind of view of the (of course lonely and soul-tormented) Wardaddy tells us that it is necessary to kill Irakis, or Palestinians or Russians or whoever decides to be on the other side of the great US-Army and their allies. Killing is right when you kill the ""right"" people. Like killing a battalion of soldiers and the own crew although the war is almost over. Like dropping A-Bombs on big cities instead of dropping them just somewhere to show their power. The American way. Disgusting and shameful. I understand why the US-Military supports movies like this, what i do not understand is why multi millionaires like Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf are starring in a flick like this.

"Varakreivi","9","9","16","9 March 2016"," A great film about the effects of war on man
","This movie has got so many negative reviews I had to write my own opinion. I've seen quite a many war films, and for me this was top-ten material.<br/><br/>Many of the negative reviews here completely miss the point of this film. It's not a documentary of WWII US Army combined arms tactics. It's a movie about five guys inside a tank, and in my opinion it does that job really well. In that sense, this movie could as well happen in any theatre of war, or in any war. The tankers could as well be Germans, or Soviet, or Japanese. The movie could be set in Afghanistan and it wouldn't change the fundamental idea.<br/><br/>What I think this movie is about is the effect of war on man. We see rugged and stressed soldiers trying to get to the end of the day, just to start it over the next day. We see men who are extremely bonded together, yet way too used to see their mates die. There are no good or bad guys in this movie. One moment they are ruthless and crazy, even evil, and the next they are loyal and understanding. They hate and love each other at the same time. I'd imagine this could happen after years of constant war. And this is just what the movie excels at - the acting and the dynamics of the cast is very good an plausible. It's a true piece of art of method acting.<br/><br/>Of course there are the usual movie dynamics - there's a beginning, a middle part and an ending, for example - which some reviewers seem to take as game-breaking clichés, but I felt the movie was very self-aware of this and tried to take a fresh angle. Yes, the movie has it's clichés, but I thought them as not bad writing, but more like a commentary on war movies. Mostly it's the characters, who are quite familiar archetypes, and the whole point seems to take these types and put them in a different perspective, it being the battle fatigue and it's effect on the men and the bond between them.<br/><br/>I said the story would work as well in any war, but regardless of that the attention to details in the movie is astonishing. I think in this category the movie surpasses every preceding WWII movie. The equipment doesn't just be periodically accurate, but the field modifications and looted gear seem to be just right. One reviewer was upset that one of the war trophy medals that we can see in the background a few times had a ribbon, when the medals were actually worn without. That is the historical inaccuracy this (apparently quite competent in WWII props) reviewer found from the movie. I think it says quite a lot of the details.<br/><br/>Most of the critic concern on the battle scenes. Some of it is sound, but a lot of it is not very accurate. Reviewers are upset because German cannons didn't hit on the first shot, or because they made poor tactical choices. Many are enraged because the US soldiers execute a POW. Seems like for some people, ""realism"" equals ""Wehrmacht Tactical Manual"" or ""Geneva convention"", and obviously this movie is not at all about them. It's about war-worn, desperate and very, very tired people who try to stay alive. One must understand these are the final weeks of the war, and the German army is only a shadow of its former might. The remaining soldiers consist of children, retirees and a few tired veterans who very well know they have no chance. The Waffen-SS had long since abandoned it's recruitment criteria, consisting at this point of nothing more than standard Wehrmacht units (besides, it's status as an elite force altogether can be debated). Excluding the over-the-top final fight, I think the battle scenes are plausible, although presented in an action-packed format. There are lots of lucky hits and misses that bend the credibility, but nothing that truly breaks it. And in the end, the survival in real war was/is quite considerably a matter of luck.<br/><br/>Many have compared this movie to Saving Private Ryan. I think it's a totally different viewpoint. Ryan was a homage to the veterans (which they undoubtedly deserve), with all it's waving flags and lovable characters. It showed the scenery, battles and events, but with all the dramatic scenes and cheesy soundtrack the psychology of the characters, the effects of war on them, was left unturned. Fury, on the other hand, is a movie just about that, the stress and psychology of war. And in that front it works extremely well.<br/><br/>It is possible that the war was not always this grim, but in its worst it most definitely was."

","Fury (2014): Dir: David Ayer / Cast: Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal: World War 2 is heading to its end but not before one last battle. The theme is the tanks either in America or Germany. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, who leads a small troop into Germany in a tank knowing it could be their death. This is a similar role to his Inglourious Basterds role yet done with less confidence because he is fully aware that he may not come out. Shia LaBeouf plays a character by the name of Bible because he can quote it and live it. His biggest test comes when applying his faith to those on the verge of death. Logan Lerman has the most complex role as a young typist brought in to replace a soldier on Wardaddy's team who was killed. Lerman is no soldier and is literally forced to shoot a captured Nazi. He will eventually hit his mark in the heat of battle. One of the quieter scenes involves Pitt and Lerman in the home of two German women whom are treated with hospitality when Pitt provides eggs for them to cook, and Lerman has sex with the younger one. Michael Pena is part of the troop and struggles with alcohol. Jon Bernthal plays the cynical hot headed soldier whose actions towards Lerman are harsh until one pivotal moment where he confronts his own actions. Directed by David Ayer who previously made End of Watch and Street Kings, both of which regard their own wars. Structure seems to be one battle after another but the action is exhilarating with explosive images outside the confines of a tank. The wages of war is death, even after survival when the fury passes and all one can do is wait. Score: 9 / 10"

","""War Never Ends Quietly"" <br/><br/>To survive where there is no chance of survival, how can you? it seems the only way is to believe you can, but more importantly believe the man next to you can ....A Sherman tank lead by Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) and his brothers in arms, we follow their journey through Normandy to push the enemy further back into Germany, with seemingly one final effort to win the war. A film inspired by the shear brotherhood of the tank regiments who fought during World War 2 comes a story of brotherhood and friendship in their finest and darkest hours.<br/><br/>BRAD PITT AND TANKS would be enough to sell any movie, but is this film any good? is this film just another Hollywood adaption and glorification of war? And will people be comparing this to 'Saving Private Ryan' because oddly enough it seems to be the case when we mention a war film, Saving takes the biscuit....Well there is certainly no comparison, and this is definitely a stand alone film, that combines some sterling performances, and a heart wrenching reality check on this tragic war. <br/><br/>A story set during the later days of World War 2, about a group of men who have fought through thick and thin together, from places as far away as Africa, and have now found themselves in Normandy ever closer to Berlin, and hopefully closer to home. This group of men are the Sherman tank crew of 'Fury' (a title and name we are constantly reminded throughout may I add, as David Ayer persists to include this name in most shots, a name which is written on the tanks turret). This team is led by a war hardened veteran played by Brad Pitt, who's character throughout is the tough leader we want to hate, but find ourselves understanding why he is the way he is, and respect him as this 'father' figure to these men.. A classic case of American 'high ho silver', but what a character he is, with an unmistakable performance from Brad (well obviously, would you expect any less?).<br/><br/>Charging into battle with Brad, are three other men, a religious gunman played by Shai LeBeouff (who regardless of the critics opinions, gives a enthralling, tear jerking performance), lead driver Michael Pena and the lose cannon ammunitions man played by the Walking Dead star Jon Bernthal. Fury is missing a second driver/machine gunner as he was killed in action (which we are horrifically shown, as the deceased drivers face is cleaned off the inside of tank). We are introduced the final member of the team, a young type writer drafted in to the unit due to lack of men and equipment, the characters name is Norman 'Machine' Ellison (played by Logan Lerman), its his welcome to the war that draws on the inhumane, vicious reality of war, as this young scared boy has to join the war effort at the hands of a machine gun, to which he has had no training and no experience before.<br/><br/>As a history fan it is always nice to know the story is not pretending to base itself on 'real' life, but is a film paying homage to something that happened in some way. World War 2 especially is a topic that Hollywood gets hold of, and will add moments of fiction to something claiming to be entirely real. The story of Fury however, does not do this as there is no reference to this being a real story. On the other hand, it does lacks some detail, and will jump between narrative moments, which can prove a bit confusing and difficult to know where as an audience you are, and at what moment in the story you are in. But what fury lacks slightly in structure, David Ayer allows this film to make up for it in cinematic battles, and heart felt stories between friends. David Ayer has really tried to emphasise the importance of these tank units throughout this war, showing the viewer how at the front of everything these heavy metal shells had to be there first, and always were.<br/><br/>As impressive and moving as this film was, there are some areas of fault where the film becomes a bit too 'Hollywood' and far fetched. For instance, at the end of the film our valiant tank 'Fury' roles over a land mine and the tracks are blown clean off one side of the vehicle, causing the tank to become immobile. Norman is sent off to scout the surrounding area whist they try to mend the tank, upon doing so, Norman is met by a three hundred strong unit of SS soldiers armed with panzerschreck's and armoured vehicles. Together five men and a tank survive the night, fending this entire unit off, until all ammunition has ran out. Although they have heavy weaponry mounted on the tank, and a few shells to suppress the onslaught, it is hard to imagine them practically wiping out this highly trained unit of soldiers (especially as they are SS soldiers) and only really losing due to supplies running out. <br/><br/>Overall, David Ayer combined with this all star cast has fantastically and emotionally brought to our screens, a depiction of the world surrounding a small unit of men who together saw things that we cant even begin to imagine, and their dream was staying a live just to get home. David Ayer has masterfully captured scenes that will horrifically and brutally remind us all of the reality of this tragic war.... And yes, this film is not perfect, and yes, the film could do with a more tightened storyline. When a film is so brilliantly acted, well written and is cinematically pleasing you will in turn leave the cinema thinking about life during those troubled times, and really appreciate how lucky you are, and question is your job ""The best job I ever had""."

"williamlanepoff","9","9","16","16 July 2015"," Best war movie I have seen..Best most gripping in reality
","This movie is the most thrilling war movie I have seen. I really got a sense of what WWII was all about in the European theatre. Brad Pitt usually seems to play Brad Pitt. Here he was so convincing in his role as a leader: the nitty gritty of what you must feel to DO YOUR JOB: save your team members lives and the movie showed why this one tank was so heroic. Shia Labeouf : don't usually like- really liked him in this movie. I loved this movie ""Idea is peace... history is violence"" The tank battles : the 4 American tanks against the German tiger just gripping. I have always like the power of the tank yet never have seen the tactics and strategy in maneuvering that it takes for less powerful tanks to defeat tanks like the German tiger tank. Wow. Just beautiful machines. And never to my knowledge have tanks been shown so beautiful, and awesome,"
"meeza","9","9","16","9 July 2015"," Only Frank the Tank has more action antics than this!!!
","I feel that Writer-Director David Ayer's World War II film ""Fury"" got massacred with many unfair negative reviews. Sure, it might have been 20 minutes too long (so it wasn't too fast but it was furious), sure it mimicked ""Saving Private Ryan"" mucho with its many narrative missiles (whatever that means?), but I sure did enjoy it anyway. ""Fury"" stars Brad Pitt as Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who commands a Sherman tank Fury and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Ayer based the film on real life war incidents told by former War veterans who manned Army tanks in World War II. It just seemed like yesterday or better said ""ayer"" when Ayer wrote the ""Training Day"" screenplay, and after a few solid directorial action-movie efforts including ""End of Watch"", one could say Ayer is a director for today's action movies, not yesterday's; you got all that. The cast of ""Fury"" was the bomb! That basterd Brad Pitt was on target as a Nazi Killer again as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf can still act, besides his real life garbage-head shenanigans, he was sound here as the preaching tank Private Boyd ""Bible"" Swan. Lorgan Lerman was a perk in the movie as the scared rookie Private Norman Ellison. Jon Bernthal was no ""walking dead"" tank Private as the aggressive Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis. And to round out the Tankers, Michael Pena was not as good as the rest but still did not misfire as tank sharpshooter Private Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia. Maybe the jury is still out on ""Fury"" and still has to pass the test of time, but I still think that this movie did not tank in my round of cinematic machinery. *****Excellent"
"midas-jacobs","8","9","16","29 June 2015"," not what I expected
","Fury is about a group of guys in a tank. But at a certain point they get someone new in This is Norman (Logan Lerman). He has trouble killing people, and being in war. His sergeant has to 'help' him with this. But this is just a side story-line, and I just found that out when he starts killing people in the movie, which I didn't like. The main story is about the sergeant who has to guide a group of tanks through Germany. <br/><br/>The movie is directed by David Ayer. I really liked the directing of the movie, they also went with this gray- isch tone. I really like that sort of style. Sometimes it is used right in movies, and sometimes it isn't. An example where it is used right: Gone girl, and THIS MOVIE. The action sequences are very well filmed, only in the beginning of the movie it was a bit fast edited. <br/><br/>he acting in the movie was good. I really liked the chemistry between Don and Norman. Logan Lerman did one of his best performances yet. Really liked his character, also Brad Pitt did a good job, but less spectacular. This couple got the best lines and where involved in one of my favorite scenes of the movie (I have two favorite scenes the next one is a bit further in this text) the scene is when Don forces Norman to kill a German soldier, that was a very well written and acted scene by both of the actors. I didn't like Shia that much. I loved Jon Bernthal, you hate him at first, but you grow out loving him, he is also in my other favorite scene is when Emma died and Grady tells Norman that that is war. I also got attached to the characters, so I felt bad, when a lot of them died near the end of the movie. the writing was also pretty good, it wasn't anything amazing, but it was good. This was also done by David Ayer. They manged to replicate a realistic world war. and something I cant forget to mention: this movie is very gruesome, don't trust the parents guide with this one. There is very realistic and gory violence. I trusted the parents guide and I was kind of shocked when I saw the movie, luckily I can handle these parts quite a bit,but if you can't handle gory violence than don't watch the movie.<br/><br/>And like I have said in the title of my review, the movie is not what I expected, I expected it to be worse because I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. <br/><br/>Here are some individual scores, like I usually do:<br/><br/>Directing: 8.5/10<br/><br/>writing: 8/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10<br/><br/>Tension: 8/10<br/><br/>Drama: 9/10 that is a total of 42.5/50 which is rounded an 8 or a 9 out of ten. I am going to round it down to an 8/10"
"den_arjan","2","15","30","13 December 2014"," Even worse than U-571
","David Ayer had his talons in U-571 also I observed. The man should be jailed for retroactive rape of WW 2 vets or any other vet for that matter.<br/><br/>Visually a lot off the effects were novel and thoroughly enjoyable but there is just no realism anywhere when it comes to tactics, I mean AT ALL!<br/><br/>Again as with U-571 the Americans are the superior in every single way to any and all others, everything including all integrity is on offer to force feed the watcher this illusion.<br/><br/>The fact was David Ayer that American leadership was trembling in their boots faced with the prospect of attacking the Germans directly, even while enjoying air superiority from the start. The U.S. and British leadership in fact cowered behind the Russians for 2 years while they in all out desperation had to throw million after million after million against Hitler in one huge pan-demoniacal hell from which man, woman nor child could escape. <br/><br/>Painting a picture of German soldiers being not much more than brainless zombies is extremely insulting towards just about everybody and that is including your own finest generation, but to the Russians and others who suffered the worst and those who resisted furiously especially.<br/><br/>Do us all a favor and stick to stories like training day, your WW 2 genre writing and directing is a complete disgrace David Ayer."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","12","23","24 December 2015"," Brad Pitt leads his team into his second round of Nazi ass-kicking.
","In 'Inglorious Bastards"" we saw Brad Pitt lead a team on war-men into a violent fight against Nazis during WW II. That's pretty much all he does again in ""Fury."" This isn't your ""Saving Private Ryan"" like war film, but more of a fun action film with spectacular sound and editing that triggers exceptional war scenes and a lot of dead Nazis. Brad Pitt gives an overdone performance as Wardaddy, a southern commander who leads his tank and four men into enemy lines throughout Nazi-occupied Euoper. The entire film features awesome war scenes with multiple explosions and machine gun fires, but never does anything else. ""Fury"" is handled well by director David Ayer because he stays clear on what his purpose is. He doesn't overdo his film, but instead creates a terrific and unrealistic action film set in WW II. Nothing more, nothing less."
"resireg","1","8","14","11 February 2018"," Another unrealistic propaganda
","Well, I am a fan of histrory, and I was expecting some good war movie like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or Thin Red Line. Fury is a big disappointment. Essentially it tells us a story a tank crew of 5 soldiers during the last months of the American invasion of Europe. Those soldiers are just invincible champions who essentially kill thousands and thousands of enemy combatants whithout making any mistakes, while the Germans are shown as a bunch of incompetent weaklings who never hit their targets, and when confronting a stronger enemy, (like ""Fury"", the war tank that gives the movie its name), instead of approaching cautiously, and trying to minimize their casualties, what they do is just marching towards it and getting wiped out by the tank's machine gun.<br/><br/>I don't understand how come such imbeciles could offer any resistance. And they don't explain how the war lasted so long with such an easy foe. The real reason they lost was that they were numerically outnumbered, and were lacking supplies and military equipment. It is just plain brainwashing, trying to portrait the American soldier as brave and ruthless, sinxe they essentially murder unarmed prisoners of war just for pleasure. <br/><br/>It is funny that if it was that easy, the Vietnam war would ended with an American war. The movie ""Fury"" feels like a tool for convincing tje audience to support adventures abroad (like we saw recently in Iraq), since the U.S. military always know what is doing, and the foreing populations are not composed of human beings, but just irrational animals who deserve to be killed. <br/><br/>I think this film could be misused by a government that wants to re-write history. There is only 2 German actresses in the movie who are not shown in a negative light, and obviously both of them die because the point is that if you are German, you deserve to be punished. <br/><br/>It is so much sadism,so much unnecessary killing that I don't understand why in real life Germans were defecting to the American side instead of the Russian side. Fury is so innacurate an illogical that I will not recommend to anyone I know. <br/><br/>I prefer ""letters from iwo jima"" by Clint Eastwood, or ""USS Indianapolis"" by Mario Van Peebles as better examples of realistoc war movies that portays blth sides as human."
"yves-vanherreweghe","3","27","61","5 January 2015"," Impressed about Fury
","I never take time to write a review, but in this case I gladly do, because the IMDb score of this laughable tank story is an exaggeration.<br/><br/>Nevertheless a movie is not a documentary, it would be nice, makers stick to some accurate and obvious WOII facts, for instance African American soldiers were segregated from white ones, apparently not in this movie...At some point, the movie reminds to a very weak version of ""Saving Private Ryan"", a clerk who has no experience, has to fight, struggles with it, (vomitting, because the audience has to know he is not OK with it), team around him dies and he survives...woohoo, only the visiting to the cemetery was missing, pity. <br/><br/>The battles are just jokes, especially the last one. Suicidable Brat Pitt decides to stand against 200 à 300 German soldiers??? How crazy can you be, his crew team doesn't agree, but quickly changes for no reason. Great to see that Sergeant Pitt can hear these were SS soldiers from a distance just by their singing, haha.. There are so many flaws in this movie, I can keep going on...<br/><br/>The movie was a drama, I can only agree..."
"santiagocosme","5","16","33","7 April 2015"," A little cliché and predictable for my taste.
","Fury is another one of the many WW2 films out there. It is an OK movie. Just as much as most action packed movies in which the Nazis get what they deserved. However, the one thing that annoyed me is that the characters were so typical in their personality, I guessed who would survived at the end about 20 minutes into the movie. Yes! That's right! And I am normally not that good at guessing endings. <br/><br/>Who do we have? Brad Pitt plays the cool guy who always seems to know what to do and how to do it. The Leader. The guy who keeps his soldiers in check. The one that inspires them to fight and be better men when they feel like faltering. As we so often see in movies of this genre, the leader is ALWAYS accompanied by a guy who behaves like a wild beast, another guy that seems more intellectual than the others, a Latin who is retarded, and and and a very weak guy who the leader needs to take under his wing. This guy does not want to fight or to kill anyone. He throws up at the sight of dead bodies. He cries and weeps like a baby. But guess who at the end will show courage beyond belief all of a sudden and inspire his fellow soldiers to show bravery too .I bet you guessed! The weakest link! And who will be the only one making it alive? I bet you guessed who because, it's always the same thing. <br/><br/>One other thing that is common in absolutely all the WW2 is the following: if we look back, and we try to be a little fair, the Nazis lost because they went to war with all the countries around them. I mean the whole world was against them. So you could easily say that they lost because of being completely outnumbered. War for them was plainly unsustainable. However, in every single American movie, there's always a scene in which a squad of about 5 to 6 US army soldiers decides to take on a full unit of hundreds of SS soldiers instead of retreating. All of a sudden, the Nazis seem to be the biggest army And guess what happens when 5 us soldiers take on 300 Germans. Yes, I bet you guessed what happens. One would think, that it took about 1000 soldiers to defeat the German War machine. <br/><br/>If you are not bothered by this type of clichés (I watch about 4 movies a week so I am really fussy), you will find Fury a good enjoyable movie. But if you are like me, a movie geek, it really feels like you can guess the coming scenes even before they have started. Everyone feels differently about each movie. My opinion: Fury is OK but really nothing special."

","I am not a history buff nor am I pedantic about getting the details correct but this movie doesn't make any effort at all. Either the people who wrote it are sloppy or stupid or maybe both.<br/><br/>I can get by poor facts but what I cannot get by is a movie that portrays the protagonists as such animals that you end hating them and hoping the ""enemy"" kills them. The movie plays triumphalism music when Pitt and the rest break the Genevia convention and then sad music when they get their comeuppance.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot in common with Rambo and Schwarzenegger's commando. Pitt and his murders run along in plain sight of machine gun nests and never get a scratch. While Pitt and the rest shoot, they hit Germans straight between the eye with every shot fired.<br/><br/>Someone should tell Pitt that making movies like this lowers his status among movie goers. Pitt is no longer enough for me to go see a movie now. In my eyes he is no longer A list.<br/><br/>Also, another concern. Not one with the movie, but one with the Movies rating on IMDb. How come the vast majority of reviews are bad and the rating is 7.6? IMDb would need to check if someone interfered with their rating. I watched this movie based on IMDb's rating and needless to say I've lost an hour and a half of my life I will not be getting it back. Very annoying."

","If you like distorted war movies like Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, Jarhead, Inglorious Bastards, and their ilk, then you'll like Fury. One thing the listed movies have in common is a total lack of understanding of the Army (or Marine Corps). There is no understanding of real loyalty, honor, and courage. Fury is about abuse. Fury is about the worst of the worst. Fury has no real plot.<br/><br/>First, Brad Pitt's character is abusive. I've served with people like him. They do gain a following, but they do so via bullying, abuse, and coercion. He's the worst kind of leader and deserves no respect or pity. The scene in the town with the two women and the murder of the German soldier as a ""learning point"" for the newbie, Norman, is such cliché' that some keep trying to propagate that it's sickening.<br/><br/>The whole ""we must hold this crossroads"" plot point is so stupid that only somebody with no understanding of tactics would ever use it. If I'm the German SS commander, I just go around that tank once i know it's manned. It's no threat. I may send a tank or tank killer to clean it up later on, but to keep attacking it with my full force, wasting time, is just plain stupid. Nobody would ever do that.<br/><br/>So, this movie should be a total pass -- don't wast your time -- if you want to see a good movie. If you want to waste time and see some stuff get blown up, then enjoy yourself. For me, i was offended by this movie. Any future war movie with Brad Pitt involved or this Writer/Producer involved, I will most assuredly skip. I'd rather pluck my nose hairs than watch any more movies from the same team."

When it does hit, the director decides to minimize the damage it cause to a single casualty.

","With a 7,7-rating at the time of writing this, 'Fury' is rated exactly the same as David Ayer's 2012 film 'End Of Watch', which is misleading, quality-wise. Where 'End of Watch' was intense, original, cool and exciting and simply one of the best cop-films in a long while, 'Fury' is quite conventional, shallow, unhistorical and rather dull. If one was hoping for a groundbreaking war movie (I know I was), this is not it.<br/><br/>We are treated to the education of a young soldier, reluctant to participate in the inevitable butchery (which incidentally is displayed in images more akin to films like 'Rambo' (2008) or Ayer's more recent 'Sabotage' than 'Saving Private Ryan'), but it turns out he just needs his arm twisted properly by strict but fair father figure ""Wardaddy"" (so much for subtlety) in order to accept the facts of life: war is beastly and you have to do what you have to do to survive, son. Good thing the crew have God on their side and know their bible verses. Soon the rookie, too, will say (and you may doubt your ears, because it is so unmotivated from a character point of view): ""Best job I ever had!"" The tank fights do look impressive, I suppose, although I cannot judge on plausibility and historical accuracy. It has been pointed out in the Message Boards that the excessive use of tracer bullets, while being a cool contemporary effect is probably far exaggerated. That seems to be a negligible objection, but that effect (CGI of course) is so overused that it MAKES the look of the film much in the same way that CGI blood spatters in Slo-mo MADE the look of '300'. It is an eye catcher, but it effectively kills the viewer's immersion into a WWII-era feeling.<br/><br/>All in all the whole film is quite irrelevant and will soon be forgotten."
"thomas-w15","9","15","31","20 November 2014"," Amazing war film that doesn't hold back
","Fury: I have seen at least two dozen different WWII movies in my life and with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Fury is the best WWII film I have ever seen. Sergeant Wardaddy says ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent."" This film is not for the faint of heart because it is not afraid to hold back on the brutality and utter gruesomeness that war brings to the world. Some of the images are horrifying to watch but are necessary to establish the theme of the film. I rarely see a film like this one. With ingeniously-crafted intense war scenes, strong acting across the board, and a new somewhat claustrophobic setting, a tank, Fury has become the best war film of the past five years. <br/><br/>I had to think really hard about what I would have changed for this movie. Aside from a somewhat laughable moment where they had to find an excuse to have Brad Pitt take his shirt off, I could not find anything to criticize. Some people say this film suffers from a plot that does not seem to go anywhere, but I thought it knew exactly where it wanted to go. A soldiers life does not have a clear-cut path that he has to follow. The plot follows as such a soldier's life would go-in all directions. <br/><br/>From what I have heard since I have never been in a war, Fury is very realistic. It does the opposite of holding back. It shows gives you the horrors of war and how soldiers have to respond to them. It has you like a character one second showing you how great they are, then shows you the character dead in a pile of rubble. It's not glorifying the Americans at all times either. It shows the pure hatred the Americans had for Germans. This is something we would all feel though and shows how one day of war can bring that hatred out of someone. The tank is also something I have never seen before. Fury is the first film to use a genuine Tiger I tank in the making of a WWII film. The tank called ""Fury"" serves as the main setting throughout the film and it is amazing the type of shots their were able to capture inside an actual tank. Outside of a couple of scenes from Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, no other director has even come close to the scenes captured in this movie. Hats off to David Ayer!<br/><br/>The people that served in WWII were never the same because of the experiences that had. It is very hard to actually convey this type of emotion and character in acting, but I surprised that everyone involved in the film did an incredible job. They were all perfectly casted. I know a lot of you are thinking right now ""even Shia Labeouf was good?"" Yes, as much as it pains me to say it, he had the strongest acting in the film. Even a little better than Brad Pitt which is really hard more me to say. Brad Pitt stills did a great job, and Logan Lerman easily had the best performance of his career along with Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena. Suffice to say, this movie has no shortage of outstanding acting.<br/><br/>If you can handle some very intense war scenes and also love incredible films, I highly recommend Fury as your first choice going into the theater. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"drystyx","8","7","12","21 July 2015"," A few theatrics to emphasize the bigger picture
","This war film set in Germany during World War II succeeds on all levels, and I think it was meant to do so.<br/><br/>In order to do that, we get a few theatrics in the form of what appear to be coincidences, but in actuality aren't so coincidental.<br/><br/>The theatrics of this tank being the only one to survive a big blow out battle of tanks is simply the result of one tank surviving. It happens to be this one. When one takes that into consideration, one realizes there is nothing really special about the five man crew or its commander.<br/><br/>After that, we get a lot of realism and gore on the order of Private Ryan. What this and Ryan do that other war films don't do, is simply relate the gore without either glorifying it or reveling in it. We don't get immediate results of death, but we don't get the modern era reveling of seeing how long a burning human can scream either. It's all done on a relatively realistic scale.<br/><br/>And that's what makes this action war film on a par with Ryan. In really has no more coincidences in it than Ryan does, a film that bends over backwards to save anyone from New York or California, magically unable to be hit by bullets, as Hollywood likes to do, However, the end game does have the cliché of ""order of deaths"" pretty much down, but one coincidence is to be expected in a melee of violence.<br/><br/>The characters are probably even better than Ryan's characters. There are obvious similarities, whether on purpose or not, who knows? Sometimes a script may linger in a writer's mind for decades before it's penned, so there's no sense in trying to make too much of that. Certainly better than the cartoon cutouts of movies like Big Red One and Bastards.<br/><br/>A mixture of many war film elements should satisfy everyone, and this passes all the tests. Will it pass the test of time? Have to wait 100 years to find out."
"prahladagarwal","8","7","12","28 January 2015"," An awesome war movie after a long time!
","Fury by David Ayer is a brilliantly made war film which directly takes you to the battlefield without any introductions or developing historical references. It can be summed as watching a WWII archive through the eye of a battle tank. Fury shot in a crude, gory and brutal fashion, is a story about courage, glory and pride of a tank and its people. The theme is very straight-forward with episodic clashes and encounters. Ideals are peaceful, history is violent is one of the many beautiful dialogues which reinforces terror and fear in a war situation. Fury deals with story of a tank which manoeuvres Germany and briefly stops at a house where the tank leader takes a moment of peace. Next the tank runs into a Nazi contingent and decides to defend its location with 5 people and limited ammunition. With Fury, Brad Pitt moves up the food chain after a super performance in Inglorious Bastards. The cinematography of Fury is noteworthy and appreciable, it keeps the set-up relevant to the audience. The incredulous ending has not been distorted but rendered memorable with a neat cinematography/VFX. Highly recommended as this type of work is rare!"

","Mr. Pitt plays the 3-year war veteran in command of a Sherman tank crew while fighting in the final push into somewhere in Germany. They lost their forward machine gunner in action so they need a replacement, and they are given a typist with no combat experience, who is quickly put into the grinder of the final weeks of the war.<br/><br/>For starters the movie has a very large cast of extras, which gives a solid initial impression of the fighting on the front of a war. Visually, the movie is also very pretty, well shot, good cinematography. The movie has plenty of gruesome deaths which will appeal to the gore crowd.<br/><br/>From there on, its downhill. The acting is not bad, but it is too much; the limited span of the script simply does not bear it. The story told by the script is too thin, like skin stretched over a skeleton with no flash on it.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes in the movie are not 'fleshed out'... they are superficial and barely adds to the flow of the movie. There is no real character development. The change to the movie forward gunner seem artificial and transparent. A lot of the human expression near the end is expletives.<br/><br/>All war movies have both inaccuracies and silliness that occurs throughout the action, but this movie's load of these is not just stretching credibility: It is outright ridiculous! Limited artillery shelling in a village that all seemingly hit right in the town square, numerous shells that manage to glance off tank armour where the tank armour only has a ~1"" indentation, and the final whopper of ""one tank crew holding off and slaughtering most of an entire Regiment""? Did they really pull off the ""Heroic Last Stand To The Death"" trope? Yep, they sure did. I feel like this is where the Storm Troopers come in, because they can't hit s___, either! After all those numerous glowing machinegun and cannon shots (which funnily enough are strictly one colour for the Americans and another for the Germans), I'm expecting Darth German to step in at the end, telling Brad Skywalker that he is his long-lost father, the two of them fighting on different sides of the same war.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the ending was weak - saw it coming a mile away.<br/><br/>WW2 aficionados will shake their heads and pop Kelly's Heroes (for humor) or The Longest Day (for at least somewhat credible portrayal of a notable war action) on instead.<br/><br/>Verdict: Poor. This is Red Tails on the ground. High-budget, lots of eye candy, but poor plot/script, and just silly.<br/><br/>Recommandation: Typical popcorn movie. Worth watching (cinema or rental ONLY) but not worth buying nor remembering."

","After complaining that the recent Neill Blomkamp film CHAPPIE suffered from a painfully ill thought out marketing campaign I must confess that David Aye's ferocious war actioner was an even bigger victim of poor marketing . Seeing the promos for this film last Autumn it was one movie I was going out of my way to avoid . You know the clips I'm talking about with handsome Brad Pitt bragging he'd been killing Germans all the way from North Africa to Germany . Okay I'll be the first to admit that some American units had this dubious privilege but compare this to many British units such as the 51st Highland division who'd spent 1940-45 fighting against the Germans non stop . That said I'm knowledgeable enough to realise that this pales in to almost insignificance when you realise the Chinese and Japanese had been fighting each other since the early 1930s . Europeans do have a very Eurocentric view of history but like so many people in Europe I wasn't keen on seeing yet another Hollywood revisionism of history especially when all the marketing material revolves around FOUR Americans in ONE American tank holding back hundreds of Waffen SS soldiers <br/><br/>It's not often a film surprises me . No on second thoughts let me rephrase that and state it's not often a film shocks me but this is exactly what FURY did . For the most part it tries to avoid the Hollywood clichés and when it doesn't such as newbie and reluctant recruit Norman being introduced to the tight knit and battle hardened unit it does disguise the clichés quite well . Where the film works best is showing the relentless inhumanity of war . It's not a case of clean cut Americans with high moral values beating the ghastly Germans and nasty Nazis without suffering a scratch but a grim unrelenting battle to the death where there's no real winners until democracy triumphs over tyranny . Absolutely nothing is held back and as someone who has seen a lot of war films I was actually quite shocked as to some of the on screen incidents especially the scene where Norman is bloodied in to shooting a prisoner . This is a brutal and depressing film of the type I thought I'd never see Hollywood attempt especially since recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are still fresh in the memory <br/><br/>It's hardly two hours of feel good entertainment but the bleak and nihilistic tone makes it an absolutely outstanding piece of American film making for the most part but then for the last half hour the film then proceeds to shoot itself in the foot , the head and every other piece of anatomy you can think of as Brad tells his men - all four of them - that they'll be defending a crossroads with their broken down tank against several hundred Waffen SS troops because <br/><br/>""I ain't ever run away from anything and I ain't about to start"" <br/><br/>Bare in mind their tank has broken down , the war has only a few weeks to go and they could have easily made it back to safe lines without being charged with desertion or dereliction of duty so there's two options left to them . The sensible one that'll see them live and pick up their war pension or the stupid one that'll see them give the audience 20 minutes of ridiculous over the top mock heroics that the film company can stick in the trailers . I suppose being film characters they'd quite happily sacrifice their lives to do the film company a favour but at the same time I'd like to see a film where characters do something understandably human and sensible , especially if they've got American accents . The final climatic battle scene is as every bit as ridiculous and overblown as you'd expect to see in the worst Hollywood Rambo type flag waver as literally hundreds of Germans are mown down left , right , centre , background and foreground which goes totally against the bleak nihilistic scenes that preceded it . The fact that it ends with most of the Americans dead doesn't make it any less ridiculous <br/><br/>This is a great shame because up until the final act I was very impressed with what I was watching . Again let me repeat this is in no way a feel good movie and if you don't like war films you'd quickly be turning this off due to the graphic violence on display and this refusal to sugar coat the grim and horrific face of conflict is what made FURY so refreshing to me . Such a pity the film had to end on a seen it all before cliché ridden denounment"

","First I'll talk about the violence. Look back to Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day scenes. Those scenes are this whole move. But these scenes are not painted as being ""war-porn"" as some may lead you to believe. These scenes are as close to the real thing as they can get, and their purpose is to show you the true horrors of war. But what really pushes this movie beyond any expectations is the cast. These men have been through hell and back every day for a long time, and it's obvious. They are not perfect, and to some they may even be unlikable. Both Americans and the Nazis do unspeakable things in this movie. Some of the things the Americans do are even cringe worthy, they're that terrible. Granted the Americans are doing these things to Nazis, and yes this movie makes a distinction between Nazis and regular German soldiers.- People have been complaining about a certain scene with the main characters and two German girls. They say it ruins the pacing and it was too long. This was one of my favorite scenes. Everything that makes this movie great is present in that scene. Very strong character development, sad truths, and horror. It's about 20 minutes long, and then it's right back to the horror that is war. I keep repeating horror because that's what it is. Great acting, realism, horror, and heartbreak. I wish I could write more, as I could go on forever about how great this movie is. If you like war movies, do yourself a favor. Go see this movie."

This leaves me depressed inside knowing that for some unfathomable reason, I am in the minority for not liking it. Bloody hell. Proof if ever you needed one that the world is full of idiots.<br/><br/>I need to give special mention to the final battle scene, because it really is a piece of work. Inexplicably, the murderous tank crew of this film decide to protect their knackered tank in the middle of a road where 2-300 elite SS soldiers are approaching (presumably so they can get off from more killing).<br/><br/>The young lad that spots them approaching walks about 50 metres from the tank and runs back. It then takes the SS about 15 minutes to walk 150 metres so that the writer of this film can try and make the audience feel emotion for the brave soldiers for deciding to stay and fight, because they are so dumb.<br/><br/>For the next 15 minutes, laughably, the SS soldiers choose to criss-cross back and forth and then do that several times over in front of the tanks main weapons until their number is depleted to a handful. They literally run up to the front of the tank to get mowed down and this is interspersed with the crew inside having a rather relaxed time telling each other what they are doing. Somehow darkness totally descends in this short space of time for a cynical attempt to add dramatic effect. This is when these elite SS soldiers get out a few of their bazookas and fire at the tank from 5 metres. And MISS. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Next Brambo Pitt gets shot 3 times and falls back into the tank to have a chat with his comrades. Now I can't be ar*ed to describe any more as I'm getting angry remembering how stupid it all is.<br/><br/>If you want to watch this film: don't. Go on YouTube and just watch the final battle scene.

"classicsoncall","8","9","17","26 October 2014"," ""Stop talking' about yesterday's fight. Start talking' about today's"".
","""Fury"" is being heralded as the current/next great war movie but I think time will tone the rhetoric down. It doesn't have the epic sweep of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"", and when you come right down to it, it's not even about the second World War so much as an intense look at an American tank crew that views their job as 'the best one they ever had'. All quite facetious of course because war is hell, and scenes in the movie are intended to convey that fact.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fine movie with exceptional performances by Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman as the new member of the Fury crew who learns the facts of war life real quick while under fire when hesitation can mean certain death. The understated message of the film is announced by Pitt's 'Wardaddy' character - ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent"". With that as a reference point, I don't quite know what to make of the unplanned rendezvous with the German cousins. It seems to me you had three types of Germans during the War, those who were Nazis, those who supported them, and those who had to bide their time and not openly defy them as a guarantee of survival. Would a young German girl have been able to share a romantic interlude with an American soldier given the intense propaganda prevalent in Nazi Germany? Not impossible perhaps, but what are the odds? <br/><br/>I guess the idea that was meant to be conveyed was best illustrated with the character of Private Ellison (Logan Lerman). Coming in cold, the newly assigned soldier encountered practically every conceivable emotion and situation that one might experience in an entire deployment, but in a span of only a couple of days. The idea was expressed at one point by a soldier who stated that the eyes take it all in but the mind is unable to process all the death, destruction and inhumanity of war and make any sense of it. Presumably because there is no sense to it, it's men following orders with a mission to defend their country.<br/><br/>The final battle? Well it's a movie after all. My instinct tells me that five soldiers in a tank aren't going to be able to wipe out an entire German squadron with a kill ratio of twenty to one, even if that's the way it appears on film. The German soldier giving a bye to Private Ellison - it's not unheard of, but comes across here as just a little too unrealistic. I guess each viewer will have to be their own judge with ""Fury"", maybe more so than with most war films."
"regginblack","10","15","32","7 November 2014"," I'm tired after watching this film... It was intensely engaging.
","I am worn out after watching Fury. It was an intense film that left me tense throughout. I even found myself letting out deep sighs, as I was holding my breath without knowing. Fury is an amazing film, and a demanding experience.<br/><br/>I had a few doubts about certain parts of this film before seeing it. First, I am not a fan of Shia Labeouf. Second, the previews made Brad Pitt look like he was revisiting his role as Aldo Raine from Inglourious Basterds. Finally, as with most war films, there is a tendency to include a handful of worn out clichés.<br/><br/>Let me put the minds at ease of anybody that had those same worries. Labeouf was amazing in his role, and didn't ham up his character. Pitt may have looked like Aldo, but he was anything but. As far as clichés go, there were a couple. For instance, chambering a round in a gun that has been, or should have been, already chambered. For the most part, the film avoided clichés though.<br/><br/>I am a fan of war films. I have watched every kind from any country I can get them from. This has to be the best war film I have ever watched. Details are important in a war film, and those details were carefully provided in Fury. Everything looked like one would expect. Things were dirty, worn, and sometimes broken. Fury showcases a war, not a parade.<br/><br/>Speaking of parades, the US army didn't parade around like saviors in this. They were exhausted, angry, and fighting battles they didn't always win. There weren't showers, laundromats, or shoe shines. Fury portrays the war as violent, gruesome, gut-wrenching, wearisome, and grinding. Soldiers weren't all choir boys, and Fury made sure to portray that fact.<br/><br/>I can't speak on the technicals of the actual film making process, I'm not qualified, but I do know that there were beautiful shots throughout. The musical score only emphasized the emotion of each scene. It was truly beautiful. Adding to that beauty was the battle scenes.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were masterfully done. Bullets and shells flew through the air like one would expect. Not every pull of the trigger was a hit. Shells skipped along surfaces. Bullets came hard and fast. Earth moved with explosions and gun fire. The tracer rounds lit the screen up, as did the tanks shells exploding, especially those with Willy Pete, or white phosphorous, in them. So, during an extreme battle, there was violence dancing with visual beauty.<br/><br/>The main characters weren't fully fleshed out with back stories and motivations that were easily perceived, but I felt like this was one of the strongest points of the film. I still cared about each of the crew, but like them, I didn't want to know their whole bio. They were part of a strong tank crew, and their backgrounds were often nuanced. <br/><br/>The film didn't feel like it was supposed to be about the characters, it was much larger than that. The film is about a war that a generation of men and boys fought. This war involved killing and being killed. It wasn't pretty -- it was a dog fight. Every inch of land was taken, earned by those men. In that moment, there wasn't good or bad, there were just two sides trying to kill the other. Fury is about a war.<br/><br/>In closing, I highly recommend this film. It easily became my favorite war film, and that is saying a lot."

","I'm not one to usually watch ww2 movies and stay as tuned in as i was. But WOW Fury literally just blew me away. I have to say I was not disappointed when I watched this. I quite truly did not expect to get as drawn in as I did. <br/><br/>I was skeptical at first, primarily because Shia LaBeouf playing one of the main/supporting roles almost turned me away before seeing the movie, as some quite crazy things were revealed that Shia, didn't wash the whole movie shoot, had one of his teeth removed of he own request and actually slashed his own face instead of using make up to simulate cuts. Odd definitely, but to get into his character as well as he did I take my hat off to him. On top of that he spent many hours learning to operate the vehicle featured in the movie to an expert level and insisted on staying in control of it even when he wasn't needed to do so. This actually made me want to see it and totally flipped my initial thoughts around! with all his personal life problems aside, Shia LaBeouf especially was top notch, the characterisation played by all the cast was extremely convincing and gave a very believable conception to what the conflict was like for those involved all those years ago. <br/><br/>Fury itself put lots of stories and tales into a great screenplay for me, as my grandfather occupied the same role in ww2 as Brad Pitt does in Fury. My grandfather told me stories of his experiences, and those of his friends from around the same time the movie is based. The way the characters in the movie give each other a hard time here and there, dealing with the stress and reality of the situation and then pull together like a family is exactly like stories i have been told. <br/><br/>I was just gripped the whole way through, although some parts were a little predictable, but mostly you really couldn't tell where or what was going to happen until it did. <br/><br/>This movie for me was a fantastic watch and will absolutely be one I will put on my all time favourites shelf."
"sunny_tirpitz","10","18","40","28 October 2014"," Why this movie is more realistic than some want to believe
","1. The level of violence: The level of violence in this movie is quite accurate. Hollywood has ""taught"" us in the 60s and 70s that the battles fought in WW2 were somehow of mild violence and conducted by ""gentlemen"" who were highly educated, mannered and fought with honor and respect for the opponent. We all know today that this ""portrait"" is light years away from what really happened then. In 1998 Steven Spielberg has ""destroyed"" this idealistic picture with the best war movie ever made, a movie in which the brutality of combat was shown almost at the ""correct"" level. Almost. This was later corrected in the Band of Brothers mini-series, which contains even more graphic and brutal scenes. But even in this 2 titles the portrayal and description of soldiers was ""softened"" and though they were not as well ""educated and mannered"" as their ""counterparts"" from the 60s and 70s movies, they were still too ""tenderhearted"" for their own good and completely not in tune with the times and with the magnitude of a world war. I am somehow astonished that some people are still ""shocked"" in the era of internet, Live TV and portable cameras by the brutality of the war and by the manner in which humans can slaughter each other. Just look at the violence, intensity and brutality of the 3 major wars of the last 10-11 years: the War in Iraq, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Syria. And these wars are ""limited"" wars, not world wars.<br/><br/>2. ""Summary"" executions: Some people talk about how in this movie the US soldiers kill unarmed German prisoners. There are 2 scenes in which captured Germans are killed apparently with no reason: one in which a German soldier is captured while wearing a US army uniform and another scene in which a SS officer is shot after he had surrendered. The first case is simple: any enemy soldier captured wearing an allied uniform has to be executed after interrogation or if the situation can't permit otherwise on the spot. This was the standard procedure on both sides, because once a soldier is dressing up in the uniform of the enemy he is no longer a simple soldier, he is an infiltrator and he must be punish exemplary. The second case is that of an SS officer shot dead after the US forces have captured a town. Before the US forces enter the town, bodies of German teenagers executed by hanging can be seen on the roadside. All these teenagers were executed by the SS officer that was later captured and killed, because they didn't want to ""fight for Germany"". It must be emphasized that the SS members were treated differently than regular German army soldiers, primarily because their fanaticism was one of the last things that hinder the rapid capitulation of Germany at that time and secondly because in April 1945 most of the concentration camps were already discovered and the atrocities committed by the members of the SS were well known by all allied soldiers. That is the case for the so called ""Dachau liberation reprisals"" episode (check the history books or search online) that happened at the end of the war.<br/><br/>3. The US tank crew in the movie seem to be cold and brutal: Maybe, if you look at it from the outside. They are fighting in the War for 3 years now (1942 North African Campaign) and at the beginning of the film we find out that one of the crew members has just been killed. So it is normal to see them sad and not very interested in the outside world. Also they know very well that the War will end soon and are frustrated by the fanaticism of their enemies. All these feelings and manifestations are very legit and credible. Again the realism is there. To truly understand them and care about their suffering imagine that you are one of the original crew members, or imagine that you are the fresh recruit that ""has never seen the inside of a tank and who is just a typist trained to type 60 words a minute"". Try to understand their sadness, their fury, the visible signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and their initial unwillingness to accept a new member in their ""family"" after 3 years of combat. Do that and at the end of the movie I guarantee your eyes will water.<br/><br/>4. Some combat scenes look exaggerated and not very realistic: Overall the combat scenes are very well made and quite realistic. If you analyze in detail the combat scenes from other great war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers mini-series, The Thin Red Line etc., you will also find some exaggerated things in them, but that is nothing uncommon, there will never be a war movie 100% accurate. Plus a war movie should make you feel very engaged in what you see and this is not possible without a little dose of extra drama, like the way in which this movie ends."

Hello, chauvinist assclown, how many Brits were there in the Second Armored Division? As many as there were Yanks in the Battle of Britain. What utter stupidity. As for the film itself it's probably one of the best evocations ever of the squalor, waste, horror,filth, fear and general nastiness of war. An American Sherman , Second Armored Division style, rolls across Germany. The war's almost over, but people still die in the hideous hundreds every day and missions are only accomplished in blood expenditure. The central image, almost a lietmotif, is a closeup of a trank tread crushing through anything in its path. That's war: huge, brutal, sloppy, unfeeling, destructive. A crew calls their vehicle FURY and goes about business with weary, frightened but determined professionalism. The new guy is too tender for this rough treatment, but he learns. The Sergeant treats him with tough love. Meanwhile, everywhere, people keep getting blown up or set on fire. The lucky ones get a shot in the head. Real tanks are used, so the sense of them has hulking tractors of war is intense, and the movie creates combat more pursuasively than anything since ""Private Ryan."" (But wait? Where were the Brits on Omaha beach! Why it's a crime Spielberg didn't show them!) Some reviewers, with great talent for missing the argument, say all the guys are stereotypes, but that's the point, not the mistake: war grinds you to your elemental self. You cease to be who you were and become this new animal, tired, scared and, as the greatest generation happily proved, willing to serve and die despite the misery of the ordeal."

Only 3 that really raised the hair on the back of my neck and made everything feel as real and terrifying as I think a real war situation would be. Those movies are Platoon, Saving Pvt. Ryan and Full Metal Jacket. After seeing Fury, I have to add one to the list. This movie tells the story of men who operate a Sherman tank code named Fury during the Allies final push into the heart of Nazi Germany. The crew is forced to take on a new crew member when their assistant driver is killed and they're saddled with an inexperienced typist as a replacement during the most dangerous push of their tour.<br/><br/>There is so much about this film that I absolutely love that if I were to go into it, I'd be here for over an hour. The filming is spectacular and really has that genuine film look that only movies like Apocalypse Now and Platoon seem to have. The casting is PERFECT and includes Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal of Walking Dead fame, Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt as the men of tank Fury and a bevy of other actors that truly look like men of war not Hollywood actors. The characters are all well defined, diverse and sympathetic and watching them you really get both a sense of camaraderie and strong dose of battle fatigue just watching the men run the tank and it's just so genuine that you almost feel as if you need a shower afterwards as you feel the grime and the filth of war all around you.

"nzpedals","9","5","8","13 September 2016"," 'so very glad I wasn't there.
","No amount of reading war history or personal accounts can match the way ""Fury"" displays so many realities of war experience. Whilst some other reviewers complain about clichés, I recognise that clichés or not, this is reality. There is the bulldozer pushing dead bodies, the tank crushing a corpse, the clerk cleaning the inside of the tank after a death, the older crew and their relationships, summary executions, decisions of strategy by the commander, fear, confusion, civilian casualties... and so many more.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance is so much better than in (for example) Inglourious Basterds, here, he captures the very essence of his role and seems to almost enjoy doing it. A feature of the DVD shows Pitt looking about 10 years younger than in the movie - does that show just what the make-up people can do? (with hair cement?)<br/><br/>Logan Lerman as the typist-clerk suddenly sent to be assistant driver in Pitt's tank is just as important to the feel of the movie as Pitt. Well done.<br/><br/>The basic story is easy to follow, a tank and its crew involved in the battles across Germany near the end of the war, the characters are well defined, the acting is flawless, and there are several especially good scenes with memorable dialogue, so I've given it a 9. OK, so the final scenes are not really believable, (is that an LED torch we see?) but by then I've decided on the rating to give it!<br/><br/>The section where they meet up with two beautiful young women is so similar to what happens in the totally different movie ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", perhaps the writer knew that? Anyway, it was worth putting in."
"PWNYCNY","10","14","30","21 October 2014"," Brutalizing effects of war.
","In terms of sheer dramatic intensity, this is an excellent movie. The movie explicitly depicts the brutality of war. In doing so, the movie takes certain literary licenses. First, the movie shows US Army soldiers committing war crimes, specifically the murder of prisoners of war and wanton acts of looting and plundering. The movie also depicts US Army soldiers as being intoxicated, both in and outside of battle, and fraternizing with the enemy. The movie also shows US Army units planning highly risky operations relying on only the flimsiest of intelligence regarding the disposition of the opposing forces who, even at this late stage of the war, are still formidable. Nevertheless, the five principal characters, the crew of the tank, are treated with reverence, and deservedly so. Although isolated, they remain at their post to complete the mission. The heroism of the US soldiers in the European Theatre of Operation is an established historical fact. This movie is a testament to that heroism. Brad Pitt gives a compelling performance as the tank commander Sgt. Collier who so closely identifies with war that he cannot separate himself from the instrument, in this case a tank, through which he acts out his violence. The rest of the cast is also excellent, but this is Pitts' movie and in this movie he is the star."
"martin-807-452270","3","14","30","21 October 2014"," Should have been 5 stars but let down by hopeless script.
","***Spoilers. SPOILERS SPOILERS!!!!!****<br/><br/>Last night I saw the film in a packed cinema full for friendly film folk, a generous audience.<br/><br/>I was incredibly excited to see the film, had watched the trailers and some of the behind the scenes stuff, and was impressed with the film makers attention to detail. Getting the Tiger tank from Bovington Tank museum etc.<br/><br/>This film should have been a 5 star smash hit, but, and it breaks my heart to say it, it just isn't.<br/><br/>The problem, as with so many US studio pictures is the script. It just isn't good enough. <br/><br/>Everyone clearly worked very hard on the film, but the lines and the story were just not there for them.<br/><br/>The opening of the film was very good and nicely shot, but then we move to incredibly predictable story. Every new scenes sets up a question: will they kill the Germans? and the answer is yes. Will they get ambushed in the town? Yes. Will the German girl get killed? Yes. Will they shoot the German POWs? Yes. Will the next mission at the cross roads be a disaster? Yes Will the new bloke survive? Yes.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing unexpected or surprising or more impotently- clever. This is very basic but VERY VERY Expensive film making.<br/><br/>And for the sake of the lord where are the European troops??? Once again (Saving Private Ryan etc) the US are portrayed as the only ground troops in WW2 who weren't German.<br/><br/>Even the aircraft that fly overhead looked like Mustangs (USA) and I just wondered where the RAF might have got to?<br/><br/>Brad Pitts character shows a moment of weakness at the beginning of the film, but we never go back to this, and this is what would have made him interesting! <br/><br/>I really really wanted to like this movie, but it doesn't go anywhere we haven't been before, and there is an astonishing lack of empathy and emotional attachment to the main five characters, I just wasn't that fussed if they lived or died. I was more emotionally attached to Despicable me<br/><br/>I remember watching Das Boot and just wishing and praying for the UBoat crew to live, they so wanted to live - I was on the edge of my seat, but those emotions were not there in this film. The tank crew did not want to live enough that I was rooting for them. As soon as Brad Pitt decides to make a stand that will mean everyones suicide, they all just say, Yeah sure - I've got no place else to go. It makes no sense. They would have been better falling back and telling the Captain that the SS were on the way and maybe call in an airstrike, from those Mustangs we just saw.<br/><br/>Maybe Brad Pitt is just too big a name and not that big enough of an actor to give us the audience a real kick in the heart, which is what a movie like this should be handing out. It's a War film, I WANT to feel sad. I want to feel the pain and suffering, but ultimate triumph of good vs Evil and the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.<br/><br/>But I just didn't.<br/><br/>I was also never on the edge of my seat. There were several really good jumps (when the column is ambushed) but it was consistently lacking in tension, I don't know if this was due to editing, or score, but it just isn't there.<br/><br/>I also never really felt the size and weight of the tanks like I had in other tank movies like Private Ryan, or even Kelly's Heroes!!<br/><br/>Having watched the making of - they had every conceivable sort of crane, dolly, camera and lens, but there are surprisingly few exciting, interesting, imaginative shots in the film. Just consider the Tank Turret shot from Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and that shot should have been in this film (obviously with less Apes).<br/><br/>Everything was there for this film to be one of the great cinema films, but lazy script writing will push it into the archives of movie history.<br/><br/>The definitive WW2 Tank movie is still to be made."
"SimonJack","3","20","46","18 April 2015"," Hype can't even paint this film as anything near reality
","For all it's hype about creating a real ""feeling"" for this movie, the Columbia team hasn't managed to fool many people. I appreciated the many reviewers who saw how unreal this film is. Now, how can anyone today – seven decades after WWII know what was real? Well, by the stories and news we grew up with during and in the years right after the war. And the many books, novels, diaries, and movies produced in the first few decades after the war. And, in the newsreels, we watched in theaters, and the live action filming for documentaries. Until the 21st century, most criticism of the Hollywood productions about WWII were that they often glorified the American GIs in combat, or they too often involved romances that the bulk of the fighting men never experienced, or that the equipment used for the movies wasn't accurate. The early WWII films didn't show the graphic gore of war that ""Saving Private Ryan"" ushered into films in 1998; but many of those films showed the angst, anguish, fear, fatigue, and other aspects of war on the men fighting it. And, most did not make the enemy out to be inept; but very formidable combatants. <br/><br/>A special bonus short documentary with the DVD of ""Fury"" has interviews with some of the main actors. Brad Pitt, Shia LeBeouf, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal talk about their preparation for the film. A Navy SEAL team apparently ""trained"" the actors for a week of what GIs would have gone through in basic training. So, their testimonials were that they learned to bond as a group in that one week. Really? And, while basic training is similar in all the services, would the Navy know more about tank training? One suspects that the movie makers were trying to hype the film by using the latest men of the military spotlight in their movie project. In reality, I doubt that the actors would have had any better training or learned to bond as brothers than if their trainers had been Special Forces, Rangers, Paratroopers, Marines, or regular Army training units. Hmmm. Why not even an armored unit?<br/><br/>The narrator of the short documentary said the movie makers met behind closed doors with a few WWII vets – now in their 90s, from the 2nd Armored Division. He said that the vets told them stories that they had never told even to family members. Interestingly, the filmmakers don't claim that the movie is based in any way on what they heard from the veterans. Again, some modern day Hollywood hype, I suspect. <br/><br/>I appreciated the comments of those early reviewers who point out some of the most obvious aspects of the film that deny its reality. This is the most foul-mouthed bunch of GIs I've ever heard and can imagine. Yes, those men of my father's age were known to curse, swear or cuss on occasion. But it was not their common language. I served in the Army from 1961 to 1964, and we too used an occasional cuss or swear word. Occasional, not part of our running, everyday language. The same is true today, the younger service people tell me. So, the ""Fury"" filmmakers aren't giving us a look at reality of the closing days of combat in WWII Germany. No, they are giving us here a modern portrayal of a time past.<br/><br/>This ""unreality"" check applies equally to the portrayal of the Germans in the long closing battle scene. Brad Pit's character, Sergeant Don Collier even notes that the approaching Germans are a crack SS battalion. And, the film seems to portray such. So this large force of crack German troops in so inept that the Americans are able to mow most of them down in a very long pitched battle from one immobile tank position smack dab out in the open. The Germans fire a couple anti- tank torpedoes that don't do much damage, and they don't shoot anymore. <br/><br/>Besides these major detractions for this film, ""Fury"" has a weak script and character parts that just aren't very interesting or believable. Can anyone imagine that all, most or even a significant number of American GIs were all so completely hardened and able to dismiss killing as though it were nothing? From the beginning, the performances seemed forced. It seemed to me that the selling point for the film is intended to be the amount of gore and fabricated and exaggerated action that they could produce. The film seemed more to me like a video game than a realistic portrayal of a unit in WWII combat. <br/><br/>It seems that Hollywood is trying to reinvent WWII for audiences in the 21st century. This is one modern film that just doesn't accurately reflect the culture of the 1940s. So, it doesn't have a place in my war film library. If young buffs today want a more accurate ""feel"" for WWII, they can watch almost any of the many Hollywood films made about the war by the major studios through the 1980s. And, even later films by the movie industries in European countries."

","Well, this movie could have been a new classic modern war movie about WWII but the last and final scenes, where a broken and motionless tank and his few crew members killed hundreds of German soldiers (outflanking and such tactics they did not learn it seems to me - something even I was able to comprehend and learn by playing some rounds of Counter-Strike), destroyed the whole movie with too much pathos and ""killing-capacity"", so it almost looked like something like The Avengers fighting some poor evil minions ;)"
"Lothar_gr","2","3","4","1 July 2018"," Waste of time
","Don't make the error to be fooled by what the title says... This isn't a war film. Its a action movie that just happens to be taking place in WW2 Germany.<br/><br/>Let's start with the Only somewhat redeeming qualities I can say. It is indeed gritty and dirty, and doesn't do much justice to the characters. Even Brad Pitt's ""Wardaddy"" character, he is apparently a war criminal even. Shoots a German POW to the back of the head in cold blood. Also, it is impressive to see all the tanks and weaponry etc - considering especially that a real German Tiger was provided for this movie. The only Tiger tank still in working condition, Tiger 131 from Bovington museum in the UK.<br/><br/>Now the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Acting is very obviously forced by the actors, and although none are particularly bad actors or do that bad a job presenting their characters, they act more like caricatures ( or stereotypes, depending on who is portraying whom ) of people, than like normal humans. <br/><br/>The film has long periods where nothing happens ( notably the 2 German women's house ) cut by scenes of fighting which are very unrealistic - Notably, ""Fury"", Brad Pitt's tank, takes 2-3 hits from a Tiger and survives, all the Germans in the film have forgotten how to operate anti-tank weapons, etc. <br/><br/>The last scene especially is by far the worst - and could be summarized in this sentence: around 200 Hapless Germans run around a lone immobilized Sherman tank like headless chickens, and are getting mauled in the process by Brad Pitt handling a machine gun and Shia Labeouf throwing grenades from a hatch.<br/><br/>Note: Brad Pitt can be killed, but apparently he is indestructible. 2 grenades exploding to his face, inside a tank even, and he is still whole. What is he made from ?<br/><br/>Anyways, If this is your idea for a historical war drama, then sure go ahead watch this film. Otherwise avoid it like the plague, it is ridiculous."
"nadblaster","6","3","4","4 December 2017"," Good enough... up until the last scene
","A reasonably well-shot and definitely well-acted war movie, but with enough dumb plot holes and strange moments to leave you scratching your head. It's a great movie to watch in that in some ways it's the most realistic depiction of tank combat seen on film in ages - shells deflect when hitting armour at the wrong angle, there are certain weapons that a tank can just plain ignore, etc. However, there are also other choices made that cheapen the whole experience (I guarantee that Brad Pitt's Hitler Youth haircut would have gotten him lynched in WW2 for real) and the last scene is so unbelievably stupid that it beggars belief.<br/><br/>I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say that it's easily the worst ""climax"" I've seen in a movie in years, maybe decades. Visually exciting but fundamentally and creatively ridiculous, it does a fine job of stripping the movie of any stage-setting and immersing it may have done previously. It's not an awful movie (some of the tank battle scenes are really exciting) but don't let your brain get involved."
"xuhetohew","5","3","4","17 November 2017"," Out of touch
","This is my first review on IMDb and it is just to express my bewilderment regarding the rating of this movie.<br/><br/>My issue with the film is that the tone of it feels off. Being filled with all the clichés already mentioned in many reviews, it would work great as a tongue-in-cheek B-movie type self-parody, but instead it attempts to take itself seriously, which leads to a very bizarre cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The film is set in the last weeks of the war, when, in truth, German forces were outnumbered, outgunned, demoralized and surrendering to the Americans in droves, as they knew that their treatment by the Russians would have been cruel. At this point of the war, no one wanted to do anything especially stupid, like get killed, as both sides knew the inevitable outcome of the war. Expecting the audience to fall for this story of battle-weary ragtag American underdogs fighting superior numbers and equipment comes across as being incredibly out of touch, and it makes you question whether the production team really did any homework on this.<br/><br/>The clichés would have been great entertainment if the film was more ""Expendables"" than the Normandy aftermath scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"". The historical inaccuracies and outright shortcuts, like experienced SS troops get their asses handed to them by one immobilized tank, cause spontaneous laughter, only to be followed up by Shia LaBeouf's best attempt at a thousand yard stare. It almost feels like the editing is at fault, but reflecting on what has happened earlier in the movie, you realize that these failures are not the result of an accident, but instead are in line with the director's vision.<br/><br/>For me, the pinnacle of the failures of the movie comes in the last moments of the film, where I thought I heard the SS officer rally his troops by yelling something along the lines of ""Sie sind untermensch!"" I seriously hope I misheard that, but in any case I let out a deep sigh. Germans hardly considered Americans to be sub-human, fascist doctrine mostly painted Slavs as servile sub-humans, so this rallying cry epitomizes how out of touch the film crew really was.<br/><br/>The film would have worked for me, and for many others I think, if the cast were set as German Wehrmacht soldiers. From this point of view, it would have been a breeze to capture the senselessness of fighting on the losing side, of being under equipped and demoralized. All the same characters could have died and the new recruit could have lived, but it would have been somewhat believable if they wore German uniforms (think of the ending of ""Letters from Iwo Jima"").<br/><br/>This movie is not entertaining as every other scene simply takes you out of the story and you end up scratching your head in bewilderment.<br/><br/>For a serious look at desperate warfare, go watch the Finnish movie ""Talvisota"", or the German ""Stalingrad"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". For B-movie type self-parody, go watch ""Commando"". Fury is not the best of both worlds. Some things just do not mix.<br/><br/>5/10."

","Fury is a cliche-ridden, unrealistic, disturbing World War II film.<br/><br/>The film is disturbing not because of its violence and nature of war, but because of the view of the personalities we are presented with. At first we have to deal with an annoying character who won't do his job, has a tantrum and is responsible for fellow soldiers being killed. The rest of the crew turn out to be much much worse. The crazy nut job guy probably should of got a bullet in him by the kid. It's an action war film, so its engaging regardless, but the last battle scene is utterly ridiculous. If 200 troops can't take out one stationary tank, why are they walking down that road in the first place. Either you have the equipment to take it out or you don't. If you do, it shouldn't take long, if you don't, you don't engage with it. The best part of the film was with the two women, but it's all so fragile in its timing, if the crew walk in a bit earlier or they're in the building when it's hit or many of the situations where everyone around them is getting hit but them. It all would play out very differently. The enemy flashes a light on Norman under the tank at the end and pretends he sees nothing, they really should of come back and dragged him away. Why does it always have to be a happy ending. The crew that we are with are a vulgar bunch, yet the only depiction of the enemy is kind."

","Having just watched Fury I am now going to recruit as a tank man. It was a totally inspiring performance that left me cheering, crying and filled with patriotic pride. From the very beginning I could tell we were in for a roller-coaster of a ride, a war film of epic proportion. When Brad Pitt jumped off that tank and killed the Nazi I was thinking 'gentlemen the tone has been set'. Me and my fellow brothers in the room just looked at each other and nodded slowly through a haze of tobacco smoke. Later on the tank battles that followed were like being in a real tank battle yourself. Brad brought it to life with his blue steel looks and words. Without this vital ingredient the film would have been rather basic, similar to that other film 'Saving Private Bryan'. The dinner scene was beautiful and timed just right. The tension that had built up until that point was at bursting point and I remember standing up a few times clenching my fists only for my friend to place a hand on my shoulder and telling me to calm down and that a real warrior wears his pain. Even in times of war there can be beautiful things like an innocent woman falling in love with a hero. But as with war there is no time for rest and our tank crew was rushing off to save more innocents. A Tiger tank tried to get them (would have been nice to use a more realistic one) but failed. I seriously doubt it would have killed that many good guy tanks but it is a movie so we can except a few bent rules. But after this little distraction the lads were ready for their final mission. A mission that saved us all from Nazi rule. I don't want to ruin the end but it was amazing. At one point me and all my friends were shooting our rifles at the TV (not real ones, we're not stupid) that's how realistic the movie was. Wow. Anyway I'm off to watch this film again and again and again."

","There are A LOT of WWII movies out there, some obviously stand the test of time and have become benchmarks in modern film, while others only succeed in doing a disservice to the brave who fought during that war. <br/><br/>Fury lands pretty much in the middle if not swaying a bit towards bad. The production design was amazing and really captured the look of war torn Europe during the closing days of the war. Outside of that, this film lacks in almost every category.<br/><br/>First and foremost-- the speaking in this film was horrendous. The lingo from that time period is hard enough to understand with people speaking clearly if you're not familiar with the era. The main characters in this film used some of the worst accents I've ever heard. It's safe to say that a good 60% of the film, you can barely discern what's being said.<br/><br/>Next was the music, I don't know if the director was going for a dramatic effect, but the score was terrible and way over the top. A well done drama about such an important topic does not need music as a crutch. At times I felt like I was watching a video game.<br/><br/>Last but not least, this movie literally had no plot. It went from scene to scene, with none being related to each other in any way at all. One scene takes up a large portion of the film and had nothing to do with the ending at all! There was no character development, no back story. Nothing. I don't even know what Pitt's character's name even was.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you're debating on whether or not to see it, I say save your money. You're not missing much."

My main problem is that the movie wants to be somewhat epic, but the story just seemed so arbitrary. It's a hard war with stupid Germans and mythical non-human SS. They get orders to take some town, then have a forced dinner party with some gentle raping (she likes it), then they have to go and save some people we never see or care about. (this is a MOVIE, we can't just be told this) The other tanks get destroyed by a (again) stupid German tank, who refuses to use his advantage, the long range gun. Run head on, you fanatical arrogant nazi übermensch! Nobody is afraid of dying here, non-humans as they are. They survive, drive on, and soon is immobilized by a mine on some road somewhere. Here, on this dirt road, after no build-up or reason we as an audience can feel, they suddenly want to commit a heroic defense/suicide. Because Americans are really tough when it comes to a good cause? They felt so awfully invested in human rights and freedom, killing, laughing, pillaging and raping all the way. The have fought many years, but on this dirt-road, they plan to make a last stance? 'Oh, right, it was a sentence somewhere about someone needing to be defended..?'. I mean, realistically, would a ww2 tank commander expect to stop a force of several hundred SS with panzerfausts, with a limp tank? Oh, it's a good cause, and then they can beat all odds, audiences love inspiring messages. If you believe..! <br/><br/>And then a predictable boring battle ensues, with the crew dying as heroes for 'our freedom', killing faceless hordes of stunt-men playing evil Germans who can't use the anti-tank weapons they all carry. With this kill-ratio, they should have only needed some 50 tanks to destroy the entire German army. And I might add, always cast people who look bad or evil as the enemy, then we as audience feel it's okay. <br/><br/>And that bumbling new crew-member, he went from scared, to traumatized (forced to shoot POW so he learns to kill and end the war faster?, i'd like to hear this logic applied in Iraq), then to really enjoying killing 'nazis', and in the evening, wanting to die with his dear tank commander. Really? Does he have Stockholm syndrome? Goldfish-memory?<br/><br/>But war is hell, or something.. This was no Saving Ryan or BOB, just a expensive look-alike.

For the most part you wouldn't bring any of them home to marry your daughter but they were a good bunch for the task at hand: war. War is ugly, so were they. War is uncouth, so were they. War is something you like to keep far away from home, as were they.<br/><br/>It wasn't a superhero story though there was some heroism.

"deacon_blues-3","9","9","18","23 July 2015"," A moving epic of brotherhood and valor
","I have read the many vicious negative reviews for this film, and I must say that I am at a loss to understand most of the complaints. <br/><br/>Many condemned the film as unrealistic. I find this hard to believe, since I have seen almost every WW2 film ever made, including documentaries that used actual war footage, and I found this film to be perhaps the most exciting and realistic one that has ever been made.<br/><br/>Consider: This is the only film to ever use an actual, working tiger tank, as well as actual, working Sherman's. In addition, the cast was trained by navy seals and army rangers in an 8-week boot-camp. The main cast was also trained in how to operate, drive, and fire the main Sherman, dubbed ""Fury."" In many scenes the actors themselves were actually operating a real Sherman tank during the live filming. The cast was also coached by four actual surviving WW2 2nd armored division veterans in their 90s to find out what actually being in combat was like, and to what lengths some of them had to go under extreme wartime conditions. Watch the special features on the blu-ray edition, and you will see how much painstaking care was taken by the production crew to present a realistic image of WW2 combat conditions.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that most of the negative reviewers are not actual WW2 2nd armored division veterans, since there are only the 4 who consulted on this film still living; yet they posture themselves as experts. I can only assume that these people are armchair, primarily book-informed ideologues who think too much of their own second-hand expertise. <br/><br/>Some reviewers complained about the language and behavior of the characters in the film, as if WW2 soldiers did not use profanity or vulgar innuendo, did not have illicit sex with European women, never shot prisoners, and were all Christian, god-fearing, faithful husbands. From all the evidences that I have ever considered on this war, their assertions simply do not hold water, and seem to deny any semblance of reality. Just because they were the greatest generation does not mean that they were all sainted, tee-totaling, Bible quoting, refined gentlemen. <br/><br/>The Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier character was a chain-gang prisoner who was given the option of hard labor in prison or fighting and dying for his country. It is conclusive that many actual soldiers were in fact from such a background, and it is hard to imagine such people not using profanity, and engaging in many unethical activities under the extreme duress experienced during actual wartime.<br/><br/>The tank battle scene was perhaps somewhat unrealistic, but when one considers the fact that there were only a hand-full of tigers left by the stage of the war depicted in this film, and that Germany had run out of experienced tank soldiers and would have been manning tanks with teenagers and even perhaps young girls, the idea that a tiger would not be able to destroy all the Sherman's, which was the usual outcome throughout most of the war, is not so far-fetched after all. Besides, the Fury's crew were portrayed as being highly experienced in fighting German tanks back to the battles in Northern Africa, so again, the idea that they would be able to at least narrowly survive such an encounter with a tiger while sustaining substantial damages, is really not so unrealistic as some reviewers assume.<br/><br/>I do admit that I was a bit troubled by the fact that the SS battalion was initially presented as marching toward the Fury carrying what were obviously many anti-tank weapons, yet when they actually began fighting the Fury's crew it seemed to take the Germans a long time to resort to actually using these bazookas against the Fury. But I suppose some license had to be allowed for to make for an exciting final conflict, and for that I cannot fault the filmmakers too much. Perhaps the Germans were so surprised and scattered by the ruse used by the Fury's crew that they had no time to coordinate such an attack? Whatever the excuse, the final battle is one of the most poignant and moving battle scenes ever filmed, in my extensive experience of watching many other WW2 films.<br/><br/>Some reviewers found the ending, where Norman survives even though he is discovered by an SS soldier who then inexplicably never reports finding him, preposterous. But I personally do not. I imagine that there were many reluctant recruits in the German army and even in the SS during this very late stage of the war; and, realizing that such a survivor was worthy of some deference for the courage of mounting such a suicidal defense of that strategic crossroads, decided mercifully not to reveal his whereabouts.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I find the observations of the negative reviewers less than compelling, while the film itself I find enormously compelling from start to finish.<br/><br/>Fury will forever hold a lasting, memorable place in my experiences of WW2 films; and I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>So there!"
"bobsgrock","Null","12","26","21 October 2014"," FUBAR in the ranks
","In this post 9/11 era, war has reinvented itself as a morally righteous act, no matter the outcome or manner in which it is executed. The movies have reinforced this notion with films like Fury, a World War II adventure attempting to scale the heights of Saving Private Ryan or Platoon though ultimately regressing to its own variation of gratuitous carnage and destruction. Such films seem to have a chip on their shoulders; how does one portray an event so ubiquitous to modern culture and so thoroughly researched by historians as to give us a new angle and understanding of the dimensions of such an atrocious existence? This answer may never be reached, although Fury does make a noble endeavor to proclaim the bravery and courage of the American military, in this case the US Armored Division.<br/><br/>Writer-director David Ayer, who has progressed from writing pulpy action scripts like The Fast and the Furious and S.W.A.T. to those of a more serious tone, nevertheless cannot seem to forget his roots as an action first, character second kind of filmmaker. Ayer has constantly focused on the 'brotherhood' of his characters, but that may be all he has to say about them. The four men occupying the tank in this film say they have been together since the Allied invasion of Africa, yet little else is mentioned about this. Furthermore, the script borrows far too much material outright from Saving Private Ryan, right down to the main characteristics of the main roles. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is the quiet, unspoken father figure whose troops are willing to die with him (just like Tom Hanks). Shia LaBeouf is the Bible-quoting gunman who seems to have almost supernatural-like aim (just like Barry Pepper). And Logan Lerman is the young, totally inexperienced new addition to the tank who has not been trained for such an assignment but ultimately proves himself through a baptism of fire (just like Jeremy Davies). <br/><br/>Does Ayer believe most of those who go to see this will have never seen Spielberg's earlier film, or does he simply not care about the similarities? It may be that he feels the message of such a story overrides any other details, ultimately rendering them unnecessary and minimal. However, other sequences are either taken directly from Saving Private Ryan and other such films, or seem to have little to no basis in reality or logic. One that many will call to mind is when Wardaddy and the newly hired Norman invade a German apartment after taking the town. They stake out the room, find two young women, force them to cook breakfast until the rest of the tank crew, drunk and disorderly, barge in and cause discomfort and awkwardness. What does Ayer believe this sequence says about the relationship between American soldiers and German civilians? The film says nothing, although given the manner in which it is shot, this seems to be a badge of honor rather than a criticism. <br/><br/>Whatever the director's attitude towards such scenarios, the actors certainly give their fullest involvement. Pitt has ensured his lasting stardom through roles like this: brash, tough, yet endearing to the younger generation looking up to him. LaBeouf, for the first time in quite awhile, shows his true acting ability when he can remain focused and under control. His role is not huge but he plays it as serious and focused as can be expected. Lerman may be the weakest link, overreaching in his portrayal of an inexperienced, frightened clerk thrust into the deepest and ugliest recesses of the battlefront. He has his tough moments to be sure, but ultimately becomes somewhat cartoonish. <br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the film is its action sequences, which may be all Ayer and audiences will care about or take from watching the film. Certainly they leave one completely entranced and utterly aghast. The showdown between our beloved American tank and an advanced German Panzer is fully engrossing and great fun to watch. Yet, is it supposed to be this enjoyable? The final sequence as well shows our heroes surrounded by an SS brigade trapped in their broken-down tank as they attempt to fight their way out, willing to die but only by taking as many Germans with them as possible. Such scenes ultimately begin to feel like video game set-ups. We cheer quietly and feel relieved at the sight and sound of every enemy soldier whose head explodes or is cut down by bullets at such a speed as to look like a fight scene from Star Wars. <br/><br/>The greatest difference between Ayer and Steven Spielberg is that Spielberg never tries to excite the viewer through carnage. He is able to do this with less emphasis on grotesque shots of mutilated bodies and fiery crashes and more of a focus on the psychological and spiritual effects of war on the individual. Fury, for all its artistic merit and genuine entertainment, would rather bombard the audience with gore than invite a thought-provoking stimulus. For Ayer, the humanity of war remains out of reach, or perhaps not near at all. This film ultimately tells us war is hell; such a statement is one of the great understatements of history. Will future war films, with all the knowledge and understanding of hindsight at their fingertips, ever give us more than such a simplistic denouement or a visual repetition of events which need not be pounded into the brain?"

","The movie starts off well enough but soon failed to provide enough excitement, and scenes that should have been emotionally engaging left me detached from the characters. Most of the action did not deliver - it wasn't tense or edge-of-your seat and by the time the final battle scene came around, I didn't care enough for any of the characters to care whether any of them died or not. For me, Saving Private Ryan is an example of an excellent war movie. This was way out of that league and if I rate Saving Private Ryan a 9/10, then to me, Fury is a 4/10. I would recommend waiting for this one on blu-ray/DVD and instead go back and watch Saving Private Ryan again."

","Although well acted and shot with technical detail, Ayers ""Fury"" sacrifice realism and thought- provoking war commentary for clichéd story telling.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest sin of ""Fury"" is its lack of faith in audience wit. One scene stands out as particularly clichéd. When Don and Norman enter the home of two German women, we as an audience are not at all surprised at how the scenario plays out. Gender roles are immediately assigned as Don and Norman watch the two women make them dinner. Don then suggests Norman have sex with the younger of the two, and all of a sudden two enemies become consensually intimate partners (I understand that this type of scenario was common, with American soldiers bedding German women, but I find it hard to believe the scenario would play out like a romantic drama after knowing each other for a whole 30 seconds). Of course, this is done because Norman has to be the good protagonist that we relate to, rather than the ""animal"" of the character Grady. Wouldn't you know that Grady and his gang show up and of course ruin everything (after all Grady is the animal) and reassure us that Norman is good. Immediately following this sequence, the German town is shelled, and oh no! Normans love interest is dead, buried in a pile of rubble (face up of course, we can't possibly recognize her without the facial features. I mean geez its been a whole 2 minutes since she was last on screen! was she blonde or brunette? I can't remember!) and we understand ""oh ya. War is bad"". <br/><br/>Very few creative liberties are taken with this film, and that is why it will go down in history as just another World War 2 film. Nothing new here folks."

He receives the rookie soldier Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) as the substitute for his deceased gunner and he tries to harden the youth along the battles. <br/><br/>""Fury"" is a war film with despicable characters and ridiculous situation in a stupid and unrealistic conclusion. The boastful nationalism of the writer and director David Ayer is laughable and the final scene with the five American soldiers fighting against hundreds German soldiers with a damaged tank is hilarious. However the production is careful in details. The execution of the German soldier and the behavior of Don's soldiers in the house of the German ladies is something that unfortunately happened during the occupation of Germany. However they are not shown in most of the American films that usually blame Russian soldiers only for rape and violence against civilian population and German soldiers for war crimes. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Corações de Ferro"" (""Iron Hearts"")"
"p-jonsson","4","10","22","29 March 2015"," I cannot say that I liked this movie very much.
","I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.<br/><br/>I can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.<br/><br/>The movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the ""heroes"" are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where ""Wardaddy"" forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I'll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.<br/><br/>Having said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.<br/><br/>The ""last stand"" at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our ""heroes"" have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.<br/><br/>The ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed."
"davidjjey","2","10","22","3 January 2015"," Wants to have it both ways, but ultimately fails at both
","Most of the negative reviews here have focused on how unrealistic the battles were, especially the last one. Or other aspects of the story for that matter - realism seems to be a huge picking point for many (and I'm not surprised at this).<br/><br/>For me, yes the clichéd and ridiculous ending was a poor way to finish the film - but I had a bigger (but perhaps connected) problem way before this.<br/><br/>The movie sets out to show us that war is horrific - and some shots really worked in that respect, really impacting me as intended (the tank rolling over the rapidly breaking up corpse for example...a truly ghastly image). So this is the gritty realism the makers and actors talked about.<br/><br/>But then the ending is just Hollywood nonsense all the way...sooo, the reason why that doesn't work is this: you can't put me through watching realistic horror-after-horror without a point. The point is ""war is horrific""? Please, thanks to some excellent war movies (and novels, documentaries, etc) over the years, we're well aware of the horrors of war. And that's why some reviewers have speculated this ultra-detailed devastation of people is as much voyeuristic as anything else. <br/><br/>Another example (definitely spoiler for this btw) of the film wanting to have it both ways is the frustrating scene with the two German women. We know the director can't have a major character and popular actor in Pitt either rape or allow someone else to rape the beautiful German women (so the final outcome's pretty predictable) - but Pitt's character basically says to his newbie recruit 'despite no indication this girl here would be willing, I'm gonna have sex with her if you don't'. Then he goes back to protecting the women when his scurvy crew show up. And what, the girl has sex with the new recruit cos he plays piano, Pitt gives her some eggs, and......um, they didn't rape her? Seriously, wtf Hollywood.<br/><br/>Of course we don't want one dimensional characters, so it's good to show shades of grey in a character, but you can't contradict yourself if you do. The whole scene just felt very contrived, to 'create tension', and provide the super convenient reason for the newbie to finally learn to love ""killin' Nazis"" (oops, wrong film?!). <br/><br/>On that note, the lack of time seeing the newbie actually develop, and in fact the timeline of the whole movie was terrible. The newb went from not having a clue to totally competent tank-soldier in basically two fights. I was really looking forward to a take on what combat in a tank would be like, and actually I thought this was going to be the point of the movie - show us the psychological world of living and fighting in a tank. Some of the action did tick that box for me...but otherwise, over the short time we spent with them, they seemed to be out of the tank just as often as they were in it! Das Boot this was not, lol. Makes you wonder why the director (David Ayer) made the actors prepare by living in the tank (including defecation!)...and he boasts about getting what he wants from actors, lol.<br/><br/>But if it was to make them into a bunch of miserable bastards then sure, that worked...but while I get it that we're supposed to see densitised men here, there's got to be *something* good about them we can like otherwise why should we care? Which reminds me, the amount of super obvious excuses provided for viciously ""killin Nazis"" was ridiculous. OK, we get it, Nazis are bad, SS just aren't human, yes you can now go and kill them any way you like for our entertainment, bla bla w/e. You know, it would never fly with Hollywood, but we really could do with a movie that shows WWII from the German side.<br/><br/>Last but not least - Ayer did something similar with End of Watch. Horrific atrocities laid on thick so you are constantly shocked by the violence and have no doubts who the bad guys are, topped off with an against-all-odds battle at the end. This is a very limited director with a nasty take on cinema, whose films I will not be paying to see, ever. A bit disturbing the ratings it's got here, and on RT."

None of the emotional scenes had any added value, except creating annoyance (""what were the Germans DOING while you are all happily chatting in there?""). I could not relate to the emotions of any of the crew.<br/><br/>One thing I do wish to rectify about the ""cowardly"" shooting of the surrendered German: it is quite legal -and was quite common- to execute enemy soldiers posing as allies by wearing enemy uniforms.

The action scene where the tanks were ""jousting"" with the German Tiger tank was excellent and one of the highlights of the film for me. However the scene where he was spared by a member of a crack SS squadron beggared belief and was an poor attempt a counterpoint to the scene where he was forced to shoot the unarmed German soldier.

This movie WILL polarize people as they react differently to what they see and I believe that is the point. It further pushes home the old adage of ""War is hell"". I have always wanted to see a more human portrayal of war and I found it in Fury. This goes far further than Saving Private Ryan in that respect. I applaud the guts it took to make this movie."
"Stephen_BU","10","12","28","14 November 2014"," Great movie, harsh critics of this movie need to relax
","I loved this movie for it's different portrayal of WWII from the view of the 2nd armored division. This was the first WWII movie I have seen were the majority of the action sequences take place from inside a tank. The action sequences were intense, and this movie is very dark and violent. The violence is pretty intense, but I feel that it is necessary to tell the story of how crappy (huge understatement) these young men had it in WWII. I very much enjoyed this film and will be purchasing it when it comes out on blu ray.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: I was very surprised to see the amount of 2-3 star ratings that this movie had in it's review section towards the top. I feel that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you are going to rip this movie, have a good reason. The only criticism I see from this movie is that it's cliché... I swear.. every other negative review on this site says that something's cliché... THAT'S Cliché!"

","My father and I both saw this together and being amateur movie critics, and just lovers of good cinema we both walked out praising this movie. <br/><br/>The opening scene with baron landscape was a great way to start the film as well as the title sequence. Throughout the movie I was visually impressed with the graphical nature of the violence while still being realistic, along with the grey dull filter of the whole film. Another fantastic scene in my personal opinion was the dinner scene where the tension was so intense I felt awkward watching it (in a good way). <br/><br/>The final standoff I thought was a great conclusion to the film, the tank's peeling paint after the shoot out and the final birds eye scene seeing the dead SS was a great finisher, even the credits were well displayed. <br/><br/>I will have a little bit of criticism, the opening scene when the the new recruit had to clean out the tank, seeing the face with an eye I personally thought wasn't realistic in the sense, a nose or more skin, and secondly was the burns on Brad Pitts back were too perfect. However those two things were not worthy of subtracting a star, just nitpicking. <br/><br/>Fury has delivered some of the best all-around theater I have personally seen this year and praise the cast and crew for producing this fantastic movie."
"peterh-140-934029","4","14","34","23 October 2014"," Overblown, overlong and short on storyline
","Having read so much about this film and heard a lot of good reviews, I went to see it when it opened last night with anticipation. What a disappointment.<br/><br/>Comparing this film, as many have, to other great WW2 films or TV series, such as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, is to be thoroughly disingenuous to those classics. Fury is weak on storyline and doesn't hold you as the viewer with any believable grip. It certainly doesn't 'redefine the genre' as many have written.<br/><br/>Above all else, it is a study of the ferocity of war and what that does to the human mind, but that is probably the only element I came away actually thinking about.<br/><br/>But a film needs to be more than that. For me it failed to engage me, didn't allow me to believe in the main characters and could easily have been shorter without impacting the overall impression. Brad Pitt's performance has been lauded, but I can't see why. Alongside performances of those such as Damian Lewis or Ron Livingstone in Band of Brothers, it pales into mediocre.<br/><br/>One man can't make a film, and Fury demonstrates that like few others I've seen. Worth a watch, but its no masterpiece and there are plenty of other films of the genre that will engage you far more."
"damien0215","10","8","17","14 April 2016"," Disturbingly Realistic
","The problem with this movie for most is its strength to others: it's realistic. Too realistic for Hollywood. In a great war movie, the viewer should NOT want to be in the protagonist's shoes, and Brad Pitt's character was certainly not in an enviable position when the credits rolled. As a veteran, I usually hate war movies and find myself yelling ""That would NEVER happen"" at the screen - that didn't occur (much) when watching ""Fury.""<br/><br/>Negatives: The growth of the kid (Norman) was too rapid and the bond formed too quickly. He went from a soft, sobbing fool to an experienced, steely-eyed operator in like a day and a half. It just doesn't happen like that. However, I understand for the purpose of the movie it needed to. The only other detracting point was the final battle. Germans racked up a high kill to death ratio in WW2, and say what you want of the evils of the Nazi, but they were good warfighters and WOULDN'T have mounted a direct infantry charge on a tank. Snipers (plural) would have been set up long before the end, but again, it was a necessary part of the story for it to not have gone that way immediately.<br/><br/>Positives: gruesome in an un-fun way. Getting shot isn't just a puff of red mist and someone falling peacefully to the ground – It's chunks of torn meat, broken bones, sobbing and agony. ""Fury"" was able to capture that in a realistic way. It set the pace immediately – a gory, knife-through-the-eye killing with visceral sounds and an abrupt realization of how quickly the end can come. The majority of the ""new"" characters introduced throughout the film were killed, oftentimes in a brutal way, very quickly and without warning, as is true with war. I don't think anyone rational walked away from ""Fury"" wishing they had been part of an American tank crew during World War 2, and that's the point.<br/><br/>Actors: Brad Pitt and Shia LeBeouf were both phenomenal. For point of personal bias, I normally despise Shia and I even have to admit that he acted this role brilliantly. Pitt's character is a complex man who objectively acknowledges the necessity of killing and brutality, but is haunted by it, and flashes of his feelings are seen enough and in such a way as to show believable depth.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie as long as one isn't picking it as a date-night flick to set the mood, and if it does, you have real problems."

","Perhaps the biggest surprise in Fury is how the last wave of murderous Nazis is not led by Hitler himself, with Brad Pitt's heroic Sarge chucking a spear at Adolf and nearly killing him.<br/><br/>A movie with major identity problems, Fury starts off as some kind of Casualties Of War drama with a wide-eyed rookie (Logan Lerman) pushed around by hardened comrades and a ruthless sergeant; then, with a complete 180, it turns into over-the-top schlock as Pitt and his men slaughter like a million enemies who charge at them with much trampling of boots and ominous singing - there is a priceless bit when the approaching Germans sound like they are intoning the Carmina Burana acappella style. The last act plays like a zombie movie, as the scarred, barking Nazis besiege the protagonists, whose brave deeds are accompanied by a soundtrack of heroic trumpets and mournful strings. It's so portentous I chuckled quite a bit, such as when a shovel-wielding Nazi dives into the tank attempting to club Pitt.<br/><br/>The best sequence is a tense confrontation between tanks attempting to outmaneuver each other. It's a solid set-piece, and lacks the rah-rah rhetoric of the final battle.<br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie was painfully bad. As I say, it is both dumb and ugly. The dumb parts at least provide some (unintentional) chuckles. In the absurd climatic battle sequence the action starts in broad daylight, there's lots of shooting, and next thing you know there a battle raging (between one broken down American tank and a battalion of Waffen SS) at nighttime. The Germans are, naturally, atrociously bad shots. Although the historical reality is that the sky over Germany in April 1945 was swarming with Allied fighters and fighter-bombers to the point that German troops could hardly move except at nighttime, in this flick the Germans move around unhindered.<br/><br/>You're wondering about the plot? Don't look for anything resembling a plot, because there is none.<br/><br/>As for the ""ugly"" part, I'm going to be very charitable and assume the people who made this piece of garbage did not INTEND to make the Nazis seem like the good guys and the US Army look like a bunch of deranged psychopaths. That's what they did do however. We get to see the Americans murdering prisoners and raping women - and its not even presented in a negative light, you almost get the impression we're supposed to approve of these war crimes. The only act of mercy which makes an appearance is when an SS man spots the lone survivor of our tank crew in hiding - and decides to pretend not to see him.<br/><br/>For some reason the first review which everyone sees when they come here to look up this movie is one of the very few to give it a high rating, even though that review itself has been given a very poor rating. What's up with that, IMDb?"

There were many controversial scenes in this movie that just made it unrealistic, over the top, and just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt forcing the new guy to kill a surrendering German soldier in front of about 20-30 other GI's made me sick. Brad Pitt tells the new guy he promised to get his crew out of the war alive. Duhhhhhh.<br/><br/>The whole scene in the apartment with the German women was absurd. Brad Pitt just wanted to play house for a while for some unknown reason while the new guy fell in love. Then the misfit tank crew shows up and we get to see them act like animals and take about horse slaughter. You have to haze and shame the new guy after all. I hated the Mexican guy, the Jesus freak and the redneck. All the perfect cliché.<br/><br/>After being such an a-hole to the new guy Brad Pitt decided to take him under his wing and be his daddy figure. Then comes the ridiculous ending. The new guy is on lookout and sees hundreds of Germans approaching and runs back to tell the crew. Apparently the Germans march real slow because the crew debate and ultimately prepare for some epic battle to defend an intersection in the road. Not a bridge like in Private Ryan, which made sense. Remember, Brad Pitt wanted his men to survive, but in this particular instance retreat is not an option, despite what the outcome was likely going to be. Totally stupid and unrealistic. Despite all this chaos they somehow manage to have heart to heart moments in the tank during the battle. <br/><br/>One of the worst movies I've ever seen."

","Actually, not a bad movie. I am surprised by the large number of scathing user reviews. There are also some very positive reviews, but fewer of them. I suppose the picture is polarizing. I won't say much about the story, so as not to spoil. Just that it's about a small, lonely American tank unit battling its way across Germany during the last few months of World War Two. Lots of violence, but not gratuitous violence. Perhaps the last shoot-out is somewhat over the top. But there is an excellent scene where the invading Americans mix it up with German civilians (women). A good treatment of the good and bad impulses that are both present in the hearts of these brave soldiers. A good treatment of the ""uncivilizing"" process undergone by a rookie soldier (part well played by Logan Lerman). As I said, not a bad movie. It seems to me that many of the overly critical reviewers are confusing their own political feelings with their assessment of the movie's merits (or lack thereof). I am as much against war as the next person; I am close to being a pacifist (and by the way, I grew up in central Europe during World War Two). Yet, I feel that ""Fury"" deserves credit for its nuanced portrayal of these ""warriors."""

","Perfect films are those that we will always remember, and Fury isn't one of it. However, it's a very good movie, with a right message about the war. This is the best of Fury, it shows the meaning of the war, shows that war changed people, shows that all American soldiers didn't act well and all German soldiers didn't act wrong. That's the main difference between Fury and others conventional war movies. Secondly, all the actors act so well, especially Brad Pitt which with the awesome scenery provides accuracy to the film. On the other hand, the soundtrack could be better, in fact, is the worst of the film, is the reason that I give Fury a nine and not a ten.

The Germans are desperate and even recruit children to their army. That is where the film takes place. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to everybody. With its very strong visuals and dialogues it perfectly shows how terrible war is (and it's not ""over americanized"" like for example ""Saving Private Ryan"") and how hopeless young soldiers are who are there against their will. Here I have to mention the acting of Logan Lerman who was perfect in his role. The other actors were also brilliant. The always criticized Shia LaBeouf really confuted and probably silenced his critics. Brad Pitt also produced one of his best performances. Michael Pena seems to have made a hit and Jon Bernthal showed us that there is life after The Walking Dead.<br/><br/>The sound mixing and editing is the same quality as it was in ""Gravity"" which film's composer Steven Price has done a great job again with an excellent and powerful soundtrack. The directing was also great. This was the most noticeable in the fight scenes. Those were extremely thrilling and well-done.

","We're going to be doing one thing, and one thing only: killin' Nazis.<br/><br/>Whoops, wrong movie! Brad Pitt stars and leads the expertly cast David Ayer feature film Fury. Told toward the end of the war, Fury is a sufficiently good war movie but unfortunately is underwhelming, at no fault of its own.<br/><br/>Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, played by Brad Pitt, is the battle-hardened army sergeant leading a Sherman tank and his crew through German warfare in 1945. His platoon has been together for over three years and fighting Germans across three countries, and he made a promise to keep them alive. A rookie soldier, played by Logan Lerman, is enlisted to join their group and promptly disrupts the accord. American forces are outnumbered and outgunned but they soldier on against overwhelming odds to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Writer/Director David Ayer's script and film Fury of 2014 is typical of an Ayer production. It features subtly nuanced archetypes of the hyper-masculine male in a high intensity environment that does not romanticize the violence experienced when in said circumstances.<br/><br/>Fury itself is especially well researched and transports the viewer to the horrors of American warfare of the second World War against Nazi Germany. The plot of Fury is a journey across the German landscape through the end of the war. It is also a journey of the characters as they are transformed by the combat battles of war. Ayer also utilizes his direction of the cinematography for beautiful but brutal shots to differentiate Fury from the more sentimental WWII films. Besides these key aspects and the notable first thirty minutes of Fury, the film is about as cliché as possible when it comes to a period-piece war film.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal all do a commendable job as the weary soldiers. However, the characters are nothing new and are even roles they themselves have previously portrayed. This just exacerbates the stale sense of the film. With almost 70 years passing since the end of WWII, Fury is not distinctive enough to elevate the film above its predecessors.<br/><br/>Fury (2014) is a good and entertaining film that will please viewers, especially the untapped male audience who will especially be engaged with the film.<br/><br/>For more reviews of RECENT RELEASES, check out our WEBSITE."
"fathersonholygore","10","10","23","1 December 2014"," Ayer's FURY is a grim look at the reality of war
","David Ayer's new thriller Fury is by far one of the most brutal and honest films set during the Second World War ever made. Not only does it present the agony of war, it also works as a great character piece. Brad Pitt leads the cast as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, a sergeant who rides aboard the titular tank, Fury. Alongside him are his three most trusted men. However, after one of those men dies the crew is saddled with a fresh young army recruit (Lerman) hauled from desk duty to fight in the second Battalion. The five men continue through Germany together, killing every Nazi they find, and try to hold onto their humanity in the face of war and death.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful and everything feels very real (this also marks the first time an actual Tiger tank has been used on a movie set). Ayer shot with film instead of digitally, which gives Fury a very bleak, grim feeling as the tanks and the troops behind them trek through miles of mud. The way it's filmed gives an almost nostalgic feel reminiscent of other great war pictures. No doubt there will be more than a few comparisons to the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film, Saving Private Ryan. Regardless of its predecessors, however, this film holds its own as one of the best World War II films out there.<br/><br/>Fury is not delegated solely to bombs, bullets, and the horrific images of war. Ayer wonderfully crafts the film from its opening with a blurry shot of a figure on horseback. It moves slowly through an area where a fight has recently occurred. Bodies lay everywhere. Ashes and fire are all around. The figure, a German, comes into view riding a pale white horse: one of the Four Horsemen, symbolizing death. Wardaddy ambushes the man, killing him, and sends the horse on its way. For a moment he has driven death out. Later, we see the white horse again galloping away once more. When the film nears a close you begin to understand Ayer's use of symbolism.<br/><br/>Fury is mainly about what war does to those who engage in and are surrounded by it. It is a film about men trying to hold onto their humanity under the most gruelling conditions. One of the central struggles of the characters is their justification of death as preventing worse deaths for others. How does a man keep on being human even after holding a gun to another man's head and pulling the trigger? And what if a man is forced to do that is worse? Ayer explores these dilemmas throughout the film with help of some stellar acting on all parts.<br/><br/>Pitt earns his keep as a continually interesting actor. His portrayal of Wardaddy is fairly subtle and restrained. He looks and acts the part of a haunted war veteran. In solitary moments where the camera sticks on him Pitt conveys a side of war not often seen, as he fights with the emotion inside him trying to escape. The supporting cast is just as top notch. Shia LaBeouf proves capable of playing a quiet character instead of the usual loud cockiness he displays. Joe Bernthal, best known from AMC's The Walking Dead and Michael Peňa who starred in Ayer's earlier film End of Watch, are both in fine form playing men who have seen and done too much to simply return to normal after the war is over. However, it is Logan Lerman that really shines. Playing the rookie soldier on the tank crew alongside Pitt, he displays great acting talent, and conveys the terror of many young men drafted and thrust into battle during World War II without ever having so much as fired a gun. Overall the main cast works together to depict the weary strain of war on those who've fought.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend Fury enough. The cinematography is something to behold and really captures the grit of World War II's muddy trenches. There are fairly divided opinions on both Shia LaBeouf and Brad Pitt, and depending on which side you fall it could skew how the movie plays, but I believe they each put in a fantastic performance here. This is a tightly scripted film driven by the emotional force of the actors.<br/><br/>There are countless war movies out there. What sets one apart from the pack is its honesty. Ayer pulls no punches about the realities of war from the script to the action sequences. Many war veterans often say that the real heroes never came home, and Fury is a cinematic testament to this statement."

","As other reviews have stated: grit and dirt are shown realistically, and so is to some extent the feeling of advancing under constant threat. Sound effects are fantastic. The acting is genuinely great too. Unfortunately, the script and dialogue are full of clichés and the resolution of the movie becomes more and more predictable until you just want it to be done with already. It's a classic hero's apprentice journey movie, Joseph Campbell and all. The weary old master, who puts his men through it all and who must die at the end. The greenhorn who grows emotionally through untold horrors. The final sacrifice, against all odds. The unlikely survivor, of course, the greenhorn. etc etc. It's amazing how such great acting means absolutely nothing in the face of a pathetic script. It's amazing how a bitter war movie with hundreds of corpses strewn manages to leave you emotionally flat, and not raise your heart rate at any time in two hours. It's not exactly boring, for that there is too much action happening. But it is so unrealistic, in character development and dialogue, that you just don't develop any emotional rapport with the doomed characters. So you never start truly caring. I expected a lot more from the movie's description."

","Spoilers!!<br/><br/>This is my first review on IMDb and i really felt i had to write one about ""Fury"" because the movie really let me down. I went to the cinema with my dad and a friend of mine and all 3 of us thought the movie was extremely unrealistic. I have read many ""Fury"" reviews on this site and quite a lot of people are complaining about the acting, especially Brad Pitts' work. I didn't think the acting was all that bad, it depends on what the director wants the actor to portray.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie are the action scenes, sure it looks realistic with all the bullets and shells flying around, but when it comes to military tactics the action was retarded:<br/><br/><ul><li>when the Americans attack the Germans who are hiding between the trees and who are equipped with anti-tank weapons, the Germans seem to miss EVERY shot. There is a tank driving through open terrain, you are an anti-tank gunner who has probably been fighting for a while but still you miss this huge metal machine which is moving without any cover over and over again, very unrealistic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the fight with the Tiger was pure Walt Disney fantasy. First the Americans deploy a smoke screen and fall back, instead of using this momentum to attack. After this they attack the Tiger head-on. The tiger blows away the two Shermans driving on each side of ""Fury"" (which is realistic) but somehow it fails to make a dent in the tank of our super hero tankcrew. In real life, 1 shot of a Tiger would cut through a Sherman like a hot knife through butter! (do some research guys). After this, Fury tries to get behind the Tiger and this veteran German tank crew just lets this happen instead of turning their tank! Unbelievable!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the final scene is the worst! about 200-300 battle hardened SS soldiers attack ""Fury"" like a terrible 90's action movie. They don't take any cover, don't use and basic military tactics but just run straight into the machineguns of the tank which is insane. During the fight we see the Germans opening up some boxes containing 10+ Panzerfausts but they use only 2-3, why??? </li></ul><br/><br/>There are more moments in this movie which make no sense, like the fact that the Germans throw 2 grenades in ""Fury"" but these take like more than 30 seconds to explode, just enough time for Brad to have a heart warming conversation with the newcomer and to show him an escape hatch which he climbs out off. After this an SS soldier sees the surviving American but lets him live??? He climbs back in and there is Brad, resting like a fallen angel with some scratches on his face.... 2 GRENADES EXPLODED RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, HIS GUTS SHOULD BE HANGING ALL OVER THE TANK, WHAT WAS THE DIRECTOR THINKING?<br/><br/>All in all, a terrible movie. I don't understand why people give this movie such a high rating because of the ""realistic"" portrayal of warfare or because they like the sound effects etc, please people don't rate these kind of shitty movies so high because it lowers the standards of quality film making!"

"CinePendejo","8","6","12","5 March 2016"," The best war movie of 2014
","I am not exaggerating with the title there. Considering the shallow 300 RISE OF AN EMPIRE, the even more shallow American SNIPER, to the serviceable UNBROKEN, it seems like 2014 has conjured quite an abundance of underwhelming war movies. That is not to be expected, since at the time we have been engaged in an actual war, and the prospect of delving into war movies that might draw comparisons to real situations seemed much of a stretch, even compared to war movies back in the 20th century. <br/><br/>However, there is one war movie that stuck out from the crowd, not so much by story and character, but by grit, depth, and the ability to go full-force with what results from such war that parallels the current one so well. That movie is FURY, directed by David Ayer. Despite a few missteps, this movie easily accomplishes what most war movies sorely lack in this time. <br/><br/>POSITIVE: Say what you will about David Ayer, he is one clever man. Most of what I desire from his movies is added depth and tangibility for otherwise sick and depraved people. With TRAINING DAY taking a good-cop/bad-cop story and creating smart, insightful deconstruction of right-abusing cops and ""by-the-books"" moral ism that somehow makes us root for the characters, even when on the edge of degradation. Thankfully,FURY is no different. These characters, however done to death, are greatly humanized thanks to the script and the conditions they must adhere to. Brad Pitt's stern but sympathetic leader character with too much to lose, Shia LaBeouf's Bible-carrying saint faced with a major reality check, and Jon Bernthal's despicable degenerate character, who is still somehow the most sympathetic at all; these characters are done to death, but are excused thanks to a sharp writing and the conditions of what they go through. War is hell, and the gruesome depictions of it makes these characters makes more sense than the simple man caught in the wrong setting. <br/><br/>Speaking of war, another Ayer perk is how much he holds NO punches. We see blood, heads blasting, people being set on fire, numerous firefights, among other things that would've fit in a dumb action movie. But, as stated before, it is not dumb, and they way they depict these scenes is out of grit and not lunacy, thus adding to the realism and dread of the setting. This is also buoyed by Ayers still- impressive directing talent, with great composition and editing skills. All while adding what is considered easily the film's highlight, the tense-building and seldom depicted tank battles.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE: Sadly, Ayer isn't all too perfect. As much as I loved END OF WATCH, TRAINING DAY, etc., I just could not ignore the way he ends his movies. There is just a nagging feeling that he should patch up the overlong and, at times, ridiculous climaxes. FURY, as it turns out, is one of them. During the groups one last push against the enemy (which, to be fair, is amazing) the characters get axed off one by one in a way so heavy-handed and extensive it kind of jerks me out of the movie. <br/><br/>VERDICT: In the end, no matter how cliché and predictable this movie turned out to be, all it matters is how much it works. And FURY definitely works! Trust me folks, give it a chance!<br/><br/>RATING: 8/10"

","I don't quite like the American propaganda, that soldiers are heroes; they are much more like the ones imaged in this movie then Americans tend to admit (I mean brainwashed killing machines). However from a historical viewpoint the movie is clearly a huge piece of garbage that presents Germans as dumb animals running straight into gunfire like a sheep herd, and the allied protagonist as a bulletproof Chuck Norris who slaughters entire armies with a hairpin. The ""best"" scene is when you see an SS officer deliberately ordering his man (who are armed with rifles) to march towards the tank and being massacred by the machine guns. <br/><br/>I observed that in crappy WWII movies the makers are compensating their incompetence with gore and guts, so the amount of blood is inversely proportional to the quality of the movie. <br/><br/>I give it a 5 because I've seen much worse, and for its gap-filling nature being a tank movie."

","Having eagerly anticipated seeing this movie, I was wholly disappointed by the lack of realism throughout the film. After watching such excellent albeit biased depictions of the later stages of WW2 such as Band of Brothers, I found the whole film lacked credibility. I am aware that American audiences need cheering up due to their failed imperialistic ambitions through the Middle East and Afghanistan but are they that uneducated that they could not watch American troops being sacrificed in inferior tanks (the Sherman was no T34)? There was much true heroism with tank crews clearly out gunned and out classed by German Tigers and Anti aircraft/ anti tank crews and the film could have paid a greater tribute showing how the crews dealt with such adversity. Instead we get a Tiger being taken out by Fury after the first 3 Shermans get destroyed. Hardened Tiger crews had little or no difficulty destroying multitudes of Shermans, yet this Tiger crew miss more targets than they hit. The final scene is truly shocking. Crack SS troops with Panzerfaust by the boatload are incapable of cooking the disabled Sherman and lose dozens of men waging Kamikaze attacks on the tank. They would had bypassed the tank and maybe left a dozen men to finish off the Sherman. In conclusion, a great flag waver for American heroism, a poor attempt at portraying the realities of war."
"bob the moo","Null","6","12","7 December 2014"," Singular and rather obvious (SPOILERS)
","This year has been a very busy one for me with time seeming to race by; indeed so much so that it did not occur to me it was getting close to awards season in early 2015. This thought entered my head a good part way into watching Fury; I was wondering why it was being the way it was and why it seemed so determined to be so very much one way, then I realized that this is one of many films that are mostly about awards success for all involved. The general narrative here is that we join an American tank during the final months of WWII, fighting their way as part of an assault into the heart of Germany. The small team are led by Don Collier, a tough and experienced commander, who has to keep his team focused, alive, and moving forward. A team where a death means that they are joined by green recruit Norman.<br/><br/>This is the narrative, but really the film is not about a story so much as showing that ""war is hell"", with lots of performances, speeches, gore, and predictability in the plotting. To say it is relentless in this is an understatement – it never stops pushing this message and if there is even a small chance to remind us, then the film takes us there. Every character will die once we start to engage with them; any character that the crew engage with will suffer and die, and so on. As an exercise in nihilism then the film does mostly work because it is relentless in how pointless it is, whether it be cruelty of man, child soldiers, the horror of random violence, the physiological effects of killing, or anything else, the film is really on point for these. The problem with it is not these aspects but rather than it pretty much contains nothing else.<br/><br/>There is the feeling watching it that as well as a script supervisor and someone watching continuity, we also had someone making sure that every single ""war is hell"" cliché was covered too. This continues through the film and to be honest the lack of anything else did make it less and less impacting as it went on – almost numbing, which in no way is the thing it was looking for. This is not to say that it is not professionally made and very authentic in its portrayal of life on the front, or the use of real tanks, but just that this cannot make up for the lack of content. Despite that so much of it is about the pointlessness of it all, the final section turns into a boys' own adventure where we see the SS mown down like we were still at war and this was a propaganda film showing the glory of death and sacrifice. It is such an odd change to the tone of the film, but at least it allows all of those involved an heroic Oscar clip death, and of course a brief (and ridiculous) moment of humanity to end the film on.<br/><br/>The cast are all solid enough, but it is really hard to escape the feeling that they are all playing clichés to a certain extent. Pitt, Peña, Bernthal, Parrack, Isaacs, Henke, all do solid work but nothing really more than that in terms of characters. Lerman does as well as he can with a simple ""eyes of the audience"" character. Technically the film is very impressive whether it be the use of authentic tanks, the scale of the film, or the sound and gore, which are flinch-inducing. None of this is an issue, it is just that there is little beyond it and as a result the film does feel like it is hammering the same point endlessly, rather than telling a good story and letting this come out of it."

","Taking place nearly the same time frame and running at almost the same time length, the film does not progress as artistically bored as Inglorious Basterds, but the focus on the WW2 action flick on the ground through a tank somehow surprisingly entertaining. The screenplay does not focus on a political trick between those big countries involved in this historical world war, but mostly on the firing battle between the armies. It heavily narrates the physical and mental torture of the soldiers in this hell-like battleship, arguing the right and wrong humanity subjects, stresses on the horror and darkness consequences of war towards those heroes who fight rather than questioning their heroic aspects. The emphasis on character development, charismatic performance from Brad Pitt as always, surprisingly big improvement of Logan Lerman from Percy Jackson to Norman with strong humanity and the thrilling scores from Steven Price all added up making Fury as one of the best war film in this recent decade."

","Oodles of gritty violence. SO many guys get shot and blown up. Numerous people being burned alive, several decapitated, several summarily executed and many, many blown to pieces. Yeah, it's all there. Three hours of it. The guts, the glory, Brad Pitt is horribly scarred. And Shia's character loves Jesus. God Bless America! Check out the German that is actually stupid enough to stick his head in that tank!<br/><br/>Predictable.<br/><br/>Could write a short book about how it was unrealistic.<br/><br/>The scene where the young soldier goes into the bedroom with the young Fraulein (and Brad Pitt's character saying ""If you don't take her in that bedroom, I will"") raised my eyebrow knowing the history of the period. Tens of thousands of German women were raped by Allied troops-mostly Russians. Many committed suicide afterwards.<br/><br/>American troops illegally executing German prisoners is presented as something normal and accepted. In reality Brad Pitt would have found himself in the Brig. Shooting them down during the heat of battle, even if they are just standing there unarmed, is one thing. Some times during heated action you cannot take prisoners and you cannot leave them behind alive. But cold-bloodedly shooting them after they were taken prisoner was not allowed. SS Concentration Camp guards were summarily shot by Allied troops, however. Some allied troops claimed they would shoot SS who tried to surrender. Officers didn't want this happening for good reason. Because it could cause reprisals against Allied POW's. And they could also face court martial or have their records permanently besmirched if these things were done by men under their command.<br/><br/>They would never have put such a Greenhorn in a driver's position with zero training. Because a Sherman is not easy to drive and takes practice. They also must have practice on the guns and learn various maintenance duties. In a combat situation on-the-job training on a tank is like suicide.<br/><br/>I laughed when Pitt's character said ""I love it in here."" Those Shermans would get up over 100 degrees and stink like diesel fumes. Nobody liked being inside them. All it takes is a 12-year-old to pop up out of a ditch with a Panzerfaust and your entire crew gets lit up like human torches. And he loves it in there? Get real.<br/><br/>I laughed when they hit that mine and Brad asks ""Can you fix it?"" And he says he can. There's no way he's fixing that with out outside help and equipment!!! <br/><br/>It's beyond ridiculous to think a disabled Sherman tank would take on an entire SS Battalion. Anybody that did that would be mentally ill. They would run. Any Officer would order them to scuttle the tank and destroy its ordinance. An experienced tank crew would not be sacrificed like that with out specific orders and a special reason. And it would not be necessary for any reason. At this point in the war we were destroying battalions with just aircraft. The U.S. Army crushed an entire SS Armored Division with just artillery. Nobody needed to make desperate stands with a Sherman."
"John-Kane25","3","4","7","16 April 2018"," More like a video game than a movie
","A product of the video game culture I think. If you want non-stop action, its here. However this movie is masquerading as a wwII flick. Much of the movie is from inside or just outside a Sherman tank. This makes about 1/5th of the movie claustrophobic, not unlike a submarine movie. Its this intimacy of a close knit group of men that is the strongest suit of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie seems to try to explain how innocent young men become ruthless killers. With a couple of the American characters portrayed as complete animals. Perhaps more ruthless than the SS themselves. The film is shown more through a young American recruit who only has office training. He gets thrown into a tank and loses his virginity on the battle field and literally later on. His innocence is played off the animalistic crew members who resent him for not yet seeing the cruelty of war. They try to destroy his innocence. This happens in everyday life as well, but is more obvious in this movie. <br/><br/>I just can never get over how the tank captain doesn't button up the tank in such obvious situations. Such as numerous sniper opportunities in towns, traveling on roads right next to heavy woods.....etc. Obviously it is to create scenarios that the script requires. <br/><br/>The violence in the movie is realistic and maybe over the top for shock value. The utter disregard for caution by the lead tank and the German SS battalion at the end is beyond belief. This movie just uses the wwII setting to set up impossible situations to create the main hero.<br/><br/>The one tender scene in the middle of the movie is just there to contrast against the brutal animals in the tank crew."

"nmholland","9","4","7","13 May 2016"," A Fantastic War Film Comparable to Saving Private Ryan and Platoon
","Fury is directed by David Ayer and stars Brad Pitt as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier, the leader of an American World War II tank squad. During this time, German tanks were very superior that of the American models, so being in a tank squad was a hard job to commit to. However, once Logan Lerman's character, a drafted clerk named Norman, is assigned to Wardaddy's tank squad, he learns the true nature of war, and just some of the horrible things humans can do to one another. <br/><br/>I would, in a heartbeat, call Fury one of the best war films ever made. Fury almost perfectly follows in the footsteps of other legendary war films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Platoon (1986), which are both recognized as amazing feats in filmmaking. Fury is very close to perfect, and does almost everything right. Besides one very small issue, I loved every single minute of Fury, and felt that it's a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The absolute best thing about Fury is the comradery between the men in the tank squad. The close friendship between Wardaddy (Pitt), Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Pena), Coon-A*s (Jon Bernthal), and, eventually, Norman (Lerman) is incredible. Due to the comradery expressed between the men, the audience begins to feel for each and every character, and have large amounts of both sorrow and pity on their behalfs. All of the actors do great as well. Fury is Logan Lerman's best work to date, being slightly better than that of his performance in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), and way better than the Percy Jackson series. Brad Pitt also does amazing, as usual, along with Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. Although I don't like him as an actor, I do have to say that Shia LaBeouf did really good in his role. His character was near flawlessly well rounded, and I felt for him and his situation.<br/><br/>The direction, by David Ayer, is amazing. Each and every shot of just how grotesque and awful war really is was shown magnificently, and brought a harsh realness to Fury. Also, however small the tank may be, the direction impressively seemed to enlarge it, as if there was actually room for five grown men to live regularly. The tank, called ""Fury,"" is given the feel of a home, and begins to feel comforting to both the characters and the audience. However, it also feels claustrophobic, which was a great movie on Ayer's part. While giving the tank room to open up, it also felt very closed, which was a great aspect of Fury.<br/><br/>My only real problem with Fury was a small portion in the middle of the second act in which roughly twenty minutes of the runtime takes place in one small apartment. Although we learn insightful things about our characters, and the scene does feel necessary, it tends to drag on incredibly, near boring the viewer, and makes the film seem a lot longer than it actually is. This sequence was good, no doubt about it, but it was too long, and dragged on to the point of slight exasperation.<br/><br/>The last point I'll make about Fury is the gruesome aspect of it. Although some people can't handle over the top violence, Fury goes for the R rating with open arms. The war violence is over the top, almost to the point of insanity, but it gives a realistic feel to the film, as well as adding some gut wrenching scenes of death and destruction. Not everyone likes violence in movies, and that's understandable, but, for a war film like Fury, it works in every way possible. The extreme violence is acceptable for Fury, because of the point it tries to express: war is bad. War is disgusting, grotesque, and not a pretty thing. However, as humans, we have to accept that as a fact of life. This message is wonderfully displayed through the utmost violence and death.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury really is a great movie. Almost everything about it works in a positive way, and there's much enjoyment, and a good message, to be had in it. I'd recommend Fury to anyone who can handle a large amount of war violence."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","4","7","12 May 2016"," Arresting, heart stopping film
","David Ayer's Fury is the most fearsome, unrelenting war film of the decade and quite the experience to sit through. One stumbles out of the theatre as shell shocked as the brave soldiers we've just witnessed on screen, needing time to wind down from the horror, after which we realize that among the thunderous bravura and non stop, head shattering combat are moments of tender humanity and ponderous reflection, just enough to contrast the madness. Logan Lerman has the pretty boy look, which is quickly stripped away and replaced by frenzied terror and confusion, playing a young army clerk who hasn't seen one second of combat, suddenly tasked with joining the ranks of a tank warfare crew. They are each hardened in their own way by what they've seen and done. Brad Pitt is Wardaddy, their iron jawed commander in a gritty, unstable and altogether brilliant performance. Jon Bernthal is the obligatory redneck Neanderthal, a big lug whose brutish ways mask a childlike yearning beneath. Shia Leboeuf is the restrained one, a bible reader and thinker whose resentment of the war radiates from his eyes like sad and sick beams of sympathy. Michael Pena, reliably excellent, is the closest to neutral of the group. Ayer airdrops us right into the action without pretext, warning or proclaimed intention. This isn't a 'men on a mission' war flick, this is a single harrowing day in the lives of men at the end of the world as well as their ropes, an intimate study of the horror inflicted on both body and soul, both soldier and civilian, the collective horrific impact of the war refracted through the prism of a small period of time. Such a tactic has huge potential, and here it works wonders in brining us closer to these characters, as well as anyone they meet along their way. Pitt leads this ragtag band with the indifferent sentiment of a hardened, brittle man who has been in one too many a tight spot and seen one too many a comrade fall under his care to waste time with compassion for the enemy. Time and tide have turned killing into a purely instinctual, second nature business for him, and we see this unfold in a kicker of a scene where he forces Lerman to murder an unarmed German private who begs for his life. Such is war, and such is Ayer's film, free from Hallmark moments and structured escapism. Midway through, the film stops dead in its tracks for a beautiful, tension filled sequence in which the band finds temporary refuge in crumbling abode with two German girls. The culture shock is numbed out by the extremity of the war, and these two groups are forced to coexist, if only for an hour or so. The youngest of the girls (Alicia Von Rittberg) is stunning, a baleful example of the corrupts of innocence, her character arc a testament to the senselessness of war. The combat scenes within the tank clank with clammy, claustrophobic dread and desperation, helped by the fact that for the most part they filmed inside real replicas. Jason Isaacs shows up in yet another war movie role as a grizzled commander who briefly assists them, and (of course) steals his two quick scenes in the process. War films often struggle to find humanity amongst the ugliness y trying a little too hard, and by being a little too obvious. This one is frank, unrelenting and assaults you with a deafening roar of chaos, with a few extremely subtle moments of introspect and emotion. It may just have cracked the formula for finding the comfort in such turmoil: less is more. One of the best war movies I've ever seen."

","Fury was as an intimate look at the memorable conclusion to the last world war. The end of this war story's atrocity became well known. Public knowledge of world war two proliferated as America's economy and educated bourgeois grew rapidly. Stories of soldiers were scarcely made public in lieu of patriotic or nationalistic gain, so humanized scripts for this depiction were profound. The jaded renegade Sgt and his rookie enlistee encountered not only the anticipated battles against Axis forces but also the natives. There was a dramatic quartering scene where the ethics and nature of victorious Allies faced the choice to plunder their conquest! ""With great power comes great responsibility"" came to mind several times while watching this story."

There's no point, other than glorified carnage and body parts, which 'Saving Private Ryan' already introduced us to years ago - in a much more realistic manner, I might add. The sound of the German tank in 'Ryan' is terrifying, something this film fails to capture in any essence. Just a scared kid and the hardened tank crew that can wipe out scores of Nazis and never suffer a scratch, apparently (I won't watch it all the way to the end, so I guess I won't find out).<br/><br/>I have really enjoyed the roles Brad Pitt has selected for himself throughout his career, but this one is deeply disappointing.

","I'm struggling to see why this film is so highly rated on here. The final battle scene is so ludicrous that it ruined the movie completely. It actually felt like the director simply abandoned the project and handed it over to someone else such was the paradigm shift in style.<br/><br/>Prior to this the film was alright but didn't really offer anything new to the genre besides the setting of the tank. Whilst it was good to see a story about a tank crew rather than yet another film focused on infantry it was ultimately let down by the contrived action scenes.<br/><br/>The first battle with the German tank demonstrated how out matched allied tanks were and seemed to show vaguely realistic tank warfare tactics however the outcome of it was fairly predictable. You knew that all the other tanks were going to get taken out and leave them to go it alone.<br/><br/>Ultimately the final battle just made me give up on the film entirely and more or less tune out until the end. There was no logic in a three hundred strong SS battalion throwing themselves headlong at a stranded tank. Their initial tactic of ambushing them by lighting some fires and pretending to be blown was clever but after that it just turned into a bewildering suicidal turkey shoot which apparently went on for so long that it turned to night halfway through.<br/><br/>The story feels like it was vaguely inspired by that of the Fray Bentos tank from WWI. However in that (true) story the Germans didn't have much choice but to engage the tank as it was stranded so close to their lines. Hand-held antitank weaponry didn't really exist what with tanks being so new and hence they did clamber on the machine and try and chuck grenades inside.<br/><br/>In Fury it is never clear why the SS don't just fall back and hit the thing with the vast supply of antitank weaponry they are seen to be carrying instead of just running headlong at it with rifles and grenades. Even just cutting their losses and bypassing the crossroads through the dark fields would have made more sense than wasting half your number to kill one wounded tank.<br/><br/>I gave up entirely when it showed one of their commanders ordering them to attack it by just running at it. Or when they had to go outside to get ammo (for some reason). Then predictably the crew all get killed one by one in an array of horrific situations and upon each death the action seemingly stops and leaves everyone a minute of silence to grieve. Oh except for Brad Pitt who was granted a high resistance to bullets by the gods of dramatic effect who were determined to give him an over the top ending and facilitate the escape of the token new recruit.<br/><br/>Utterly cliché ridden tripe. By all means watch it as an action film and enjoy it but anyone saying this is emotional or that it demonstrates the true horror of war is just plain wrong.<br/><br/>'Fury' is Rambo set in World War Two where Brad Pitt is filling in for Stallone."

The action was good. The special effects were good. The scenery was good. There even was one scene which made me jump in my seat (a very rare occurrence). So I did enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>(spoiler) I'll give you one example of what bothers me.<br/><br/>At the very end of the movie there is this long drawn out shot from the tank called Fury. It is directly above and it has this perfect music playing to set the mood. As you pull out from the top of the tank, you start to see the damage the US tank crew did to the Germans. Dead bodies are every where. I mean sixty or seventy dead.<br/><br/>But as you get all the way out you see the road is perfectly clean of any bodies. I know many would say that the US troops coming by cleared them out, but they wouldn't and they didn't. They would have just gone over them with their trucks.<br/><br/>You also don't see clumps of Germans which indicate the US troops did not move them. The bodies are perfectly laid out and in positions to indicate the fighting.<br/><br/>Remember the dead German body which every one was running over in the middle of the movie. The body had been run over so many times that it was actually liquefied, only a small hand remained. No one cared. Besides, SS troops were the most hated right? I mean the movie projects that not only from the Fury tank. It was from the others too, but I also know the the SS were complete douche-bags and I have seen interviews with WWII vets and they hated the SS. They were considered lower than dog poop.<br/><br/>So as a director, why not put a bunch of dead bodies out there? Let the US trucks/half tracks run over them? Instead you have this perfectly clear road.<br/><br/>Do it right or don't do it at all.<br/><br/>4/10 stars for acting, effects, music and scenery"

I was glad, I have studied war that they finally did a movie right, instead of using the wrong vehicles and how it really was for tankers in WW2 and if you didn't hate Nazis before, this movie would show you why they were so awful and how brave Americans were. It was a fact it took 5 Sherman's tanks to beat 1 Tiger tank in WW2, till the end of the War when the Pershing was released. I wish Hollywood like this movie and Saving Private Ryan, get its thru their THICK head, there are people that do know what kind of vehicles and equipment we had and just not throw up something from Vietnam and say its WW2. It was awful to be a American tanker because how we beat the Germans was productivity not quality. We didn't get that right till the end and now today. Overall I give it a 10 because they gave you a feeling of what it was like to be a tanker in that horrible war and why we did it.<br/><br/>Also for the people that don't get it, try watching the military channel for a bit, because anybody that gave it 3 or below, doesn't have a clue about WW2. Try reading and get a idea on the subject before watching this, because if you don't know your missing best part. So don't give it a bad rating because you didn't have a clue about WW2. Its a great movie and are probably under the age of 25. Its not from World of tanks, this was like the real war not a video game."

Fury is the story of a battle weary US tank crew, fighting deep in Germany towards the end of the Second World War. A new, and very young soldier called Norman joins their team, trained as a clerk and totally unprepared for any of what is to follow, he is pushed very hard for the sake of his own survival and that of the team. Given the horrific subject that is any war, this film, aided by it's excellent epic score, was a magnificent portrayal of life on the wrong side of the front line and how the soldiers look out for each other. It is not for the faint hearted, and indeed one person walked out before we were halfway through, but these are stories that need to be told to make sure future generations never forget what these people went through for the sake of our freedom. As expected blood was flowing freely and the cast of extras must have run into many hundreds. Brad Pitt played the part of Sergeant 'Wardaddy' with a compassion and sensitivity you wouldn't expect from this kind of film and his character held his team together, sometimes on a very thin thread, but commanded the kind of loyalty you only find in extreme situations. Not for the faint hearted but a cracking good film."

The men inside ""Fury""-- the tank they fight with as they enter Nazi Germany--are brave, wise, and humorous. Character development is executed with poignancy as we witness the atrocities of Hitler's armies and the unspeakable suffering of Jews during this time period.

","For some reason I really didn't think I was going to like this movie - having seen so many great and memorable world war movies I was a little bit expectant of slightly re-hashed material that was too much Hollywood and too little in substance and storyline. Thankfully I was proved to be completely wrong. Fury shows us a World War movie from a new angle I certainly hadn't seen before - from life inside a tank. This was something fascinating and thought provoking - imagine having to live inside such a confined moving target with a group of other men? The performances were slightly understated and I think the movie was all the richer for it. Shia Leboeuf held his role very professionally and very believably and Brad Pitt was excellent his portrayal gave a lot of depth that I wasn't expecting (the trailer almost hinted to me of his character having a very shouty, over exaggerated performance). Like any great war movie it has some memorable scenes - in this from the moment they walk into the German lady's house until the moment it is is bombed not long after is completely surreal - which must have reflected the surrealism of a lot of moments that happened during the great wars.The dinner table scene was taut with unpredictability. All around there are some great performances, memorable scenes and a realistically brooding atmosphere. A very enjoyable movie that I would watch again. Still does not quite sit up there with the very best war movies I have seen - but one of the most solid candidates in recent years."
"moshtheboss","5","5","10","8 July 2015"," Tiger 131, Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg are a pleasure. But the end ruins everything!
","Fury is the quintessential example of a movie that gets ruined by the ending. You can't discuss the movie with anyone into WW2 without discussing the bad turn it took. <br/><br/>Up till that infamous ending, Fury is a quite nice American movie about a group of tankers in a M4A3E8 Sherman (the so called 'Easy Eight') with the nickname 'Fury' on their way from Normandy after the D-Day landings to Germany. <br/><br/>Most standing out moments in the movie are the scene where the tankers visit two German ladies Irma and Emma (played by the lovely Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg). The tension is played well and throughout the scene one actually really starts to dislike these uneducated 'liberators' more and more. Not often do I see an American movie on WW2 portraying their own soldiers as such lowlifes. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie will appeal to anyone with even the slightest interest in German armor. And why is that? Because there is a REAL Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. E, also known as the 'Tiger'. The tank came from The Bovington Tank Museum. Tiger 131 was captured by the British in the African campaign. Even though the Tiger in the movie makes a rookie mistake which couldn't have happened for real during those fighting days in 1944 and gets taken out because of it, the scene in which the Tiger and Shermans meet and fight is the true highlight of the movie for any tankophiliac. <br/><br/>No matter how much I now want to write an entire essay on the intense fighting spirit and efficiency of the Waffen SS after D-Day had made it clear the (borders of the) Reich itself were in danger, I shall refrain myself. A trackless Sherman tank against 2 or 3 die hard Waffen SS members with Panzerfaust, what did you think would have happened? well, is this movie they take on hundreds of SS men and, well, the ending is so unbelievably improbable and impossibly bad. I can not, shall not give this movie more than 5 points.<br/><br/>Which is a shame because the presence of Tiger 131 and the Irma-Emma scene were truly an addition to the collection of WW2 movies."

","So I bought Fury on DVD to catch up on my David Ayer leading up to Suicide Squad. I'm in two minds about him so far. The jury may still be out because of his box office gambling habits. In essence I'd describe him as a visually effective renaissance director with a habit of cutting corners! Luckily with Fury that mostly works in its favour, but comparing it to Saving Private Ryan because it's bleak and wintery was a bad sales pitch. If anything, Fury is the younger brother of Enemy at the Gates and its daddy Iron Cross, despite it not being based around Russia. It has that undeniable element of exploitation to it that I feel makes up for everything Inglorious Basterds wasn't.<br/><br/>Fury's strength is in the overwhelming theme of seeking an end or seeking salvation where there is none to be found and it paints a picture of the parts of WWII that have been so rarely depicted. The Yanks are animals in this movie and they are aware of just how desperate the situation is getting to be.<br/><br/>Enter Logan Lerman's army typist Norman Ellison who is jettisoned to the war effort during the occupation of Nazi Germany and is he in over his head or what?! You really need to see the non-stop gore to get the drift...<br/><br/>The crew of Fury, the titular sherman tank, are way beyond the douchiest people you could ever know, because the war has destroyed their souls and they know in their hearts that the chances of making it home are impossible, so when the film focuses on the importance of Ellison learning how to keep his crew alive in the slimmest odds.<br/><br/>Sent on a slew of what can only be described as suicide missions, Fury leads the battallion's only remaining tanks into battle only for them to start falling one by one and leading to an inevitable battle to the death against Tiger tanks and a full SS regiment.<br/><br/>Visually Fury mostly hits the spot but then some action scenes seemed a little more than rushed and not in the name of an overall sharp editing style. It just cuts corners here and there like I expect and where some scenes build great suspense felt it had greater potential.<br/><br/>In regards to character, the ensemble cast nails it... mostly! Half the time I couldn't penetrate the impossible accents they were putting on. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal were especially difficult but still I got the basics.<br/><br/>The action and violence are also pure exploitation but heaped on top of the rising tension as we realise the theme of the movie - one that is ultimately the fear of death and having to face up to the consequences of one's actions - the resulting product is a horror movie based in the Second World War and that suits me down to the ground.<br/><br/>Or, you know; it's Jaws but with tanks instead of boats and SS Waffen instead of sharks!"

Characters swear in excess, and there is little to pull the story together, just bloody grisly fighting scenes interspersed with inane dialog. And why would German soldiers bull-rush a tank - an equal lack of realism. Indeed Director Ayer tries to add gratuitous blood in poor taste. The ""binocular"" view camera effect reminds of bad 50s war movies while you have the requisite rookie, crazy, sentimentalist, and leader characters.

","Just watched Fury and the movie -unexpectedly- made me think of several subjects I never thought before.<br/><br/>While showing the horror of WW II very naturalistically the movie brings in a lot of already-seen-already-felt emotions from other war movies, uses techniques we all know very well with very good acting in this definitely ""male"" topic one can easily feel the senselessness of war. It still comes second after Saving Private Ryan from US WW II movies for me.<br/><br/>At the end one might think about the feeling of duty - sacrificing one's life consciously for an order in an obvious suicide mission, fighting till last breath (both on US and German side) when you might not have too much to do with what you are fighting for.<br/><br/>We are not here to judge what is right or wrong. [...] Our duty is to kill Germans. - as we can hear from the Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), commander of the tank called ""Fury"" before forcing the newcomer private (Logan Lerman) to shoot a German soldier. A mentality one could find in any army unit from SS to any present (from North Korean to ISIS) army. Duty comes first even if it is about killing others or a suicide mission. Whether you come out as a hero or a devil is the future's dilemma.<br/><br/>And while it's a commonplace that winners write history it's interesting to think a little bit about who'll become winners and what fanaticism it takes to win a war."

"vandykeu","10","9","22","30 October 2014"," Shattering, unflinching, brutally honest portrayal of war in a tank
","Fury is unflinching in its portrayal of war, and is probably the most honest, least patriotic American anti-war film made about WW2. The only alternative I can think of is Steve McQueen's Hell is for Heroes. Saving Private Ryan, this ain't. It's one of those where you get the feeling that everything on screen probably happened, at least once. The only exception is the final battle, which is a bit Hollywood but at the same time not entirely impossible either, if you read of Audie Murphy's last battle.<br/><br/>Technically, it is incredibly well-researched. The details of the tanks, the crews, and armored combat are spot-on. It doesn't glorify anything, and shows both the positive and the negative qualities that Americans likely had in abundance at that stage of the war. The only thing it doesn't have is the smell. The sound effects are incredible.<br/><br/>Dramatically, watching it was a soul-shattering experience. It builds tension, both in and outside of combat, in a realistic way that few movies pull off successfully, especially most Hollywood war movies. The battle with the Tiger for me was especially tense, especially to anyone familiar with how Shermans had to fight Tigers in order to win. The actors disappear in their roles- even the big names. I believed every one of them could have been real.<br/><br/>I think the comparisons that have been made with Das Boot are very apt. I also saw similarities to Platoon, but it is done better in Fury because there is no clear good guy or bad guy, as Barnes and Elias were in the former. <br/><br/>Judging by the reviews it's gotten, it probably won't be recognized as such, but I think this is one of the great anti-war movies of history. It's certainly one of the most realistic."

","One of the best war movies ever, a masterpiece close to the levels of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, as far as I can see. Fury has the admirable ambition and achievement of showing how even the Greatest Generation could brutalize and be brutalized by war. Brad Pitt, you'll recall, already won World War II in Inglourious Bastards, well over here he's perfect as well, along with the rest of the cast. The story is intense and suspenseful with strong performances and has also an unsentimental approach as to show the dehumanizing side of war in its raw, the unflinching details and what makes us humans, like the bravery and mercy found in people in the worst of circumstances."
"dcarsonhagy","8","6","13","29 April 2015"," One of the Best Movies about WWII
","I put off for a while watching this movie because IMO Brad Pitt has made many poor movie choices recently. Caught this on On-Demand last evening and was riveted from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The story tells a tale about ""Wardaddy"" (Brad Pitt) and his merry band of fellow tank partners heading toward the front lines in WWII. His men are hardened soldiers who have seen just about everything that war has to offer. Pitt loses one of his original men and a replacement is sent to him--in the form of a clerk typist. <br/><br/>""Fury"" is probably the best war film I've seen since ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's gritty, graphic, well acted, and well directed. Brad Pritt is finally able to show his acting chops. He never overplays a scene here; he is constantly pulling back. The ability for him to do that makes his portrayal of ""Wardaddy"" that much more believable. There is one scene that was almost too uncomfortable for me to watch. What appears to be a peaceful moment you know could erupt into horrible violence at a moments notice. <br/><br/>This film was also educational for me. I found out that in the beginning of WWII our tanks were vastly inferior to German tanks, which were referred to as Tigers. Its only weak spot was located in the rear, so I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to get in position and try to attack those.<br/><br/>The movie is rated ""R,"" and deservingly so. It contains constant language and graphic war-time violence. If you haven't seen this one already, you owe it to yourself to check it out."

","I didn't expect this film to be historically accurate, and it wasn't. So no problem there.<br/><br/>The off action parts are very interesting showing the brutality of war and capturing it from a few different angles. You see a slither of the conflict from the view point of Americans, German civilians, Nazi supporters and the German soldiers. <br/><br/>People's heads explode, they get their faces shot off and limbs amputated by bullets; it is very graphic and feels a bit glorified. <br/><br/>Also it doesn't go far enough; victims of the Nazis dangle from lampposts but when it comes to the horror of carpet bombing civilian centres there is only a glib one liner from Brad about a city being on fire.<br/><br/>Then we come to the real problem. The action! It is rubbish! Lets ignore the indestructible qualities of Brad's tank and its shell resistant plank of wood. Inevitably the campaign pivots on 'Fury' having to fight a crack SS battalion. Unfortunately these guys had obviously missed their firing range training and didn't realise you can shot guns from a distance. So they run back and forth in front of Fury's blazing guns and are mowed down like wheat.<br/><br/>It is extremely tedious to watch. Why does Hollywood do this? If you are building up to a battle then don't make the bad guys useless donkeys.<br/><br/>The majority of the action sequences is in this vein, pointless and boring."
"ironhorse_iv","8","6","13","2 November 2014"," Ideals are peaceful. History is violent. This film was brutal to watch.
","Fury is an intense film that use war to no clear beyond showing how ugly it can be. It's no way, go overblown patriotic like 1998's Saving Private Ryan does with its music. It doesn't romanticism the war like 2001's Pearl Harbor with its story. It's doesn't make war, an easier sit, acting somewhat like a propaganda film like 2009's Inglourious Basterds does. It's a very dark film with a lot of dark subject matter. It was a hard seat at times. I just glad, it didn't go too far into the horrors, to the point that it makes it really unwatchable like certain war films like 1995's 'Men Behind the Sun 4' or 2008's 'The Downfall of Berlin: Anonyma' due to the repulsion, nihilism nature. This movie belong in the same category as 2001's 'Enemy at the Gate' or 1985's 'Come and See'. It find a reasonable balance. It doesn't turn away audience members away due to the repulsion of war nor does it seem inaccurate or clueless to the horror of war. Directed by David Ayer, Fury is a fictional film about a battle-hardened army sergeant named Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) whom commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines during the last days of World War 2 Germany. The film draws a composite portrait of tank crews and the final days of the war in Europe by using stories influenced by the service of veterans in his family and by reading books such as Belton Y. Cooper's Death Traps about American WW2 tank warfare. Ayer went to considerable lengths to seek authentic uniforms and weapons which fitted the final months of the war in Europe. He even got the rare Tiger 131, the last surviving operational Tiger I to portray the enemy tank. It is the first time since the 1946 film 'Theirs Is the Glory' that a real Tiger tank and not a prop version has been used on a film set. While some things are not historically accurate for a story set in 1945, the film is accurate enough. Still, there are a few inaccurate things, clichés, and tropes that anybody can nitpick on. As for story, the movie wasn't giving anything new to the table; after all, there has been hundreds of films like this, previously done before. The third act is basically Saving Private Ryan with tanks. While the plot of the film is fictional, the depiction of the tank Fury and its commander, parallels the experience of several real allied tankers such as the American tank commander Staff Sergeant Lafayette G. Pool. The action scenes mirror that of the real life Battle of Crailsheim fought in Germany in April 1945. The action scenes were pretty intense and gory, but it was indeed scale down compare to those of other epic war movies. What the movie does well is using the story of the transition of cavalry to mechanized warfare. A lot of horse symbolism. The horses symbolize over the course of the film is the difference between European WWII movies and their American counterparts. People don't realize that the German army was like mostly horse-drawn at the time. By the end of the war it was mostly horse-drawn, and there's an innocence about a horse. A horse doesn't know where it is or why it fighting. In a way, all of the horse slaughtering can represent the youth of the two countries. When, they talk about what they've done to all of those horses, and it's very significant in foreshadowing when they let one go. Lots of Christianity motifs. Just like the Bible, it is filled with harrowing violence, inhumanity, corrupted and fallen men, and a message of God's grace. The movie is a very raw film. Lots of tense drawn out lingering nerve biting moments. Some good examples are the scene where Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) was forced to kill an unarmed prisoner of war in the back & the frightening sexual vibe of the scene with German women where you don't know if they wanted to rape them or not. It doesn't help that song playing in the background at that scene is 'Virgin Slumber Song.' The biggest change to the WWII motif is the idea of brotherhood. In this movie, they really mistreat each other, both physical and mentally. This movie was no lovely dove bromance, 2001 Band of Brothers. The tank crew honest could had kill each other, any moment. All of the actors well-acted in this film. Before filming, Ayer required the actors to undergo a four-month preparation process, where it broke them down. He kept the actors to cold, exhausted, and miserable while filming. Ayer also pushed the cast to physically spar each other, leading to many black eyes and bloody noses. They insulted each other with personal attacks as well. On top of that, the actors were forced to live in the tank together for an extended period of time where they ate, slept, and defecated. It was pretty ruthless. Maybe, too ruthless, as one of the co-stars, Shia LaBeouf went a little bit crazy, and pulled out his own tooth, cut his own face and refused to shower in order to understand what his character would have been through. It really did angering much of the cast and crew that day. The film also caused controversy by shooting a scene on Remembrance Day in which extras wore Nazi uniforms, in which the filmmakers had to make an apology. The movie is beautiful shot. The opening shot, alone, has this Lawrence of Arabia feel to it. Then you got a lot of haunting scenes. Overall, Fury is a well-made depiction of the horrors of war that will keep you at the edge of your seat watch."
"joe-garwood","9","6","13","29 October 2014"," Proof that David Ayer is a cinematic genius!
","I went into Fury expecting to be watching a war film. What i got was something far more epic. This is more than just a war film. This film is a mind blowing drama that deals with the horrors of war in a realistic and inspiring way, whilst maintaining extremely interesting characters through some of the performances of the year. I especially enjoyed the performances of Jon Bernthal and Shia LaBeouf. The two portrayed their interesting characters almost perfectly. The characters were pretty much what set this film apart from other films. A normal war film's characters would be your average every day heroes, whereas the characters in Fury are very different. Sure, Wardaddy has heroic qualities, but there are still moments in which you don't want to root for him. There are moments in the film in which you feel he has his bad qualities. Apart from him, there are no real heroic characters and that makes this film very realistic. <br/><br/>The one thing i would disagree with about this film is the ending. This is when Norman is hiding under the tank and the SS soldier sees him, but just walks away. I thought this was stupid and was only done because one character had to survive. It would be believable if the SS soldier had captured or killed Norman as this would have been more realistic. However, the film was amazing in almost every aspect so it is my favourite film of 2014 so far.<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"grantss","7","6","13","23 October 2014"," Good, but not great - quite clumsy at times
","Good, but not great, WW2 movie. <br/><br/>Written and directed by David Ayer, who gave us the brilliant End of Watch, plus the reasonably good Harsh Times, and wrote Training Day, you expect good plot, good action and, most of all, character depth. The action scenes are great - pretty much straight out of the Steven Spielberg/Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers school of realistic war action. Suitably gory, yet not gratuitously so.<br/><br/>Plot is OK, but not brilliant. Some sub-plots feel contrived and the final scenes seem overly gung ho, sentimental...and very predictable and unoriginal. Furthermore, some scenes are very clumsily done, and/or plain unnecessary. (The tank's Commander and Assistant Driver in the women's apartment was the best example of this - has me squirming the whole time and it seemed to last forever).<br/><br/>Moreover, the character depth Ayer built up in End of Watch is lacking here. Yes, there is some character depth, but it seems superficial. In End of Watch you ended up caring so much for both cops and couldn't imagine anything happening to them. In Fury you hardly get to know them - only the tank commander and assistant driver and then only to a limited extent. Makes you feel less engaged with regard to what happens to them.<br/><br/>In keeping with the lack of dimension to the characters, the performances feel a bit wooden. Brad Pitt is OK in the lead role, but his performance lacked something. Similarly, Shia LaBeouf is OK, but his character is overly stereotyped. Logan Lerman probably gives the most convincing performance of the movie, as the rookie Assistant Driver.<br/><br/>Overall, an exciting and entertaining movie. If more time was spent getting us to care about the characters, and less time on unnecessary, clumsy scenes, this would have been a brilliant movie."

","There is an ongoing trend in movies about World War II to be ""gritty"", in other words showing as many body parts flying as possible. Be it a leg amputated by machine gun, or a head vaporizing from a shell. While perhaps it is ""realistic"", it isn't necessary, and hides the fact that this movie is a string of clichés, with a few trite expressions thrown in to make Brad Pitt seem Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>The most obvious cliché is the innocent kid getting thrown into the war and seeing how gruesome war is. He tries to maintain his ideals in the brutal face of war. Everyone else is already hardened and cynical and on the brink of being animals. The spoiler here is obvious, the innocent boy starts enjoying killing Nazis. The turn is actually terribly done, since basically he ends up killing some Germans and suddenly likes it.

","Okay, so I'm not the biggest fan of war films – my main motivation for watching 'Fury' was that it was filmed in my home town and I wanted to see which bits of my village I recognised! However, I was actually pretty glad I did. I'd heard mixed reviews on Fury – much of the negativity based around how 'unlikeable' the characters are. Well, that may be true, but it was sort of refreshing in a way.<br/><br/>'Fury' itself is the name of our 'heroes' tank – part of a battle-worn American division deep inside Germany in the dying months of World War II. Basically, this tank crew (led by Brad Pit) have seen it all (and killed much of it). They aren't particularly nice people. If they once were then the constant slaughter has taken its toll on them and all they know is war. However, when they lose one of their crew a youngster is added to the mix, who doesn't share their particular attitude to the war.<br/><br/>I suppose you could say that there's not much story here. It's pretty much one (rather impressive) tank battle after the next. Fury's crew were pretty grim, but seeing as all of them have been fighting it out for years and could be killed any day, I felt that that was kind of understandable under the circumstances. Whatever 'character development' comes from Brad and the 'newbie's' characters. One must learn to 'toughen up' and the other must relearn his sensitivity.<br/><br/>It's probably a guy's film, as it does rely on the action scenes to 'wow' audiences. Although, maybe it was just me, but when the machine guns were firing, they kind of looked like either red or green lasers (definitely something out of Star Wars), but that could just be me.<br/><br/>About the only time I felt it slowed down was during a scene in the middle of the film. I'm guessing it was meant to emphasis the two main characters and the change in their attitudes, but I felt it did just drag a little longer than it should.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Fury' is a good watch, but you'll probably need to be into some pretty dark and bleak war films in order to truly appreciate this."

","If you would read the reviews that give 5 stars or less, you will obtain a more realistic view of this movie. <br/><br/>The story shows an American tank crew headed across Europe in Germany during the last week of the WWII. It is April of 1945. This crew is multi-racial and it displays some of their conflicts with one another and their surroundings and German survivors of the War.<br/><br/>The tank is disabled by a land mine. Two Hundred Germans, likely SS soldiers are marching towards the disabled American tank. The Americans have time to load up and transfer all of the extra stored ammunition which is hanging carried on the outside of their tank to the inside of the tank before the Germans come. They do not haul inside the ammunition until 200 Germans are shooting at them at close range. Hiding and running would have been a rational choice given that the War is about to end within 5-11 days. But Brad Pitt chooses to stand and fight. I mean, the Americans and Russians are overwhelming Berlin in April 1945. What would you do?<br/><br/>Similar to a Rambo movie, the protagonists in the tank choose to do a stand-off while cowering holed up against 200 enemy soldiers who surround the tank. They could have hidden in the bushes; there was time, but no, they choose to stay in their disabled tank to ""stay with the Sergeant"" Brade Pitt. This means sure death for them. <br/><br/>The Germans could have starved the Yanks out. Or waited until they wanted to go to the restroom. Then you shoot them with sniper fire as they get tired of smelling ""it"".<br/><br/>The Germans do not seek cover against the firing machine guns of the tank. Rather, they run back and forth in front of the tank's blazing machine guns. I suppose the Germans are attracted to the firing machine guns like mosquitoes are attracted to heat and light. And this may be why the Germans lost WWII.<br/><br/>The Germans put two hand grenades down the tank's top porthole. There is a hatch at the bottom of the tank for the Americans to escape. There is time for one soldier to wiggle out of the tank before the grenades explode. And he does this. All others, including Brad Pitt, are killed by the grenades. So, why didn't the soldier simply grab the grenades and hurl them out of the tank through the bottom porthole which was wide open? That would have taken 3 seconds per grenade and perhaps he could have made it, saving his team mates. The grenades have about a 5-6 second fuse delay.<br/><br/>Then shortly afterward, an SS officer sees the alive soldier below the tank hiding alive and well. He doesn't shoot him. What does the SS soldier think the soldier is beneath the tank? He doesn't order him away from the tank. The SS soldier just leaves him alive without saying a word to him. I mean, who would be under a tank after a firefight?<br/><br/>There is abusiveness by one American soldier to another who is new to combat. This is a kind of ""hazing"". Oh boy, adding ""realism"". He pulls on the ears of this new soldier. This abusive soldier handles the soldier in various ways to aggravate the new soldier. Doesn't it occur to the audience that in combat --you do this to a soldier and you could be ""shot by accident"" in the next firefight? <br/><br/>Oh, yes, there is a scene with a blown up face sitting on a shelf in the tank. The 1/3 face has no scratches on it, and the eye is perfectly in the socket of the piece-of-face. How could an eye remain the eye socket after the head has exploded from an anti-tank round?<br/><br/>If you will read the criticisms of other reviewers, the ones with 1 or 2 star reviews, they will detail more story errors.<br/><br/>This movie is not a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level show. It shows soldiers taking unnecessary risks and then making bad tactical decisions. And that is what Rambo did. Rambo stood up to the enemy straight up and fired his machine gun from the hip. In real life he would last 3 seconds. And this is why returning Vietnam veterans were highly critical of Rambo and John Wayne movies. These movies give the viewer a false sense of security. You know what: If you have fears, it may be because you really are in danger. And if you want to live, you might be better off making like a mole. <br/><br/>Yes, the grungy scenery, and the sleazy actor's lines may give this movie a sense of ""realism""; a tired soldier's viewpoint. But the macro view of this drama portrays unrealistic command decisions and motivations which may be acceptable in a video game only. To give this show a high rating is a disservice to critical viewers of IMDb ratings.<br/><br/>I recommend movies like ""Come and See"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", ""Das Boot"" for war movies.<br/><br/>I suppose this movie was made without any consultation with real Tank veterans. But one plus of the movie is that it has a real ""Tiger Tank"" in it being driven around.<br/><br/>So, go see this movie, but don't start thinking about all the unrealistic issues with it. If it makes you feel lucky to live in a Country not at war, then it has a positive purpose in your life. And it might make you feel further grateful to those tank crews that fought during WWII.<br/><br/>So, this movie is 1/2 good, and 1/2 technically bad. It is more ""grinding"" than inspiring. ""B"" movie fits the description of this film."

This is just grim, dirty, filthy...and I'm not talking about the physical environment which is about the only acceptably realistic aspect of the film. 
This tank crew depiction almost makes you want the Germans to win. The Americans are virtually criminals. Mafiosi types. Something out of modern US urban culture of the sewers. There is a modern soullessness about this movie that does not represent the Generation of WW2. It represent the generation of post-Iraq and Afghanistan, of Trump on the way. 
It bears no resemblance to 2 generations ago. The soul ethos, and camaraderie are missing, absent. It might as well be a tank crew of a Soviet punishment battalion. The director seems to have had more experience with violence and destruction in movies than with history and the WW2 military and the WW2 generation. 
After about 15 mins I was ready to switch off in disgust. Americans always winning battles, Germans always losing. If the US army in Germany in 1945 had been like this, the Germans would never have chosen to surrender to them. Its a truly appalling misrepresentation of a generation. 
But then modern US film making is in general grim and dark...maybe reflecting the soullessness of Trump USA.

","The cinematography was pretty good and I'll give Shia LaBeouf credit for doing a great acting job. But besides those things, the movie was kind of terrible. I didn't like Brad Pitt's ""typical"", clean- shaven, muscular, mean army guy thing that he had going on. Also the fact that Logan Lerman's character was the other ""typical"" character that had no idea what was going on was kind of ridiculous. The pain and fear that Logan Lerman's character faced is not unusual, but the fact that he was forcibly placed onto a tank was kind of weird. From my experience, it seems that those who work in tanks have some kind of special training. Why would they put someone like that in a tank? It doesn't seem very realistic. Jon Bernthal's character was also barbaric and seemed to be a bit exaggerated. Of course, it's possible that all of this may have actually happened. After all, anything's possible. However, the clothes and hairstyle that the girl had were incredibly unrealistic. That's not what girls of the 40s looked like. The fact that they just walked into the next room and had sex but tried to make it seem romantic was really weird. <br/><br/>The movie itself gave almost no indication that the characters were suffering. Jon Bernthal's character showed signs of breaking but it kind of seemed like his character was already like that. It seems like they took a couple of facts that they knew happened and tried to revolve everything around those things, without doing any other research..."

Compared to most war movies this is one with a different look on how things were, we've seen the movies about pilots, soldiers and marines, but never from the inside of a tank, where (of course) the actors are most of the times.

","""Fury"" is an American World-War-II themed film from 2 years ago written and directed by David Ayer, the man who directed Denzel Washington to his second Oscar and is also in charge of the much-awaited 2016 film ""Suicide Squad"". For ""Fury, he got to work with Brad Pitt, one of the biggest film stars of the planet, plus a fairly famous supporting cast. The outcome is disappointing. I quite like Pitt in some of his roles, but his participation in ""12 Years a Slave"" was already a major letdown and this film is nothing different. He does not even come close to losing himself in his character. I always had the impression that I would be watching Pitt. Zero character transformation here from him. But it also has a lot to do with how the film was written, which is in a way we never forget who the big star here is. The shirt undressing scene is about as cringeworthy as Lautner in ""Twilight"".<br/><br/>In terms of the contents of the film, it was an underwhelming watch too. I may be slightly biased as I have never been too big on war films (without any comedy), but ""Fury"" offered absolutely nothing that hasn't been done in other war movies already, better most of the time. It's tough to feel for any of the characters and the lack of convincing story cannot be simply made up by boastful special effects, explosions and tanks. So yeah, as a whole this was a disappointing watch, in terms of story and acting, especially the former. People who like empty war films that are style over substance like this one here may have a good watch with ""Fury"", but everybody else can really skip it. It also felt overlong at no less than 2 hours and 15 minutes, during which it frequently dragged I must say. Thumbs down, certainly nowhere near Pitt's finest career achievements. Actually a contender for weakest, especially with him producing as well. And not a glorious hour for Labeouf, Lerman or Eastwood jr. either. Stay away."
"The_Other_Snowman","4","3","5","10 January 2016"," Hell is Other People
","""Fury"" is probably one of the bloodiest films I've ever seen. The story follows a young machine-gunner on his first (and hopefully last) mission in a Sherman tank as the US Army invades Nazi Germany in 1945. Brad Pitt is the tank's ruthless commander, determined to make a man out of the new recruit using the time-tested methods of rape, murder, and general mayhem.<br/><br/>I've noticed a funny thing about movie violence lately: the level of my disgust varies depending on who's inflicting the violence on whom. If the story's protagonists are the ones getting hurt or killed, I will empathize with them and leave the film suitably affected. However, if the heroes are the ones doing the killing, I will feel merely sickened. There's a whiff of sadism about watching Pitt and his crew blow apart enemy soldiers from the safety of their tank, and a certain perverse satisfaction in the gruesome finale.<br/><br/>All this suggests that the filmmakers miscalculated. If they wanted to tell me that war is hell, they've succeeded; but if they wanted to make me sympathize with the soldiers on the front lines, they've missed their mark. Pitt's crew are bloodthirsty psychopaths to a man, and not worthy of my sympathy. The level of violence -- raw, gritty, at times grotesque -- might be realistic, but what purpose does it serve if it only makes me want to turn the film off? The film seems to have been produced by and for the kind of people who are more interested in the weapons and ammunition -- and their horrific effects on human bodies -- than in why those weapons were used. The battle scenes in ""Fury"" are recreated with reverence and awe, but not a lot of logic.<br/><br/>Halfway through the film is an intermission in a German town. Pitt discovers two young women in an apartment, and hosts an impromptu dinner party for his men. For a moment he becomes almost admirable, as his refined Southern manners are contrasted with the animal antics of his men, but the scene goes from bad to worse when we learn that his motives were simply to get the new recruit in bed with a German girl. This is rape masquerading as a manly coming-of-age ritual, every bit as sickening as the violence.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to argue against any film that presents war as dehumanizing and destructive, as ""Fury"" accomplishes quite well. I'm also reluctant to condemn a film that implicates the audience in its crimes. But ""Fury"" assaults the viewer so relentlessly that it ends up causing resentment, and finally apathy. When the credits start to roll, you'll want to turn it off and forget all about it."

Fury is an exhibition of how much a human can take in war and how it is shown in the eyes of the actors portraying the characters.<br/><br/>If you think you seen it all then you haven't. David Ayer always brings something spectacular to the table, and I know his portfolio as a writer and director can speak for itself. There is only a few that can do so and that is Ayer."

Therefore for me the film's music contributed most in making this movie so beautiful.The sense of reality at that time is truly painful to watch. The movie's success lies in bringing this pain tot the screen. The dramatic scene's strike a the heart of war. An emotion that most in this 21h century are lucky not to feel anymore but should never be forgotten. This movie honors the soldiers that fought and suffered during the war for our freedom, the freedom we live today's day. Giving a close up view of individuals together bonded by the Sherman Tank. The psychological aspect of war is extremely well performed by the actors. It hits the spot of a reason a war movie should be made, no entertainment, but all honor and respect for history's soldiers. Because if it wasn't for their offer, we might still not be able to feel our freedom. I thank everybody that contributed to Fury for expressing this reality. <br/><br/>An amazing, sad, realistic, painful and absolutely brilliant movie."

","A waste of time in almost every sense. No real story present, hollow characters, bad effects, bad acting. I was enthusiastic to finally see a WW2-movie focused on a tank crew with 2014 special effects, but was very disappointed. Everything about this shipwreck just looks and feels uninspired. There is no more story then ""5 guys in a tank, Germany 1944"", while this could be a base for a decent movie. The acting is horrible, it's either phoned in (Brad Pitt) or overacted (everyone else). The locations and sets could have been much better, almost no imagination needed in war-torn Germany 1944, but it all feels uninspired - again. The village they enter on a scouting mission looks and feels fake and so does everything happening in that village - the indoors lunch scene is totally ridiculous and never gets credible. The shooting of the SS-officer entering the village square is one of the worst ever, looks like how an 8 year old would act. The end of the movie is so ridiculous that I'm not even going to describe it - the A-team TV-series offered more realistic shootouts. The tank crew's acting is perhaps the worst of all, especially the lead character ""Norman"" - this kid must have had his daddy arrange an acting gig for him because he can't have gotten it for his talent. Or, keeping every other decision the director made in mind... Maybe the directory actually thought he was good. This movie is garbage."

","This movie could have been above 7/10, if the battles, especially the final one, had't been so bad that I wanted to exit the theater 5-10 minutes before the film finished. 1) action - plenty of it, very good technical effects of body parts being severed by MG bullets or tank projectiles, lots of explosions and other special effects 2) acting is good, no question 3) story - one tank crew fights its way through Nazi-Germany until they have to hold a crossroad, alone and immobilized against hundreds of elite SS troops to prevent the Nazis from hitting the supply columns of thousands of unescorted and unarmed (?) cooks and doctors. BAD. 4) it is so cliché-laden, it almost hurt. From the tough war-hero commander (Pitt), over the new guy struggling to assimilate, the one ""non-caucasian"" (in this case Mexican) in the team, the one slightly crazy team member, to the final mission which means certain death, which however, the new guy survives miraculously and due to the mercy of an enemy who decides against killing him, although his crew just mowed down 200 of his imbecile SS buddies... 5) realism was not on the list of goals to be achieved, which is demonstrated in most battle scenes. The Germans miss their targets most of the time out of close range and the final battle is so ridiculous that it ruined an otherwise decent, but cliché-laden movie. 300 elite SS troops constantly dance into the MG fire of the immobilized tank like ballerinas, waving their guns and missing the tank out of 5 yards distance with an RPG 2 or 3 times, sticking their head into the tank to be stabbed to death, and always attacking from the front, since the tank has no guns on the sides and in the back (where Pitt stands for 5 minutes on top of the tank killing dozens but not being hit once until a sniper shoots him three times in the chest, which, however, still allows him to climb back in the tank and hold a nice chat with the rookie, until he is blown up by two grenades, which do finally kill him but leave his body completely intact.<br/><br/>There are so many unrealistic, or let's say idiotic, scenes that this otherwise decent action flick ended up being sub-par."

Why does this work? Because in the very first scene, the one with the giant bolder and poison darts, etc., I was setup for a no-wholes-bared rip-roaring fantasy. Fury, on the other hand, starts out with a very realistic atmosphere and continues that way until the final scene when it becomes utterly ridiculous. At the start of the movie a child, who looks to be about 12-years-old, destroys a fully functioning tank. In the final scene, hundreds of battle hardened SS troops can't seem to knockout an immobilized tank in the dead of night without losing half their strength. Really? All the while, as if to add insult to my injured suspension of disbelief, the death of each soldier in the tank crew causes the surviving ones to stop fighting and exhibit their heart felt sorrow for what seems like long enough for the German troops to overrun the tank and two more just like it. I'm not saying this is a bad movie,overall the acting is quite good, and it works to a point, but the end should have starred Rambo or Captain America.

"aharmas","5","7","17","19 October 2014"," Are we furious yet?
","There are some outstanding war films out there, and I wanted so badly to have ""Fury"" become another one of them. Two hours later, I felt disappointed that here was this big budget movie that fails to give us a coherent account or depiction of what was supposed to be a couple of days in the middle of hell. <br/><br/>First the good: Brad Pitt believes in his character and doesn't fail to embody the spirit of the traumatized leader who has seen his faith and beliefs shaken more than a few times. There's the neophyte (Logan), a young man literally dumped as the action is turning crazier and bloodier. There is the squad of hardcore men who can't seem to find goodness anywhere despite what comes out of their mouths. Le Beouf hangs on the believe some higher being will keep him going, but his eyes are listless. The token minority doesn't seem to have much of a vocabulary or a point of view. Pena is wasted here. There is the soldier who has lost the ability to feel compassion and has become a shell of a being, with nothing resembling a soul in him. Of course, we have a beautifully reenacted scenery full of rotting bodies, wounded and dying men, with fog machines working full time to give it the proper atmosphere. Impeccable visual and special effects and some good make up creations.<br/><br/>However, both the screenwriter and the director (who happen to be the same person) appeared to have gone AWOL or have been the victim of a crazy American or German sniper. It really doesn't matter who because it feels like the camera was left running and the actors appear lost most of the time. Nothing really comes together. The dialog is weak at best, there seems to be no rhythm for the flow of the story (which is very thin to say the least), and this is too bad because the expected range of emotions never comes through. Oh yes, there are the required excessive amount of cussing as heads are blown up, imminent danger happens, or hell breaks loose, but it's hard to connect it to anything since it seems the editor has become victim of some kind of chemical agent the troops have been exposed to, but it's not the characters that feel the effects, but the members of the audience, as movie editing goes up in smoke, and we really don't get to appreciate the beautiful horrors of what other films have given us in the past.<br/><br/>Here we yearn for the constant fear that Scott conjured in ""Black Hawk Dawn"", for the madness of ""Full Metal Jacket"", a movie that is both intense and too constricted, but that has some kind of focus. We start wondering where the muses that inspired the battles of ""Private Ryan"", ""Braveheart"", and even the flawed ""Alexander"" have gone. Even less popular films like ""Hamburger Hill"" managed to terrify, disgust, and sicken us. There are moments we beg for Stone to step in and give us some of the psychological and physical shadows of death and despair. We want the self-discipline of Eastwood who knows how to make quiet a stifling force, a prelude to even more hellish moments. There is humanity in those films. In here it makes a brief appearance in a scene where people regain a semblance of humanity that is quickly shattered by some members of the heroic fury troop.<br/><br/>It's not a complete mess, but a film that needed some more intervention, some more trimming, some more editing to use the elements that give a more complete picture of what the original goal is. We get the drift and cry when the tragic end arrives because we know it's going in that direction, but we also fear that it never gets there because it never feels like we are in the middle of a German field in 1945."

Do you really park up and ruminate life next to a burning tank full of ammunition? Do you really patrol bunched up next to an ambush threat. The war is nearly over. The Germans had realized they'd lost months ago. Would a company of soldiers fight to the last man knowing their support MG and AT guns were taken out? Did GI's really chatter away in 21st century slang?

And although this film had more than a few inaccuracies with content and props, I would have to say that, overall, the film was well written and acted. I would not allow my 12year old daughter to view it, but would definitely allow my 17year old nephew to view it. Within the story, I found the focus to slide, quickly, from Wardaddy to Norman. I am sure that it was intentional. But, I would have preferred to learn more about Wardaddy. Especially after viewing Pitt's scarred back and torso when he was cleaning up in the woman's apartment. Also, I do not think that the uncomfortableness of the apartment storyline was either integral or as realistic, considering Wardaddy spoke German. The assumption was that a rape would occur. Viewer's were led through this drawn-out scene...will they/won't they....when the viewer already knew that it wouldn't be a violent interlude. The film established the morality of both characters long before this scene. Overall, a valiant effort. I can understand, easily, where the nominations came from."

","Having been around awhile I've seen my share of war movies. Back in the last century most were about triumphant, courageous types who were luckier than lottery winners. Bullets always seemed to just miss them while their shots almost always hit the mark. It was a simpler, more simple-minded, time. I think 'Fury' would have appalled 'the greatest generation' having been weaned on John Wayne and Audie Murphy.<br/><br/>There's no way to explain it. Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf have a better grasp of warfare than your average recruiting sergeant. Their performances here evoke a better sense of battle and war than any I've seen. And I felt as if they were bringing to life exactly what needed to be seen: those scenes between brothers in arms that 99% of soldiers know, no one will ever know or understand.<br/><br/>It's a terrifying movie to watch and I'm glad I didn't catch it until the DVD came out. I was able to stop it when it got too intense which was a couple of times. Every performance is beautifully delivered and that's a miracle too. How did the director get these young men to understand what most men never will? It's beyond me.<br/><br/>This story is a moving experience but probably not destined to be everyone's favorite, especially women. The only scenes not hip deep in war are shocking and disturbing because they involve men with women under the worst of circumstances. The battle scenes make sense and yet there's no hint they're somehow contrived. That in itself is a unique achievement.<br/><br/>I haven't seen 'American Sniper' yet but if it's even half as good as this I'll be quite happy."
"Screen_Blitz","9","4","8","28 January 2015"," Gritty, violent, and highly entertaining World War II flick with solid performances
","David Ayer's dark and gritty take on World War II boasts a powerful representation on the horrifying reality of war. In short words, it has nothing to say other than ""War is hell"", or as Brad Pitt's character puts it ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"". Shining on screen is a stellar cast of actors taking on roles of soldiers in this violent, gory World War II flick that shies away from director David Ayer's typical works which often deal with police drama ('End of Watch', 'Street Kings'). And what David Ayer pedals on screen this time is a crew of soldiers who face the unforgiving reality of war on the European battlefront, which is no stranger to lead Brad Pitt who wielded the role of Nazi-killing Lieutenant Aldo Rain in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' five years ago. In further detail, he proceeds not with the goal to give viewers a bleak history lesson, but to simply tell a story that feels parallel to what being in active combat feels like, even if the plot feels slightly run-of-the-mill. Set in April of 1945 near the conclusion of World War II on the European Theater, Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, a war-hardened staff sergeant leading of his crew of men in an M4 Sherman Tank through the European battlefields to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. His courageous crew includes a religious soldier named Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (played by Shia Labeouf), flamboyant gun-loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (played by Jon Bernthal), Mexican tank driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (played by Michael Pena), and the newly hired assistant driver Norman Ellis (played by Logan Lerman). Together, these crew of men fight through the violent fields of Germany while struggling to cope with a bloodshed horrors of active combat.<br/><br/>Although David Ayer's rendition of World War II on the European front doesn't flourish the same emotionally gravitas as 'Saving Private Ryan' (unsurprisingly), it paints a highly disturbing portrait of the harsh reality of war in a way that rarely pulls the punches. When the crew enters the battlegrounds, heads are blown off, soldiers are engulfed in flames, bodies are torn apart, and our characters bravely pursue through the fields knowing they can be killed in any second. If there are any moments that offer levity, they cam from the occasional humorous one-liners that the characters spit out every now and then. All in all, they do little to sugarcoat the grueling atmosphere that pervades this emotionally blistering trek. The story focuses on a crew of men crammed inside the tight confinement of a Sherman Tank, and newest member on the ride is Logan Lerman's character Norman Ellis, a young typist who's inexperienced in active combat. Upon first entering the battlegrounds, Norman struggles vigorously on coping with the horrors of war as opposed to Brad Pitt's Wardaddy who's seen it all since the beginning. As the story proceeds, Norman grows a broader eye on the truth of war that puts to maximum test in the climatic battle sequence during the final third. And his character's growth from cowardly to bravely is handled mostly well, though it feels a little rushed towards the end in the aforementioned battle sequence. As for the rest of the characters who are left in a two-dimensional state (except Wardaddy), they are not only fortunately energized with cast's solid performances that speak high volumes of the actors' talents, but very human in their portrayal (though Jon Bernthal character's shows slight resemblance of a caricature).<br/><br/>Fury is gritty, violent, but highly entertaining World War II flick empowered by a powerful direction by David Ayer and solid performances by a likable cast. While the film may not hold the same amount of emotional gravitas as other high-ranked films of the genre, it is honest in it's portrait of war and stands strong as a powerful picture."

And Bradd Pitt is also outstanding, great to see a Hollywood superstar acting that good in these kind of movies.

","Some of the battle action is not realistic but this does not detract from the deeper message.<br/><br/>""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"" states Don Collier (played by Brad Pitt) as he takes a new crew member under his wing. However it is this Norman Ellison played by Logan Lerman who is really the central character in this movie.<br/><br/>Conscience hits the reality of war, as a Norman young inexperienced American, suddenly takes the role as machine gunner in a US Sherman tank nicknamed Fury in the dying throws of Nazi Germany. Powerless and hardly believing where he is Norman cries, ""I have never even seen the inside of a tank"". Movement, power, brutality and destruction follow the tracks of the steel tank, as all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>This film is called ""Heart of Steel or ""Herz aus Stahl"" in Germany and this name is very appropriate. Within the few days of combat in the heart of Germany, Norman goes from someone prepared to die, rather than execute captured SS soldiers, to a furious, hard hearted killing machine. As he quickly learns, it is not quite as simple as ""kill or be killed"". If he does not kill quickly, his crew members could easily be those which will quickly die.<br/><br/>If you are looking for much more depth than just an action packed war movie, then this is for you. <br/><br/>Every moment life changing decisions are presented. While the moral conflict rages all around him, it penetrates and grasps his heart. As the movie ends, he survives only through the mercy of an SS soldier. Deep in thought he weighs his soft heart at the beginning of the film and his hard heart at the end. The path his heart took seems almost unreal but the film makes it seem logical and plausible.<br/><br/>The deeper issue of idealism and realism is the heart of this story.<br/><br/>Should an idealistic person such as Norman act on moral principles or as most others, act on interests. Ideals without power to put them in practice are shown to be empty but power alone is seen to be brutal. It is said that realism and idealism are different sides of power and must be used together with both heart and discernment. The main characters struggle with this moral conflict. This dark world shows that a man who understands both reality and morality is rare.<br/><br/>I couldn't stop talking and thinking about this movie for days. Yes the action is not always realistic as many have pointed out but I think the message comes across powerfully. <br/><br/>Ultimately you are drawn to ask, ""How would I have decided in his situation?"" <br/><br/>The nearest way I can think of to experience this at home today, is if you have the courage to play a Moral Conflict WWII strategy board game! Playford Games beckons you,just like Norman to make decisions not just in real fast paced action but on their path of the heart. <br/><br/>This experience could help you to understand, rather than condemn the decisions Norman took in Fury."
"harryburke-09522","10","6","14","12 May 2016"," Fury Review
","Film review Name of the film: Fury Year of the film: 2014 Name of director: David Ayer Star Rating: 7.6/10<br/><br/>When I saw the first trailer for the film I instantly fell in love it looked exactly like my kind of movie and I like all of the actors that star in it so I was expecting a lot. It's an action movie set in the 1940's about a tank crew in an Easy 8 sherman which was the average American tank used but this one was special because unlike any other the crew had been together since the beginning. The film is about a tank crew in World War 2 that have been together since the beginning but one of the crew dies so they need a new recruit but because the rest of the crew are like family it's hard for them to accept him. The commander of the tank is called War Daddy he is played by Brad Pitt, his character is like the leader of the crew but he is still not the main character that role is held by Norman or Machine who is played by Logan Lerman. His character Norman is the new crew member to the tank but he has issues with the war and shouldn't actually be in a tank because he was trained as a typist but was shipped over to the wrong place. The other three crew member are: Bible who is played by Shia LaBeouf, Gordo who is played by Michael Pena and Grady who is played by Jon Berthal. I loved almost everything about fury the fight scenes were amazing and the dramatic scenes were even better. There was one thing I didn't like about the film and that is the realism such as in that time of the war you would have seen other tanks fighting alongside the Fury Sherman such as Hellcats and the British Firefly but all you see are shermans but to normal people that wouldn't matter because they wouldn't notice something like that. Also the scene when they are fighting the tiger the Fury hits the front panel dead on and with the shells they used in that model the shell would have gone straight through but again that's something normal people wouldn't notice. I think the main aim of the film was to entertain because they didn't pay too much attention on what it was actually like back then because a few things were missed out but it definitely did entertain and is still one of my favourite movies of all time. My overall opinion of the movie is: I enjoyed it even though they could have added more and dropped some things but I love it and still watch it over and over."

It might be worth pointing out the preamble, obviously written after someone had been down the pub, had nothing to with the rest of the film.

Probably a little over the top. Okay get on with it already!<br/><br/>The part about the German armor being superior, understood. That scene with the Sherman's fighting the Tiger looked like a reenactment from a documentary I saw. <br/><br/>Then all of the sudden, the movie took a weird turn that can only happen in Hollywood fantasy land. Went totally surreal, and partially turned into a 70's style Nazi revenge movie.<br/><br/>Didn't anyone notice with the German column that about every third solider was carrying a panzerfaust (German anti-tank rocket) over their shoulder. What a continuity/story error! When the German's arrive they are noticeably missing them. I guess on the way they neatly packed them into crates because the commander says ""sneak these over and shoot that tank, this is all we have left!"". On top of that there were what looked like at least a dozen of them.<br/><br/>Really? The Panzerfaust were not like the crappy British PIAT spring launcher models. One would have been enough through the back of a standing still tank (even one PIAT).<br/><br/>Actually the whole thing was crazy nonsense at this point. It's a static (not moving) Sherman tank, the men on foot surely could have moved out of the way of the slow rotating turret as they were close and could have avoided the limited arc of the front gun. Apparently these were stereotypical ""dumb"" Germans that thought it would be better to run directly into the path of the machine guns instead.<br/><br/>Way to go to kill a movie guys! It's like whom ever wrote this movie ran out of ideas and just gave up with a big heaping handful out of the bag of nonsense, stereotypes, and clichés. <br/><br/>I felt insulted; as if everyone was pushed into the sub-moronic IQ level.<br/><br/>It's too bad, I really wanted to like this movie.

","I found this movie good...but not great. Being a self-professed history and military nerd, I found too many tactics related errors and Hollywoodizations (Yes, that is a a word. At least it is now...) the portrayal of German soldiers, both armored and foot, very problematic unrealistic and downright disrespectful. From the Hitler Jugend ambush to the armored ambush featuring Tiger 131 to the climactic battle, they are given short shrift and no tactical respect. To wit-<br/><br/>A one Panzerfaust ambush with no follow on fires or supporting infantry fires on a linear road with plenty of escape routes for the ambushed. Even with inexperienced troops, this isn't happening...<br/><br/>The tank platoon is hit by entrenched, established forces with clear pre-established and ranged fields of fire...and the Tiger is drawn out into the open in some kind of cavalry duel with Fury? No. Way. The ambush if not successful and led by anyone with any experience would have resulted in a tactical withdrawal to fight another day. The Tigers KwK 36 main gun could have eliminated Fury and its support from over 1000 meters away...why would he be drawn out into a cavalry charge? <br/><br/>Finally, the climactic battle scene...in which elite Waffen SS infantry are drawn into a senseless battle against one disabled tank at a meaningless crossroads. Any commander with half a clue would have stuck to his mission and simply diverted around the tank through the surrounding area, leaving Fury isolated and alone. The SS sniper who ultimately took out Wardaddy was a needless piece of fluff too...why he would need to be ghillied up and ease forward at the stalk is beyond me. With the heat of battle joined all about him, he could have easily flanked out the fully exposed Fury and kept her crew pinned down for the remainder of the evening, allowing his kameraden to move forward to their objective. Don't even get me started on the Panzerfausts and their penetration capability...<br/><br/>And how many rounds were fired at Brad when he was exposed on top of Fury? Tell me that one stinking senior soldatten could not have just calmly fired one round into his head to end the whole thing? But I guess if he had, we would not have had much of a movie now would we?<br/><br/>But I digress. At times, a gripping, suspenseful and enjoyable movie, but if you are a military veteran and or nerd like me, don't bother. Re watch Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. They at least make you care about the characters."

I was expecting a 7,5-8,0 and what I got felt more like 6,0 out of 10.<br/><br/>Warning, spoiler alerts!<br/><br/>This film has some terribly poor shot scenes that show off Hollywood's preference to ""action"" and ""drama"" rather than toning it down a bit and thus creating some actual suspense (Check out Das Boot for example if you want to see how it should have been done in terms of building suspense and character development).<br/><br/>I was literally laughing at my TV when the scene came along where Brad Pitt's brigade has to attack At cannons through an open field:<br/><br/>1. Why not flank them? Well, because Shermans were so well known for their fantastic frontal armour so those shots will bounce right off for right? And sure we have no intel on what they have for weaponry or numbers but I'm sure their calibre and skill of the crew will be so feeble that they will LITERALLY miss 3-4 shots fired straight at a bunch of Sherman tanks actually moving at walking speed. <br/><br/>Because obviously German AT crews firing AP shells from cover would surely miss multiple times at a distance of a only a few 100 yards with a precision engineered high powered antitank cannon. That's way beyond suspending of disbelief here.<br/><br/>2. The scene that really killed the film for me is the part where they get into a house with the 2 German women and they have a dinner. That part was actually nice, where Brad Pitt's character actually tries to get a bit of the normal world back among the madness of war. But the following scene just shouts Hollywood's misunderstanding of what drama is all over it. Way before the mortar barrage starts I was already telling myself 'If I was a really BAD scriptwriter I'd have an enemy counter attack hitting the village right when they come out and of course a stray shell utterly destroys the building they were just in killing the women they had just sort of bonded with.' And so it happened.<br/><br/>Clever scriptwriting and dramatic impact? No, Hollywood ""geniuses"", that's just called playing the 'Lazy Captain Obvious' card.<br/><br/>The film had potential but stuff such as described above just killed it, well that and all the usual clichés:<br/><br/><ul><li>Rookie joining an experienced crew - Rookie gets pushed around a lot - Rookie eventually somehow proves himself - The guys on the Fury tank are mostly just the standard stereotypes (preachy kind of guy, redneck hillbilly) and we're supposed to accept what they do and care about them because they've been through rough times. The only 2 interesting characters are Brad Pitt and the rookie, the rest is utterly forgettable/interchangeable. - The German soldiers are all either nameless thugs (Well safe for 1 scene) or just purely evil and can be shot without something like a trial even though they're unarmed and have surrendered (Private Ryan did so much better a job about what war does to people and how soldiers try to preserve their humanity (think about the final scene of that film).</li></ul><br/><br/>Such a letdown."

","One of the latest films that Hollywood released during the last year was Fury. This movie is about five American soldiers who fight during the World War Second against the Nazi regimen with a tank called Fury. This movie was the first war movie that Brad Pitt starred in after Inglorious Bastards thus the expectation created about his performance was more than justified. As far as I am concerned, his actuation is pretty satisfactory as usual. With regard to the movie itself, it cannot be considered only as another war movie because it has been produced under a completely different point of view. As many other war movies, it contains enough violence and strong scenes for war filmgoers but considering others aspect, it is not the typical American movie in which Americans always win. Among all the violent scenes mentioned before, there is an extra space for dramatic situations and hilarious moments that provoke a deep contrast between fun and war. This contrast can be appreciated in the magical touch that Brad Pitt gives in the production. The only thing that spectators might miss in the movie is the lack of a good soundtrack and that is what makes the difference between a good movie and a masterpiece. To sum up, I have no hesitation to recommend you this remarkable film. It deserves each pound you have paid for watching it."

Fury, provides a far better close-up view of the challenges of a WW2 tank commander and his team than any other film I've seen. This historical insight is what I liked best about Fury. Like Saving Private Ryan, it masterfully depicts the diverse personalities of the team and how they interact. There is plenty of action and suspense. But there is also a fair bit of drama and tension between the characters. The film has no shortage of acting talent. Brad Pitt does an excellent job (though I think his performance in Basterds was better). Fortunately the film doesn't rely entirely on Pitt to carry it -- a few other members of his tank crew also give notable performances (my favorites were Bernthal and Pena). Many people have argued about the realism of a few Shermans beating a Tiger. I don't know how likely that is, but that scene definitely showed us how out-matched the Shermans were by the Tigers. Also many have complained about the final fight scene, which was totally unrealistic, but what we're supposed to get from it is that our heroes could have walked away and they chose to stay and fight knowing they had no chance. I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again."

The others were (a)the religious nut; (b) the green moon-faced scared newbie; (c) the brute; and (d)the immigrant (cholo). It was hard to empathize with any of them.<br/><br/>I thought the movie would be a real expose of how the German Panzer and Tiger tanks fought tank battles, and the tactical difficulties American tankers had to face; instead, we only see one tank battle, really, and a preposterous scene at the end where the 5 tankers decide to ""stand their ground"" in a broken tank in the middle of the road, against a battalion of Waffen SS. Of course, before they meet their ultimate demise (except, of course, the baby-faced newbie, who saves himself by hiding under the tank), they kill a great percentage of the battalion, because the Germans run right in front of the the guns, back and forth, back and forth, instead of sneaking up behind the tank or taking it out with one of their many anti-tank weapons.<br/><br/>Quite disappointing, and a sheer waste of time, with very little entertainment value."

","Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier is the commander of a US Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury'; he and his crew have been in the thick of it in North Africa, Normandy and are now in Germany in the dying days of the war. Private Norman Ellison has only been in the army for eight weeks and is trained as an office typist until for some reason he is assigned to Collier's crew to replace a dead member he is definitely not ready for the terrors of war. He is certainly the outsider in the crew. As they progress through various actions he sees is baptism of fire and becomes a hardened fighter. Eventually collier is ordered to take five tanks to defend a vital crossroads; four are destroyed leaving 'Fury to defend the location then a battalion of SS turn up and one hell of a firefight ensues.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a war film with lots of brutal action then this is likely to be the film for you; people are decapitated; burn and are blown up. There is also the feeling that secondary characters could die at any time and as the end approaches it feels as if anybody could die. There is a problem with the characters unfortunately; early on we see Collier forcing Ellison to shoot a German prisoner and the rest of the 'hardened crew' are even less likable I almost found myself cheering for the German Tiger tank that was picking off the 'good guys'. The action scenes were intense and nicely captured some of the confusion of battle even if, as others have noted, the tracer fire looked like lasers in a sci-fi movie. The ending definitely requires one to suspend ones disbelief as hundreds of Germans take enormous casualties before they make the slightest headway against this single tank even though they have anti-tank weapons. The cast lead by Brad Pitt, in the role of Collier, does a solid job making us believe in the characters even if some of those characters are pretty hard to like. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of war films; just don't expect it to be too believable."

We are talking about SS unit, which is special forces of Nazi army. Not ordinary soldiers.<br/><br/>20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilized Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 SS soldiers can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a road? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in any war movie.<br/><br/>Cast is good enough.

"jackpenmanreid","8","2","3","6 October 2016"," Most Realistic War Movie Since Saving Private Ryan
","Pleasantly surprised by the realism of the film. Fury does not shy away from the horror of war which I found refreshing as many war films tend to go down the glory road. The action is intense and actually makes you feel tense (the film states in the opening credits that the American tanks where inferior to the German tanks and this adds to the sense of dread and tension during the battle scenes). I find the quiet 20 minutes in the middle of the film drag and feels too long but it does have some pretty haunting dialogue which stuck with me. The dialogue as a whole is consistently good and ranges from moving to funny to sad. I still remember the foreboding line spoken by Shia LeBouf in the beginning of the film to green as grass recruit Norman ""Wait until you see it. What a man can do to another man."" Fury has some great cinematography which will turn even the strongest stomach, from decomposing bodies in the mud to piles of dead soldiers being pushed out the way by a bulldozer to hundreds of German POW's staring sorrowfully at Brad Pitt's character WarDaddy. One of my favourite scenes is of a beautiful German refugee Girl staring at Norman and he smiles back. I really got the feeling that rather than staring because she was attracted to him, she was just shocked at how young he was for a soldier and this really left an impression me. Fury does not try to paint the Americans as all good hero's and neither paints the Germans as evil (apart from the SS which Fury makes a point of showing are hated by the American soldiers above all else.)The character of Norman (played by Logan Lerman) is very relatable and it's easy to put yourself in his shoes, especially earlier in the film when he's practically mad with fear during his first combat encounters. I would definitely recommend this film as it is a welcome break from stereotypical war films that stick to the usual flag waving formula or war films that just plain aren't violent enough and hide away from the horrors of way."

Nice to see Shia LaBeouf appear somewhat likable. Most met honorable ends. I guess it was kind of corny to see Logan Lerman's character ""become a man"" in more ways than one. Yes there are several clichés, but I could overlook it. I put on my Amazon wish list, but I'm not sure how often I would watch it again. It's rather intense at times."

","I liked the action in this film and the acting, however the story line was way over the top for a story which supposedly was happening during World War II. American soldiers are shown to be crazed psycho killers. They enjoy killing so much that they laugh and cheer every time they kill someone. Also, they kill everyone including surrendering soldiers. When they seize a town, they become ""mad hatters"", blowing up pianos, wearing gold chains and top hats, dancing around in the streets like a band of wild savages. The feel of the film is the area is not the 1940s, but the late 1960s when Viet Nam was lost and drugged out soldiers ran wild, or maybe not. Hollywood has a way of making ""Joe Public"" believe that a movie shows real life. But, this movie was a major hit, Brad Pitt is great, so who cares if it is realistic or not. It is a movie, nothing more and nothing less. For some action entertainment, I rate it a 7 out of 10. If you want to see a realistic World War II movie, see a Walk In The Sun with Dana Andrews."

"nadblaster","6","1","1","14 December 2019"," Could have been so much more
","The most frustrating part of this entire movie, more than anything else, is that it was so close to greatness, and let a couple of weird lapses in judgment drag it down to ""not a total waste of time but not great at all"" territory.<br/><br/>There are lots and lots of subtle little things that this movie likes to do that elevate it above most other war movies. The sky is perpetually grey and cloudy, the times the sun shines are extremely rare, and you better believe that that was intentional. The ""good guys"", the American tankers, are barely-restrained animals, with rotting teeth, frayed clothing, permanent filth in their hair and on their faces, etc. The movie at large does a really great job of showing the more animal side of warfare, insofar as how an extended period of total warfare can twist even the most righteous person into a growling barbarian.<br/><br/>The acting is all well above average, to the last actor. Brad Pitt is a personal favorite and as the weird, violent but caring Wardaddy he is a natural. A total prick, a fierce warrior and a harsh taskmaster, he swings between screaming, slavering killer and protective father figure. Pitt himself did a great job of showing that his character wasn't always that way; there is a scene where his civilization shines through and it's actually touching. Shia LaBoeuf does a top-notch job as the proselytizing ""straight man"", trying to stay right with God while doing as much damage to the Reich as possible. It's magical and I honestly feel that this is LaBoeuf's best performance of his life. The scenes where the tank crew jokes around and messes with one another are great and do a fantastic job of showing how close five men can get when they live, fight and die together in a closed, dark and dangerous casket like a Sherman.<br/><br/>Why isn't this a 10/10 then? Because for all the amazing stage-setting they do, for all the trials and hardships and laughs we experience with this close-knit tank family, there are a few scenes that are so creatively and fundamentally bankrupt that they completely and utterly obliterate the setting and tone. There is a truly touching and genuinely incredible scene about halfway through the movie, and it makes you think, makes you feel, it's amazing. Then five minutes later there's a huge explosion and that scene is literally destroyed, no reason, no warning. I understand it's probably meant to show how random and senseless war can be, but I left that scene thinking ""man, what a waste of time"". Maybe it just went over my head though.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm sure there are hundreds of other reviews about this, but the final scene is so unbelievably stupid it boggles the mind, and I am absolutely gobsmacked that this somehow made it past the scriptwriter. In fifteen short minutes all suspensions of disbelief are instantly dismantled and all the stage-setting that was done is hurled out a window. The dumbest, least sensical ending I have ever seen for a war movie, and I've seen some pretty damn dumb movies.<br/><br/>Overall a movie worth watching, but it's more notable for how good it could have been and almost was."

Ultimately, all you're left with is a collection of depressing scenes, sad moments, and a worldview so cynical that it seems to endorse the surrender of ideals in favor of acceptance and comradery from ones compatriots and in the face of the brutality of the human condition that underlies the farce of civilization."
"sddavis63","7","1","1","7 December 2017"," Simple And Straightforward With Some Excellent Tank Battle Scenes
","If you're looking for a deep and well developed plot, then ""Fory"" will probably disappoint. It's a very straightforward and even simple story of an American tank crew in the last days of World War II. Battle hardened and perhaps a bit cynical as a result, these Americans for the most part are not the honourable heroes that American movies usually portray. They've become as vicious as anyone else. They'll mercilessly kill their prisoners, they'll rape German women. There's repeated reflections on how bad the SS are whenever they're encountered - but under the surface there's a sense that this particular tank crew at least isn't all that much better. They kill indiscriminately, with little hesitation and few attacks of conscience. It's all to paint a broad picture of war as brutal and ugly. It dehumanizes warriors, turning them int killing machines. It's a very bloody and graphic and violent movie, featuring some of the most vicious tank battles I've ever come across on film. It isn't a movie that's going to give you the warm fuzzies, nor does it create heroes. It's not a very likable movie - and yet, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>First, I liked the lead performances from Brad Pitt as Sgt. Collier (the commander of the tank crew) and Logan Lerman as Norman (a clerk typist who somehow got assigned to tank duty. Logan was not welcomed or respected by the crew. He didn't want to kill; he didn't really want to fight. He wanted to type. He still saw the Germans as people rather than enemies. I liked the portrayal of the bond that developed between Collier and Norman. Collier took him under his wing in a sense - protected him somewhat from the abuse of the crew and treated him decently, all the while preparing him for war. Norman gradually evolves and - sadly in some ways - by the end of the movie becomes a savage warrior like the others. I found myself kind of wanting Norman to stay more human; his gradual transformation was a little bit sad. The rest of the tank crew (played by actors like Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal) were pretty one dimensional.<br/><br/>The best scenes of the movie are probably in the German apartment where Collier and Norman hook up with two German women - one of whom seemed very young and innocent - much like Norman, actually. There's a tension to those scenes. Norman takes her into a bedroom and we assume they have sex - but it didn't seem to be a savage rape. This was Norman. The two seemed genuinely to like each other and found something with each other in the midst of the insanity around them. The girl's death as a civilian casualty when the Americans are attacked seems to be the turning point for Norman.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a pretty simple and straightforward movie - but it does have some good moments of reflection and humanity. (7/10)"
"ravitchn","7","1","1","15 April 2017"," Much better than expected, even very good
","Not a fan of war movies and battlefield scenes I had no expectation that I would enjoy this flick. And enjoy is not the right word because it is very long and certainly difficult to deal with. But there are two reasons I believe the movie is to be praised. First the hardened leader of the tank squad, WarDaddy played by Brad Pitt, reveals deep down a sympathy and a compassion for a young soldier way out of his element, an office soldier who somehow becomes a victim of army procedures and was sent to fight in a dangerous showdown with SS troops desperate to save the Heimat from the Americans in the last days of the war somewhere in western or central Germany. Pitt is tough, hard on his comrades and even harder on the Krauts he encounters. But he also, my second point, is able to be somewhat sympathetic even to the German civilians he encounters, whether they were or were not Nazi believers. The scene in the German home with the two women and the battle scared veteran Americans, plus the coming of age there of Norman the young soldier mentioned above, is very movingly done. Pitt's character is complex: a mixture of needed brutality covering perhaps a sensitivity as genuine as Norman's. You don't see this very often in these movies and I applaud those responsible for seeing past the obvious. I am not sure whether Norman's life is spared by accident or by a German soldier's sudden decision to be merciful; if the latter is meant then even a German soldier can have compassion. This did not occur often -- especially not on the Eastern Front -- but it did occur. Germans are after all not that different from us, as much as we should like to think and as much as we are justified in being skeptical."

","**Contains mild spoilers**<br/><br/>The WWII battlefield has been retold countless times. As such, a new approach can be hard to create.<br/><br/>The film starts well, unlike most modern WWII films it focuses on an experienced tank crew headed by none other but the charismatic Brad Pitt. Against all odds this tank team seems to have survived multiple battles and the films begins showing a severely religious and naive new recruit commanded to join the tight-knit team near the end of the war. It becomes immediately clear that part of the film will evolve around the changing psyche of this new idealistic, utopian-minded recruit.<br/><br/>The film is explicitly gritty, showing the true horror of war. One particular memorable, albeit brief, scene shows a body being run over by a tank. Another shows bulldozers clearing away a small mountain of dead German soldiers. It seems to denounce the reality of war as any good war film will do. <br/><br/>Yet, despite this fantastic start the film made, it soon descends in terms of script, characters and story-line. The transition of new recruit ""Norman"" is so fast as to be unbelievable. Meanwhile an against-the-odds action-focused scene at the end, shows the Nazi enemy to be inept rather than the feared experienced enemy they actually were. In the end, the film seems to glorify violence that it earlier seemed to condemn.<br/><br/>The film is easy-watching, at times shocking and well produced but in the end is ultimately forgettable.

I didn't expect to see German shock troops to be mow down like a bunch of orcs from LOTR, but whatever. Perhaps there is a reason why the US lost only"" about 400.000 soldiers in that war and Germany ten times more. But in this movie all looks very naive to me, like a script from some first-person shooter. It is above all, a war-glorifying movie. Sacrifices have to be made, and the enemy must be destroyed at all costs. By all means necessary. But, the battles in this movie between remains of the German Army and the US troops are silly. Zee Germans"" seem unable to hit anything with their weapons. Not even from an ambush with their enemies in the open field. A crucial battle between a German Tiger Tank and our heroes is stupid. Or better said the Germans are stupid. At one point in the battle, both crews try to get behind the opponent to hit the weakest point of the tank, but as our heroes are moving to reach the back of the Tiger, the Germans only rotate their turret as if they have no idea of the threat. And they die, of course. Furthermore, the Germans use their infantry weapons (in all stages of the movie) to attack our heroes tank, although it is a futile attempt. Crazy stuff. And the final battle between our heroes and the German SS troops is mind boggling. First of all, we see a SS-battalion (aproxx. 300 soldiers or more), armed with ancient kar98 rifles, machine-gun and couple of anti-tank weapons marching (and singing!) toward our heroes. Our protagonist spots them and runs to warn his friends. He reaches them in couple of seconds so I expected the Germans to be close, but no. Our heroes have time to argue whether they will run away or stay and fight (gues what they decided!) against many ill-equipped enemies. They set up an ambush in their immobilized tank and wait. Pleeeeenty of time to talk some more. Then the hilarity ensues, a battle that has to be seen to be believed! All of a sudden the night falls, everything is on fire, smoke everywhere. Zee Germans run left and right, confused, getting killed. They return fire from their rifles and machine-gun, and – no surprise – they do nothing! Then, after losing dozens of troops, the bad guys decide to use anti-tank weapons. Two of the rockets miss, although they are fired from about 5 meters distance and the third one manages to penetrate the armor and kill a single crew-member. Then our heroes get really mad, they shoot and reload. Shoot, reload. After some time they only shoot, no time to reload! But, there are too many storming Germans. Our heroes die, and the main protagonist survives and is rescued. All's well that ends well."

","I am not sure why this movie is getting all the high reviews. As already noted, this is the story of a family of 5 tank members that fight in a close quarters in a Sherman tank towards the end of WWII. <br/><br/>The tank scenes in the movie, of course, keep you on the edge of your seat, however there were several scenes that dragged on and on and really did not contribute to the story. Ofttimes I found myself saying 'all right already, move on'. I thought one of the tank member's roles was so overacted it was totally unbelievable. <br/><br/>I also think the gore was excessive and overdone. In Saving Private Ryan, the horrors of war were appropriately placed and truly showed viewers for the first time how frightening real battle was. Not so here. Although it was important for the audience to know that death was violent in a tank, the volume of the gore was unnecessary after a point. Too much. <br/><br/>I think the movie is a great tribute to those who drove tanks in WWII and for sure if you are a tank aficionado, this movie is worth seeing. However, the story line may bore you at times and you may find yourself wishing that there was more tank action instead. I think this film is worth some nominations for it's cinematography and honorable mention for Brad Pitt but in no way is this an epic war movie that one would run out to buy the DVD for to watch over and over again."
"khiemhtd","5","7","18","18 October 2014"," War is in reality much uglier
","While I think the movie does portray war a little more accurately than most war movies, it's still very conservative in terms of showing the real horrors of war, which is really what I was hoping for. Also, I know it's an American movie but I wish someone had to balls to really show that war is ugly on both sides and not just the enemy.<br/><br/>Examples: Women was portrayed as wanting to have sex with the American soldiers, which never happens, usually rape is what happens. There was in fact rape portrayed but it was almost converted into a love story. In reality, nearly any women that is on the enemy side is usually raped and then thrown aside or killed. Heck soldiers even rape when they're our 'allies' (read up on American military in Okinawa)<br/><br/>There were civilians killed even children and old people but some mostly made it look like Germany is the only one who would do it.<br/><br/>Despite all this I still appreciated the movie for taking movies one step closer to the real reality of war and all of the evil that comes out. As someone who dislikes war movies, this one was pretty decent. Although this movie still portrays these soldiers as heroes (the last scene was a little bit ridiculous) and that always bothers me. Case in point, there was a little kid behind me who kept saying ""they deserved it""."

I'll leave that for others. But Fury, as far as I'm concerned, had it all; a great story, totally believable characters, awesome acting, realistic battle scenes, beautiful photography - all in a film which shows both the horrors of war, as well as the heroism it often reveals.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant film. I wouldn't change a single frame."
"aljaz_raz-14","10","6","15","5 February 2015"," This show how war looks
","I believe, that the story of movie Fury is a little inflated, but it shows how world war looks like. In my opinion, this movie had no happy ending, at first it was cruel that girl Emma dies, but it show how much pain was inflicted in world war. It's good that they are making real story movie, because we must never forget the sacrifice of our ancestors. But that that four tanks couldn't destroy one German tank was a bit strange. And at the end I wonder were that sniper came from. They were doing it were good but when he shoot Bible, everything was lost. But the most disturbing was that everybody died except Norman. This is drama movie so he should die with them.<br/><br/>About Brad Pitt, I believe that there is no better actor for that type of movies. He is a great actor for drama movies, or a very cruel movies like this one and Inglorious Bastards, Legends of the Fall. I believe that when he acts in his movies nobody could act better than him.<br/><br/>This movie I recommend anybody who like drama or war movies."

","This movie made me say wow. It was such a long time for me to find a movie with a great story and specially vote the movie higher than seven. I have been waiting for this movie since the news talked about it, the story of people who lives in the tank and day in and day out spending time together going from one point to another is just something that we are not seeing in most of movies. It's defiantly has became one of my favourite movies about war, Brad Pitt speaking in German was nice, in most of movies there is always a man who is a translator which makes movies look bad, but i know there are a lot of people out there looking up to Brad Pitt as a role model in their career or they might be a huge fan of his works, it may gives them the idea to go and learn some languages cause that is what the world needs most. Overall i believe this movie is gonna stand in top 20's of all time because of great story line, camera position and sound. it was so obvious that it's not one of those movies who just get famous and forgotten. This one will win bunch of awards for sound, music, camera and a lot of thing and it will be remember."

There's more than enough movies that make this point while still managing to possess some element of entertainment value. <br/><br/>I get what they were trying to accomplish with the guys recalling their past acts of war....but it just didn't really fit into the scene to justify the argument that they shouldn't be playing house. The delivery just fell short and it didn't really connect.<br/><br/>It would have made more sense to use that scene to portray these pawns of war trying desperately to find some sort of normalcy if even for a brief few minutes. <br/><br/>The missions were random, the battles random, the entire movie was just pointlessly random. Very little character development, no real underlying story, just a random tank crew showing you how bad war is and really failing to be as hard and as cold as it was intended to be."
"chisoxrock1344","7","6","15","17 October 2014"," Ayer's good mix was not quite enough
","When I first heard that David Ayer was creating a war film, I was thrilled. I knew he would have that good mix of intimate dialog and intense action that helps audiences fall in love with his characters. This mix was especially prominent in Ayer's End of Watch. <br/><br/>I felt Fury barely scratched the surface with these components, leaving me unsatisfied and dry-eyed. In Ayer's defense, this could have been the lack of chemistry or stigma amongst the actors. Shia LaBeouf, for example, has been an absolute douche bag off screen, making it hard to sympathize with his character. And then there's Logan Lerman. That boy should be nowhere near a war film. I get why he was casted, though, for he fit well into his role as Charlie in Perks Of Being A Wallflower. In this film, he played an innocent, passive teenager. And these same qualities were spotted in his role as Norman. But then there was a random point in the film where he was no longer that innocent boy and starts gunning people down like he's Scarface. C'mon. I get that war can turn a boy into a man, which was probably the symbol of Lerman's character, but it just wasn't believable.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I didn't feel much of a sense of ""brotherhood"" from Fury. At least not nearly as much as I felt during End of Watch, which was, in my opinion, what made that film so great."

","This film only serves to make Brad Pitt seems really bad-ass and as a cheap excuse to shoot up a million Germans (maybe less, maybe more, didn't count). While Inglourious Bastards was meant to be fictional, funny and provocative it was still more realistic and convincing than this piece that actually portrays as a historic-isch movie.<br/><br/>The characters are flimsy, non coherent and self contradictory. Norman hates killing but than suddenly likes it. Don does everything to keep his crew alive through Africa, D-Day and countless other battles but than for no obvious reason sacrifices his crew to the cause when their tank breaks down. The remaining characters are a religious guy, a Mexican and an asshole. Their only role seems to be to make the main characters Don and Norman look good.<br/><br/>As for realism, there's non. Sure you see bodyparts being ripped of and explosions but that has already been done better and more in Saving Private Ryan. Sore for eyes are the coincidences (Don and Norman leave building - building blows up with Normans short lived love-affair landing on-top of the rubble, how convenient) and the fact that the 300+ SS soldiers go running up and down in the firing line when confronted with a broken down tank. Just why would an elite troop of experienced soldiers do such a ridiculous thing? If you like tanks and explosions this film has something to offer. If you're looking for a story or realism than please skip this one."

","This movie failed on so many levels, I cannot fathom how the public has rated it so highly here. I like the majority of the actors, I enjoy a good war movie, but a bad film is a bad film. It has a storyline which leaves the viewer with no emotional connection to the main characters, battles which have WWII tanks shooting off what look like Star Wars laser shots-aesthetically out of tune with the ""gritty"" look the film appeared to be going for-, and confusing scenes of dialog which contradict the relationship between the characters. Beyond that, the ludicrous final stand-off when a good leader (which throughout the entire film they purported him to be) would have taken his men to safety -was simply too much. Then when you just couldn't imagine something topping that poor story-telling, two grenades are tossed into the tank at the end with an exaggerated delay time-convenient for the last survivor to escape- only to have him go back into the tank the next morning and find that the corpses inside the tank are completely intact-no lingering smoke or smoldering items, not a hair out of place regardless of being at point-blank range INSIDE a tank. Two, not one, grenades. Really?"
"Wuchakk","8","5","12","14 December 2014"," WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew
","RELEASED IN 2014, ""Fury"" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. <br/><br/>Writer/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent ""Training Day."" In ""Fury"" he successfully shows the soldiers' view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) perhaps comes closest.<br/><br/>I mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) or ""Man of Steel""(2013)? ""Fury"" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Peña). <br/><br/>'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.<br/><br/>Beyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day ""Fury"" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968), ""Enemy at the Gates"" (2001), ""The Eagle has Landed"" (1976), ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957), ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998), and ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); ""Fury"" is leagues better IMHO. <br/><br/>The melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of ""Fury,"" but I get the point of that sequence.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","5","12","28 November 2014"," Almost unbearable, for all the right reasons
","April, 1945. The war is ending. Deep in enemy territory, our five protagonists command a tank, including a rookie who has to be quickly broken early on, because it's the only way he can be of any use to them. A Sherman, widely regarded as the weakest type for the time, extremely vulnerable not only to enemy equivalents, but also infantry-held Panzerfaust. This bears similarities to Das Boot – narrow focus on the claustrophobic, heavy death-trap, with us trapped in an oppressive atmosphere, seeing the ugliness and the filth. We don't get a plot, in spite of a series of events presented in chronological order, we're seeing men carrying out their duty, and we, like they, get to know this small group, with the macho culture, black comedy and tight bond they form in this awful situation. And if we didn't have that, this would be unwatchable – it's simply too nasty.<br/><br/>David Ayer directs his first period piece here, bringing his inside understanding of L.A. gangs, especially the interpersonal relationships and fatalism, his unflinching determination to show every miserable aspect, to this, and makes it look effortless. I hope this is the first of many times he plays around with his honed formula – End of Watch gave us a POV take on it, and this shares its intensity and immersiveness. Every second of this, you can smell the filth. There are occasional brief glimpses of something outside of the soul-crushing reality of their daily life. These never truly feel like anything other than escapist fantasy, and soon enough, we, and they, wake up. The action scenes aren't entertaining, they are just the release of the anxious undercurrent. You feel awful for the relief when a German dies, in spite of it being an actual ""us or them"", of hesitation meaning one's own death. The ending does lose us.<br/><br/>There is constant violent, bloody, gory and disturbing content and strong language, as well as some hinted at sexuality in this. I recommend this to anyone who genuinely thinks they can tolerate it... it will make you think twice about war. 9/10"

","I have served my time as an Armour commander. This movie plays to all the war stereotypes because that is what happens in war. A tank crew is closer then family and that bond is clearly examined in this film. The movie serves as a great reminder of the cost of war and what it can do to an individual. If you have served your country holding arms, then you will relate to this film. Officer-specialist relationships and commander-men relationships are genuinely portrayed. The times where the tank specialist gave face to a young LT or the times when Don (Brad Pitt) had to hide his fear/sadness from his men till the end is what every commander experiences. Not wanting those who follow you to see your weakness even though you feel like screaming and crying inside. Not giving up your mission no matter what the cost. I don't believe that every man in that position would have chosen to fight but this movie is a a good maybe exaggerated depiction of what might have happened if you did. To those whose only knowledge of warfare and the army is from movies then this will just be another war movie with nothing special.

It's in these difficult conditions that the young Norman (Logan Lerman) is going to join the Wardaddy's team (Brad Pitt) to do dangerous and delicate missions. The danger is clearly illustrated on the screen, whether by violent deaths or wild assaults. The idea is not to shock but rather to make feel the terrible soldier's daily life. The director (also scriptwriter), the clever David Ayer, propose an extremely realistic vision of the war and I appreciate it a lot. GI are not represented like usual American heroes indeed they don't have patriotic speeches. On the contrary, they are depicted as men who are destroyed by the war, and we can immediately understand that the ideals haven't their places on the battlefield. We discover this atmosphere through the point of view of the rookie and his mood and his state of mind contrast a lot with his new brother's in arms' one. And that was a brilliant idea from the director to insert Norman in this rough atmosphere because he represents the link between the spectator and the tank's squad. The director reminded us too, that Hero is not a natural status. You are not born as a hero, you have to change your destiny and to prove you are one. Too often in war movies, the battle scenes and the soldiers' behavior are caricatured. But the History was also made of humiliation, poverty, violence, and liberation. It's important to remember it, even in Hollywood. To conclude, Fury thus stands out as a powerful, explosive and extremely realistic war movie. Taken by an imperial casting to the beginning from the end, the movie captivates spectators during two hours and, in spite of a classic story, offers several impressive sequences.

Brad Pitt is in great form as Wardaddy and if it wasn't for him I would be giving this a lower rating, I felt the other four men overacted, but Pitt was real, I felt for this character and believed he was a real person, when an actor can do that you know they're doing a good job.

The violence is certainly not over the top nor does it have graphic violence for the sake of it. It is real and it shows the viewer that war is hell, and in no way should the makers of the movie apologise or have to justify themselves for exhibiting such graphic violence. Fury may not be right up there with such classic war movies as Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now or Platoon, but its still an entertaining and enjoyable war movie.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is the hardened and battle weary tank commander Sgt Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier who has been responsible for leading his tank affectionately named Fury as well as his crew through many campaigns in World War II.

The crew at first treat Norman with disdain and contempt , but once Norman is able to overcome his fears and proves himself in battle, the men start to treat him like one of their own.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt shows that age 50, age will not weary him and he still shows the same clout as a box office draw card that he has always possessed throughout his career. Shia LaBeouf may be regarded as a person who is not quite right away from the cameras, but in Fury all that is put aside as he puts in a very likable performance as ""Bible"". Logan Lerman is a standout as the Army Clerk inexperienced on the battlefield but gradually becomes hardened by the horrors of war and shows that he has an intense hatred for the enemy. Michael Pena is always a likable actor no matter what movie he is in. Jon Bernthal of The Walking Dead fame came across as very unlikeable and volatile, but after a while he shows that he is a human being who has almost lost his humanity through the horrors of the war.<br/><br/>Director David Ayer (Street Kings, End of Watch) does a great job bringing Fury to life with Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast as well as the story that has you hooked from start to finish. David Ayer also hammers home the message that war is hell and affects everybody on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Although Fury does not reach the same groundbreaking cinematic heights as other classic war movies, nonetheless it is still an entertaining movie that is highly recommended.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ellishin73","9","4","9","10 December 2014"," Fury concerns a tank crew at the closing stages of World War II.
","""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent,"" quotes Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier in the second act of director David Ayer's war epic Fury. The film takes place in the closing stages of World War Two. Brad Pitt plays the protagonist ""Wardaddy"": the leader of the crew tank nicknamed ""Fury."" Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson franchise, Perks of Being a Wallflower) plays Pvt. Norman Ellison, a new recruit. The strongest part of the film is acting. Brad Pitt expectedly gives a commanding performance as the draconian and seemingly unscrupulous sergeant ""Wardaddy."" His character provides an interesting contrast between that of Lt. Aldo Raine, another character that Pitt played in Inglourious Basterds, another WWII movie. Wardaddy sees killing as a necessary evil for survival, while Raine outright glorifies the act. However Logan Lerman shines as replacement crewmember Ellison. His powerful performance provides yet another important contrast between his character and that of Wardaddy's. He lets his moral conscience control his actions, while Wardaddy emphasizes the absence of one. The charisma of Lerman helps amplify that contrast. However, the biggest surprise to me was the performance of Shia LaBeouf as the crew's religious gunner Boyd ""Bible"" Swan. I was initially skeptical of him because of his mediocre work in the Transformers movies. However, in Fury, he shows some range, especially in his constant recitations of Bible verses and his interactions with Wardaddy. Supporting players Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña also add weight to the film's acting component. The plot itself is rather trite as it is the usual 'men on a mission' stylized narrative. The events that take place in the film are also quite predictable. Though it brings nothing new to the table, director David Ayer compensates for this by his proficient filming of the many battle scenes of this film. His eye for the visceral and grit makes them all the more excruciating. However, the quality that I most admire about the film is that it brings up the issue of taking another one's life for the first time and its psychological repercussions upon the individual who commits the act. I also like the scenes that are rather tranquil, especially those in the second act where the crewmembers interact with each other and some German citizens; because they, along with the heavy-handed messages about killing, add to the film some much needed humanism. They make Fury more than a simple gore-fest. I concur that Fury is a well-directed and acted film, even though it suffers a bit from predictability. The movie is not for the faint- of-heart, as it is extremely violent (it is a war film). If the viewer is looking solely for originality in Fury, he/she should expect to be generally chagrined by the film. However, I highly recommend it to those who appreciate acting and/or battle sequences more than story. I can see potential Oscar nominations for Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman for their performances and even one for Shia LaBeouf. I expect Fury to be one of the ten nominees for best picture this year."

","This is a hard core war movie. This movie is rough as a cold steel piece of war machinery.<br/><br/>We follow the travels of a tank crew towards the end of the 2nd World War. These are hardened men, a group of pit-bulls with a very thick skin. <br/><br/>We are introduced to the characters through the eyes of a newbie, who is a real innocent lamb when he first joins the team.<br/><br/>Several battle scenes keep the pace up, but the brotherhood confined in the metal death-machine is the real heart of this story. <br/><br/>The characters are beasts, more or less stripped of their humanity, hardened and mentally scarred by years of war. This is really well portrayed and performed, there is a credible organic bond between these men.<br/><br/>The lack of patriotic mumbo jumbo strips down the narrative to one of basic human survival. The Germans are given more human features but are still mostly faceless shadows, almost being demonized as in so many other movies.<br/><br/>There's some beautiful imagery, with a lot of beautiful wide well composed scenes. Hard to believe the director made ""Sabotage"" earlier.<br/><br/>Stephen Price deserves a mention- the soundtrack is impressive.<br/><br/>Is ""Fury"" worth a watch? Yes, if you are an adult that is not bothered by a lot of profanity, blood and graphic gore."

","Director David Ayer's horrific war drama, FURY - starring Brad Pitt as the lead honcho, a tough father figure of a Sherman Tank crew of 5 men, including a virginal, brilliant blue-eyed ""rookie"" as the gunner (Logan Lerman), a boy/man whose unshaven cheeks are as supple as his belief in the ""goodness"" of his fellow human beings, even in the most grisly of circumstances. His transformation into steeled ""manhood"" is a painful reality to observe. <br/><br/>Like the Battle of Thermopylae the odds are stacked against this team of hardened, profane, American warriors fighting the Nazis on German soil in April 1945 - a last ditch violent effort by the Axis to prevail, realizing that defeat was fast approaching. The cinematography with its deep, muddy browns and fiery oranges casts a blazing light which permeates into the conscience and hearts of the characters. War is not exonerated or laundered; it is bloody and dirty - one's moral compass is abandoned in the effort to survive slaughter and death, be it by one's own hands or at the hands of others. It is hard to imagine going through this experience and not returning home shell-shocked and psychically wounded.<br/><br/>In the platoon is a soldier who puts his belief in God's will and protection, nicknamed ""Bible"" (Shia La Beouf,) an actor who has never been able to seduce me.until now. In FURY I finally understood La Beouf's appeal, with those dark penetrating eyes and a smile that conveys the Divinity's rapture; he is a symbol of underlying goodness prevailing over his own destructive power and the carnage of the ""enemy."""

","Walking into the cinema There is an understandable excitement about Fury, but the question is will this film go into the 'just another war movie' category or will it show a different side of war? <br/><br/>The opening scene is raw, brutal and shocking and that is an accurate description of rest of Fury. David Ayer's (End of Watch) new film shows the wartime realities from the perspective of soldiers in a tank division during WW2. Fury is the name of their tank and represents their existence. The film is shown in April of 1945, the Allies are making their final push towards Berlin and the end of the war. The Americans ground war is heavily reliant on the armour and fire power of Sherman tanks. From within the armoured exterior of the tanks, Ayer's film provides a wartime view from within the heart of the tank. Showing the war from inside the tank and how the men contend with the fear of the potential coffin the tank can become and the challenges of close quarters of five crew men. The battle- hardened crew is led by army sergeant, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). They have fought together for the many years and have fought the Nazis in Africa and Europe. Their dependence on each other for survival is evident, but the expected tensions of war-time stress and close living conditions leads to a fascinating on-screen chemistry. When one of their crew is killed in action, a new man is given to the close knit crew. Norman (Logan Lerman), a clerk typist, has to learn to drive the tank and is quickly exposed to the brutal nature of war. He learns from Wardaddy and the crew that to survive he has to come to terms with the 'us or them' mentality of combat. They lead the men throughout the countryside and towns of Germany. Finally, they are left with the assignment of securing a crossroads and confronting a final wave of German SS soldiers. The Fury crew find themselves out-numbered, out-gunned and they have to determine if they will make a sacrificial stand for the sake of the platoon.<br/><br/>Ayer has put together a brutal and visceral depiction of war as the backdrop for a story of interconnectedness of men at war. The landscape and battles are well filmed, but do not leave any false pretences of glory. Each battle brings a devastating reality to the war effort and understanding the mindset of the men who have been put into these surreal situations. Seeing the atrocities that mankind can do to one another in loss or victory is sobering and is a stark contrast to many epic war films of the past. There are many effective battle scenes, but the tank battle scene between three Sherman tanks and a German tank is one of the best choreographed battles in modern film. The realistic style of filming may cause some to avert their eyes, but for those who can stomach the visual display will have a better understanding for the attitudes and demeanour of the men in the tank. David Ayer manages to write a film about men who can love one another as men and not feel the need to incorporate any unnecessary sexual undertones. The relationship between the battle hardened David and Jonathan from the Bible came to mind in watching this film. Brad Pitt delivers a stellar performance as Wardaddy and is at his stoic best. He shows the strength needed for an effective leader, but through the many layers of a battle hardened soul he is able to convey a vulnerability and love for his men. He is surrounded by a crew of men who form an effective, but flawed symbiotic unit. Shia LaBeouf has been given one of the best roles of his career and he takes it on with unapologetic fervour. Boyd 'Bible' Swan is the heart and conscience of the tank crew and could have easily become a clique as he quotes Bible passages, but this is not the case with this character. Swan is willing to get into the fight alongside his crewmen, as well as, hold his own in the verbal battles with anyone willing to listen to him. He is loved by his crew and is never trivialised because of his beliefs. The final interchange of Bible quotes between LaBeouf and Pitt is a refreshing dialogue between men and shows a depth of friendship and respect. Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal round out the cast as journeymen who add the needed comic relief and relationship bonding for this type of film. The surprise of the film was Logan Lerman's performance. Coming off his performance in Noah, Lerman is has shifted from teenage actor to adult contender and is proving to be a mature actor that will be worth watching. Throughout the film, Norman quickly grows from innocence to maturity and Lerman effectively conveys this critical transformation. This war time film is truly a character play that develops some great roles in today's cinema.<br/><br/>Fury does not pull any punches when it comes to depicting the the realities of war. The violence, the language and conversations of men who have been through so much together garners a warning for discernment. This is not a film for young audiences or for those with a weaker constitution. But unlike most Quentin Tarantino films, Fury does not push the violence to excess. The brutality seems to convey an honest depiction of war and shows the value of masculine camaraderie. David Ayer has put together a great war film that does not glorify war, but shows how something glorious besides battle victory can come from it. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is the God of the Bible a God of justice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:19) 2. What is the view of war in the Bible? (Ecclesiastes 3:8)<br/><br/>Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews"
"Laakbaar","9","4","9","1 November 2014"," Blood, sweat and tears
","This is somewhat of an overwhelming movie. It shows the last ""total war"" at its most desperate. We see -- no, we smell – the excitement and the horrors experienced by a single tank crew. <br/><br/>This movie jolts you into realizing that much of what we've seen on the screen over the last 70 years about this war has become cliché. Most of those who lived through the war are dead and we can now dare to imagine what it really must have been like and tell stories that we didn't dare tell before. These men were both heroes and ""inglorious basterds"". Surely that's the way it was. The movie clichés are trotted out and then dealt with brutally.<br/><br/>A cinematic decision was made to show everything. In modern times, we need to see this to understand what total war is like. These are the things your granddad and dad refused to talk about. But if you're squeamish, be warned. Further, this movie provoked a huge emotional response in me. Bring a hankie. Yes, sweat, blood and tears -- this movie is an experience.<br/><br/>I have never seen armoured operations, tank battles and tank activities so well depicted on film, However, the German military seemed strangely ineffective at times. I suppose this was to give the film dramatic tension and showcase our heroes. It felt artificial. <br/><br/>Pitt and Lerman are very good, but it was Shia LaBoeuf who really shone. What a fine actor. This was a larger than life tank crew (something unavoidable when Pitt and LaBoeuf are in your tank). It bothered me a little that this crew was so ragtag and maverick. Hollywood loves this kind of thing, but it is not realistic. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes involving the interaction between the sergeant and the newbie also seemed unrealistic. But the decision to tell this story more or less through the eyes of Lerman's character was brilliant. Sensitive, intelligent, conscientious, not combat trained, lacking acculturation to military life and battle, his main asset is the ability to type 60 words a minute. Now if this doesn't speak directly to the hipster-reddit-twitter generation, nothing does. Norman Ellison is a young man from the 2010s, not the 1940s. It worked very effectively. <br/><br/>I'm glad they referenced the Falaise Gap. Now THAT might be a movie<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","First let me give you a tip before watching Fury: take it easy with the food. I love food and I eat a lot of it, but during this movie I haven't touched a piece of popcorn. Why? Because this movie is awesome. If I wasn't nauseous because of the details you see during the movie, I was sitting on my neighbours' lap with a very high blood pressure and my hands before my eyes.<br/><br/>There was just no moment of rest in this movie. Some movies can't pull this off and I get annoyed, but during Fury I couldn't get enough. The two hours this movie lasted, were the most intense hours I've had in the last couple of weeks, or months. And talking about that, I think 'intense' is a perfect word for this movie. I am not the most emotional woman there is, but to be honest I've felt a lot watching Fury.<br/><br/>When I saw that Logan Lerman played one of the big parts I was a bit sceptic. One of my all-time favourite movies (and books) is 'Perks of Being a Wallflower' in which Logan has played a perfect part. I thought seeing him in a war movie couldn't stop me from thinking about the Perks. I guess he has a lot of talent: he made me believe he was a whole other person.<br/><br/>And of course there is Brad Pitt. Everybody knows him, and I think also everybody likes him in a different way because every kind of character you can imagine, he has played it. In Fury, he actually played two parts: the killer and the sensitive guy. He is playing his parts very well. And quickly talking about Shia LaBeouf, I hope there wasn't real alcohol in the bottles since he is having some trouble with it, so I've read. Besides that, he –and the rest of the cast- has really entertained me.<br/><br/>For the content of the movie, I haven't got a lot to say besides that everybody must watch it. I don't like bloody movies where you can see every detail how someone is killed. But in Fury, these details weren't for entertainment. What you see is just the reality of war: it is not nice. So what makes this war movie different from other movies with the same subject, is that I felt this was reality. This wasn't just a movie about some guys in a tank killing people. This is a movie about the difficulty of shooting someone. It is about the transformation people have during war.<br/><br/>Of course there are some American, exaggerated characteristics, especially at the end of the movie. Fury, however, is so intense that I don't even notice it. And I even if I do, I don't mind."
"deeba-s","8","4","9","29 October 2014"," Great work!
","I took a couple of days to think over the movie, and I think that changed my opinion quite a bit. Let me start off by saying that most movies start at the beginning of a story, but Fury is a war film that chooses to kick off at the tail-end of one, when the stakes are high and the soldiers are broken. Proceedings commence in early 1945, with the conclusion of WWII fast approaching. But the American tank units on the ground don't know that, having suffered staggering losses to the superiority of German armor and fire-power. This movie had a strong start, it really showed how depressing and horrible the sight of War is. There were definitely cons throughout the movie, for example, what really was a waste of time and what seemed to be a 30 minute long scene, was during the middle of the movie, when Brad and Logan enter the soon to be collapsing building, they begin with hostile intentions, but soon settle down with the 2 woman in the room. It was WAY over-timed. It felt like the director couldn't think of any ideas to continue the scene, so he just decided to make it last a long time. The movie started to make you hate all the characters but Logan, which partially ruined it for me. Aside from that, the movie was great and enjoyable, it kept you on the edge of your seat. Effects were very well done, except the fact that the bullet rays were Green and Red. (Star Wars Much).. The ending was very depressing, but thats what made it that much better. I didn't expect all but one soldier to die in that Tank. :( The casting was spot on! I couldn't think of any other actors to take the rolls of these characters. Overall, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch, I would go view it a second time if I got the chance!<br/><br/>-Deeba"
"wrathman-145-266037","7","4","9","28 October 2014"," Fury
","If you're looking for a movie that gives you another reason to love America then Fury is the movie for you. Brad Pitt stars as the leader of a five-man crew traveling behind enemy lines in a Sherman tank. As they travel they encounter many exciting and action pack battles filled with gunfire and explosions. The film takes place in 1945 when a young soldier; Norman Ellison played by Logan Lerman, joins a highly skilled platoon. As they go on their journey, he has to battle his way through Germany and he has to show he is a valuable soldier to his comrades. Jon Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña all play the other American soldiers in the tank. The main focus of the film shows almost a father/son dynamic between Lerman and Pitt. Lerman is very emotional, and acts like a normal human being would act if they were thrown into a tank mid war and expected to kill people. Pitt helps him through all the difficult situations that they are put in. The film uses great use of lighting especially in scenes when they are in the tank. The use of key lighting to illuminate the faces of the five soldiers helps the audience see how the characters are reacting to what's happening. The extreme close-ups on the soldiers faces also help with showing the emotion of the characters. The film uses a lot of crosscutting to show what's happening in the tank as well as what actions are taking place outside on the battlefield. This film all together is one of the better war films made in the past five years and with a star- studded cast; it should be. After watching this movie in its entirety I would definitely recommend this film if you're looking for a movie with a good action packed story. I was surprised on how well Logan Lerman performed in this movie. After seeing him in movies such as ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and ""Noah"" I was surprised to see him in a movie with this much violence. I believe this helps him as an actor, and it helps the film because the audience can see that Leman's character is emotional and more quiet. I don't think that was the intent when they were casting him, but it worked out to their benefit."
"zardoz-13","8","4","9","26 October 2014"," Tanks for the Memories!!!
","War is undeniably hell in writer & director David Ayer's ""Fury,"" a grim but electrifying World War II saga about tanks. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, and Jon Bernthal are thoroughly repellent as the battle-scarred crew of a U.S. Army Sherman M4A3E8 tank that tangles with a monstrous German 131 Tiger tank. For the record, the 33-ton Sherman tank came armed with a 75mm gun, but this was no match for the ferocious 54-ton Tiger tank. German Tigers boasted not only an 88mm gun, but also bore 3.9 inches of armor. Incredibly, Sherman tank shells often bounced off Tigers. Nevertheless, Tigers couldn't match a Sherman's rate of fire. Moreover, Tigers were vulnerable to shots fired at their rear compartments, and they consumed far more fuel than the Shermans. Unlike the Sherman tanks that their colleagues cruise around in, Pitt commands a modified Firefly Sherman tank equipped with a more powerful, 17-pound, super-velocity, anti-tank gun. The rugged combat sequence between three Shermans and a lone Tiger marks the high point of this blistering blood, guts, and testosterone-laced actioneer. <br/><br/>""Fury"" takes place in 1945, after the Allies have crossed the Rhine River into Hitler's Fatherland. Although our heroes belong to the U.S. 2nd Armored division, Ayer provides few details about where the action is actually happening. This may frustrate some armchair World War II scholars who thrive on such minute details. Indeed, nobody drops the names of prominent generals on either side or mentions historic battles. All we know is that our heroes started killing Germans in North Africa, and they have been pursuing them across Northern Europe with a terrible vengeance. Essentially, ""Fury"" is a World War II variation on the mud and blood splattered, World War I classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1930) but told from the perspective of the newest member of a Sherman tank's crew. Typically, most World War II movies pass off Korean War era tanks for Shermans and Tigers, but all the ""Fury"" tanks are authentic. The producers borrowed the last remaining Tiger tank from the Bovington Tank Museum in Dorset, England. <br/><br/>""Fury"" opens with hard-bitten Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt of ""Killing Them Softly"") leaping like a savage Apache warrior onto an unsuspecting Nazi SS Officer on a white horse riding through a battlefield and stabbing him to death. Collier's Mexican-American tank driver, Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña of ""End of Watch""), cranks up their Sherman tank nicknamed 'Fury,' and they trundle off to a nearby Allied supply camp. Collier isn't happy because one of the original members of his five-man crew died in combat. As it turns out, Collier lands the worst of all possible replacements, Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman of ""The Three Musketeers""), a green, wet-behind-the-ears, teenager with neither the appropriate training nor combat experience. Cherub-faced Norman is a clerk typist who can bang out 60 words-a-minute. He knows nothing about tanks and he has never shot anybody. Collier and his unsavory crew terrify and toughen-up poor Norman so he can handle the pressures of combat. Collier forces Norman to shoot an unarmed S.S. soldier in the back. Collier, it seems, hates the S.S. with a virulent passion. The SS constituted the most brutal component of the Third Reich. Murdering civilians and unarmed prisoners-of-war constituted their stock-in-trade. Anyway, a young, inexperienced lieutenant orders Collier and two Sherman tanks to follow him into combat. The officer doesn't last long. An S.S. trooper with an anti-tank missile turns the lieutenant's tank in an inferno, and the lieutenant shoots himself before the flames roast him. Collier receives new orders from Captain Waggoner (Jason Isaacs of ""Windtalkers"") to rescue G.I.s who have been cut off from their unit. No sooner have the Shermans embarked on their mission than Collier spots a Tiger. Our heroes find themselves in a life and death struggle to dodge the Tiger's screaming shells. Gradually, young Norman becomes as psychotic about killing the enemy as his companions. The real trial by combat occurs when the Fury strikes a German land mine and breaks down at a crossroads. Collier refuses to abandon the Fury, even after Norman spots about 300 SS troops marching their way, proudly warbling a Nazi song.<br/><br/>Naturally, comparisons between Brad Pitt's Sergeant Collier in ""Fury"" and his Lieutenant Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" are inevitable. Personally, I deplored ""Inglourious Basterds,"" while at the same time I admired Tarantino's tongue-in-cheek spin on World War II heroics. Like his ridiculously redneck officer in Tarantino's tale, Pitt lives to exterminate Nazis. However, Pitt doesn't try to be funny in ""Fury,"" and he is more convincing, especially during his dour moments when he coerces Norman, the epitome of innocence, to have sex with a German civilian. Unfortunately, writer & director David Ayer doesn't sketch in a backstory to explain Collier's hatred of the enemy. Meantime, Collier's crew looks straight out of a World War II propaganda movie. Hollywood combat movies made during the 1940s emphasized America's melting pot demographics. Collier's driver is an Hispanic-American, while his shell loader, obnoxious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal of ""The Walking Dead""), is a raging Cajun. The gunner of the bunch, Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf of ""Transformers"") is a scripture-spouting, religious fanatic. All of them harass, humiliate and humble Norman until he becomes as cruel as they are. Nevertheless, Ayers spares us of usual banter about the girls back home, mom's apple pies, and favorite baseball teams. The final set-piece at the crossroads looks like a World War II version of the Alamo with our heroes battling the Nazi horde as if they were Audie Murphy. These Nazi warriors are essentially anonymous villains who lack the intelligence to wield their anti-tank missiles with the same accuracy that they did earlier in the film. Despite its lethargic 135 minutes and its bleak but predictable script, ""Fury"" remains tenaciously gripping, perhaps even more so during its quiet moments than its explosive ones."
"phd_travel","7","4","9","23 October 2014"," Entertaining and not that violent
","Put aside preconceptions about this movie and you will be surprised. Firstly it's not that violent by today's standards. No way it's in the 'Saving Private Ryan' category. What was cringe inducing was the romantic interlude in the German town with the two German women that was drawn out and clichéd. The ending went a bit over the top in a fantasy hero ""Lone Survivor' way but it isn't 'Inglorious' crazy just a bit unrealistically brave. The atrocities shown weren't that gory. Just Brad Pitt's character shooting a POW and some Nazis stringing up Germans who won't fight. Don't expect a realistic historically based true story type war movie and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The good points are: gripping tank photography both during the battles and inside the claustrophobic tank. The cast is mostly likable with Michael Pena and a mature looking Shia. Logan Lerman is well cast as the fresh faced idealistic typist plunged into the horrors of the war. In fact the movie is mainly from his POV and he is a sympathetic character. Brad looks older and I couldn't understand too much of his dialog. In fact a big weakness is the dialog which was too thickly accented and almost unintelligible except for the expletives.<br/><br/>Overall this was entertaining (if not realistic) and not excessively violent well photographed war movie with a likable cast."
"wolfghostninja","5","3","6","15 March 2020"," A Brad Pitt film, not a WW2 film.
","WW2 films are expensive and difficult to make. The biggest obstacle to making a WW2 film is how to source original or replica WW2 equipment. Tanks, in particular, can only be rented from the military body they belong to, so in the making of Fury the US Army would have leased out its tanks for filming - but not without censorship - if the Army does not like the script, they will not approve the lease of the equipment. So producers have restrictions on the stories they will be able to tell.<br/><br/>In the case of Fury, although we can marvel at the original Sherman Tanks and uniforms, the script is weak and at times cringeworthy, but worst of all there is a noticable difference in the range of the actors used, with some inhabiting their characters and others who are simply incapable, the introduction of one such character who is poorly cast, ruins the immersion of the film quickly after a stellar action sequence.<br/><br/>It also appears that there was no military advisor on set, with many extras shooting bolt-action rifles from the hip.<br/><br/>The final scene is comically bad."

Of course the Nazis were bad people and led to a lot of suffering but in this movie I had the feeling that actually the American Soldiers especially Brad Pitt who are portrayed as Heroes are the real evil ones. Killing children and prisoners is a war crime and to show it as something neccessary and heroic like Hollywood does is just wrong.<br/><br/>Furthermore the last scene turns the movie into a fantasy film. 5 Soldiers who are almost defeating a whole battallion of SS Soldiers in a broken tank is just a joke.
I know Hollywood likes Superhero movies but they should not claim to make a realistic WW2 Movie then. People might actually watch it and believe this made up hero stories. The Second World War was a terrible time and many million people suffered and lost their lifes. To make such a parody of this horrific war is not appropriate.

Nice touch ! :D - At the beginning, you will see the US tanks advance to a camouflaged German anti tank fortification. Of course, the Germans had not some ordinary PAK, it was the notorious eight eight. Two of them actually. The situation: M4 Shermans advancing open field to a camouflaged position. The 8.8, who have so much penetration on long range, wait for the Sherman's to close in like 300-500 meters. Then, of course, missing or bouncing all their shots. While the Sherman's just shot in some trees and kill. Sure thing.<br/><br/><ul><li>Later on, we get a fight between a Tiger and 4 Shermans. The Tiger is also equipped with the 8.8 anti tank gun. But like total idiots, the Tiger rushes in close range on 4 Shermans. Why not use fog or something, i could believe that 4 Shermans managed to outflank a Tiger and kill him? Totally stupid.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Last battle. A demobilized Sherman is facing 200+ German SS soldiers. SS soldiers, the elite German kinda marines, right? Not some inexperienced Volkssturm stuff with mainly kids in it. And again, the Germans approach the disguised tank without caution. Pitt and his crew wait until the troops are all around the Sherman. Not that it would make any sense to let enemies come so close. Usually, you would have opened fire when they were like 50-100m away in front. Nah, they waited. And the German elite corps just runs like chicken in all directions. OH MY GOD! Not to mention the stupid dialogues like ""hey, this is the best job i ever had"". Which Pitt actually said before this last battle started, and they were going to die. *facepalm* Not to mention all firing stopped, once a crew member of the Sherman tankers died. Like ""hey, the Germans know one of our comrades just died. They are nice lads, so they stop firing so we can bring up stupid dialogues to the audience for our fallen, heroic friend"".</li></ul><br/><br/>If such a movie gets 7.6 stars average, then Hollywood is doing everything right.

For disclaimers isn't better than Saving Private Ryan, but it doesn't try to be , it is a good War world 2 movie and if I should which WW2 film copies, that is Das Boot, but it is more that has similarities with it rather than a rip-off.<br/><br/>To the performances ,amazing, everyone plays great their role and the commitment to the project was apparent. It said that LaBouf to be in his role he didn't was during filming and he stinted show bad that the rest of the actors couldn't be near him for long! OK that is crazy and the guy must have some issues ,but at least he showed acting skills for ones after the Tranformers apart from Lawless. Also it is in my one of the best WW2 movies after the turn of the century (But lest be honest the Pianist (2002) and Der Untergang (2004) are the best!).<br/><br/>In any way you see it is a good War movie with great action, a fine story and characters you care about. It isn't a masterpiece , but at least is really well made and definitely you should watch it if you love WW2 flicks like me."

","I have watched almost every movie about the 2nd WW and I did study history, so much for my part. That said, there were a bunch of brilliant 2nd WW movies in the last two decades, most of which were either German, Japanese or US-American ones: Letters from Iwo Jima, Flag of our Fathers, Band of Brothers, Der Untergang, The Pacific, The Thin Red Line,...You name it! Inglorious Basterds was kind of special and it didn't want to be realistic. But Fury does and this movie has some resemblance to it. Fury is an action movie, which wants to show the darker side of US Troops in Germany. The heroes are anti-heroes, but not quite. Some fighting scenes are well made, but hell - if the Germans were fighting like that in the 2nd WW, they would have been beaten in weeks instead of years. The movie was a butcher fest in the best tradition of Rambo. The story and plot are forgettable to the point that, like other reviewers already pointed out, every stupid cliché about the Germans and their troops was featured. <br/><br/>The movie has good features too. The acting is good, although Pitt is IMHO not the best choice as the platoon commander - he and LaBoeuf were there for promotional reasons. New faces would have helped to de-cliché the celebrities and their roles. The camera work inside the tank, the lighting, the props, lots of great stuff to see. <br/><br/>If You need some patting on the shoulder that You have won the war or some of Your family has been killed by the Germans, sixty years ago, this movie is for You! <br/><br/>For me, it's one huge disappointment, when I see, what could have been manufactured with all those props and actors."

"MattBirk","7","3","6","17 March 2016"," Decent War Movie with Brad Pitt
","David Ayer creates what is probably the best war movie of 2014. Fury is a gritty look at the life of a group of men confined in a single tank and their struggle for survival. Clearly a crazy life and for just about anyone it would be a very difficult life to have, but these few men make it work. Brad Pitt is definitely the highlight of the film, bring not only his men together but the garrison of other tanks during battle. While together in the tank they are a solid, fighting unit worthy of your admiration, but outside the tank 3/5 men are complete fools and it's hard to look past how obnoxious they are. <br/><br/>So we are left with only 2 men, the new member, and Don, but Don shows his true colors when he executes an unarmed man (I completely lost faith in his character after that scene). And then the kid, unfortunately, doesn't receive enough backstory to make him seem like the 'innocence' character they want him to be portrayed as. Also, the movie would have been far more effective if it didn't go all out crazy with its climax, becoming too over the top for its own good. But outside of these flaws, the movie feels authentic and real in a sense and totally shows the horrors of war. But in the end, the movie will probably just be remembered as 'that tank movie with Brad Pitt'."
"Silvermoviewild","8","3","6","13 February 2016"," This is not a real life documentary and it's not trying to be either.
","I have a passion for war movies. If I want to get genuine information about history I would seek it at a library. This movie is great. I liked it and enjoyed the tanks. The accuracy of this movie is not correct but who are we to say that things like this did not happen? It shows the gritty life of war and everything violent that surrounds it. This movie is a journey of emotions. I liked the idea of using real tanks in the film and its not very often we get to see what happens with them. I believe the performances of the actors were very good and cast well. Shia labeouf was very convincing from what he was going through in the movie. Brad Pitt also played his part as well as you would expect. Overall great movie. Don't expect any exact historical events from this movie. To be completely honest, I don't think today's world could handle it."
"Arconada","8","3","6","3 January 2015"," Good movie, but it deserves a better ending
","Fury is a good movie, but not particularly realistic. The experiences of Norman Ellison show very well how the ethics of people degrade in battle. Towards the end realism fades, however. The enemy army unit is loudly singing in a war zone, making it obvious that they will be spotted. Although nearby, it takes ages for the Germans to reach the Americans. A gimmick that seems to be copied from Inglorious Bastards - it worked there, but not here. The Germans carry anti-tank weaponry, but do not use it. Enemy fire sometimes entirely stops because of a dramatic scene taking place in the tank. The enemy behaves like brainless characters in a video game, going back and forth depending on the events taking place. A sniper in camouflage suddenly appears when needed. After the battle, dead Germans are scattered all around, like matches dropped from a box, but for unknown reasons they do not cover the road. If the director would have restricted himself to a small unit of the enemy with only limited weaponry, it would have improved the realism of the final scene. But don't get me wrong, the movie was good. I gave it 8 out of 10 points."

","i have seen pretty much every WWII movie there is, and i must confess, this one truly shocked me. the level of violence portrayed by this movie was beyond anything i have ever seen. it really has got me thinking, was this what really happened or was it an exaggeration of reality to make good action scenes? i obviously knew that WWII wasn't a walk in the park, but, i mean, it's just jaw dropping what happens throughout the movie, the scene where the tank enters a small village, and one of the characters asks a question to an old man walking by and then all of a sudden someone shoots the old man tearing his head right of, was just pure shock to me. on top of this the movie doesn't really have a story line per se, so you just pay full attention to their day to day.

All the acting on this film is brilliant. The director and writer does a great job of what it was like for tankers and the dangers they faced. The score for this film was very haunting which helped the film a lot. This is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and it may actually even been better than it. Logan Lerman gives a haunting performance and I would say it was the performance of the year. Brad Pitt gives s very excellent performance as well.

","What seems like a good cast and excellent cinematography and good directing turns into a laughable mess about 1/2 way through.<br/><br/>First, putting a completely inexperienced pencil pusher into a veteran lead tank company is just stupid. No officer would assign him to that position and no sergeant would accept him because he would have been a liability, which he of course is very quickly.<br/><br/>The amount of screaming and infighting that goes on is not very consistent with the chain of command in WW2, and the crew which is scared of the Sergeant seem to have no issue mouthing off, getting drunk and acting like total fools around him.<br/><br/>The scene where Pitt forces this innocent kid to shoot a German in the back came off as ridiculous. And would probably have ended up in a court martial in real life.<br/><br/>Then the girl the kid just met and fell for is killed just seconds after they leave and he acts like he lost his mother so they of course start beating him again like they do through half the film.<br/><br/>The final battle against what would have been the top trained German SS just looks like a bunch of idiots all racing toward their deaths without a plan when the German captain could have easily called in heavy cannon to take out the non functional sitting duck tank and saved 100's of his men.<br/><br/>Worth a viewing but don't expect much.<br/><br/>Also the intermingling of white and black troops seems unrealistic in WW2 since he black regiments were segregated."
"ramirezsamuel791","10","6","16","2 December 2014"," Awesome War film, almost reminded me of Saving Private Ryan
","I am not very much into WWII films, though I decided to give it a try and I was not disappointed. I walked into this film expecting very little and did not think I was going to be surprised by it. There is action throughout this whole film and there is not one scene where you are not left without saying wow, or on the other hand leaving your heart beating because you don't know whats going to happen next. It truly is an amazing film and it focuses on just five guys and part of their background stories of who they are and who their character is. There is this one scene though that left me wondering why did they have to add that in there, but in some way I think its a crucial part of the film that retains the whole story together, I still don't understand why its there but its there. This scene I am talking about is in the very middle of the film, after they took over a town filled with hidden Natzi soldiers who have surrendered. Brad Pitts character and Logan Lerman's character both enter an abandoned apartment to see if there is anyone hiding that were supposed to come out, and to their surprise they find two German ladies, one is young and the other is either in her 30's or 40's, I don't remember if they were mother and daughter or sisters or just friends but in this particular scene Brad asks the older lady to make him some breakfast in her native tongue, this whole scene ends up in Logan Lerman's Character to have some type of love making duo with the young girl, after all that they end up having breakfast until they are interrupted by the rest of the crew who are obviously drunk... So to what I was trying to say this whole scene was basically somewhat of a crucial part to the film, though i still don't know why it is but I know it to be crucial because in some way it makes sense."
"mainhunter-68567","3","5","13","26 October 2015"," Weak in every aspect.
","As a WWII buff for over 30 Years I add some Historical and Technical discrepancies i saw: Tank scene with the Tiger: 1, I highly doubt, the Sherman crews could realize from where the shots came from, for sure not in the short time showed. These bullets had no tracers and travel faster as sound.<br/><br/>2, The Tiger was one of the few Tanks who could pivot on place. It would be near impossible for the Fury tank to flank it like it did in the Movie. But it did not need it anyway, because the 76mm gun could easily penetrate the Tigers side armor from far away, no need to get at his back.<br/><br/>Also, shooting while driving was not a common tactic. Move, stop, firing.<br/><br/>Attacking the Forrest: 1, Pitt said he heard an 88 because of the sound, but they were Pak 40 instead. Flak 88 were really rare on the battlefield, because they belonged to Air or home defend units and many times you had to ask Hitler himself to free some up for the Wehrmacht. Also, the Germans would never drag a big 88 deep into a Forrest.<br/><br/>2, At these ranges, the Pak (Anti-Tank gun) could'n miss. Also the Film try to suggest the tank crews were able to reload faster as the Pak, but it should be the other way. A Pak crew has far more freedom of movement for reloading and a far better all around situational awareness.<br/><br/>3, Deep in the Forrest dug in and camouflaged you can't see a Pak, maybe the muzzle flashes, but you have to estimate the range. The proper tactic would have been, the tanks sitting far outside and giving support fire and Inf taking out the Pak's, if no Arty and Air was available.<br/><br/>4, I don't know the rules for the US Army, but it was forbidden for Wehrmacht Soldiers to move behind tanks, it's a big bullet magnet. Also, the Germans would add into her defense line some crossfire like positions with overlapping fields of fire. Most likely, after the first ambush, they would have switched positions anyway, because of the deadly US Arty that would have followed.<br/><br/>Last stand: 1, This wasn't a Battalion, more likely a single company(120-250 Men at War times) 2, A German unit would not approach such an area in march formation.<br/><br/>3, To take down a tracked tank you don't need explosives. A bit grease and a crow bar would do it. Blind it and bend the MG barrels. Stuff things into gun barrel.<br/><br/>4, Why would anybody climb on a enemy tank from the front? 5, Like others mentioned here, no one would ever shoot with small arms at a tank, when friendlies are around. Those ricocheting rounds would kill more of your own men as the tank could ever inflict.<br/><br/>6, Soldiers don't take comrades as cover, never! Everyone in the Army knows that a full rifle round can go through 5 guys standing in a line.<br/><br/>7, ""We peel of your skin"" Hello? Who would ever say this? Some swearing I would expect, but this sounds like the creator of this Movie tried to make them look like some NS-Mengele-Konzentration Camp defenders, to make them really bad looking.<br/><br/>Overview: This Film is so full of flaws, it's not even funny. The Myth and stereotyping about elite SS-Units is really annoying. There were only a half dozen real elite Waffen-SS units. The ones who fought in the western Theater were mainly Hitler Youth like the 12. SS Div. or consisted from foreign Volunteers. Most of the Waffen-SS weren't Germans at all. This doesn't mean they were bad, it's only a fact. The real elite units of the 3. Reich were Paratroops, Mountain units, Pioneers and the usual professional soldiers of the Wehrmacht. In the Polish campaign they had to withdraw SS-Units because of overconfidence and heroic actions who lead to high casualty's among them.<br/><br/>For a pure Tank film, you see so little about what makes out tank combat. And there are no informational scenes who shows the audience, without Army background, what really happens, especially on both sides. Best example is the last scene were the German officer rallies his troops only to tell them ""Take them, because it's our Country"". WTF? Even 6. graders would make a plan! Hollywood should stop showing German Soldiers who run around like headless chickens. And always showing crying Soldiers as if dieing would come so unexpected. Your Adrenalin level would skyrocketed after a battle, you then don't cry like a baby.<br/><br/>The dialogs are horrible, sounds like some red neck created that Movie. You really get the feeling, this crew is the dumbest the US-Army could muster. When you see post war interviews with Tank aces how polite and even funny they can be, you wont believe a thing in that movie."

","Well I read some good and bad reviews here and both probably have a point. Okay some scenes might not be realistic enough to make them believable but if I want to see an accurate thing about the war then I just watch a documentary and not an action war movie. Saying that this is a bad movie is ridiculous because all the actors are doing a great job and the way of filming is excellent. The point of the movie is to let you see how ridiculous a war is and how many soldiers die for a cause that is not theirs. Like in any war the real army commanders are not risking their lives and are in fact big cowards. The foot soldiers are the only one that you can call heroes even though killing other people doesn't make you an hero in my eyes. Only saving people can make you an hero. Anyways, I enjoyed the movie and if you like action war movies then you can't go wrong with this one."

Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is a green recruit destine for clerical work when he's push onto Collier to replace his dead assistant driver.<br/><br/>What David Ayer gives is an ugly portrait of war. There is no prettying up these characters or these situations. They are worn down to their animal cores. Some may be displeased at an American soldier killing a prisoner. The most disturbing is the approval of all the soldiers around them. This is not heroic at times putting survival above all else. Yet at other time, it is heroism at its highest. The blood and mud is easy. The acting is the hard part. The four hard worn veterans have the dark animalistic feel. Logan Lerman gets to grow his character. They all get that dirty feel of war. The story is a bit predictable with the third act playing out without much surprise. Nevertheless, it is a compelling watch all the way to the end."

Come on people...<br/><br/>There were lots of great scenes plus its realism & cinematography earns the movie an 8 from me. <br/><br/>Sadly, there are also a number of awkward scenes which could label this flick yet another stereotypical ""American"" hero war movie.<br/><br/>You do know that the Germans were skilled at knocking out tanks?

But I must insist: This Movie is made for the big screen. Also, one may not forget about the significance of the sound in Fury.

"rwatt92","9","4","10","9 December 2014"," Appropriately Brutal WWII Film that Lives up to it's Title.
","In my opinion there really cannot be enough movies made about the Second World War. There are so many different perspectives to capture. Steven Spielberg captured the nightmarish storming of the beaches in D- Day perfectly. Wolfgang Petersen captured the claustrophobia and peril of life in a German U-boat perfectly in ""Das Boot"". In this film director David Ayer captures the horrors of tank warfare.<br/><br/>The movie makes explicitly clear that the US Sherman tanks were no much for the German Tiger tanks. They were much bigger and it would take several Shermans to take one out. Operating in one of these tanks would also mean the possibility of dying in some of the most horrific ways imaginable since it was near impossible to escape. <br/><br/>It is April 1945, a month before the war in Europe was won and at this point the Nazi's were pretty much defeated. However, Hitler obviously didn't realize this and he ordered total warfare which meant that the Allies were fighting kids with weapons that had the potential to end them. The SS would hang kids who wouldn't fight. However the Allies had a duty to storm though the heartland of Germany to put an ending to this war.<br/><br/>It is here were we are introduced to the veteran crew of the tank nicknamed ""Fury"". We have Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier excellently portrayed by Brad Pitt. Imagine his ""Lt. Aldo Raine"" from ""Inglourious Basterds"" with more depth and dimension. The two characters share the same love for killing Nazis, first established in a memorable opening seen where Wardaddy ambushes a Nazi on a horse and stabs him in the eye. However at the same time he is also a loving father figure to the people in his tank and has shown a caring side particularly in a brilliant sequence involving him, another soldier, and two German women in a town which I will not spoil. However that scene provides something special in an otherwise decent WWII film.<br/><br/>The other crew members include ""Bible"" a Christian who lives by the good book played by Shia LeBouef. His presence may be a deterrent for some people but he gives probably the best performance of career. We believe him when he quotes scriptures. Also present are ""Gordo"" a Hispanic who speaks ""Mexican"" and ""Coon-Ass"" a southerner who should have been Section 8 discharged long ago. However the essential character and performance comes from Logan Lerman as Norman. <br/><br/>Norman is a young and innocent typist who has never seen warfare up to this point and we examine his journey as Wardaddy must break him of that innocence. This isn't the most original role in the world. We've seen these character archetype many times before in war movies. However what's interesting is how although he becomes a Nazi-hating killing machine like the rest of his crew, there is still that innocence inside of him. <br/><br/>People have complained of the movie's characters being a too clichéd. However one problem I've always noticed in many war films (especially those with intense combat sequences) is that in the chaos it gets pretty hard to tell who's who. In the confided claustrophobic space of the tank's interior were are able to tell the characters apart and their traits we also feel that we know them as well.<br/><br/>The battle scenes involving the tanks are both spectacular and authentic. Since much of it is shot inside the tank itself, we feel we're fighting along side with them. The director actually managed to get the last surviving Tiger tank involved in the production. There is also an amazing last-stand climax that is a bit clichéd and even a little corny but I could not help but be awe-inspired by it. <br/><br/>As a WWII film goes, this is as gritty and brutal as they come. David Ayer spares us no punches in realistic horrors such as seeing the face of the former tank gunner of the seat or seeing someones head get run over by a tank. All in all this is a worthy installment in it's genre that knows that even when the war is won, some people still have to die."

Brad Pitt in this movie played the broken but still caring Wardaddy, you can see all the pain and stress in his eyes as he has been through wars that will scar a person for life. Logan Lerman did a good job ass well. He was great in this movie better than those Percy Jackson films. But they is this one actor in this movie that I've got to say that this is best performance yet, and that is Shia LaBeouf, yes he may went crazy last year and early this year, but in this movie he did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>The bad things in this movie: The character's in this at times can be likable, but at times they not. Towards the end of the movie I started not to care about them because in other scenes their where acting like bullies and ass-holes, and I know they been through a lot of hard times with war and losing people and stuff, but this is a war drama and when these character's are in danger in the battlefield I want them to die, that's a bad sign When a viewer like me want the main character's to die.<br/><br/>But overall Fury is the most realist, brutal and hard hitting war drama that I've since Saving Private Ryan."

It can be 60 years from now or if that is your destiny it will be today in the chaos of war. If you except that then the fear of dying turns to adrenaline that actually helps you to survive. We could go further with this train of thought and fall back on Gnostic philosophy of existence where we are considered spark of divinity, soul- light that is trapped in this sinful world of matter only to return into the source where our soul comes from. The reason why women in most religious traditions are treated as the negative principal of creation is because your mothers womb is in reality your tomb. The second you are starting your materialistic sinful carnation in the world of matter, in reality it is beginning of your death as your cells are dying on a daily basis and are reborn once again. <br/><br/>Coming back to the review it definitely takes special kind of a man to become a soldier. The horrors of war that most soldiers go through are unimaginable for most people. This is why successful war movies are so scares and majority of time the balance between the drama, character development and the plot needs to be achieved to make sure that the mainstream audience will be able to empathize with the characters and the story. Majority of time in war movies you have a cinema full of male viewers. It rarely happens that the audience is evenly divided between women and men. This is what the presence of Brat Pitt does to the success at the box office. Writer-director David Ayer created truly something very special in his newest WWII drama ""FURY"" which might be early contender to the next year Oscar race for the best movie. <br/><br/>Yes indeed! He is also responsible for writing hit movies like ""Training Day"", ""U-571"", ""The Fast and the Furious"" and directed in the past very solid but far from perfect movies like ""End of Watch"" and ""Harsh Times"". In ""FURY' he accomplishes possibly his best and most technically difficult movie so far mainly with a development of characters where plot became secondary to the realistic depiction of carnage of war. This film offers the viewer a claustrophobic experience of being one of the crew members of US tank under the leadership of Don 'Wardaddy' Collier played valiantly by excellent Brat Pitt.<br/><br/>""April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out-numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.""<br/><br/>The whole movie despite of lacking a clear plot line and in essence is just three battlefield scenes that showcase the deterioration of our characters and their moral values testing them as human beings who try to survive at all cost. The war creates monsters on both sides and is a clear test of who our characters are inside. Are they moral people or just animals that in heat of the battle forget about their humanity and compassion. The acting is superb from all the principles. Brat Pitt delivers one of his better performances as brave tank commander who tries to make sure that his crew will get through the horrors of war in one piece. Shia LaBeouf goes method in his performance and apparently refused to take showers during the full time of filming as well he pulled his lower tooth to get in to character of companioned religious Boyd 'Bible' Swan who becomes the moral barometer of the crew developing almost love like admiration towards his commanding officer. Then Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña offer wonderful rich support to the lead actors with Logan Lerman playing a rookie that joins the crew. In some way we observe the horror of war through his eyes and the director is hinting that in some way Pitt's character sees himself in this young intelligent man that has a compassion towards his enemy. <br/><br/>The battlefield scenes are realistic in it's violence and often leave us speechless feeling like we are in the middle of actual combat. Movies like ""Das Boot"" and ""U-571"" come to mind where the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the metal tin can that stands between them and the enemy enhances the actual cinematic experience. Being 134 minutes long as the audience we are truly engaged into this character driven story that has a potential to not be overlooked in next years Oscar race. Very good film full of wonderful acting performances even if the plot of the story has got something to be desired.<br/><br/>For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"williamtitus0628","9","4","10","24 October 2014"," A War Movie That's Sure to be a Classic
","Fury was a surprising delight. Acting was phenomenal, cast great and dialog very good. So much writing out of Hollywood as of late is just not up to par, but Fury seemed to hit the mark. While character development could have been stronger, the detailed tale just couldn't allow for much more. If there'd had be just a bit more, I'd have given it a ten out of ten. This is one of those movies where you walk out and you were truly moved, shaken and left thinking. Certainly a must see for anyone who is a fan of the genre. Sherman tank crews had a hellish go of it during their run across Europe and Fury does a masterful job of conveying the garish experience of war and the brave men of the era that gave so much. Certainly a motion picture that ranks up there with the best ever made. It will certainly be a movie I'll own when it's released on DVD! Like Band of Brothers on steroids. SEE IT!"
"John K.-2","8","4","10","24 October 2014"," Almost as good as Saving Private Ryan, and bonus marks for character realism.
","Fury is intended as a ""horrors of war"" film in the same way that Saving Private Ryan was, and there are perhaps too many scenes of deeply unpleasant injuries and deaths. However, it has two key strengths. One is the tank battle scenes, which I have not seen done so effectively before. The other is realism; it includes vignettes on the enormous psychological resistance to killing another human being; whether there are atheists in foxholes; and incongruous moments of humanity. <br/><br/>It does include some war film clichés; there's a transformation from ""boy"" into ""soldier man""; the usual ""band of brothers"" stuff; and the Americans are not nice, but the Germans are nastier (though sadly, this reflects the reality of spring 1945 pretty well). There are also a few ""but why didn't they just ..."" moments in the plot. <br/><br/>It won't become that classic that Private Ryan is -- Private Ryan earned that status by being the first ""real war violence"" film and also having a journey as its core plot -- but it's well worth the night out, as long as you have the stomach for the bloody bits."
"jadepietro","8","4","10","19 October 2014"," War is Hell
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Fury is a violent indictment of war and its many casualties. But perhaps, the subtitle should more accurately read: Fury: The Story of a Tank and the Boys who Loved It, since it plays up the band of brothers angle rather vigorously. Or, Fury: The Power and the Gory, since the bloodletting is extremely up close and personal. Either way, the film is a powerful and disturbing drama that evolves into a standard but riveting World War II tale of courage literally under fire. <br/><br/>Anyone who has experienced a war film has seen this misfit group before. The stereotypes run deep here as does the clichés they continually lobbed at each other, like word grenades that blow up in their faces: ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" There's the innocent newbie, Norman (Logan Lerman), the Bible-spouting religious zealot, Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the brutish bully, Grady (Jon Bernthal), the Latino, Gordo (Michael Pena) and their foolhardy and hardened leader, Wardaddy (Brad Pitt). All of these stock characters are assembled in the confines of a claustrophobic tin can nicknamed Fury. Their mission: stand their ground against the Nazis.<br/><br/>For over two hours, the onslaught of Fury is endless, with little character development or back-story to add the slightest bit of enlightenment or empathy. The characters remain under-written facsimiles of the real thing. That said, the ensemble of actors do an exceptional job in trying to flesh out their sketchy characters, especially Shia La Beouf who brings some remarkably subtle acting to his character. However, Pitt's screen persona works against him at the start, seeming too similar to his crazed blood-thirsty character from Inglorious Basterds, a factor that throws the film off kilter at times. But as the film progresses, the actor displays more acting skills, adding a more human side to his tough-as-nails macho man and making his gonzo character more distinctive and believable.<br/><br/>Writer/director David Ayer is quite talented, but he is far more interested in war action and its resulting carnage than the human story of its men. The film may accurately depict the brutality of war and the unquestionable bravery of the soldiers placed in these hellish situations, but the movie-going experience is equally as hellish as the war it depicts. While watching Fury, one can easily get battle fatigue from the warfare overkill. With its gruesome images of bloody flesh, exploding heads, and severed human limbs, Fury is not for the faint- hearted or those with a low tolerance for violence. In fact, Fury is violence personified to the max.<br/><br/>Ayer has made a grim testament to these men. His visuals are impressive and have an overly realistic edginess, aided greatly by the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov and concise editing by Jay Cassidy and Dody Dorn. Many scenes are beautifully composed and the action sequences are taut and intense. Yet the overall effect appears too manipulative and predictable, even if it is emotionally engaging. The extremely well staged battle scenes resonate the necessary visceral impact that other classic war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Bridge Over the River Kwai, and Platoon have delivered in the past. <br/><br/>All in all, Fury is an ugly film, but that statement is meant to be more positive than negative. It unflinchingly shows off the atrocities of war faced by these characters in grisly details. It just doesn't show off its characters with enough details. Still, Fury remains a strong addition to its war genre faction. GRADE: B+<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"rgkarim","8","4","10","18 October 2014"," Furious Gore and Action, but poor in character
","World War II is a time of tragedy, dismay, horror, and for Hollywood an opportunity to make movies. We've seen this historical time period represented in so many ways that you wonder what battle, or aspect we have left to cover. This weekend, the historical archives have been rooted once again, to deliver to us the tales of tank battle warfare. My review is on Fury, the action thriller released this weekend to most major theaters. With all the premovie showings and Hollywood exclusives, I was curious as to what the design team had in store for me. What's my verdict? Sit back, relax, and read my review. <br/><br/>Where to start? I guess on the first big strength of the film, the action. This movie contains a bountiful number of intense battles in the German countryside. These exciting and suspenseful bouts of metal behemoth chaos are filled with enough explosions and special effects to make Michael Bay jealous, though in this case they are actually relevant. Audience members will be brought into the full experience with the incredible editing of the audio effects, as bombs, bullets, and the likes soar through the theater. You might be thinking, big deal I have plenty of movies that give me a similar experience. What's so great about this movie? For this reviewer, most movies don't bring you into the full tank experience. Fury plops us into the mechanisms of tank warfare, showing us the inner workings and the teamwork required to full operate the instrument of death. Each team member, or cast in this case, plays an integral cog in the maintenance of the metal monster, and one gets to feel they are working alongside them the whole time. In addition, the battles have strategy behind them as well, each fight having a different element and target than the last. While the colored bullets of green and red were a bit ridiculous, Star Wars anyone, it didn't take too much away from the thrill that was Fury's action shots. <br/><br/>Action is only one element of the experience though, for it's the motley crew assembled that adds more depth to the movie. Leading the cast is popular heart throb Brad Pitt playing Don the commander at large. Pitt does his role well, the stalwart general who puts up with little crap to the point of being a jerk seems to be a natural part for him to play. Yet, somehow he plays the paternal role to the group and has that softer side that makes him likable. Batting second in command is Shia LaBeouf who finally left the artificially created Autobots to fight a war on his own. LaBeouf surprised me with his performance, a character who was grounded yet not afraid to fight off the enemy. His pipes from Transformers were put to good use in this film, his screams actually relevant to battle instead of calling for Optimus. Such a mature role was a welcome asset to the film, and I look forward to seeing more of these in the future. Logan Lerman has also graduated to a more mature role, and was a good character to play Norman the typist dropped into the horror that is war. Lerman's character makes a lot of transitions through this movie, and the young actor did a nice job portraying the struggles of a rookie in war. While the evolution into a Nazi killing machine was rather sudden, I think Lerman handled the emotions well and kept them in control. As for Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal, they too did a nice job as supporting character, playing the more aggressive and blunt tank soldiers that represent the animals men can become in the heat of battle. Regardless, the chemistry between this team was phenomenal, almost as if they were truly brothers of war and they were a team forged by battle. <br/><br/>As for the problems with the film, they start with the character development. Fury's character development was rather poor at points. Yes, we got to see emotions and outlooks of each member towards the Nazi's, but aside from that the history of the soldiers was left in mystery. Pitt's panic attacks went unexplained, the pictures and backstory's of the other crew, pretty much nonexistent. In truth only Lerman's character had any real development, and that was due to him evolving into a true solider. This ambiguous nature made the characters a little one dimensional for this reviewer, and in truth a little hard to latch onto. In addition to this weakness, the next flaw in the movie is some of the scenes they put into the fray. Fury has a span of almost forty minutes of pure, boring, unnecessary downtime. As my buddy pointed out it was to relieve some tension and give some character development, but it failed for me and left me half asleep at points. Some post editing could, or scene directing I felt is needed to make a more relevant, and quicker, attempt to get some depth to our team. As for the ending, it leaves you a little cheated, proud at what unfolded, but at the same time disappointed by the inconclusive ending. There are a few other things that are a bit picky, but let's wrap this review up shall we?<br/><br/>Fury is a great war story, filled with excitement, emotions, and brotherhood. I warn families to exercise caution with taking their younger family members to this, because it is bloody, filled with vulgar language, and intense. The battles themselves are merit enough to see this one in theaters, but the flaws I mentioned do take a way from the movie itself. It's no Saving Private Ryan, but Fury is a nice change up from the genres that seem to flood the theater. My scores for this film are:<br/><br/>Action/Drama/War: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall 7.5-8.0"
"missybusty","10","5","14","24 October 2014"," This tank runs on star power
","Brad Pitt is the star of this movie & make no mistake about it. He has a good supporting crew (Shia LaBeouf & Logan Lerman) but Mr. Pitt is the man in charge. Even approaching middle age he can still take his shirt off & remain believable. Russell Crowe can't do that any more. As war movies go this is an excellent piece of World War II memorabilia. Things are pretty clear - Americans (with all their flaws) are the good guys & Nazis are the bad guys. Roll camera & roll the tank. The director/ writer avoids most of the clichés but not all. There is the token minority Mexican & the token ""good"" Germans. The battle scenes are well staged. Spoiler alert - every one dies at the end except one. In other words - there will be no sequel to this particular war movie."
"dusan-22","6","6","18","16 January 2015"," Good
","This film contains two faces. One represents good filmmaking and pretty good war drama depicting, some drama realism of the war that we haven't seen in the US movies for a very long time. In that way, this is one of the best war movies that Hollywood has ever produced, from my point of view. The war atmosphere, social profile of the soldiers in the US army and their dialogs are among the best I have ever seen regarding the American movies. We have all been used to watch the American soldiers in the US movies as the charming knights in the shining armour but in this movie it was far from that and much closer to reality. Acting was very good. I also think that the director has seen the Apocalypse Now and the Iron Cross but also Russian 9-th Rota, and utilized everything he liked from them.<br/><br/>However, the other face of this film is an irritating low sense for technical and strategical military reality of WWII:<br/><br/>Battle scenes are more suitable for a fairy tale than for a war movie: Germans in an AT ambush are being ambushed by the four Sherman tanks, kind a ridiculous. Tiger tank which was a heavy tank with a much longer shooting range than the medium Sherman tank was never running towards the incoming tank group but rather shooting from a distance (or retreat if necessary) where the enemy tanks couldn't have reached it which was its main advantage. Its like you're holding a gun and you see four guys with knives running after you and instead of shooting at them while retreating, you start running at them, like – now I'm going to smash your had with this gun! Above all, lets mention that Germans put their best men to be the tiger tank crew so it was almost impossible to destroy that tank from the ground. This is why the US Air force was sent after tigers in most of the cases - US dive bombers dropping huge bombs on the tiger turrets were the only real weapon against these tanks, cause even if you ambushed them with medium tanks, you couldn't approach them as they were always escorted with light or medium tanks.<br/><br/>Killing 300 SS soldiers with a non-mobile Sherman tank is more for some Disney Cartoon (I won't go into the details where SS soldiers are aiming a tank with a panzer-Faust from the 3 meter distance even though that weapon could shoot from a range from 30 to 150 meters. It's like you approach to 30 feet range to shoot an enemy with a sniper rifle . And one Molotov cocktail ends the tank that can't move in a jiffy.<br/><br/>Also, a tank lieutenant that is jumping on a highly decorated SS officer on a horse and killing him without problem is more suitable for some John Wayne movie and has nothing to do with WWII reality. <br/><br/>There is an idea that the group is experienced Africa corp unit but you got to now then that they were fighting the more experienced and incomparably more trained, armed and successful German troops here. Also, few scenes where Germans beg for life which is more than ridiculous cause Germans were fanatics and such thing didn't happen with their POW. Don't forget, Germany was fighting USSR and the US at the same time and still was so hard to break their spine."
"jwsanfrancisco","10","6","18","17 October 2014"," movie just about puts all of its million dollar budget on the screen
","submitted 10/17/2013...with the possible exception of ""metro Manila""(done on a shoestring budget), this is the most suspenseful movie I have seen this year,or possibly the last 10 years,where the act of just 'staying alive', substitutes for an actual plot(?). I would just like to know if my opinion is right, the Tiger tanks depicted in the film(real & replicas used?), would the sheer size & mammoth weight give it more of an advantage in the open(battle scene between TIGER & Pitt's Sherman)?, & more of a disadvantage in close, street-to-street fighting, where Pitt's puny, 75 mm armed SHerman has more maneuverability in blasting away entire buildings in every German village he visit death upon?...That said,I believe the far superior TIGER would have an engine driven turret to compensate for lack of maneuverability in the battle scenes taking place in the small,cramped streets of the towns depicted in the film. Whereas, older German,British, American tanks probably had to make do with manually driven turrets, a distinct disadvantage in close quarters?<br/><br/>All in all, this is the role that Pitt was born to do, SHia la Boef give an honest depiction of a participant in combat battle,following in the footsteps of the day-to-day trials & tribulations of Vic Morrow(60's hit TV series,""COMBAT"")."

"meritcoba","Null","3","7","8 September 2015"," The walking dead.
","Whenever a Tiger I tank and SS troops appear together in a movie you can bet the federal gold reserve on it that this movie is not about historical accuracy. This doesn't mean that Fury has no a sense of historicity, but world war II movies are actually never about world war II but about the spirit of the time they are made in. If you don't believe me, just (re)watch Kelly's Heroes and compare it to Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>The spirit of Fury isn't a pretty one if we are to take our queues from the crew that operate her. During most of the movie they never display any redeeming quality; these are a truly sad crew. We have truly reached the bottom of the well as far as humanity goes. Even Apocalypse Now isn't as gloomy as this one. These are dark times were the best are the worst or the other way around. Well, not as bad as the enemy perhaps, who even hang their fellow country women for refusing to resist the invaders in a time that resistance is futile, but as bad as can be and only marginally so. <br/><br/>The key scene is one where Brad Pitt together with Rookie invade a house where two German women hide out. It is one long protracted threat scene that screams rape with every frame. If you have seen Der Untergang, or have read the Last Battle by Cornelius Ryan, you will be aware of how these women would have felt. It isn't a pretty sight to behold. <br/><br/>Fury has a scary anchor point, which is that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it because you have been told to do it and nothing else matters. It reminds me of a phrase of the game Mafia II: in the war the president pointed the finger at whom to kill, now it is the hand that pays me. This movie is thus about moral bankruptcy. <br/><br/>In a human society there is no place for any of the crewman of Fury with an exception perhaps for the rookie who is the least tainted. Society can not work with the scumbags that war has created, and who have traded in their morals and compassion for the command: go forward and kill. <br/><br/>They are the walking dead. <br/><br/>It just needs a German bullet to remind them that they are."
"smatysia","8","3","7","8 May 2015"," A very intense war movie experience
","While I was certainly aware of it, this film brings home the horrible brutality of tank warfare. The constant expectation of fiery death must make one rather fatalistic. Aside from the modern tendency toward excessive gore, this movie was evocative of war films from the Fifties and Sixties. Pretty decent acting all around, led by the low-key Brad Pitt. A couple of notes on plot holes. By April 1945, the German army was extremely depleted due to the millions of casualties sustained up to that point, doubtless including even Waffen SS units. So the extreme expertise that some have speculated about in previous comments may be exaggerated. However, as has also been noted, no military unit will allow itself to be chewed to pieces by immobile troops in a defensive position that can easily be bypassed. This has been military doctrine since the Hittites. Still a very intense war movie experience."

","I don't normally watch war movies and probably wouldn't have picked this one except it was offered to us by a friend/neighbor who said it was good and should be watched. I'M GLAD I DID. Both my husband and I feel the same way. Most war movies focus on the war and the win/lose of it. This movie focused on 5 men (one of them totally new to the fight) and how it had bonded them, bruised them, damaged them and then brought them to the Almighty Power. That was our take on it. A Tank full of men from varying walks of life with different beliefs; but in the end, in order to find a reason to make 'the last stand' against evil, they all called upon Scripture and Faith for strength."

","I must say this is up there with the best historical film I have watched I recently also watched the imitation game which is good but lags on a bit. Fury however I find very compelling the whole way through I feel mostly gripped by the atmosphere that is created by the Sherman tanks. But one issue is that however good a tiger tank is it would not be able to destroy to Sherman tanks without being destroyed itself.also I found the scene where the tank crew were in the German town in a woman's house very boring. As it was just lacking substance as if it was a time filling piece. I do feel there was some very good acting in this brad Pitt did a very good job of portraying a very passionate and determined soldier. I hope to see more films like this come out."

","Fury is certainly an infuriating film. I think the makers had high hopes that this would be a serious Oscar contender but clichéd characters, ethically suspect scenes and laughable battle sequences very much kibosh it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays a battle hardened tank commander. Logan Lerman is the newbie innocent. However Lerman soon learns to kill as the rest of the weary crew are willing to kill injured German soldiers or soldiers that have surrendered because you know war is hell and all that.<br/><br/>When the soldiers arrive at a village, you fear for the local women from the American soldiers as rape is very much on the agenda. Now I am aware that atrocities were committed by Allied troops as well in World War 2, but 70 years later does the director seriously think I will be cheering for this motley crew!<br/><br/>Director David Ayer as in his previous film, End of Watch wants to bring a video game style in his battle sequences. Tracer fire is made to look like laser fire giving it a Star Wars style sheen. However when the battle tank is disabled and the crew is at the mercy of the SS battalion, they hold out heroically as the Germans walk right in front of the fire and dies instead of thinking it would be better to spread to the sides and attack the tank from behind.<br/><br/>The film comes across as an exploitative cartoon type action film that Sylvester Stallone would had made in his heyday."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this WW2 film being a bit of a history buff but once again Hollywood disappointed with a movie that failed on many levels. Character development was non existent as was any meaningful plot. The special effects were good, but I didn't find myself drawn in by the battles either. With such a thin plot, the writers of Fury made a serious mistake by making the protagonists so unlikable. Really without likable characters and such a simple plot there are not that many reasons to keep watching. It just keeps rolling on like a damaged tank until it finally stops and we can finally stop watching. Non the richer for the experience. A wonderful opportunity to illustrate the deeds of the heroes who defended freedom was wasted here."

","'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.' David Ayer (Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, End of Watch, Harsh Times, S.W.A.T, Sabotage etc) wrote and directed this film that explores aspects of WW II – and all war, in fact. It is intensely brutal, unforgivingly bitter, and graphically assaulting – just like war. It is one of the better film s to capture the way war alters soldiers and the citizens of the country who are not involved. It is painful to watch: it is important to note.<br/><br/>April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew – Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo Garcia (Michael Peña), Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and the very young 8 week in the Army typist Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. There are a few moments when battle is not active that are memorable – the episode where Wardaddy and Norman have lunch and more in the home of two frightened German women, the confrontation of Wardaddy with Norman bringing him into the realm of being a killing soldier, etc – but for the most part the film is constant fighting, grizzly unspeakably horrid, insane, sociopathic but true to war mentality fighting.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent – if only the adopted varying accents would allow us to understand all the lines – and kudos to Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Jason Isaacs, Alicia von Rittberg, Anamaria Marina. The musical score by Steven Price is superb and the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov is incredibly realistic. The film is very long – just like prolonged battles in war – and the end result is a crushing question of why do we continue to participate in such wastes of lives."

","War is hell and we can't imagine the feeling of being in battle. But I believe that Fury does a good job of bringing that complexity of the fog of war onto the big screen. In Fury, Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) does a good job an average soldier rising to the occasion. He is leading a group of men in the finally of the European theatre in 1945. He has a deadly mission behind enemy lines. This cohort is outmanned, outgunned, and out strategized. These boys struggle to make it but know they are fighting for a bigger cause than themselves. The movie takes you to the front line and the complexity of trying to stay alive while there is death all around. More than a war movie, it is one that shares the story of forgotten heros. The men who risked it all for freedom. One heck of a movie. Wilson Trivino"

The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that I wish it was longer, however, it's almost 2 and a half hours long which is long enough.<br/><br/>With that being said, I have to say, each scene that was shot felt just right. Each scene, in my opinion, had meaning and was directed really good. I enjoy long shots in stead of short fast shots. The shots were mostly long and a lot of attention to detail was put into each scene and shot. This is usually where most movies fall short, however, in this movie, you can see they really planned each scene and shot carefully.<br/><br/>I must admit, I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt. The only decent movie he ever played in in my opinion was fight club, so I was a bit sceptical at first. However, this was probably one of his best performances ever. All the characters worked really well together and played their roles really good.<br/><br/>To conclude, the movie left me wanting more and I was satisfied until the very end. It was not a waste of my time and although not as good, I would put it right next to other war themed movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket."

"Jerghal","8","3","7","18 January 2015"," We're the good guys right?
","Fury suffers from one of the problems many American WWII movies have: the Nazi's seem more humane than the liberators. In this film there is actually an act of kindness by an SS soldier and absolutely none by our 'heroes'. The main characters are brutes bent on killing as much German soldiers as they can and OK there are some scenes where they try to expose the duality of war but in general the Yankees come of as self righteous mass murderers. On that level Saving Private Ryan was a lot better. But as you ignore this twisted morality you can say the actors (certainly Brad Pitt) are playing some bad-ass guys. The film isn't wall to wall action, but when there is, it's pretty cool. The surround sound FX are awesome and the visuals are great. For 60m$ this movie looks a lot more expensive. If you like war movies certainly check it out. Personally I liked it but I would put below favorites of mine like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates or Inglorious Bastards."
"jacob-salanta","8","3","7","13 January 2015"," Enjoyable from an action standpoint, but so not historically accurate it hurts
","This movie I did enjoy from AN ACTION STANDPOINT. It kept me entertained with all the exciting commando Uncle Sam's GIs kick the butts of the most experienced and seasoned ground infantry of the war(I am aware of the Volkssturm coming into existence near the end of the war, but there were Waffen-SS soldiers and a freaking Tiger Tank). This Fury tank crew in their tin can Sherman somehow survives two shots from the behemoth monster cannon of the Tiger, while all their comrades get one shot and die like fish in a barrel. That Sherman tank would've been a piece of scrap metal based off where they got hit. This movie is stereotypical Hollywood WWII action. If you want historical accurate re accounts of the war, go read books(because no movie in Hollywood is really all that accurate, maybe Saving Private Ryan is OK). Sure, I still love WWII movies and such, but I always make sure to keep my thinking cap on and separate the historically accurate from the Hollywood. The ending is where the biggest load of BS gets thrown at you featuring the Third Reich's most elite ground infantry, ""The SS Drunkards."" I understand why the movie made it so action packed and so down to the end, but lets be real here, that tank crew was soo screwed I have no idea why the heck they didn't run. Their enemies have like 50 panzerfausts and don't even shoot them. This movie takes WWII and turns it into an American steamroll session."
"stephendaxter","8","3","7","5 January 2015"," A gritty and horrific take on WWII with intense action sequences
","Fury is yet another film that takes place during the events of WWII and follows a group of soldiers in a tank as they take on an onslaught of German soldiers in an intense and horrific take on this time in history. This film stands out well above many of the other WWII films out there because it tries to depict the horrors of WWII on a much smaller scale. Rather than dealing with large groups of soldiers moving forth and battling over weeks or even months, this movie seems more concentrated as it focuses on only a single group of soldiers over the course of a few days. This very clever take on WWII by David Ayer worked really well as you got to really know a lot about the characters and that got you to really care about them whether you love or hate them. The action sequences also were so intense that you just did not want them to end. He captured the tone of WWII and showed it through the scenery and also the attitudes of the characters, just from the way they act and talk you instantly get an idea of the terror they have experienced. <br/><br/>And if it weren't for the performances of the main cast this movie would not have been anywhere near as good as it was. Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, John Bernthal, Logan Lerman, and Michael Pena all equally shine as they provide killer performances as this bunch of soldiers who have to put everything on the line to protect each other and their people. Unfortunately for Brad i don't believe an Oscar nomination is coming his way mainly because as i mentioned everyone was so good in this movie that there was no really stand out role, a very well balanced field of talent. The one thing i wanted more from the film was to maybe see a little of how the war has affected and changed them before the events of this film, we do get some of that from a few characters but seeing a bit of that could have added a little more insight into the motives driving these characters. But in the end Fury is a fantastic film with as very gritty portrayal of WWII and incredibly intense action sequences. - 8.3"
"joetufano882","8","3","7","13 November 2014"," Definitely not Saving Private Ryan, but I'd say it's certainly worth your time
","WWII films have always been a big deal to me since I'm really into the history of WWII particularly in the European front. My favorite on screen portrayals of war are obviously Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, and some other favorites to name a few are Bridge Too Far, Big Red One, Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. With David Ayer behind the camera for this one who made ""End of Watch"" in 2012, Brad Pitt in the lead and newcomer Logan Lerman alongside, I was really looking forward to it especially with the trailers. Having seen it, there are some flaws here and there but there's greatness within.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Wardaddy is excellent at playing an emotionally burnt out soldier who's been through some of the most hellish situations in the war but isn't afraid to show that it does get to him. Logan Lerman once again impresses as Norman Ellison, the young soldier who is thrown into the fight unwillingly and is forced to become a cold blooded killer given that he has a sense of compassion for the Germans. Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal are good in their parts and Shia Labeouf is surprisingly not annoying. A lot of people have complained that the characters were shallow and that we could've had more time devoted to their backgrounds before the war. While I do agree with that to a point, I feel that the scene in the middle section of the film where they're having a meal with Norman and Wardaddy giving us a sense of where they've been during the war and why they have a strong dislike towards the Germans. That scene for me at least gave us a good reason as to why they are the way they are, but the biggest compliment I can give to these actors is that they feel like real people. They don't feel like some Hollywood clichéd Lone Ranger type characters who are perfect. Since I've been in the military for the last two years, even though I have never been deployed or seen combat these guys' camaraderie felt real and natural like some of my friends that I've made since I enlisted and that's something I always look for in a movie like this.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly basic: they're on a mission to secure a crossroad for the Allied forces coming in and fight off the SS who aren't going down without a fight. Like with the characters, lots of people have complained about there not being a complex story, but I didn't have a problem with it personally because not every war film has to be Saving Private Ryan. It's a basic plot indeed, but it's a straightforward plot: secure a crossroads and stop the Germans from taking it back. And that's all you really need I'd say. The tone is also a plus since this feels like David Ayer combined the elements from classic WWII flicks like Big Red One and Dirty Dozen with the grittiness of Saving Private Ryan thrown in the mix. It fits with the mood of the men who've been battling the Nazis for a long time, and with the end of the war in sight (April 1945), you get the feeling that they're ready for the war to be over given that the Germans are throwing everything they've got at the Allies.<br/><br/>And just a warning for anyone who's worried about the violence: it's not overly violent but there are a few scenes where I'd prepare myself because some people might not be able to handle it.<br/><br/>Steven Price's musical score is excellent and thankfully not done in a way where it's eye rolling, specifically the battle scenes. While I can let it slide in other movies, I don't really like it whenever music plays during a battle scene in a war film because a lot of the time it comes off as cheesy and trying to get the audience to applaud, but this score fit because it was intense and nail biting. Especially when Wardaddy and his crew face off against a German Tiger Tank, which is probably the best war tank action sequence I've ever seen. And I'm a about to spoil the ending so skip this sentence if you haven't seen it yet, but since some people have expressed contempt for this part I feel like I have to address it (Norman is the only survivor of the tank crew in the final fight and hides under the Sherman tank while the other Germans search the tank for survivors. A young German soldier looks underneath and spots Norman who quietly begs him not to tell his comrades. After a few seconds of contemplating, the German soldier spares him. Some people find this unrealistic and argue that he would've revealed him on the spot, but to be realistic: not every German soldier was a cold blooded killing Nazi. Even our enemies have feelings and show compassion).<br/><br/>With that being said, there are some flaws: I too would've like a bit more emphasis on the characters/story and the middle act slows down and drags on a bit too long. But overall, I applaud David Ayer for his efforts along with everyone else who worked on this film, and I'm really happy to see a good WWII movie again. I'd say to anyone who's interested: go see it!"
"eatakmakova","8","3","7","12 November 2014"," ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent""
","Finally, I went to see Fury. I can't say I am a big fan of war films. I wanted to watch it just because of Brad Pitt. Just to see how he would deal with not typical for him role. Plus, there are many positive reviews that also influenced on my decision to watch this film. And, I admit that, I was really impressed. It wasn't waste of time.<br/><br/>The movie tells us a war story placed during World War II. Fury is the name of the tank that is the central figure of the whole movie. But the main role is given to Brad Pitt who plays the tank commander Don Collier (also called Wardaddy) and whose mission is to hold crossroads from Nazi soldiers until US reinforcement arrives. He leads his crew with who he has been fighting for a long time: Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), gunner; Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal), loader; and Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Peña), driver. Their original assistant driver/bow gunner was killed in battle and he was replaced by a recently recruited Army typist, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). Norman has never been inside of a tank before, he has never killed people in his life. So, getting to the war was like a nightmare for him. And precisely this ""freshness"" is what makes him another central character in this story.<br/><br/>Norman and Collier are totally opposite characters. Collier is a weathered soldier, who is used to war atrocity in all its aspects. He has no fear nor mercy. He is just like a killing machine. But there are scenes where we can see he is not that tough and fearless. He is a human as well, he has feelings and deep inside he does care about what is going on, he is already tired of this war and it hurts a lot to him to see people dying.<br/><br/>Norman is a newcomer. He is afraid of everything. He can't stand all that blood mixed with mud. He can't kill and he doesn't want to. And all along the movie we see how Collier tries to change Norman, to help him to survive that war. And it's really very interesting to see the development of these two characters.<br/><br/>I should point out the excellent work of all actors. No doubt, Brad Pitt is an amazing actor! I was really impressed by his acting. I remember first time when I felt similar impression was when I watched Fight Club. He is really great! While I was watching the movie, I could feel Pitt's character with all his feelings, emotions and conditions.<br/><br/>And, of course, some words on the whole film-making, how it was shot. Absolutely, Fury is a great director's work! David Ayer, director, managed to transfer that gloomy and terrifying war atmosphere. Bloody action scenes together with the thrilling music makes you feel all that horror reigning on the battle field. I won't tell much about the end because it is very very sad.<br/><br/>In general, the whole movie is very tense and emotional. There are moments when the characters try to make jokes, but it's just because they don't know how to deal with all that pain and tiredness they feel inside. All the battle scenes where people are torn apart and everything is in blood are so horrifying. And due to the excellent acting you feel this atmosphere and you just can't stay indifferent, it's just impossible."
"benoit_03","8","3","7","8 November 2014"," Gritty war-torn realism, on-the-edge-of-your-seat stuff.
","The number of war-era films littering cinemas nowadays is rising. Many have failed to reach the same level of epic proportions as some blockbusters - Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, Schindler's List - and this go at it almost makes it there. Almost.<br/><br/>This story takes place in 1945 Nazi Germany, centred on one tank's crew and their journey securing a path through the battle-torn countryside, village by village. Seeing the peaceful German countryside shattered by war and littered with dead bodies really makes for some hard-hitting viewing, really giving you a real graphic view of how it must have been back then, albeit given a little Hollywood treatment.<br/><br/>All cast in the five-man crew of the Sherman tank 'Fury' gel together brilliantly, with Brad Pitt showing a convincing portrayal as battle-hardened commander Wardaddy. Logan Lerman also stars as young newbie Norman, who provides a little clear conscience amongst the rest of the group. There's a welcome break in action with these two midway through, that shows a lighter side to the characters instead of the sombreness surrounding it. Be on the watch out for Shia LaBeouf, who seems to be constantly teary-eyed.<br/><br/>The battles here are powerful, shocking and thrilling and worryingly authentic. You feel every moment that they are fighting and with the help of great in-tank camera-work, as though you are in there along with them. With a surprisingly good climactic battle that ends the movie on a solemn note, which is happy, or sad, depending on how you perceive it."
"jkbonner1","8","3","7","3 November 2014"," Fury dives straight down into the visceral savagery of war
","It's World War Two and April of 1945. While the Americans, British, and French cross the Rhine and slash their way through into the heart of Germany, the Russian Soviets have smashed through Eastern Germany and are breaching Berlin. Nazi Germany is teetering on its last legs.<br/><br/>As the American Army advances, they encounter brutal resistance every step of the way. They have to work their way from village to village, cleaning out the tattered remnants of the Wehrmacht (the German Army) that now consists chiefly of teens and even children. Villages are left in rubble, both from the retreating Germans and the entering Allied forces. Hitler's fanatical command from the Führerbunker in Berlin is for every German to fight to the last man, woman, child. The Nazi motto emblazoned on signs and banners pushes this message home: Ein Volk Ein Reich Ein Führer. And for any German that dares show signs of weakening, the SS will torture and hang them.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on an Army tank crew that has been together since the Allied invasion of North Africa (1942) and the crew has suffered its first casualty. Their turret gunner. The crew commander, Sergeant Don Collier (Brad Pitt), aka Wardaddy, is a man forged by three years of relentless war. He's kept his crew together and in one piece by adopting one maxim: kill or be killed. He carries it down to every enemy man, woman, and child he encounters, and to him every German is the enemy. Ironically, he speaks fluent German. And he's been killing them since his North African days.<br/><br/>He's been assigned a new turret gunner, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), a raw young recruit trained by the Army to type. ""Sixty words a minute,"" as he claims. Wardaddy knows he has to shape this kid up or things aren't going to work out and he'll be a liability for the crew. The acid test is when Wardaddy grabs a German prisoner caught wearing an American Army trench coat (presumably an infiltrator) and forces Norman to shoot him point blank in the back. Soon Norman is killing Germans and liking it.<br/><br/>The tank squad consisting originally of five tanks with infantry is sent out on several missions, dreading they might run into a Tiger. Their tank is the American Army Sherman, a medium-sized tank but no match for the far better armored German Tiger tank. They liberate a German village and shoot the local SS officer as the one responsible for all the hanging bodies they passed.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding war movie and I've seen quite a few. But it is intense and adrenaline-loaded from its very start to the final end. There is death and dying in almost every scene. But this is war and war is hell. Or as Wardaddy explains to Norman, ""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent."" ""The war will be over soon,"" he says, ""but before it's over, more people will die."" Even the scene when Wardaddy and Norman invade the apartment of a German woman (Anamaria Marinca) and her young cousin, Emma (Alicia von Rittberg), the tension is palpable and hovers in the air like the angel of death. Norman is captivated by the young Emma and soon they're swooning over each other. They enter the bedroom together. The tension escalates when the three other crew members show up, but Wardaddy knows how to handle his crew and keeps things in line. As they've leaving the village, shells shriek down from the sky and blow the building with the German woman and Emma in it to smithereens. Norman rushes over and sees the broken dead body of Emma lying in the rubble. But this is war and war is hell, and more people will die before it's over.<br/><br/>Eventually the tanks (reduced to three) set out to hold a crossroads open. They run into a German Tiger, and only Wardaddy's Sherman tank Fury (crudely painted on its cannon barrel) survives the ordeal, defeating the almost invincible Tiger. Reaching the crossroads, their tank hits a land mine that blows apart one of its treads and ruins a road wheel, rendering it motionless. But they've been ordered to defend the crossroads. A determined infantry battalion of about three hundred seasoned Waffen SS approach, and Wardaddy tells his crew they can leave if they want but he's staying. As he says of his tank, Fury, ""This is my home."" Out of sheer loyalty to their warchief they all stay. One crew member survives the carnage.<br/><br/>The action is realistic to a tee. The acting is good although I found Pitt a bit wooden in a few places. I loved the music. The score was very good but enhanced the movie and did not interfere. I thought the flash photos at the very end were great. <br/><br/>But we learn scarcely nothing about any of the crew members. It's like they had no life before the war. Except for Norman, all the men seem in their thirties, but there's no mention of wives, girl friends, children, what they did before the war. All we really know even of Wardaddy is he speaks fluent German and knows his Bible well as he recites a line from Isaiah before he dies. Their sole existence seems to be entirely consumed as crew members of a tank in wartime and their private lives are a total blank, which I found very strange. For this reason I give it only 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>World War Two ended Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. But it did not end war. Is war endemic to the human species? After five millennia of civilization, one might hope that humans could find a more equitable and rational way to settle their differences. But as Wardaddy said, ""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent."" If violence is built into human nature, we'd better find a better way to channel it."
"jacob-m-ford97","8","3","7","26 October 2014"," Epic scenes and unrealistic story.
","About a week ago, I hate when this happens, but I had a strange urge to watch a war movie. So I hopped on the internet and tried to find what I could watch for free. ""Apocalypse Now"" was the only critically acclaimed one I could find, so I decided to spend my evening with Martin Sheen. When it finished, I felt awful. I felt like I was a terrible person, which is what Coppola was going for, but it wasn't exactly what I had planned to conclude my otherwise delightful day. In a way, ""Fury"" was the same type of war movie. It wasn't trying to tell a great story or show you good and heroic people, it was detailing the horrors and atrocities that make human war.<br/><br/>""Fury"" is a film about World War II that shows us a new take on the terrible fighting that went on: the life of the men inside the tanks. Following a young man named Norman who is forced to become a member of the already close crew that makes Fury after one of the members is killed, we see this side through the slowly adapting virgin eyes of war. There are some awful things that happen, and through Norman's eyes, we witness them firsthand.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is the big name advertised in this film, making up one of five primary characters in the film. His performance was one of my favorites, with just the right voice, look, and demeanor to play the role he intended. Logan Lerman played our eyes in the movie, doing a fine job of giving enough character while still making himself relatable to all viewers. Michael Pena and John Bernthal also played crew members of the destructive tank Fury, each taking on roles of the two different soldier stereotypes. Shia LaBeouf, an actor who I don't particularly have much favor for, got into this role like I've never seen him do. His commitment to the part really showed, giving us by far the deepest character in the movie, which is impressive considering he had little script to back him up. <br/><br/>David Ayer directs this film, and it was clear he had a set idea in mind. Taking a script he also penned with a very intriguing story, Ayer had just a couple things he needed to put together in order to complete his idea. Some of these he did something about, others he didn't bother. To begin with, the screenplay lacked depth in characters and their development. Our essential lead, played by Logan Lerman, had the typical and almost clichéd development as the boy who learns to be a man, but otherwise the characters were given at the start of the film and stayed constant throughout the entire movie. This is a movie with essentially just five characters, so development is very necessary to elicit enough intrigue, however with this movie it wasn't there. <br/><br/>Second, Ayer had to find the right tech guys to make this movie happen. The visual effects artists did a fine job in this film, though at times they, along with Ayer, made some interesting decisions. There were times where the animations would appear entirely realistic, but had almost cartoonish underlying suggestions. It worked, but it was hard to not notice. Ayer really hit the nail on the head though when he got to work with his sound guys. In any war movie, the sound is essential to bring it to life, and here the work was done with perfection. If any other sound mixers win at the Academy Awards this year, I will be very surprised. Finally, and this is the case with any movie, but Ayer had to take his screenplay and make it cool. This is a war movie about fighting tanks, the biggest, baddest, and most impressive part of early twentieth century war: we need to see come cool action scenes with awesome fight choreography. Here, Ayer delivered with flying colors. There's one scene in particular in ""Fury"" where it's a full-on open field fight between one tank and four others. This has to be one of the most gripping war film scenes I've ever seen. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and was not disappointed by the climatic conclusion. In the end, I enjoyed this movie very much. It was loaded with clichés, the character development was seriously lacking, and it was kind of long, but I was thoroughly entertained. In the likeness of ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Fury"" was incredibly violent with gruesome depictions, which is exactly what was intended, but can be disturbing and repellant to some viewers. The people I saw this movie with did not like it, mostly because of these reasons, but I was honestly surprised by its quality. So as I walked out of the theater, I was wanting to wash my hands and see it again. I give ""Fury"" an 8.2/10"
"martymac2","9","3","7","22 October 2014"," The Hollywood dilemma: Heroes or reality
","Fury raises more questions than it answers: Why does Wardaddy hate krauts so much, (and why can he speak German)? Is rape 'okay' in wartime? Did Americans kill prisoners? (When Wardaddy was testing his new crewman I thought the gun was not loaded.) Why did the US army use such lousy tanks? And the largest question: How and why can men who have been dehumanized (by our standards) by war find the courage to lay down their lives? Dramatizing these themes alone is reason to applaud Fury. Such realism has not been seen for decades: since 'The Victors', 'Attack', and 'Full Metal Jacket.' (Sorry, but Saving Private Ryan was straight out of Sgt. Rock comics). But these movies were not big box office successes. And Hollywood demands boffo box office or you don't get to make your movie. So I forgive Fury of its few Hollywoodish faults. War turns men into beasts, but do we need to see all the depravity of our heroes? The acting and the battle sequences are top-notch. Pitt could get an Oscar. (So Hollywood, me realizes) On a side note, my Russian wife and I just came home from the cinema. She wonders why Americans would fight in a foreign land. She understands why her countrymen fought. Her grandfather died at Kursk. I told her I probably would have fought Hitler, also, though I am safe in Canada. Issues to resolve later, bedtime now. I do hope Putin allows this film in Russia. He has been telling his subjects that we are Nazis and/or fascists."
"moviexclusive","8","3","7","21 October 2014"," Gritty and visceral, this bloody and brutal depiction of the struggle among and within individuals cast into the necessities of war is a classic in its own right
","War isn't pretty. Nor does it kill discriminately. Hollywood woke up to that reality with Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan' slightly more than 15 years ago, and hasn't looked back since. Set within the same great conflict in modern twentieth century history, David Ayer's 'Fury' possesses the exact same sensibilities. It is gritty and realistic, bloody and brutal, grim and sobering; to put it simply, it's that kind of war movie which doesn't paint its subject any differently from what it is in real life, and it does so with such persuasion that it deserves to be mentioned among the very best.<br/><br/>To be sure, Ayer's propensity for raw authentic portrayals of masculine behaviour under fire wasn't born and bred on this battlefield. Indeed, his preoccupation began on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, which formed the setting for his 'Training Day' script which won Denzel Washington an Oscar as well as equally well- received LAPD drama 'End of Watch' two years ago. But Ayer truly comes into his own as a filmmaker with his latest, an apparent work in progress for many years during which he did the research on every little meticulous detail that shows on the screen – most prominently with the use of five M4 Sherman tanks and one German tiger in the production.<br/><br/>While it takes its title from the sobriquet of a particular Sherman tank with the four-letter word emblazoned across its barrel, 'Fury' is less about what happens outside the tank than inside the battered vehicle. Within those walls are five men led by Sgt. Don Collier, a.k.a. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), a battle-hardened commander who has been fighting Germans through Africa, Belgium, the Netherlands and now on their very home soil. His crew includes gunner Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), a religious man who prays over the Germans he kills; Boyd's loader Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal), a short-fused belligerent hillbilly who is the most unhinged of the lot; and driver Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Peña), the sole Mexican-American among them.<br/><br/>In a broad sense, 'Fury' does share some similarity with 'Training Day' – both films unfold from the point of view of a rookie; in the case of the former, a young recruit named Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), sent to replace the tank's fifth crew member, the assistant driver, who has just been killed. Barely eight weeks in the Army and trained as a clerk typist, Norman simply doesn't belong. Ayer uses Norman as the audience's surrogate, plunged into the horrific necessities of war and forced to put aside conventional notions of decency and humanity in order to survive.<br/><br/>""Ideals are peaceful; history is violent,"" Wardaddy explains to Norman when they get a brief respite in a German town which they liberate from the scourge of the Nazis. An interlude in the middle of the film that sees the two men chancing upon two German women in an apartment, the fortyish Irma (Anamaria Marinca) and her beautiful young cousin, Emma (Alicia von Rittberg) makes that point emphatically, the eventual denouement of the latter marking one of the most unexpectedly moving turning points in the movie. <br/><br/>Ayer's commitment to character is evident in this sequence alone, and he remains steadfast to it from start to finish. Though the characters read like archetypes for the genre, they are surprisingly well drawn. Each has developed his own defence as a response to cope with the horrors he witnesses, and Ayer captures their buried feelings with shrill immediacy. Their roles in relation to each other in the team are also clearly defined, and their camaraderie is made up of a rough and unpretentious intimacy. <br/><br/>Yet what proves to be far more fascinating is the complex dynamic between Wardaddy and his men, the former assuming the role of the latter's paterfamilias as he watches over the latter with a keen eye not dulled by his combat weariness. In many ways, Ayer fashions this as an old-fashioned platoon movie inflected by a post 9/11, post- Iraq, post-Afghanistan, 21st century point of view, such that despite its familiarity, it subverts and enhances old-school expectations with contemporary sensibilities and comes across both fresh and gripping.<br/><br/>The same can be said of star Brad Pitt's riveting performance, which is no doubt one of his very best. Though one may be tempted to compare it with that in 'Inglorious Basterds', Pitt loses the hipster jokiness of the former film for a much more grounded and compelling portrayal of the tough and quiet squad leader filled with intensity and charisma. His below-the-line team is exceptional, including a truly excellent LaBeouf, an edgy Bernthal and a quietly solid Pena. But the film is also anchored on the other end by Lerman, his horror and disgust a cracked mirror for the crew as well as a proxy for the audience, and the actor best known for playing the lead in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is heartfelt to the point of being almost heart- breaking.<br/><br/>The fact that it resonates so immensely with us is testament to the power of this bleak and savage portrait of war. It is not about the honor, glory or majesty of heroes; no, it is simply about a fight for survival premised on the shedding of blood - heads are vaporized by mortar rounds; limbs are severed by bursts of automatic-rifle fire; and human flesh is charred by flames and shredded by shrapnel. Even so, it is a deeply sensitive exploration of the depths of hell in battle, shot with visceral and often shockingly grisly realism and driven by a top-notch calibre of actors you want to hear mentioned when awards season comes along. And when it's time to write the history of Hollywood's war movies, we're sure 'Fury' will be mentioned among the very best."

Pitt and Bernthal's characters particularly show the effects of war – You have mixed emotions about them as the film progresses, as they both do things to Lerman's character that make you despise them, and then later on their actions do make you pull for them. Peña and LaBeouf are pretty likable, and again Lerman's does well as a man forced into a being a soldier, in this rag tag crew, again, where some are morally questionable. The characters do come out stereotypical at times in terms of past performances of soldiers on screen, and pretty much nothing is given on their backgrounds before the war.

This time if I had more time I would have re bought the movie ticket and watched it all night long. Was very good movie. Weird to see transformers actor with a mustache though.

","In Brad Pitt's latest film, we see the final days of the war in Germany, via a tank commander and his men, circa 1945. It is in a word, Gruesome.<br/><br/>However, very realistic in it's nature of showing the war and its effects on the men who fought. It was not pretty and romantic like the liberals want us to believe. No, the men didn't dance the night away with Hitler like so many liberal wet-dreams. It was ferocious and bloody like depicted.<br/><br/>I am really surprised the film was SNUBBED by the Oscar committee for consideration at the 2015 Academy Awards. Why? It's a great period film, maybe not completely historical, but a great film nonetheless. Should have been at least nominated for Best Picture. Wonderful film."

","A solid, realistic, first half of the movie, with good action and dialogue, but I feel the 2nd half is too unrealistic, and again we have the typical American portrayal of German soldiers as being stupid(and the belief that somehow German women are all prostitutes willing to sleep with Americans). The only character that I didn't like was Brad Pitt's character, as in other movies he is some maniac ""killing gnazis"" and being that fanatical about it that he sacrifices almost his entire crew and himself towards that goal, although they could have easily live to fight another day. My favorite character was Shia LaBeouf's character, he seemed the most believable of all(a loyal friend, a fighter and a Christian)."

I thought it was pretty authentic, very bad things happen in war, men are driven quite mad. I liked the whole thing how they had authentic uniforms, tanks, guns, It was suitably claustrophobic in the tank, realistic in that they were filthy, as there are no showers or pizza huts in the middle of war,and the second world war at the near end was vicious on all sides,prisoners were often summarily executed, some of the scenes in the war, really make me glad i wasn't there.i would recommend this film to anybody who likes old fashioned war films, where you just enjoy the ride."

Saving Private Ryan and Fury share so many elements that it borders with plagiarism. <br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Up to a point. Acting is good and so are special effects, but military buffs will be quick to point out that the supposedly realistic portrayal of war is full of absurd situations.

","FURY is a very fine WWII tank movie. I would even go so far as to say FURY does for WWII tank movies what DAS BOOT did for WWII submarine movies. It is a frank and honest portrayal of how road- weary and worn out Allied troops were by the end of World War II, it is not a glorified ""patriotic"" movie, but rather a grim, dark and dank film about survival punctuated with some intense tank battles.<br/><br/>So, why didn't I like it more?<br/><br/>The answer is simple - I just didn't care enough about the 5 people we spent over 2 hours in a tank with. <br/><br/>Start with Brad Pitt's Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. Clearly, good at what he does and clever enough to keep his ""band of brothers"" alive, Pitt's portrayal is gritty, dim and dark (in keeping with mood of this movie). It is a more realistic, restrained character/performance than his Lt. Aldo Raine in INGLORIOUS BASTARD. The trouble is - I rooted much more for Raine than I ever did for Collier.<br/><br/>Add on top of that, Jon Bernthal - channeling an R-Rated version of his character Shane from the Walking Dead, Michael Pena being ""gritty"" as Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia and fresh faced Logan Lerman as fresh faced Norman Ellison - all right out of central casting - and we have a group that was really hard for me to root for, or worry over.<br/><br/>Only Shia LeBeouf's Boyd ""Bible"" Swan was a character that I cared about. I caught myself midway through this movie thinking ""Gosh, LeBeouf really can act."" I then realized I had to take the surprise out of my voice. Let's hope he builds on this and quits his real life ""crazy"" act and all those Transformers movies.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, director David Ayer keeps the action moving and stages some wonderfully intense tank battles that makes this movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Just don't get too attached to the characters.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"badajoz-1","5","4","11","6 November 2014"," Derivative War Film That Does Not Really Convince
","A good effort at trying to portray war in its gory, dirty messiness - both in literal and ethical terms. But ultimately it fails on two counts. Firstly, it tries to be an all-embracing depiction of every war there ever was, but it is set in WW2, and it does not fully convince of its historical setting, eg incidents, characterisation, general philosophical observations in the script, and the incompetence of the Wehrmacht reveal a desire for universality rather historical accuracy. So we get soldiers depicted as if they are fighting in Vietnam or Iraq (you know modern liberal hand ringing about atrocities committed by US personnel), and new tropes of war based on YouTube videos from Iraq- officers do not really fight wars (if they do, they look 15 and get killed almost immediately. So why do snipers have orders to take out officers first and make soldiers leaderless? And every soldier must literally depict that they are suffering from PTSD so we get every actor, bar Brad Pitt, twitching his head slightly! The second failure is that the film revels in and perpetuates all the old clichés of the genre. Yes, the new kid who has to be shown how to fight total war; the war weary vets who have almost descended to an animal state; US GIs fighting almost impossible odds on their own; a couple of scenes with female civilians as 'normal life' is partially reconnected to; characters who have appeared in 95% of previous war films and are so recogniseable; and bits of other better films dragged in because the director/writer does not know how to be original. The latter sees Pitt and La Boeuf reconnect by spouting biblical quotations, just like Peckinpah's 'Ride The High Country' as Randolph Scott and Joel MacRae rediscover their bonds of trust and friendship for the final shoot out. While the decision to stay and fight a probably terminal stand is straight out of 'The Magnificent Seven.' It does portray a very bloody business, and the tank battle with the Tiger is thrilling, but the final battle is sheer Errol Flynn/Clint Eastwood with Veteran Wehrmacht/SS going down in their hundreds before the superstar's automatic weapons! And please why did the film have to pinch the ending of 'All Quiet On The Western Front?' Shame on you! The film should have just got on with telling how it was, not how Hollywood thinks it now is."

","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent."" Wardaddy (Brad Pitt)<br/><br/>And violent Fury is, and old-fashioned WWII war story about the commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier of a Sherman tank, his crew, and a retinue of tanks, all heroically facing superior German tanks with their ability to destroy Shermans at will. The story is captivating, the soldiers believable, and the heroics inevitably sad. Pitt's similar role, however, in Inglorious Basterds as a Nazi hunter, was far more nuanced, and frankly, directed by the genius Quentin Tarantino. David Ayer's work in other men facing murderous times is still not competition for the sardonic Tarantino.<br/><br/>Many war stories tropes are here, such as the young recruit who needs seasoning (Norman, played by Logan Lerman) and the scruffy crew of diverse characters: the outwardly gruff master sergeant (Pitt); the inebriated Mexican, Trina (Michael Pena); the bible- bookworm-killer Gordon (Shia LeBeouf); and the hardened tough guy Grady (Jon Bernthal)--stereotypes all but not overly so. This film is superior to George Clooney's The Monuments Men as the jokes are quiet, not taking away from the grim reality, and the incidents are coherent with the overall plot, not set pieces existing for effect rather than complement. <br/><br/>That Pitt and Clooney are best buddies and recently married to accomplished women makes for a kinder comparison. Pitt, with his boffo performances in Benjamin Button and Moneyball and this one, is jumping ahead of his friend in the acting category but still needs to direct to compete overall. <br/><br/>As the four tanks dwindle down to just Fury (the name painted on Wardaddy's tank), the intense warfare is mitigate only by a brief encounter between Wardaddy and Norman and two German women hiding in their apartment. What happens is not exactly what you'd expect and more illuminating about the tank's crew than you'd expect. Ayer expertly underplays this episode as he shows a deft hand at even quiet, non warlike moments.<br/><br/>Norman will grow too fast for belief with each episode (it is only one day, after all) and Wardaddy's terse advice on matters relating to sentiment, survival, and slaughter: ""It will end, soon. But before it does, a lot more people have to die."" Exceptional heroics surface while everyone knows the German will surrender soon but remain steadfast with respect to their orders to stop the enemy. <br/><br/>Although the final scene is hard to believe (at least 300 SS troops versus the tank crew?), the film is not compromised, for we are surely aware that this is not a good war, and war is hell."

","Hardened tank commander Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) becomes an unwilling mentor to unprepared novice Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) who is not prepared for war having previously served his time behind a typewriter. Nevertheless Collier guides his men through enemy lines in Germany, but at what cost??<br/><br/>So here it is Fury probably one of the most bloated and overrated war films that I've ever seen; instead of offering us an insightful and involving character piece Fury instead became a macho chauvinistic display of empty emotion with most of the characters behaving like the biggest bunch of jerks you're ever likely to see. This is purportedly based on US Tank Crews during the final moments of World War 2 which begs the question; were they all objectionable like the guys depicted here? I have to admit that it was not a lot of fun sitting through this film and the only character I felt any real sympathy for was Norman.<br/><br/>So aside from all of this what else happened? Well there's lots of shouting, noise, bravado and of course the US of A killing several Germans. At one point in the film there are some moments of quiet reflection which add nothing and only serve to elongate the film past its already generous 2 hour plus running time.<br/><br/>The acting is not much to write home about; the likes of Pena, La Bouef, Bernthal and Pitt are all in the film, but if I'm honest I'd struggle to remember their names or anything about them as this is clearly not important to anyone that made this film. Pitt's character becomes somewhat sympathetic towards the end, but even he is a persona that is hard to endure. Only Logan Lerman comes away as being a sympathetic character (perhaps that was the point), but at least he was someone we could root for.<br/><br/>Despite a lot of potential, Fury is far too superficial and thin to become really involved in and, truth be told, when watching the film it looked like I was watching someone else play a computer game so yes pretty uninvolving stuff truth be told."

","Fury is an excellent and action packed WW2 movie by one of my favorite current film makers David Ayer. He is best known for working as a writer and/or director on a lot of excellent police thrillers. Besides the cinematic abomination known as Suicide Squad, I enjoy the movies he works on. This is unlike a lot of more one dimensional jingostic WW2 movies. The film is very gritty and violent and portrays a fairly bleak view of survival of Brad Pitt and his crew fighting the Nazi's and doing their best to survive inside a Sherman tank, which is inferior to the tanks driven by the enemy. This gives a fairly sound depiction of the horrors of war and what these men must endure. The performances are very somber and very good. The actors had great chemistry. The overall tone and mood of the film brings to mind the band Discharge, which would be a good aural companion piece to the film. Fury is a very good film, that is solid and well made."

","This is the story of a battle hardened crew making their way across Germany during WW II in a Sherman tank. Although not many movies made that I can compare, it's unique in the sense that most of it takes place from the perspective of the tank crew. The visuals include a lot of unnecessary gore that added little of nothing to the movie. The story was lacking despite the fine performances of the actors and it seemed to drag on at times with content that really didn't add anything. There were a couple of scenes that even seemed it didn't quite fit the story-line.<br/><br/>Enough to the story to get me through it but unlikely I would see it again. If it weren't for the performances of the actors It might have been a walk-out."
"darkelsar","7","2","4","13 August 2017"," Another film showing how hard and violent war is
","Following the daily route of a tank crew during the last months of WWII in Germany, showing both the humanism and heroism of its members, this movie does its very best to immerse us in all the horror, the dirt, the sweat and the blood that soldiers had to endure back then, even at the relative shelter of a Sherman. It shows violence without qualms, and succeeds in creating a memorable rendering for the viewer, well helped by several tense action scene and a total immersion, comforting the viewer that it all seems real.<br/><br/>But in fact it contrasts with the historic reality and all the credibility of the events bound to it, which are indeed quite forgotten for the sake of the tense and bad-ass looking scenes. Germans' tanks and their anti-tank artillery are less accurate and effective than they really were, allowing American soldiers and tanks to take the advantage in situations where they might have not, situations they probably wouldn't have engaged that way in the first place in reality, knowing both their own strength and weakness and those of German units, and preferring not taking such useless risks, especially at that time near the end of the war. So the exceptional is standardized, and a handful of Americans hold a suicidal position against a regiment of hundreds of Nazis, butchering many of them. It could have been greater if the Germans looked less like a herd of wildebeest willing to rush in number and more like soldiers willing to defeat or simply survive their enemy to fight at least another day. In fact the context of this whole last stand lacks credibility, why the hell these Americans would sacrifice their life to hold a position against all odds, whereas Germany is collapsing, invaded from everywhere by Allies and Soviets, and this German armed group is not in position to change a damn thing about it, in fact such a German force would have most likely entrenched itself on a defensive position to ambush the enemy at that time of the war, rather than the opposite.<br/><br/>Anyway the film is made of good quality, with a good immersion, tense and convincing actors who compensate the more artificial and less credible stakes of the scenario, to give you a quite memorable viewing."

","I love a good war movie. Unfortunately, ""Fury"" isn't one. I should have know by the somewhat surreal opening scene that I wasn't going see something in the vain of classics like ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""The Longest Day"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Instead, what I got was a cross between ""Kelly Hero's"" and (Jon Bernthal's presence notwithstanding) ""The Walking Dead.""<br/><br/>There are two big problems with ""Fury."" The first is the ridiculous (or perhaps, standard) one dimensional characters. There isn't a character in the movie that has any depth. I think there was an attempt to make Wardaddy a bit deeper by stealing the scene from ""Saving Private Ryan"" where Wardaddy sneaks off behind a tank for a quick cry.<br/><br/>The second problem is with the fighting, especially at the end of the movie when the tank is surrounded, at night. The Germans were particularly good fighters and would not have spent a couple of hours running around in front of a tank getting machine gunned. Not when they could have quickly run around the back and put a couple of Panzerfaust rounds in the turret. <br/><br/>As a pure action and explosion movie, Fury does deliver, especially if you pretend it is very well drawn cartoon."

","While this was a descent action/historical fiction/war movie, it wasn't anything that great. It gave good performances from the main five actors, had good cinematography, but seemed unrealistic.<br/><br/>The plot was not very well put together and in the end you were left wondering what the point of it all was. It goes through the motions at the beginning with not much happening and builds up to the final stand where it is ""do or die"" but leaves the story without full closure of anything. It had many standard war movie cliché's especially with the small band of men taking on hundreds alone. While it did avoid the cliché of them all surviving, they included a different one with the rookie living in the end and being pardoned by an enemy troop. How exactly did he become an expert fighter in just two days when before he barely knew how to operate a firearm? Who knows.<br/><br/>While most of the effects and visuals of the movie were raw gritty and incredibly realistic looking, there was one flaw that tainted the look of the entire film. The tracer rounds that the armies fired throughout looked like laser beams from from some sci-fi film with their long glowing neon green and red streaks flying throughout the air. It almost looked like a firefight in Star Wars Battlefront or something.<br/><br/>A truly good historical fiction movie should look like it was shot in the time that the story takes place in. While most of this looked pretty good, some of the dialogue and personalities of the characters didn't fly. And what was with all the Macklemore haircuts??? I'm pretty positive undercuts were not a popular look back then especially if you were an enlisted man in the United States Military.<br/><br/>The out of place romance was just plain ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall it did give us today a look on what it might have been like in the life of a tank crew during World War II, showing us the horrors of war, but also the little bit of goodness that shines through even in the most horrible of situations. It was a good film but nothing to be amazed over."

Brad Pitt gives a more human performance than his Inglorious Basterds counterpart. Often savage and in turn paternalistic. At times achieving both.

","The Good:
War films often look at the machines of combat as cold and impersonal tools. Infantry soldiers mount and dismount trucks and carry themselves from mission to mission on foot. The reality of modern combat, though, is more mobile, more mechanized. But, even though machines can be cold and impersonal, and can remove soldiers from the visceral and traumatic nature of war real intimacy and feeling isn't removed from combat. The film spends a good deal of time inside the tank trying to depict the close bonds that form between a group of men in close quarters put in life and death situations routinely, and it does it well. Although the personalities sometimes clash and we can see the real animosity that exists between them, truer moments shine through when they're asked to fight for each other and against perhaps the greatest evil the world has ever known.<br/><br/>The Bad:
The worst part of this film is probably the largely uneven or lackluster performances. Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt, which is regrettable because as the film''s biggest star one would hope for more of a star performance. Jon Bernthal is Jon Bernthal, which is unsurprising. Logan Lerman is Logan Lerman, which is predictable. Michael Cena could have shined, but was given only an awkward monologue that doesn't really connect well to the rest of the film. Shia LaBeouf similarly isn't given much of a showcase in the film, but he does well in the moments that are written for him. He should have had more.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
A deeper scan of a list of World War II films would likely generate at least a short list of films that better did what this film tried to do, but the first film that comes to mind for me is Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998). Although Ryan doesn't deal directly with tank combat, it certainly showcases how soldiers in combat can establish deep relationships without regard for the character of brevity that their lives have assumed. All that being said, the performances are also immeasurably better across the board."

Fury has a strong cast and one outstanding actor, Shia Labeouf. He lifts the film slightly. Brad Pitt has a respectable role of tank commander. The story is quite simple. A warmovie is a warmovie. At the end Fury is an exciting war film in the best tradition. I would like to say boyishly exciting."

"scb-49372","6","0","0","22 February 2017"," Lack of a real reaction and comradery in a pivotal moment
","SPOILER ALERT! The movie overall is pretty well done but the lack of sympathy between the characters and for people in general is unrealistic. Whether or not these men hate the Germans would make no difference during Emma's death scene. The fact that these men just shared a meal and obviously this young teenager just had a moment with this girl would cause a totally different reaction than what was seen in the film. OK so if this kid was still getting locked up and not killing Germans I could understand the men treating him with contempt but they've watched him kill and fight along side them so if he wants to run over and remove bricks from a dead women he just slept with they would have never treated him that way. I understand they are battle hardened vets who have seen the horrors of war but they have American values instilled in them and they would have never through him to the ground and acted as if it was an o well type of moment. This was a very tragic death and obviously these 2 women treated them fairly well especially the young man and brad Pitt and to act the way they did was unreal. Again I understand they've been through hell and back over and over again but the reaction depicted made me write this review because it honestly just bugs me to make them act this way. Maybe I'm overreacting but it just felt odd and I think that's even why they did a follow up scene with an apology to the young kid because if they didn't you'd feel no sympathy for these men because they have no sympathy for anyone not even each other. As a man coming from a family of veterans they have told me many stories and there are times to be tough and show little remorse but the one thing that holds men close together and makes them want to fight is the understanding of each other emotions and noticing moments when u show empathy for a tragedy. They've told me you can't do it all the time or else you'd be withering in sadness the whole war but a moment such as that would make the men pull the kid up not knock him to the ground because that's only going to effect his fighting. Sorry for the overreaction but just had to get that off my chest."

","There are so many WWII movies on the market that are full of propaganda and created just to be made. But this one is made with passion and honesty. World War-II is a big part of lives of people of my generation (I am 36 and my grandfather was the veteran of WWII) in former Soviet Union countries and I would like to thank director, crew and all involved for creating this masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are a few clichés in the movie as mentioned by other reviewers but they all are passed unnoticed while I was watching Fury. Great performance by all actors, great music and battle scenes. Director made me to feel like I was each one of the tank crew members living their lives and dying with them. Fury is one of not many movies that shows how war really is. That this is ugly, cruel and dirty unlike it may seem for new younger generation people that are playing World of Tanks in their warm clean homes and think that war is a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Fury shows us how WW-II really was, how brave men were and that we should not forget about the Greatest War, learn history lessons and not let this happen again.<br/><br/>I have watched the movie many times and highly recommend it."
"eragonbookfan","8","5","16","30 November 2014"," Surprisingly... I really liked it!!
","I usually don't like films were pervasive swearing & violence - I find it neither fun nor entertaining. <br/><br/>Even far better than David Ayer's previous flicks like ""Training Day"" or ""End of the Watch"", which were so horrible & awfully made that that I didn't give two HOOTS about any of the characters, or what would happen to any of them! No this. No, I actually cared about a bunch of the characters - hoping they would make it through.<br/><br/>But, hey, it's because it's a World War II film - and we all pretty much know how Jews were persecuted & massacred horrendously during that period, so I'll REALLY give it that. And quite a bunch of these actors are Jewish, so I could feel the tense emotion they were going through when making this. <br/><br/>What interested me enough about this flick is Shia Labeouf's recent conviction with accepting Jesus Christ as his Lord & Savior - and I sincerely see why.<br/><br/>I surely felt that actor Logan was a far better character in this than his ""Ham"" character in the disappointing biblically inaccurate flop ""Noah"", near the start of this year - where playing a son that wants to defy & defeat his father who turns into a psychopath.<br/><br/>But, from be inning to end, I have to admit I was engaged! Fighting the Nazis was quite satisfying, the character development was helpful, the horrors of war a really-well depicted, quite on an educational level, and I notice there are negative reviews regarding the ""house"" scene with the two women - I found that scene really tense! Wondering what was going to happen next, the intention to slow the film down, because there's GOTTA be a break sometime in any big action film! And loved how Logan had a temporary love interest, Emma, who I found was really cute with Logan.<br/><br/>But I also certainly liked when the issue of G-d and the Bible was brought in. When Norman first shows up, he's grilled by another tank crewman about his salvation. We find out that this guy, nicknamed Bible, is a Christian. We see him praying over a wounded soldier and quoting Scripture several times before battle. That said, his faith doesn't keep Bible from being every bit as foulmouthed, boozy, and death-dealing as the rest of his crew. In fact, he rationalizes that relishing the slaughter of the enemy is a positive thing since it's ""God's work."" He intones, ""I am the instrument, not the hand.""<br/><br/>Norman, we find out, is a Presbyterian. His faith informs his initial hesitation with regard to following in his crewmates' crude and deadly directions. But he tosses those convictions aside fairly quickly in the bloody heat of battle. There's even a scene concerning the fact that ""Jesus loves Hitler""; yes, G-d loves every person. But He hates there sin!<br/><br/>For his part, Sgt. Collier generally scoffs at the idea of God's hand being involved in their lives, even though he later demonstrates some knowledge of the Bible by quoting from the book of Isaiah. I do agree with the line of ""The love of the Father not being on those who've got the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, being of the world, but no the Father.""<br/><br/>This movie wants to make sure we know that, smell that and chew on that phrase. In fact, Fury rubs our cinematic faces in two hours of grimy, dirty, intensely ferocious, charred-flesh misery to make sure the point comes through is crystal clear fashion. <br/><br/>Some will see that unflinching glimpse at perpetual bloodshed and gray-smoking destruction as something of an antiwar declaration. They'll see a cautionary tale of men hollowed out and broken by the unspeakable horrors they've witnessed.<br/><br/>Others will see this pic as a one-dimensional splatter-fest dressed up in khaki Army fatigues, with limbs innumerable being severed by large-caliber machine gun fire and mortar rounds in a story of brutal, hard-fisted soldiers battling a Nazi evil even more wicked than themselves.<br/><br/>Everyone will be right. The film's creators crafted it that way on purpose. But no matter which interpretive path you take, what seems inarguable is how profanely foul, excruciatingly graphic, unwaveringly nihilistic and downright ugly it all remains. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>And PS: PluggedInOnline.com is one of my many inspiration to be watching & reviewing movies - it's also a great website to view the many different elements within whatever flick you're interested to see."

Why not, after all, Wardaddy showed him how to kick ass, how to love a women, how to kill Nazzies and much more. The guy killed himself when he was on fire with the head shot? He was on fire.

","The movie is about a tank and its crew during the second World War in Germany. After so much marketing around it, Fury should have been better. The movie is just about the tank. So there is no story. I though at some point that maybe it is about the brutality of the war and how men are turned against their own beliefs. But it never gets to it. Logan Lerman gives a great performance, and maybe that's the highlight of the movie, but that is not enough to save it. Except from the brutality and the lucking of a story (which results into having too many little meaningless and uninteresting stories) the non existing script (the dialogs are mostly just cursing), the Star Wars fire exchange (really unreal) the luck of originality and the final scene simply destroyed it. The constant reminder that the Germans are the evil guys got annoying at some point (even though the movie had a good German in the end) as did the brutality (that face in the tank was disgusting). Therefor I give Fury a 2 out of 10."

If I had stopped at the start of the final battle then maybe I would have walked away with some sort of admiration for what the director had produced. But i didn't! The ridiculous colored tracer bullets being fired by every weapon used throughout the film wasn't nearly as outrageous as the final battle. OMG. If only the German soldiers had been this dumb in the real world wars, running in front of gun fire like ducks in a shooting gallery and being blocked by some strange force field which seemed to prevent them from getting behind the immobilized tank The Fury.

"edouardterzis","4","4","12","7 December 2014"," Lots of action but no real story
","Showing the horror and violence of the war, the plot is very simplistic and we do not have any of the very complex socio-political facts and events at that time that were of great importance shaping the movie. The other critique I have is the single minded perspective adopted by Ayer, where all the Germans are portrayed as 'nazis' and killers. I feel like more objectiveness in a movie that tries to portray a very tragic and important event in our recent history is greatly required as it will influence lots of people that do not have the necessary knowledge in history. Although the roles were well played by most of the actors, I felt like each one of them had much more to offer or say about personal / older history as brothers in arms."

Why always the exaggerated and simplified characters and clichés? While history itself has so much to offer.

"rogerdarlington","Null","4","12","26 October 2014"," David Ayer gives us two films in one
","Brad Pitt and the Second World War. What's not to like? Even if, now 50, Pitt really is too old to play a front-line soldier. And the movie is rightly proving a huge commercial success. But haven't we seen all this sort of stuff before, most obviously in ""Inglourious Basterds""? Well, yes and no - ""Fury"" does have some distinctive features.<br/><br/>First, it is not often that war films focus on the tank as weapon. The best example was ""Lebanon"" and, although a good deal of ""Fury"" is located within the soldiers' vehicle, the Israeli film was shot entirely within the confines of a tank. A major difference between the two films though is that, in the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, they faced no heavy weaponry whereas, in ""Fury"", we see the the US Army's standard armoured weapon, the M4 Sherman medium tank, facing the much better-armoured German Tiger tank and a sequence when four Shermans lock horns with one Tiger is one of the most viscerally thrilling of the movie.<br/><br/>But there are other differences too. The Second World War is usually presented as the nearest we've had to a 'good' war: we know who is the evil invader and who is the noble liberator, who commits war crimes and who acts with unfailing decency. Except that ""Fury"" does not flinch from showing Americans behaving badly, even murderously. A final difference - which adds a certain poignancy to the film - is that it is set in Germany in the final days of the war when the Germans have no reason to keep fighting and the GIs just want to stop killing and go home.<br/><br/>All these elements of ""Fury"" are the result of the writer and director being David Ayer for whom this is a very personal movie. Both of his grandfathers fought in the Second World War, he himself is a US Navy veteran who served on a nuclear submarine, and he has made a career out of telling stories about men losing their innocence (think ""Training Day and ""End Of Watch""). In the case of ""Fury"", the innocent character is Norman (Logan Lerman), a clerk suddenly forced to be a gunner, who comes under the unconventional guidance of tank commander Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Pitt). The other three crew members are a mixed bunch of veterans played by Shia LaBeouf (""Bible'), Michael Peña (""Gordo""), and Jon Bernthal (""Coon-Ass"").<br/><br/>At so many levels, this is an outstanding work. The direction, the cinematography and the sound are superb, while the vast crew who made the Herfordshire and Oxfordshire countryside of rural England look like the war-blasted Germany have done a terrific job. Ultimately, though, this is two films presented as a single adventure. For the first two- thirds of the movie, we have a traditional 'war is hell' approach. Then, when the tank called ""Fury"" loses its track, we lurch into another kind of film altogether, one in which 'fury' becomes an adjective rather than a noun, one that recalls the final body-fest in the conclusion to ""The Wild Bunch"", one in which war may be hell, but damn it, it's also incredibly exciting and oh so heroic."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","12","25 October 2014"," Among the best WW2 movies, and the best ""tank movie""
","I cannot claim that ""tank movie"" qualifies as a separate genre by itself but those who enjoyed ""Battle of the Bulge"" (1965) half a century ago would love ""Fury"". Both anchored on the post-D-Day period when the Nazis made a desperate final attempt to turn the tides of war by unleashing the last instalment their still superior hardware: Tiger tanks. While ""Bulge"" is a dramatic (actually somewhat melodramatic) heroic epic that essentially entertains, ""Fury"" is an intimate account that entertains, probes, moves and challenges.<br/><br/>""Fury"" can boast of the distinction of being shot with the ONLY remaining real, working Tiger tank in the world, ""T-131"", that was captured from the Nazis during the war and still kept intact in a museum. Pitched against Tigers were American Sherman tanks, decidedly outclassed in both fire power and armor protection.<br/><br/>With some simplification, I could say that ""Fury"" is a brief (a few days) account of intimate scrutiny of 5 people who man the titular Sherman tank, starting with the arrival of newcomer (replacement of a lost assistant driver) Norman (no reference to ""Psycho"", I think) who was obviously in the wrong place, having joined the army for only 8 weeks, ""fighting"" with nothing deadlier than a typewriter. You can look at this multi-dimensioned movie as a coming-of-age story of Normal, well performed by Logan Lerman.<br/><br/>The soul of the movie however is squad leader ""Wardaddy"", superbly portrayed by a Brad Pitt who never stops surprising the audience with his virtuosity, such as the dumb idiot in ""Burn after reading"" (2008) that you would never have associated with him until you see the movie. In ""Fury"" the first impressive I have is that I have never seen Pitt so old, not old as in Benjamin Button, but in the sense of being world-wearied and war-wearied. Shia LaBeouf finally capitalizes on a role that can showcase his acting ability, a soldier nicknamed ""Bible"" which quite aptly defines the character. The delicate bond between Wardaddy and Bible is quite subtle but still palpable. The other two members are nicknamed Gordo (Michael Pena) and Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal), two varieties of the gruffly, macho soldier from the grass root.<br/><br/>The one thing that must be remembered is that except for newcomer Norman (who finally got accepted and earned a nickname ""Machine"") these people have been through hell, over and over again, in the claustrophobic interior of a tank. The bonding this has on them is something that we can only try to appreciate, but never truly empathize with.<br/><br/>Those looking for action should be well satisfied with the final two set pieces. First, we witnessed several Sherman tanks destroyed one after another by a Tiger which was ultimately vindicated by Wardaddy and his boys through skill and courage in maneuvering Fury. This level of excellence in filming a tank battle you have never seen before. In the grand finale, their tank, the only one remaining in the group, got stuck after hitting a land mine. All alone in the middle of nowhere, working to repair the tank, the found (through Norman posted on a watch) that marching towards them in a collision course is a troop of some 300 German infantry, too many for 5 men to cope with, even with a stalled tank that can still fight. The war was on the verge of being won and the logical course of action appears to be to hide in the woods until the troop passes. But ""No"", says Wardaddy, ""this is my home"", patting Fury with deep affection. The rest is history (for the movie).<br/><br/>There is one interlude that deserves mentioning. I shall not go into details but briefly, during a respite in a German town captured, Wardaddy and Norman find a moment of quiet domesticity in an apartment where two attractive German women where to prepare and share a quiet meal (eggs provided by Wardaddy – don't ask me how he got them) with them. While Normal is drawn to the piano and plays from the music scores there, the younger of the two women (a girl, essentially) is drawn to him and starts singing to the music. This leads to a tender love scene that is left mostly to the audience's imagination. But when the other three members of the crew walk it, real drama and tension starts - a mixture of absurdity and reality.<br/><br/>Finally, I must mention the opening scene which could be a tribute to a similar scene in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" – a faint dot appears in the center of the screen and is gradually reveals as a man approaching on horseback. This underlies the mesmerizing photography with which ""Fury"" is shot."

","Because we are Americans, it is second nature for us to pull for American soldiers in a war movie, especially a World War II movie where we know that the Nazis are the most evil enemy we have ever fought. But by the time this movie was over, I was pretty much past those preconceptions. Had I not known anything about WWII, I would have been pulling for the Germans to kill all the evil Americans, who murder surrendering prisoners, rape innocent women, act like brutes, and bully the new recruit because he is a little guy who can't defend himself. The only suggestion that the Germans were evil in this movie was the way they hanged the draft dodgers and forced young teenagers to fight, but that seems almost benign compared to what we see the Americans do.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a tank crew led by Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt). A replacement, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), is added to the crew, and he is immediately badgered and bullied by the rest of them, all of whom are bigger than he is in addition to outnumbering him, so there is no chance that he could defend himself. You see, there they are in the middle of Germany toward the end of the war, but this tank crew isn't satisfied to have the Germans for enemies, so they figure they will try to make an enemy out of this new guy as well.<br/><br/>Now, Don's motive for treating Norman roughly is to toughen him up, so that he will be able to commit war crimes just like the rest of them. But Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal) and Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena) are mean to him for a much more basic reason, which is that cruelty is fun. Had I been assigned to that tank crew, I would have waited for the chance to be alone with any one of them and then put a bullet in his back.<br/><br/>The ultimate absurdity in this movie comes when Don and Norman go into an apartment where there are two German women. Don says to Norman regarding the younger of the two, ""If you don't take her into that bedroom, I will."" Reluctantly, Norman takes the girl into the bedroom. When they close the door behind them, Don says to the other woman, ""They're young, and they're alive."" Aw! Isn't that sweet? Rape can be so lovely and romantic when it occurs during wartime.<br/><br/>I really was glad that, except for Norman, the Americans in the tank all died in the end. They deserved it."

"chris082179","9","3","8","28 February 2015"," An emotional, gritty, unrealistic action movie
","I watched this movie without having heard anything about it, which I find to be the best way to watch movies for myself. Going into it I'm thinking Inglorious Bastards, just because Brad Pitt's in it. I wasn't expecting much, but what I did get was a gritty intense work of art. This of course, turned about to be slightly more realistic than Inglorious Bastards, but grittier and darker. I suspect Mr. Ayers (I know nothing about him, nor do I care) is a generation Xer, like myself, who doesn't know a whole lot about War in general, or world war II, and that is fine. If you want to see a realistic depiction of the European campaign, Band of Brothers is all you need. I certainly don't want think anyone should strive to get to this level, because it would undoubtedly fail, yet I don't think that is what was intended here. This was a work of art, an action movie that seems to grab from the older war flicks of good ole fashioned American propaganda. It doesn't hide from that at all either. I think we all know nothing like this happened in World War II, and if you're looking for historically accurate depictions of World War II in movies, you shouldn't be. Movies are for entertainment, and I was thoroughly entertained by this one. I didn't want to stop watching. A gripping moment for me was the scene with the 2 girls, for some reason, it seemed like a bad trip; very thought provoking. I was constantly trying to guess what was going on in each characters minds while the scene played out and not too many movies accomplish this for me on this level. The fighting was not realistic of course. You don't just see tank artillery shoot through the air like lasers. Obviously this was done for dramatic purposes, while at first I was disappointed by this effect, it had its value. It put me in more of a feeling of actually being there, in its own distorted way, and set me up to set aside disbelief for the rest of the movie, for the sake of entertainment. Brad Pitt's character is interesting, although flawed at times in enunciating his accent consistently, he did speak some interesting quotes that were probably not spoken by soldiers during a time of war, but developed in hindsight by analysts of war, and for me it worked. The soldiers all acted to me, as this generation would in war. It also seemed to blend space and time and update world war II into the now. It touched on religion quite a bit, which is an interesting comparison to how the ""God is on our side"", or ""this is god's work"" mentality is achieved not only through ISIS in the present day, but can, has and will be achieved by Christianity as well. Yes, killing for God; To be clear, I'm not saying we weren't justified or at least, we can emotionally identify for all the acts our soldiers did, legal or illegal, in world war II. <br/><br/>This movie, even in all its unrealistic, pulls at the emotional depravity that occurs in war and brings you down to its level, through great intense scenes and acting. <br/><br/>I recommend giving it a watch, suspend disbelief of course, and think for yourself while watching."

","Damn... what a great film. Visceral as hell. Last film that made me feel like ""war is hell"", was Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>My Girlfriend is German, born and raised. So, for her the film was an emotional roller coaster, as she speaks German and there are a lot German dialog the film doesn't subtitle that really made it hard for her to watch. If you've seen the film, you'll know which scenes I am talking about.<br/><br/>It's almost anti German in a way. But it isn't...<br/><br/>It almost fell into the trap that most of our American war films of the post 911 era did. The trap where the film makes the USA out to be these bad ass guys that save the world and the enemy the fight, in this case, the bad Germans, deserve to get beat. I felt that the film really came close to being one of those films, almost propaganda in a way, but it didn't. There were moments where I was expecting the film to become that, but in the end, its a story about one crews view of the war through a confined, hot, rumbling metal coffin, surrounded by nothing but the death of friends against an enemy that would not surrender even when the odds were against them. We watch how the war had made Brad Pitt and his veteran tank crew grow cold. They're desensitized and careless about humanity in a way. We see how they've almost become barbarians in a way, and that they themselves, are no better than the enemy they paint as a ruthless killer. There is an interesting scene where we pause from all the death and destruction to watch Brad Pitt try desperately to hold onto what sense of civil morality he has left when he asks a German woman of a town they just liberated, if she would make him eggs. The scene is actually very intense as the film director keeps us on our toes, not knowing what Brad or the woman will do. The introduction of Logan Lerman's character as the new inexperienced support gunner for the crew cemented that dark viewpoint that Pitt's crew has on humanity, as we as an audience got to watch the difference/contrast in mindsets between a tank crew that had been through hell and a young freshman straight out of basic training. His fresh innocence is our viewpoint as we enter into their world. We're riding shotgun with him on this journey.<br/><br/>Great film. Deserves to be seen on the big screen with Atmos surround sound."
"lee_eisenberg","8","3","8","9 February 2015"," tanks a lot for this movie
","Having battled Nazis comically in ""Inglourious Basterds"", Brad Pitt now does so seriously in ""Fury"". He plays a staff sergeant commanding a Sherman tank through Nazi Germany. This movie shows World War II in its gritty details, although I admit that it probably doesn't compare to being in the midst of a battlefield. One of the most interesting scenes is when the platoon takes the town and spends some time with a pair of German women: it's a brief period of peaceful interaction between presumed enemies, just like the 1914 Christmas truce.<br/><br/>It's a really good movie. There are some pretty intense battle scenes, but most importantly, the characters are people whom the audience can care about. In the end, I think that the countries that participated in World War I need to take a serious look at how the Versailles Negotiations precipitated World War II. In addition to the millions of lives senselessly lost in the WWI - not to mention the Armenian Genocide - the Versailles Negotations simply placed new colonizers in Africa and Asia, and destroyed Germany economically, setting the stage for Hitler's rise to power.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a movie that I recommend. Definitely see it."

As other reviews have pointed out, if you are expecting a war movie on par with classics like saving private ryan, or the fantastic The Pacific or Band of Brothers series, you will be extremely disappointed. This is the first movie in a long time that I had to stop watching 3/4 of the way in because of how dire it was.

"estebangonzalez10","8","3","8","19 December 2014"," David Ayer's furious portrayal of the Second World War
","""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""<br/><br/>When it comes to approaching war films, every director seems to have a certain agenda in the way they are going to portray it. David Ayer's approach is summed up in that simple quote, delivering a war film that portrays the cruelty and rawness of war in a rather visual way. Ayer has had more misses than hits as a director, but if there is something he knows how to direct it is action set pieces. He may not be the greatest story teller and most of his characters aren't developed at all, but when it comes to action scenes he directs them with great detail. Fury is at its best when it centers on the action and stays away from the dialogue and character buildup. Very few war films have centered on soldiers fighting from inside a tank perhaps due to the physical constraints so in a way Fury is unique (unless you have seen the foreign film Lebanon which takes place entirely inside a tank). David Ayer isn't the first director who has experimented with this, but he does deliver a solid and entertaining film with gruesome action scenes. Saving Private Ryan has changed the way films portray war, and Fury is one of those war films that has been influenced by it. I can't recall another war film that depicts the cruelty of war in such an authentic and raw manner as Fury does. Fury is my second favorite film from David Ayer, but I still think End of Watch is his best. However, it's a huge improvement over his previous film, Sabotage.<br/><br/>The characters in Fury are clichéd, we've seen them before in many other war films, but the action scenes are unique and engaging. Even Brad Pitt's Wardaddy feels like a similar character from Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds without that heavy southern accent. The rest of the crew that Fury focuses on also play the usual stereotypes from numerous war films of the past. Logan Lerman plays the new boy who doesn't seem to belong to this violent world, but who we will see transformed by the effects of war. Shia LaBeouf is the Christian soldier who will throw out a pair of Bible verses in between fights. Michael Peña is the wise cracking latino and Jon Bernthal the bully who is the hardest to sympathize with. These are the five crew members inside the Sherman tank that the film centers on. Despite not being unique characters and often quite dislikable, the actors give strong performances. Brad Pitt is great as the Sergeant, although at times his star power does get in the way. I still enjoyed his performance very much. Shia LaBeouf was a surprise as well, he delivered a credible performance. The easiest character to engage with was Logan Lerman's, who delivered a surprisingly strong performance as well. The entire cast was solid despite playing clichéd characters. There is a sequence in the middle of the film that feels out of place and hurt the overall pacing of the film, but the final 30 minutes will have you at the edge of your seat again. It is intense."
"bryce-keaton","8","3","8","8 December 2014"," A Movie the War Genre Desperately Needed
","I was very excited to see David Ayer's ""Fury,"" not just because I love war movies or Brad Pitt, but because the War Movie genre seemed to have covered every aspect of modern warfare except tank warfare, which was a HUGE part of World War II. I'm certainly no expert, and I certainly did not ride a Sherman tank across 1940s Europe, but I believe Ayer put audiences inside the belly of the beast with his realistic adaptation of this World War II hero story.<br/><br/>Not only is the cast magnificent (shout out to Shia LaBeouf for his OUTSTANDING performance. I naively made the assumption, based on his previous films, that he should not be viewed as a serious actor. This movie proved that notion to be very wrong), but the visual effects and realness of it all made me almost feel what it was like to be in an American Armored battalion facing a seemingly unstoppable opponent (for those that don't know, German tanks were considerably more advanced than our own; imagine a fox trying to fight a Bengal tiger). The fear, anger, and bravery of the characters are brought out through the terrific cast and Ayer's outstanding writing.<br/><br/>I would have rated this film a 9/10 had it not been for the slow developing overlying plot; and I, unfortunately, am very picky when it comes to plot development. The first half of the film seems to be an introduction of the characters in order to show their changes in values and relationships during the conflict. There are also a few scenes that I cannot identity a purpose to, other than character development, that are rather uncomfortable and confusing to watch. Overall, ""Fury"" is a great war film that any action and/or drama fan should enjoy thoroughly."
"weelockerbie","9","3","8","6 December 2014"," Best Job I Ever Had
","Fantastic! The best war movie we've had since Saving Private Ryan, and hands down the best tank movie we've ever had. One thing I really liked about this movie is that it never really had a story its just a day in the life of these soilders and their tank. Another thing I really liked about this movie is that it is very realistic and gives you a good depiction of World War 2 and how it changed people. The action in this movie was fantastic and very realistic, and this movie has a high body count. David Ayer did a great job at directing this. The best thing about this movie was the acting, Brad Pitt gave a fantastic performance as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier a man who is the leader of his five-man crew. You can tell that Brad Pitt's character has been through a lot in the war and that the war has changed him and that the war has changed his view on everyday life. Some of the scenes with Brad Pitt's character are very intense and Brad Pitt does a great job in this role and I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for this performance. Logan Lerman also puts in a really good performance as Norman Ellison a young man who is new to the war and you can tell that he doesn't really belong there but as the movie goes on you can see his transformation from a frail kid into a 'drinking, killing machine' as they call him in the movie. Shia LeBeouf is also very good in this as Boyd 'Bible Swan, and I am not usually a fan of Shia LeBeouf but he was really good in this movie. Jon Bernthal was also good in this movie as Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis, and Michael Peña also puts in a good performance as Trini 'Gordo' Garcia. I thought this movie was great and one of the best war movies we've had in a while."

","Fury exposes the harsh realities of World War 2 warfare and life; 'Kill or be killed'.

Intense action and violence, but what more is there to expect from a World War 2 movie? The setting is April 1945, the final push of the Allies into German territory. Outmanned and outgunned Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt) leads his men through the frontline in 'Fury' a Sherman tank, with true leadership and bravery. In the brutal nature of war, we are given an account of the faith shown through Boyd 'Bible ' Swan (Shia La Beouf),as well as the reality of untrained soldiers forced into combat and the conflict of morality and mortality are shown through Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). <br/><br/>Compelling performances from all the cast, Special mention to Pitt, LaBeouf and Lerman who were exceptional.

","So this movie is about the WWII against the Nazi in 1945. This movie represents all the critical situations that likely happen during a war which means David Ayer had hit the nail on the head, he's awesome! The dialog, and the setting are perfectly match to the situations happened in the movie.<br/><br/>The awesome act from Brad Pitt (Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier), Logan Lerman (Norman Ellison), Shia LaBeouf (Boyd ""Bibble"" Swan), Michael Peña (Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia), and John Bernthal (Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis) are the main point in the movie, so do others casts' stunning act. <br/><br/>The score I gave to this movie is 9 out of 10 because the ending, how the SS Army (enemy) was beaten wasn't told in the movie, so I'm kind of curious. The end of the movie is clear but a little unsatisfying. ""Fury"" was the last tank standing in the battlefield and when all of its' owners dead, Norman Ellison is exception, I feel kind of sad and mad at the same time. <br/><br/>There are a few lesson we could take from this movie. 1)""War never ends quietly"" ---> There's no use of war 2)""You or him?"" ---> to keep on living you sometimes have to put other people aside 3)""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"" 4)Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier took care of all his squad like a father, he looks on them like his own family. If you watch carefully, he always like sacrifices himself for the troops. (In the end part of the movie, he even took the ammunitions stock when Fury was surrounded by the enemy troops just to save all of his squad inside the Fury save.) 5)I forget to mention that Boyd ""Bibble"" Swan still remember to pray even during the darkest time!"

","""Fury"" is one of the best World War movies I've seen in recent times. And I feel most of the credits should be given to the director of photography, the team behind the movie's splendid special effects and the movie's sound design department. The war sequences have been captured in a jaw-dropping manner and the consequent sounds that would reverberate across the theater every time a bomb would be dropped or a shot would be fired from a gun or a tank were enough to transport the audience to the ""other side"" of the screen right amidst all the action. <br/><br/>This movie didn't exactly need a superstar to carry it on his shoulders. However Brad Pitt's stardom is like the icing on the cake. A lot of people including me, came to watch the movie just because his name was associated with the movie. Little did I expect that there was so much more to this movie than just Brad Pitt. Having said that, Brad Pitt as an actor in this movie, has done a marvelous job. He plays Wardaddy and his job is to command the Sherman tank named 'Fury' well behind enemy lines so that he can annihilate as many German soldiers as possible . He is this adamant guy who is hell-bent on winning the war for his country.<br/><br/>The actors who play the other 4 soldiers in the tank have done a commendable job in assisting Pitt's character every now and then. But amongst the 4 of them, actor Logan Lerman shines the most. With this movie he has taken his acting to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The movie keeps you engaged from the very first scene right until the end. Please do not watch this movie for the sake of Brad Pitt. Watch this movie for its cinematography. So go to the movie theater, sit back and be assured that you will be taken on a journey back in time to April 1945."

This film sees a group of five soldiers in a tank in WW2 as they attempt to survive a suicide mission. Now Brad Pitt leads this film and he does really well in his role as the commander of the tank, combining the real brutal war aspect and the caring commander and he was great in this role. The supporting cast also did a really good job in their roles, I do like a comeback and Shia Labeouf is great in this film with his character having good layers to him and I hope he gets more work as he is a good actor. Logan Lerman is the character that we are meant to connect too as he has no experience in war like us and we really feel sorry for him in this situation. Michael Pena also does a good job in this role and he combines the seriousness and comedy very well and probably the best out of all the crew. The one downside the last character is an absolute douche bag, with him being unbearable at times treating Lerman's character as a piece of dirt and at times he just went too far. The story is bad with their being really no story and the acting and fact that it is in WW2 is all that they thought was necessary without giving us an interesting story. The script is really good with the war buddies dialogue feeling right for the film and feeling natural to the actors. The style of this film is awesome with the tank scenes being awesome and exciting and being the best part of the film by far. This is a great film that is definitely worth seeing."

","Fury is written and directed by David Ayer and stars Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and John Bernthal. Set over a two-day period towards the conclusion of WWII, it is the story of a battle-hardened U.S armored tank division fighting through German lines.<br/><br/>The film begins in the aftermath of a battle where a small tank platoon has suffered the loss of one of their drivers. We are introduced to the crew of the Sherman tank named Fury led by the charismatic, yet reserved, Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt), deeply religious Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia Labouf), fast talking driver Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Pena) and the bully of the unit, Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (John Bernthal).<br/><br/>On the unit's return to base, their fallen comrade is replaced with raw recruit, Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). Ellison is only a typist with basic tank driving skills and has never seen a day of battle in his life. Wardaddy's unit has no patience for rookies. The unit is then sent on a mission to hold down a crossroad against larger German forces armed with superior artillery.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance is mostly reminiscent of a previous WWII film, Inglorious Basterds. Like his character in Quentin Tarantino's revenge fantasy, Pitt as Wardaddy is a commanding presence with a total disdain for his enemies. Michael Pena as Gordo repeatedly cracks jokes even at the darkest of times. Shia LaBouf's performance as god-fearing 'Bible' steers clear of the overly religious character trope. John Bernthal's performance as the tank's loader is well executed but he portrays him as an unlikable bully who's as brutish as he is reckless. Logan Lerman is impressive but his character's development from a raw recruit to a war-hardened warrior is underwhelming.<br/><br/>Most war films portray their characters as people we can support and want to see survive, but Fury's main characters do not fit this mold. Wardaddy's unit is voracious and has no regard for the enemies they kill. Fury's cast is reminiscent of the characters in HBO's Iraq war miniseries, Generation Kill. Like Generation Kill, Fury has a strong 'war is hell' message and portrays its characters as self-proclaimed, war- hardened warriors who view war as just a job. <br/><br/>Ellison is the only character we relate to. He is fearful and reluctant to fight even when he needs to. There is a scene when he hesitates to fire during an ambush and after which Wardaddy disciplines him by forcing him to execute a Nazi prisoner of war. From this point on, Fury makes it clear; there are no heroes in war. This is not your typical war movie. Fury feels realistic but is still like any other action film, but with the addition of intense and grinding tank battles.<br/><br/>In the end I didn't feel as though Fury matched the themes of heroism and sacrifice like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. After watching these men go through so much turmoil, I expected a stronger sense of brotherhood between the characters. It's not to say the rest of the movie is a disappointment. Fury delivers on chaotic action-packed battles and what feels like an insider's look into what a real WWII tank platoon would have been like."

","Can't recall if I've ever seen a WWII movie about a tank before, so in my mind that's the first thing about Fury that makes this movie cool. <br/><br/>Forget about Brad and Shia, the tank itself is a superstar, and watching it go into battle was amazing. <br/><br/>The dramatic acting in this movie is also unique in the fact that most WWII movies speak of this part if our history in the most shinny light possible. It was the last completely justified war we ever had. Maybe if I saw this movie 20 years ago or it was made 30 years ago, it would not bother me so much the realization of the solders who have made all Germans, solders or civilians, their mortal enemies.

"writers_reign","7","3","8","24 October 2014"," Rhymes With Jury ...
","... which is still out as I write this. Clearly writer-director has either no concept of or else no respect for Back Story, for he gives us a leading who is American and 1) fluent in German and 2) has a pathological hatred of Germans to the extent that he practically orgasms each time he kills one - or, in most cases - several. At one point he speaks of killing Germans in North Africa, Italy, France, Belgium and now - it is April, 1945 - in Germany itself. This makes it reasonable to assume he either enlisted or was conscripted around January, 1942 and thus has been a US soldier for roughly three and a half years; it would not be too difficult for a reasonably intelligent person to acquire SOME German in that amount of time and under those circumstances but not to become fluent. The character is not depicted as someone intellectually gifted or even someone who has been to college so we must assume German parentage or at least a fairly strong German connection. In the same way a soldier who has spent three and a half years in active combat will have presumably seen several comrades killed in action and may well develop an intense dislike of the enemy but again this would likely draw the line at pathological hatred. Four of the five-man crew of the tank have been together since North Africa yet none of the others displays the same hatred. In addition these men are Americans not English and the Germans never invaded or bombed America. It would be much more logical and credible for an American serviceman to hate the Japanese who actually destroyed the US fleet in a cowardly and clandestine attack than the Germans. These cavils to one side the film is well made and well acted with even a clumsy attempt to show another side of the lead character. At one point this man and his assistant driver enter a house inhabited by two nubile German women (albeit one is played by a Roumanian actress). The commander encourages his assistant and the younger of the girls to take themselves off into the bedroom and in response to the raised eyebrows of the older girl he says 'they are young, and alive'. He makes no attempt to molest the older girl and when, some time later, the other three members of the tank crew turn up and clearly intend to rape one or both of the girls he makes it clear they will answer to him if they do so. Ayers seems to be saying that 1) war is essentially pointless - in April, 1945 the war was, to all intents and purposes, over, with one month to go, yet instead of throwing in the towel and losing gracefully, the remnants of the German army fight on as though there was still everything to play for - and 2) that war is not only brutal but it also brutalises those who take part in it. Chances are both things are true but we have, Mr. Ayers, known that for some time now."

","Greetings again from the darkness. When a filmmaker takes on WWII, he better have something new to say or a new way to show it. Director David Ayer (highly recommend his End of Watch, 2012) literally takes us inside a Sherman tank with its crew of 5 men, including their leader played by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Having the tank as a centerpiece brings a level of claustrophobia to the treacherous German war front. The battle scenes are excruciatingly tense, and actually beautifully filmed. This may seem an odd description for a war movie, but bouncing from inside the tank to the German countryside is done with such style that it provides contrast to the brutality and violence of war.<br/><br/>Pitt's crew is made up of Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal (especially good). They are forced to take on a rookie with no tank training ... but he can type 60 words per minute. Logan Lerman plays the rookie and he brings the natural sensitivity we've come to expect from his roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Noah. We buy off on the difficult transition since the others have fought campaigns together in Africa, Belgium and France.<br/><br/>What works here are the battle sequences. What doesn't really work are the numerous moments of personal drama injected to help us understand how war can change a man ... no matter how hard he tries to hold on to his humanity. The sequence with the two German women, a piano and fried eggs seems especially drawn out and unbelievable. We understand the point pretty quickly, but the extended sequence becomes quite awkward.<br/><br/>The most interesting question the movie asks is whether a soldier can be so disgusted and sick of war, yet somehow addicted to the action. Mr. Ayers previously wrote U-571 (2000), so he is clearly interested in the mentality of soldiers in a claustrophobic setting. More of this approach would have been welcome here."

","Caught this movie on cable TV last night. Seems to me that the makers of this film went to a lot of expense(that working Tiger tank alone probably costs a bundle)to portray an average Allied tank crew on it's journey through Europe. The point? The flaws I saw: Sherman tanks did not have muzzle brakes on their guns unless they had been modified by the British and called FireFlies. They employed an 17pdr. gun which could have penetrated that Tiger tank. No commander would have sent armor ahead without infantry support for the reason seen at the end.<br/><br/>""Fury"" ran over a mine and was disabled. Yet, the guy sent up that same road to look out nor that ""company"" of Germans stepped on a mine. Why would they hide inside the tank, knowing full well at least 1 German would look inside. Hide inside the house or out in that field until the Germans go by."

","I expected more from the movie but more turned out to be less.<br/><br/>It's really a ""last stand"" story except that in the Spring of 1945 American tankers weren't making much of a last stand. That's the way the movie presents it. But the real 7th Cavalry was the Wehrmacht, who were just about out of everything except boys and old men, fanatic SS troops, and great big-assed Tiger tanks that our M-4 Shermans couldn't hope to cope with, despite the newer model having been up-gunned and despite there being far more Shermans than Tigers. <br/><br/>We also had air superiority and a vast advantage in artillery, so we were plowing our way through a nearly spent Germany. Yet that doesn't stop the movie from turning It's a grim story, all rain, muck, and mud, and a Sherman tank with ""FURY"" painted on the barrel. That barrel was part of a high-velocity 76 mm. cannon, which was an improvement over the earlier variant's 75 mm. But the movie doesn't explain any of that because that's not where it wants to go.<br/><br/>And that raises the question of where the movie DOES want to go. My answer is firm. I don't know.<br/><br/>It's another CGI extravaganza but not that much of an improvement over the ""Great Tank Battles"" that can be seen on YouTube. Brad Pitt is the tank commander and he's a pretty lousy guy who commits war crimes and tells the newly arrived audience proxy member to go screw a German girl they've discovered in an abandoned house. ""If you don't take her in the bedroom, I will."" Improbably -- IMPOSSIBLY -- she seems to fall in love with him after one roll in the hay, and after these five greasy aliens have occupied her shabby flat and eaten her food.<br/><br/>Pitt's main characteristics, aside from his authoritarianism and sadism, is his desire to kill Germans. In the end it leads to the death of all the crew members but one.<br/><br/>The supporting crew members are grimy stereotypes: the Bible-thumping gunner, the Latino driver, and the drawling Southern loader. The junior soldier is a greenhorn clerk redirected into tank service as the assistant gunner. He gets a swift, wide-eyed education in warfare while desperately trying to survive and integrate with his unwelcoming, veteran crew mates.<br/><br/>One of the crew -- I forget which -- is given an especially repulsive appearance and demeanor. He slobbers freely. He has a distinctive and very ugly haircut. I had a feeling that the director and the make up folks would love to have shaved his head bald and given him a Goth tattoo but even THEY realized that it might give the game away.<br/><br/>Well -- a virtue of the movie. You get a better feel for the crowded, painted, steel interior of the tank that I've seen in any other movie.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if you need a mindless adrenalin fix, this is probably the answer."

","What a strange film! I've seen some great war films and some dire ones, but also some strange ones too, just like this. And what to make of it? Some of the battle scenes were pretty good, especially the battle against the German Panza tank, which was directed quite well, but other battle scenes were bonkers unrealistic. The final battle was ridiculous. Will someone please fire one of those RPG/Bazooka shells out of the box? Will you stop rushing the tank with bayonets, for God's sake, and so on... And then the lad escaping through the lower hatch, getting detected and not being rooted out, punched to little bits and killed by the mad angry Germans who had just lost an entire battalion. I don't know why film directors sometimes treat their audiences like wozacks, but this one did in droves.<br/><br/>There were some really good bits though. All the soldiers looked battle-hardened and up for it. The scenery was great, as well as the costumes and other effects being very realistic, but then we're treated to the clichés, the odd scenes of potentially-about-to-be-raped German girl falling in love with the boy soldier because he plays piano music and beds her very nicely, I guess, and all the other bizarre scenes and other bits taken from Saving Private Ryan, but not done too well, I guess we've got to take it with a pinch of salt. And see the humour in it.<br/><br/>And then, the bizarre cinematography, switching between a boys face, an overhead burning tank, the boys face again, and so on... much like a TV sitcom, badly switching in and out due to lack of camera panning options. It felt really cheap and badly done. It bemused me. And not forgetting the Star Wars laser fire, with streams of pink and blue light emitting from various gun emplacements and entrenched battlements. So weird.<br/><br/>The final battle scene should have been a parody, much like the German war propaganda featurette involving the sniper, from Inglorious Basterds, but this isn't a Tarantino film, but dead serious! And when all the Germans regularly fire and miss, even at close range... forget it, it's not worth your money, time, etc.<br/><br/>The overall ratings for 'Fury' are obviously rigged, because this film isn't anywhere near a 7.6 out of 10. But it's still quite entertaining, sometimes in a Battlefield Earth, so awful it's quite good sort of way."

Also, it's customary while marching to a designated area or enemy to send scouts (as when Norman went in his scout mission), but 400 Germans couldn't figure the importance of sending scouts so they can examine the presumed tank wreck. The battle is 100% sci-fi. 5 troopers wiped out an entire platoon, and the Germans couldn't figure how to use their own anti-tank weapons, but instead they start shooting bullets even when every American was in tank. The dump SS officer release a flare so that every German is now visible, even when it's better for the (S-S) to fight in the dark against a blind target. a dump SS sniper couldn't even take a slow moving target fatally, instead he fired 3 round , not to kill him in the end. when the tank position is overrun, another (S-S) dump soldier open the tank and look inside entering his whole head to be shot by the inside, at least he can fetch a grenade and throw it inside or pointing his gun at the inside of the tank. not to mention the speech from the German officer to his soldiers before running. and that strange SS soldier who let Norman live by not telling anyone that he is hiding beneath the tank.

","This film is supposed to display the horror of the bloodiest war in history, through the experiences of a tank crew who are on their final march inside Germany.<br/><br/>The director tries to immerse the audience to the psychological aspect of land warfare, by including numerous violent,raw scenes and by contrasting the cynical, almost inhumane attitude of the battle hardened veteran tankies, to that of a naive, young replacement whose moral values pose a threat to the safety of the entire crew. Although the film does move the audience, it goes a long way and loses its balance. If you 're interested in something truly realistic about WW2 (close to the band-of-brothers series), this movie is probably going to leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>The focus is almost exclusively on the dark side of the tank crews, who are presented as if they were already soul-burned by their year-long campaign in western Europe. It almost completely disregards the fact that these events were taking place about a month before the end of the war, when most of these guys had a high morale and just wanted to come home.<br/><br/>There are some cool scenes, like the one with the Shermans vs Tiger, but most fail to convey the tactics and ferocity of the battles that took place. The closing one, which is also the lengthiest, is a big disappointment and reminds me of old-Hollywood-movie-style scenes which depict completely ridiculous actions of bravery and self sacrifice in the face of an all-evil, blatantly incompetent, but vastly superior in numbers enemy. Did the plot writer forget that these events where taking place in 1945, when the Nazis were seriously and hopelessly outnumbered? Sure, there had been instances of 5 guys against 200, but no sane allied crew would ever choose to sacrifice themselves when they had nothing important to defend, an easy alternative to survive and especially when they knew that the war was almost over. Furthermore, the Nazis in this scene are presented as mindless puppets for target practice.<br/><br/>Overall it's a movie worth watching, but don't expect too much from it."

"caseynicholson","5","3","9","12 November 2014"," A Bit More Intense Than I Had Imagined
","I saw ""Fury"" on Veterans Day this year, and while it was a well made movie, it certainly left me with a different experience than I had imagined. <br/><br/>Most of that is my own fault. When I first saw the previews, I had taken the film to be a rip off of the Marvel Comics series, ""Sgt. Fury & His Howling Commandoes"". The classic comic series features a tough-as-nails army sergeant, Nick Fury, who leads a company of colorful characters in thrilling adventures during World War II. The trailer for ""Fury"" gave me the impression that Brad Pitt was going to be a Nick Fury type of character, and that Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman and the rest were to be the equivalent of the ""Howling Commandoes"". <br/><br/>This only made sense, given that comic book movies are so popular these days, and given that it seems Marvel won't be diving into the WWII origins of Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Marvel's Fury anytime soon. <br/><br/>That said, I went into the film imagining it to be a lighthearted army movie, something more along the lines of ""Top Gun"" than ""Saving Private Ryan"". Or, perhaps something akin to the first Marvel Studios ""Captain America"" movie, which was set in WWII. I'm sure that Pitt's more lighthearted portrayal of an American WWII soldier in ""Inglorious Basterds"" also influenced my expectation. <br/><br/>""Fury"" is nothing like any of that. Instead, what we have here is a modern day John Wayne movie, one in which any perceived comedy only serves to add flavor to the grisly character of the film. The movie is not quite as intense as some in its genre (""Saving Private Ryan""; ""We Were Soldiers""), but it certainly leaves one with more of a ""war is hell"" type of feeling than any lighthearted, patriotic type of vibe. <br/><br/>In fact, there is a sense in which I might compare it with the classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", the 1930 protest film (based on the book of the same name) which underscores the horrors of war while balancing them against the romanticized version of war that we too often associate with.<br/><br/>The big question is whether the movie was good or bad. It's hard to explain how I feel about this film. Does the John Wayne hero thing mix well with the ""war is hell"" type of vibe? I'm still asking that question. Parts of the movie were very unsettling for me, including its climax. The last twenty minutes of the film certainly made for good cinema, and yet they also focused on a prolonged battle that was an odd mix of the war-is-hell vibe and a feel good movie, which didn't quite fit the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Logan Lerman's performance was stellar, and I might even say that Lerman saved the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say the movie is worth viewing, but do prepare yourself for a more intense experience than the previews suggest."
"calle_2565","6","3","9","30 October 2014"," Seems like any other war movie...
","I haven't seen EVERY war movie ever made, I've seen a lot of them. And just one mans opinion here, but I don't know what to think.<br/><br/>The scenery is great, classic world war II scenery (has been done a TON of times). And the story is your typical band of brothers squad, you have your messed up in the head character, your overly religious character, your emotionally scarred leader, a innocent young man and a Mexican (that's about it, his character is just for exposition, handle the gun and saying Spanish words and being ""suave"" with German women. And he is just as messed up about the war as anyone else in the group). This time it is a tank squad, which offer great and intense action scenes. I really like the camera work and the sound during the fights, sometimes they can be a bit overbearing. But hey, that just puts you in the action more. So I don't mind it since I see a purpose for it.<br/><br/>The portray of world war II is also basic, you have the weathered soldiers that's fed up with everything and the naive young man that thinks there is a peaceful way out. And I can't say what could've been done instead since this is what you'd expect a war situation to be like. But the problem that I have with it is that it's been done SO many times before. Not breaking any new ground in my humble opinion, but that doesn't make it an unentertaining movie.<br/><br/>And who can forget the ever present patriotism and the new wave of film to use musical sounds to make sure that you know what is going on. Seriously, who DOESN'T think that the Nazis are terrible people when you show the people they've hanged for refusing to fight for Germany (or every other thing they did during the war and before that, goes without saying though)? You don't need to use musical sounds to make sure the audience can feel the tension of a scene, war is intense. It doesn't need constant musical accompany, because the imagery is tense as it is. Subtlety would've been the more effective route. Now it just feels like another winners tale of the world war II movie.<br/><br/>Also, one last thing. At the end, where one of the squad members is hiding from the Nazis. They should've just shot him, when you build up the Nazis as these ultra bad guys you could at least try something different. That ONE soldier that suddenly gains a conscience, at the END of the movie. Give me a break. Yeah, yeah, the humanity and not everyone is bad thing. But the guy KILLED hundreds of your army friends, and you're just gonna let him go? Yeah right...<br/><br/>Watch it for the cool action, camera work and sounds. But it's not groundbreaking, and definitely not 8/10."
"ceidt","5","3","9","20 October 2014"," ""The Slow and the Furious""
","I went to see ""Fury"" a few days ago and am just now realizing how much I really remembered. Especially since I tried to forget it.<br/><br/>*Minor SPOILERS ahead* If you're looking for a reminder that war is hell and tough guys are tough because they are desensitized so much that they have become awful human beings, look no further than ""Fury.""<br/><br/>For me, the defining scene, the longest one, felt even longer given the director used it almost as the centerpiece to the film. This was where Brad Pitt and the ""good"" kid played house with a couple of German cousins. We trust them at this point in the film. Then, heavily suggesting consensual rape, the women had to then cook for the soldiers, and for no reason a great sense of dread came when the others joined in. They proved to be bullies and horribly juvenile, so much so that I expected Brad Pitt to put a bullet through their heads (he didn't, because he's one of them). Instead, he just spit at his fellow American soldier, which, I felt, was an insult to all American soldiers because of the way they are portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>What I was expecting was a film about camaraderie and survival when it was almost anything but. The film turned into the feel-bad movie of the season seemingly trying to be a ""day-ruiner,"" if you asked me, not because of the depressing colors or downer ending (okay, there's actually a somewhat hopeful ending), but because we're supposed to care about these characters.<br/><br/>To this movie's credit, the pacing was well done, only slowed down by one aforementioned scene. The music, by Stephen Price, was really good and moody and any intensity in the flick owes itself to his score. This is the man who made ""Gravity"" such a memorable experience. The action, random as it was, had graphic images spliced in that did add a great level of realism, as did the dialogue which felt authentic. The scenes built towards a climax that I would have preferred been the focus of the movie, if only because I didn't understand Brad Pitt (once again, acting with his haircut) and his motivations of staying with his dead tiger tank and awaiting to ambush a massive German army to march over them. The action itself, however, had me completely distracted by the green-laser-beam effect from the bullets flying by. I thought the special effects guys on the new Star Wars movie were experimenting or something. There was also a great deal of computer-generated explosions that took away from the ""old fashioned film-making.""<br/><br/>Plus, I must say, in the post-""Saving Private Ryan"" world of cinema, making a world war II movie any less unique is a near waste of time for filmmakers and audiences alike."

","Fury follows a bad-ass tank crew and its bad-ass, grizzled, Nazi-hating, SS-killing leader, Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). A new kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the team - pretty much against his better judgement. He's never seen the inside of a tank before and hasn't even fired a gun since basic training. He's quite certain there's been a mistake and just wants to go home.<br/><br/>Norman is a military-trained typist. An excellent, experienced typist; 60-words a minute he can go. A worthwhile skill to have when you've got a superior officer dictating a memo, but does it work when you've got an entire division of Nazis shooting at you? Not exactly. Norman is teased relentlessly, and mercilessly slapped around by Wardaddy because he refuses to kill anyone. Norman's crewmates believe he'll get them all killed one day, and there's plenty of opportunity for that. Wardaddy is well respected by the Oldman (Jason Isaacs, whom you won't even recognize) and it's Wardaddy's crew that always get the call when there are Nazi's that need killing or Allies that need rescuing; a task that Wardaddy ruthlessly, and violently, carries out with gusto and a 'take no prisoners' attitude.<br/><br/>Fury shows the horrors of war quite explicitly. There is enough blood and gore in this movie to make any horror film make-up artist blush. I'm confident in saying that the actions displayed on screen in Fury happened in real life during the war - during any war - even though this particular story is fiction. It's that realism that makes this film sometimes hard to watch. 'War is hell' to quote William Tecumseh Sherman. Everything is so realistic and so genuine it's nauseating.<br/><br/>I began to hate Brad Pitt as this movie went on. He plays quite a jerk. You'll hate him too (if you don't already for some other reason). Same with Jon Bernthal (that's the guy who played Shane in The Walking Dead). He's a creepy war machine without a conscience. Shia LaBeouf plays a depressed bible-quoting, war-weary soldier, and you know something else, he's really good in this role! I was surprised, actually, because of, you know, his frequent meltdowns I figured he just went crazy and stopped acting. His character is a troubled and emotional young man, so it's not too far from reality (and the cut on his right cheek is real and self-inflicted prior to filming the movie). Logan Lerman is awesome. He's come a long way since The Butterfly Effect (2004), and I much prefer to see him in an intense role like this, surrounded by so much talent. Lerman feeds off the other actors and you can see it.<br/><br/>Sound mix is awesome, so is the cinematography (same guy who shot Suicide Squad and End of Watch). There is a good scene when some tanks get into a battle with some stubborn Nazis. There is one shot in particular that is awe-inspiring. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. It's quite stunning. I don't use the term 'awe-inspiring' very often.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie, watch it when you can."

Terrible and real face of the ww2 is depicted with some excellent directing and impressive acting. I had a feeling that I was with them in the tank. Scenes are brutal, surreal and disturbing.

","I came across this movie after seeing Logan Lerman in ""Indignation"". For such a young actor, Lerman is extraordinarily gifted. In fact, I knew nothing about Logan until I happened upon ""Indignation"" (quite by accident, actually).<br/><br/>""Fury"" is powerful, but gut-wrenching. The horrors of war and the losses that occur in war are portrayed with gravity. The end is not what I was expecting, giving it all the more merit. Brad Pitt is superb in a role I might never have expected for him. ""Fury"" has guts. It is coarse, delivering a strong and at times a disturbing reality of what we humans do to one another in such settings. ""Fury"" is not for the weak of heart.<br/><br/>After reading some of the reviews posted here, I may be on the short straw. But, I really like this movie because of its intensity. I may watch it again to see what I might have missed the first time.<br/><br/>I must say once again that Logan Lerman is powerful as ""Norman"". I suspect his character reached me because I was only 18 one month before joining USAF (that was 1962). I was not in combat, but in overseas remote site Intel. I came of age in the Air Force. Lerman's character ""Norman"" speaks to me. Those days of youthful, moral righteousness and steadfast honesty are a dim memory. Like ""Norman"", I hardened."

","There is a part of the movie where the heroes come up against overwhelming odds and the leader decides to stay and tells his men to go but the men go, ""Nah, we stay with you"" as the emotional music plays in the background. Checkbox checked.<br/><br/>Besides this cliché and a few others about how bad war is, there is unfortunately not a whole lot to this movie. ""What is this movie about?"" someone will ask. ""About a tank crew,"" I would answer. ""What does that crew do?"" ""They kill a bunch of Germans."" The sacrifice made by the main characters does not feel like it's for something. Many of the events and much of the dialogue feel forced, like the movie is looking for something of substance to add or make things seem more awesome than they are.<br/><br/>The good part about this film is how well it is made overall. The camera work is solid. You can tell what's going on and there are plenty of epic shots. The music is epic too. It has that classic instruments foundation but it is layered with good atmospheric effects. The action feels weighty, despite the battles being fairly small scale. There is at least one really cool tank fight.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Of course, with Brad Pit at the lead you pretty much guaranteed a solid performance but his support crew area all doing a good job as well. The Mexican character played by Michael Peña is funny but not so funny as to be overbearing. As with the rest of the movie, unfortunately there is nothing special about these guys. The naive noobie gunner at the center of the film is a walking stereotype of that type of character. The others are kind of blank. There is a scene that feels like it serves to give more background to the rest of the tank crew but it does not deliver a whole lot.<br/><br/>Is it a very realistic war film? Well it has a scene or two that treat the enemy with a lot of respect and show the dirt of war, but the film can't help but revert to the super hero Americans theme we have grown sick of.<br/><br/>Maybe in the end we need more movies that aren't about something. Meaningful epic movies have in themselves become a cliché. This film flows logically, looks good and doesn't overstay its welcome. If you are interested in World War II or in tanks then this is a must see."
"ognjen-e","5","2","5","14 February 2016"," Visually spectacular, yet implausible
","In this short review I'd like to point out two levels that I found existent within this movie.<br/><br/>First is the movie's visual spectacularity. If you want to see all the filthy stuff the war is about, you'll surely find it here. Having been set in the final days of WWII, the movie boasts with all the dirt, the mud, the violence and the blood pertinent to its settings. And that is where I find the amusing part of the movie. The visual effects, the combat scenes and the photography in general are done very well. You'll find some very good and exciting fight moments, all-guns-blazing included. In accordance with that, there is plenty of blood bursting out of soldiers falling down in the heat of a battle. Since the main characters are soldiers themselves, stuck deep somewhere in Germany in April 1945, neither their outfits lack dirt, nor the ground they tread on lacks mud. <br/><br/>And now a few words about the second level. The plot and the development of some of its parts are things that spoiled the movie. Generally speaking, the air of patheticism and obvious implausibility become present in the second part of the movie and tend to ruin it irreversibly. For instance, there is a scene of four US tanks fighting in an open field against one German tank. Predictably, the three US tanks are easily busted, but the last one manages to destroy the German tank. In another scene, the lone group of five US soldiers are expecting a German battalion consisting of several hundred well-equipped soldiers. You guess what is coming next - they bravely choose to stay stuck in their damaged tank and to fight the upcoming Germans. The battle starts and it seems it lasts for hours. I've never been a soldier, but I think that any group of three hundred or more armed soldiers could easily overpower a bunch of commandos fortified in an immobile tank.<br/><br/>To conclude the review, this movie will provide a nice, visually engaging piece of action to those who like it, however it (the movie) could be found quite disappointing by those who expect a little bit more than yet another World War II picture."
"nboyer17","5","2","5","31 May 2015"," Fury Flounders
","The WWII film genre is dying. Actually, the entire ""war movie"" genre is dying. Nothing says Hollywood desperation like a WWII tank movie with little else to say besides ""War is hell, kids."" Apparently, this is the first film to use an authentic German Tiger I tank in its production. This will probably remain FURY's only notable distinction as the years pass.<br/><br/>I initially resisted the notion that FURY would be a letdown. After all, Brad Pitt has given a string of admirable performances in the last six years, including INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, which managed to subvert and enliven the war movie genre more successfully than any in recent memory. I was also intrigued by the prospect of Logan Lerman making a departure from his typically subdued fare (see PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER). Not to mention, director David Ayer, of TRAINING DAY renown, sealed the deal for me because I had so enjoyed his 2001 Academy Award winning film. I expected FURY to be as punchy and challenging as TRAINING DAY, but this was a mistaken assumption.<br/><br/>FURY boredly belabors you with every 'shocking' war movie convention in the book. You name it, they got it: civilian casualties, callous slaughters, graphic violence (exploding heads and blasted limbs alike), dehumanization of the enemy, brave, improbable stands, the 'war is a drug' cliché, and the oh-so-familiar progression from innocence to experience. As for plot, FURY seems to deliberately deny any opportunity to find a reason behind the carnage, which might have been an effective strategy had Ayer made this a miniseries.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my greatest grievance with the film. So many of FURY's problems stem from the brevity of its narrative. Over no more than a handful of days, we observe young Lerman's transformation from an inept typist to a gung-ho Nazi hater unflinchingly gunning down hordes of Germans. Accelerated, stilted characterization plagues Lerman's admittedly impassioned performance. There seems to be little to no transition from Lerman the coward to Lerman the killer, and no time for him to grow on the rest of the crew, who warm to him at an unbelievable rate. Had the events of the film been stretched over ten hours, Ayer could have achieved more conviction in the bonds between the brothers in arms, more catharsis at the conclusion. As it stands, FURY is ludicrously contrived because of how quickly everything progresses.<br/><br/>The sole exception to this observation is an extended sequence between Pitt, Lerman, and two German women which creates a catastrophic hiccup in the film's pacing. It also makes for some extreme awkwardness, as Lerman finds himself a fifteen minute lover in the form of a somewhat-unwilling, somewhat-inviting German civilian girl. It's hard to say what Ayer felt he accomplished with this sequence: the women are unfortunately submissive, and the men aggressively misogynistic. Ayer makes no attempt to rationalize why these women are so accommodating, or why Pitt's seemingly upright character would torture these women with a simultaneously foreboding and unthreatening set of gestures. Why keep his men from raping the women if he turned a blind eye to Lerman's fling behind closed doors? The explanation might be as simple as ""war is hell."" War changes people. And if that's all Ayer had to say, he could have completely eliminated the scene and lost nothing. In an attempt to remark on the moral ambiguity of the American soldiers, Ayer jeopardized my sympathies in his protagonists and disrupted the flow of his film, which was already bland.<br/><br/>I would say that FURY should have been better, but it would probably be more accurate to concede that FURY is what it is: a ham-handed retread (pun intended) of the familiar formula of grit, horror, loss, disillusionment, and redemption that so many better films have already defined. Ayer's vision of war is stultifying monotony, interrupted by the occasional burst of ludicrousness. If you're looking to see a workmanlike Pitt performance, you could do worse, but don't expect to be surprised or impressed by FURY."

"tomgillespie2002","4","2","5","13 March 2015"," Will remind you of every war film ever made
","It's highly likely that David Ayer's Fury will conjure memories of Saving Private Ryan (1998). It will also bring to mind The Wild Geese (1978), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and just about every World War II movie ever made. It's also hard to shake off the idea that Brad Pitt is not playing Aldo Raine, his drawling, neck-scarred leader of a band of Nazi hunters in Quentin Tarantino's excellent Inglourious Basterds (2009). Although Fury is certainly not lacking in spectacle and decent performances, it just doesn't come up with any ideas of its own, stumbling along a wafer-thin narrative and getting lost on its way to try and figure out what type of film it wants to be.<br/><br/>We are in the climatic days of the war, with the U.S. deep into Germany territory, and the crew of 'Fury', an M4A3E8 Sherman tank, long battle-worn. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Pitt) is a hard man (we first meet him knocking a German soldier from his horse and stabbing him to death), but he struggles dealing with the horrors he has witnessed. With a crew member dead in their latest fight, rookie Norman (Logan Lerman), a kid who has never fired a gun or experienced combat, is plucked from his typing duties and thrown into Fury. The crew, consisting of bible-bashing gunner, er, Bible (Shia LaBeouf), token Hispanic driver Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena), and scumbag mechanic Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal), don't take too kindly to the new arrival.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Fury is that it hints at potential brilliance. The underlying theme seems to be that war turns men into animals, and in one stand-out scene in which Wardaddy takes Norman into the home of two German women so he can lose his virginity, only to be interrupted by his crew and a drunken, vulgar Coon-Ass, manages to create an atmosphere of tension and discomfort. The battle scenes look very impressive too. Bullets fly across the screen like lasers, and one set-piece involving a squad of Sherman facing a superior German Tiger tank is exciting, but the film is often too eager to revel in gore and flying body parts.<br/><br/>Fury spends so much time giving us blood, guts and loud noises that it forgets to give us any resemblance of a plot to hang onto. It also gets so lost in trying to hammer home how damaged these men have become than it doesn't allow us to get to know the characters on any deeper level than their primary personality trait, ticking off a check-list of war movie clichés on its way. It all builds up to a ridiculous climax that pitches Fury against a 300-strong company of SS panzergrenadiers, who all proceed to jog gleefully into a hail of machine-gun fire like many a faceless video game baddie. It manages to insult both the German army and the audience's intelligence. We are given little to make us sympathise with the Americans apart from the fact that they aren't Nazi's, so come the emotions at the end, it's difficult to care at all.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"peterwink","4","2","5","8 March 2015"," Brad shoulda been in a wheelbarrow
","This is a poor 1 dimensional clichéd film that contains good action & good effects. Not since John Wayne was pushed about in a wheelbarrow after dropping into France screaming ""cut them down, cut them down"" has there been a more incredible lead character in what purports to be a serious war movie. The Germans are portrayed as dopey cannon fodder who just walk onto machine gun fire, whilst in reality they were a highly professional fighting force who despite overwhelming odds on several fronts managed to put up organised resistance & avoid defeat until the bitter end. Where this film missed a trick was not to examine the subtext to that situation and the difficulties for the allies in dealing with that. War is never as cut and dried as this. There is no doubt the Nazi regime was evil & their exercise of warfare was ruthless and chillingly efficient, however this poorly constructed tale of a bunch of clichéd multicultural misfits led by a bilingual philosophising sociopath is too incredible to be classed as a serious war movie like ""Enemy at the Gate"" or even the very recent '71, movies that are deeper & far more credible than this one."
"sissonsk-550-381706","8","2","5","17 February 2015"," Decent war film
","I've read a lot of the negative reviews from the ""armchair"" generals out there. What these people forget is that this film takes place in the very last days of the war. Germany did not have the resources that it had just a year earlier. The German military was scraping the bottom of the barrel and the people it had left to execute the war were far from the professionals that fought years earlier. Apparently, panzerfaust were not that accurate. Anti-tank guns manned by frightened old men and boys were more likely to miss their targets than hit them. German tanks were not that reliable to begin with and one that hadn't proper maintenance wasn't going to perform well. It's the end of the war. Even the feared Waffen SS wasn't anywhere as good as it had been. My point is that you have to stop nit picking the ""mistakes"" in this film to get anything out of it. I liked the film because of its portrayal of the brutality of war. It showed US troops committing horrible acts that did happen and more often than you'd think. War is ugly and this film brought this out for all to see. The film was wonderfully shot with the latest technology and the acting wasn't that bad. The new recruit character put the viewer into the film. How would anyone behave if taken from a safe place and tossed into a world where you could get killed and if you didn't do your job, others got killed? Yes the film had clichés in it but you can't make a war film without them. Fury put the clichés together where they told a good story about the horrors of war. <br/><br/>Spoiler: BTW, 300 SS soldiers marching in broad daylight would have been ripped to shreds by the Typhoons, P-47s and P-51s that were continuously patrolling the skies over Germany. So, one could argue that the SS soldiers probably would have never made it to the crossroads to begin with. <br/><br/>With the exception of ""A Bridge Too Far"" US war films are full of inaccuracies and the ""armchair general"" will be waiting a long time to see a fully accurate war film."
"bob-rutzel-1","7","2","5","28 January 2015"," Cinematography wins this good war story
","Tank Commander Sgt Collier (Brad Pitt) is ordered to hold an intersection so the German troops won't get thru. The problem is that the Sherman tank (Fury) is disabled and the Germans are marching their way. This can't be good.<br/><br/>What makes this a good war story is the cinematography. It is better or on a par with all previous war movies we may have liked. No, I changed my mind as I feel it is better than all other war movies. You almost feel like you are there. That is how good the cinematography is. The photography and the details shown are incredible. Kudos.<br/><br/>I kind of wished this was a true story and maybe it did have elements of some true stories. I mean there is nothing new under the sun (except for CGI and Star Trek type stories) and the cinematography and heroics seen gave this impression to me. Also, in the beginning we are told by notes on the screen that the German Army possessed far superior tanks than us and we know our forces will be in for the fight of their lives.<br/><br/>The acting all around was good. No Oscars, but good. The supporting cast (Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal) were spot on and when soldiers kill for a living and don't like anything to get in their way, they have a sort of superior attitude about everything. This showed up in spades. There was some very uncomfortable moments when Sgt Collier and Norman (Logan Lerman) the new guy to the tank crew, find a German woman and her cousin and decide to have dinner with them. Then the rest of the crew find them and well, here we go with the uncomfortable moments with these ""superior"" soldiers. <br/><br/>Downside: The tank is immobilized. The Germans find them. The spare ammo is attached to the outside of Fury. Why is this when they know they will be in the fight of their lives? Whaaat? The Germans fire RPGs and miss. Whaaaat? Germans run in plain sight of Fury so Sgt Collier can mow them down. Whaaaaat? Two hand grenades go into Fury next to Sgt Collier and later we see Sgt Collier intact and not blown up. Whaaaat?<br/><br/>Those were the most glaring errors or mistakes I saw. But this does not take away from the movie as a whole. There is enough tension and suspense to hold you throughout the entire movie. Keep in mind this is a movie for entertainment purposes, but it also shows us the brutality of war. <br/><br/>When the credits run we see footage of soldiers on both sides during WWII. <br/><br/>Again, it is the cinematography that makes this a very good war movie and yes, I did wish this was a true story, and I have to satisfy myself with knowing that some elements were true. (you said that before) (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."

"gnix1979","9","2","5","23 December 2014"," Great movie
","A tale of morality and a tale of duty, that's how I look at Fury. Saving Private Ryan set the standard for all future war movies and Fury does not let down and in some ways raises the bar a little.<br/><br/>Private Ryan these days feels dated even though the opening D-Day beach landing still is awe inspiring in relation to cinematography, but on reflection from that point on up to the end battle, the movie becomes flaky and pointless, trying to put a price on the life of one man over another and justifying the point of the movie for near 60mins.<br/><br/>On the other hand Fury differs in so many ways. Yes it has the dramatic battle scenes like in Private Ryan and boy does it not hold back. Yet it also has a subliminal message about ""Why we fight"", were as Private Ryan tried to use Philosophy at one point, on a number of occasions Fury reminds you of two truths, the first is that the German people are just as much victims of the war, especially the scenes when the Americans enter the town and the sights they see. The second is that there is no glory in war, only duty. We see on a number of occasions the conflict of one mans pacifism and a mans need for duty. You see it in the eyes of the actors, lack of sleep, and no relief, yet they have to do it as its their duty to end the Nazi way of life and to free Europe, it sets the pace of the whole movie. In fact throughout the movie the characters are careful not to taint all Germans with the same label, Normal German soldiers are treated with some respect as prisoners, yet Nazi prisoners are beaten and potentially executed.<br/><br/>I have read a number of posts commenting on the lack of realism in retrospect to combat tank tactics and procedures, its important to remember that this is a movie, like the Omaha beach landing took hours to complete in 1944, it took Tom Hanks less than 30mins. You have to look past that as its not important. I felt that this movie was different as its rare you would see a war movie based in a tank, especially one set in WW2, but it cuts down on the need for large open spaces and cuts to the chase of what's important.<br/><br/>This movie deserves the 9/10 vote I have given it, it fails to get 10 because of certain oversights the director makes at the end such as the fact when the Germans are spotted, they are marking with a weapon called Panzerfauts which is an Anti Tank weapon. Yet in a scene in the final battle they don't seem to have any except some in a box which is made out to be the last they have. This may not seem important but I do prefer proper continuity in movies and this was a bit silly.<br/><br/>Nether the less, love this movie and recommend it to anyone."
"ilovelctr","9","2","5","22 November 2014"," Stuffed with one-liners in dialogue, but beyond a typical war epic if you're keen on battlefield depiction
","First allow me to apologize for not being comprehensive in the title, with which said, there's still a possibility that you'll not be satisfied with the depiction on the war zone if it is run-and-gun fight scenes you're looking for. But if you want to watch something rarely done for the war epic category, i.e. tank battles, the film's a lavish treat.<br/><br/>There isn't much plot involved, so it's rather easy to follow. For audience unfamiliar with American English, you might want to watch it subtitled considering the concise expressions all over the place. It's not the typical affective drama where you get elegant written conversations, which don't even happen during the sequences meant to be touching, and these sequences strike as clichés whenever they do. Sometimes, you may find it much ado to ruin the pace. But on the other hand, due to the convincing performance from Pitt and Lerman, these emotional scenes get you immersed and care about the characters for the obvious charisma these guys carry along, although the storytelling seldom gets you think on the matters deeply. But it is also thanks to the simplicity that there is no ostentation available for criticism, as it never goes to the extent to preach philosophy overly, which makes the film all the more convincing and pleasant to enjoy.<br/><br/>The portrayal of tank battles is definitely the highlight here, partly because of itself being a rarity, standing much oppositely to the more ""conventional"" military gunfights or squad-based missions, and, also because of the cunning depiction which really earns a salute. Apart from the delicately built visual which spares no efforts on casting both grittiness and sumptuosity, the best about the battle scenes are the tactics of each battle which are meticulously planned and displayed; this helps develop the characters by rendering these protagonists intelligent and brave, and undoubtedly shows that their supremacy on the battlefield is credited for the wisdom and bravery flowing exclusively in their blood. Editing has been marvelously done, so has shooting, in such a way they, combined, deliver an unparalleled, unique and brutal representation throughout, accompanied by subtle sound effects that never gets in unwelcome. Every battle is staged with care so that they differ from one another, always offering a new flavour.<br/><br/>To sum up, Fury is well crafted with attractiveness in mind. It's conscientiously tailored via all that's requisite for film-making for all its exquisite actions packed inside, while effectively shunning superfluous CGI's, which if used, might have abased itself. And if you're the kind of audience who doesn't abide by melodramas but desires pure entertainment, Fury is likely to gratify and surprise you with its great merits that make it outstanding."
"cristinamaymi","8","2","5","18 November 2014"," The Passion of Fury
","The Fury (2014) starring Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal was a nonstop emotional roller costar. No more than five minutes could go by in this film without strong emotional and outside struggles completely turning this movie into much more than just another war tale. Following a tank crew in World War II who had just lost one of their own in battle, they pick up a new member who has been thrown into the fight with no battle training at all. As we see the plot unfold around these men, it is clear that there is more than one war being fought in the lives of these soldiers. Sargent Collier (Pitt) is the head of this crew who tries to keep everyone in order physically and emotionally. Although he has gone through a lot, he keeps a brave face on for his men. His seams start to unfold as he takes the newest member Norman (Lerman) under his wing in hopes of opening his eyes to the unbearable world they are forced to live in and fight against. His tactics are harsh and unethical but in the sake of time and the lives of the other soldiers, his methods are seen as necessary. This sort of father son relationship is what really drove the emotion that filled this film. This relationship was held not only with Norman but the rest of the crew as well. The performances that each actor gave struck so deep that it was not difficult at all to get lost in this story and feel as if you were there in the pit of war with them. The constant action was pared with deep personal struggles that kept my attention through out the movie without fail. This fast glimpse into the short lives of these men, was full to the rim with powerful passion and an even stronger fight for life, loyalty and ultimately the kind of love that is only found between a brotherhood of soldiers."

While you may not always agree with decisions made by the main character Brad Pitt the movie is still slick while difficult to watch at times. Watching 'Normans' character also proves difficult as he struggles with his morals and the stark reality of war itself. The final scene may not be a totally realistic one, but does add to the high drama that this movie contains. This movie can be tough to watch, but is compelling none the less. Great entertainment -<br/><br/>a definite go see!"

I went to see it with a friend that was in the army who whispered some interesting facts which enhanced my film experience. It was a complete movie which included young love & action. Brad Pit looks great! I preferred this movie than his other war movie. I thought it would be a guy flick but I was pleasantly surprised. The actors that were chosen were suited for their roles.

","As always, you're going to get reviews by those who loved the film and those who didn't but, if you go by the overall rating, that's usually a reasonable guide. Having missed seeing 'Saving Private Ryan' on the big screen, and reading some good reviews of this film, I was determined to make sure I didn't make the same mistake - and I'm so glad I took the time to do so as it was worth every minute (and pound).<br/><br/>From the opening scene, you are made aware of just how 'realistic' the portrayal of war is going to be and, unless you really are desensitized to extreme violence or approach the film with the wrong attitude (as I strongly suspect some of the more cynical reviewers have done), then you are in for one gut-wrenchingly tense and thrilling experience.<br/><br/>You need to watch this film with the mind-set of the era and the event it is portraying, not trying to judge the story or characters against the mores of today or modern conflict. Some have seen this as a contrived or clichéd movie - but it's neither of those things as long as you keep in mind what the makers are trying to do: show the true horror, brutality, moral-destroying and brutalizing nature of such a conflict.<br/><br/>Set in 1945, many of the characters have already been through several years of terrible war and it's evident from how they behave, doing some heroic things, some tender things, and some things that seem morally reprehensible to us today but that we know - from first-hand accounts - did actually go on.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are incredibly realistic and well-staged and seem to me the closest I've ever come across as to what the experience of a real one must be like (though I've never personally been anywhere near a war, so how could I really know?). I used the term gut-wrenching because that's how I felt during those intense moments. The sheer terror experienced by the crew during one major battle scene part-way through the movie is brilliantly portrayed - and brilliantly acted (despite what some have said) - and will leave you emotionally drained at the end of it. It's a long time since I felt this tense (almost sick with it) watching a film.<br/><br/>So put aside those negative reviews, approach this film with the right attitude, and you will be rewarded. But, hey, that's only my opinion: make your own mind up!!!"

I don't think the film deserves more than an 8. I feel everyone should watch this film at least once. I must add that this film is not meant to be a documentary or be historically accurate, it has been made to depict the horror of war which has been done successfully.

"mceegbert","9","2","5","29 October 2014"," Fury is Not a Film to be Missed (Film Class Review)
","Fury is the remarkable story of five American soldiers who single handedly take on the German army at the end of WWII. David Ayer directed one of the most raw and real depictions of the brutality of war and the closeness of a tank crew ever depicted. This film captures the sense of forged brotherhood that only war can bring about in its grim, bloody and unrelenting terror. The film is an ""in your face"" experience you experience up close every bullet, every explosion, every death; even the claustrophobia of the tank as if you were there. This intense imagery is needed for a film of this measure, so if scenes from Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, U571 or Lone Survivor put you off in any way it is nothing compared to the realism and brutality you witness in this film. Brad Pitt's performance as a ravaged war veteran is outstanding; Shia LaBeouf and Logan Letterman deliver some of the best performances in their careers in this film. You belief in their characters, you relate, and you want them to succeed. The choice of Jon Bernthal for such a crucial character in this film in my opinion was probably the only let down for me in this film. Bernthal delivers a character that he isn't ready for in his career. The acting seems too noticeable and is overall distracting and at some points annoying at how hard he tries to deliver the intensity of the character. However that being said Bernthal's character is balanced out by Michael Pena's performance of the tank driver. Each of these actors give their all in roles in every scene so you believe them every step of the way. Ayer has an extremely keen eye for chemistry on screen and he directs each of these actors to deliver performances that are well beyond anything that could be scripted. The effects and cinematography of this film are a knockout in every sense and I'm sure will earn the film some highly deserved awards. A different user described it best:"" Overall, Fury is a brutal war film that shows war exactly how it should be shown. It's disturbing, it's violent, it's scary. Fury really hits a home run between the sweeping cinematography, the phenomenal performances and the near perfect direction, it is one hell of a film that shouldn't be missed."""

","April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened army sergeant named Wardaddy commands a Sherman tank and her five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Out- numbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. <br/><br/>Fury is written and directed by David Heyre, stars Brad Pitt as the team leader, Logan Lerman, Shia Laboeuf, Michael Pena and Jen Bernthal. David Heyre is a very good director and writer but he has made some not so great movies in the past, I'm especially talking about Sabotage. This film displays another great Nazis killing performances by Brad Pitt, there's this uncompromising composure about him. Logan Lerman is fantastic; he delivers his best performance yet, far from Percy Jackson and way better than Perks of Being a Wallflower. Shia Laboeuf is great as well. You see, I don't really care about the press he had but as an actor he does a really good job in this film. He succeeds to prove that he is a good actor. Keep yourself out of the tabloids and I think you're on your path. Plus the director has been able to create a sort of camaraderie that make you want to root for these guys, they feel like family. Fury is a well-shot standard WWII movie with locked down, fluid pictures, an interesting story and very good action sequences. In fact the action the action is extremely realistic, it does not seem fake at all, this thanks to amazing sound effects. Plus tanks scenes are intense, you really feel like you're actually part of the crew inside it with them. This film grasps the concept that war is ugly, there's nothing heroic about it, there's no medals. This is war, it's all dirty and mainly no one wants to be there. Apparently sometimes to fight monsters you need ass holes. However, the movie doesn't have enough substance around his characters though and is a little bit overstepping his boundaries with religious messages sometimes. <br/><br/>Overall Fury is very well directed and entertaining movie, with very good performances all around and most importantly that displays his point very well: war is ugly and violent. This is an effective war movie."

","Not going to give a big description on the story as most of you know what it's all about. In short this is a rollicking good war movie with 5 men on a tank going about their business as they roll through war-torn Germany in April 1945. It's a film about the futility of war and the coming of age of a young man who joins a tough unit on board a tank. The cast is great with Brad Pitt on a good role of acting choices of late, Shia Labeouf doing his teary-eyed best ( wee bit overdone mate!), Michael Pena providing comic touches & Jon Bernthal doing his quirky bit as an oddball but the real star of the show is Logan Lerman, who is brilliant as young typist turned tank gunner Norman.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are ferocious, gory, thrilling and the film moves quickly from start to finish, David Ayer did a grand job on directing duties and if you want a good war movie of recent times then look no further, also stands up well with a lot of the classics and it's an enjoyable film to boot."
"inspektorr","8","2","5","22 October 2014"," Boiled down review
","Let me just skip the ""the director that brought us this and that"" or ""Pitt delivers a such and such performance"". Everyone already wrote those lines, so I'll just get down to saying what you really want to know.<br/><br/>Is this a good war movie? Yes. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitively a very good film. Experiencing it on a big screen is something I recommend.<br/><br/>There's a LOT of very realistic gore. Heads exploding like pinatas, body parts being taken, rotting bodies everywhere etc. If you're sensitive to this sort of stuff, this is not a movie for you. It's also not a date-movie. With that said, I brought my fiancée along and she liked the movie.<br/><br/>The action is gripping, it really draws you in and the battle scenes are spectacular. I will not say more, but they're definitively some of the best tank battle scenes I've ever seen. Also, the chaotic dynamics of war are pretty realistically displayed. To me it also seemed pretty detailed in historic realism, although I'm sure that trained eyes will probably note that some weapon has a wooden oak handle instead of pine or stuff like that. <br/><br/>Now onto the negatives. There are a couple of ""Murica f*** yeah"" moments, which didn't bother me, but a lot of people burst into sarcastic laughter in my theater. Some of the constant and loooong Bible quotations almost made me expect Samuel L Jackson himself will pop up to deliver the famous Pulp Fiction speech. One or two would be OK. This was over the top. Germans seem to be VERY bad at aiming, refilling their weapons and generally surviving."

","Hollywood's take on war isn't as bad as it sounds!<br/><br/>First and foremost, if you're a stickler for fact and realism, then there will be a few issues, however surely not enough to rate the film 1 star! Americans especially seem to be upset with this portrayal of War, as it shines there heroes as 'bad' at times. I take nothing away from what brave men and women have done throughout history in the name of peace, but the harsh facts are actually mentioned in the film! ""Ideals are great, but more killing is needed to end this war"" ""Kill what's in front of you or be killed and get us killed too"" are snippets from memory, arguing the case for soldiers needing to show harshness to get a job done! The story was created from true memoirs of different veterans that served in tanks. It can't be too far from the truth! There are people like that out there in the world and thank fury because perhaps we'd be Nazi dominated now - Extreme?<br/><br/>Back to the film, the acting is sublime from the main cast, which was always inevitable, the intensity of the whole film is fantastic and leaves you gripping the armchair tightly at times, and feeling a sense of trepidation at others, while the storyline is gripping and fun! <br/><br/>Not so keen on the laser like shooting, but it made it a spectacle I suppose and the love scene was clearly forced in for the love scene box to be checked and break up the action, but overall the the story, acting and filming from within the tanks was top notch and I recommend a watch!"

","A must see in theaters! A raising of the bar for war films. The best war films glorify the warrior and not war. But these warriors are shown, warts and all! Brutal, callous, hateful, merciless. Danger close to rapists and murderers. But war brings out the worse in some men. These men definitely need Jesus! Two of the characters profess Christian belief, the others, not so much! But this film shows the bond men at war have for each other. Slow to accept the newcomer, only weeks in the Army, while the veterans served together for 3 or 4 years, the brutality to the newbie to toughen him up for war is probably hard to watch. The brutality of war, more so. NOT for the squeamish. Profanity is off the charts, but it is to illustrate an aspect of men at war. Definitely not choir boys. Courage and unexpected mercy shown to an enemy shows what few positives can come out of war. One film to see and to own on DVD!"

","What a movie...what a movie - and what a freaking waste of time. First off...I got it. In WWII all US Soldiers were rapists , murderers and thieves. Way to go - gotta love how the elite keeps showing all those guys who put their lives on the line that Tinsel Town respect? Very classy. Pfffft. Insulting. If you wish to witness and speak with the real people who served, and be enlightened by true acts of valor...go to the 'National World War II Museum' in New Orleans. Yes Hollyweirdos, some of these real heroes are still alive - you know the ones - the ones you insist on carelessly dragging through the mud. For a work like this, any of these people would be excellent points of reference of authenticity...as opposed to some trumped up drug induced theory. Oh and that brings to mind, I do have a suggestion. Before misleading the public by mislabeling a product authentic, read some history, research it, take the time to get a true sense of what happened and who was affected...don't just make it up...again very insulting to those who lived it. I can't rehash what others have mentioned about the silliness in this stupid story - like battle-hardened crack SS troops getting their butts whooped, the long drawn out scene with the GIs in the room with the two German women and the cliché, upon cliché, upon cliché. Don't get me wrong,I like some clichés but not in this movie. Remember...according to the director/author, U.S. soldiers were all evil. I have to disagree...I served and so did many family members and friends...some did not come back, and some did...but none of them acted like the animals depicted in this pile of waste labeled, 'Fury.' Alas, at least one good thing came out of sitting through this trip - I will never watch anything by this crowd again."

","No tactical strategies, no true. Commander is not clever. Absurd attack M4- Shermans against Tiger! Hah-Hah!!! Just for war II fantasy lovers :)) German panzer divisions were at full strength, and win some U.S. softly divisions. It was providing a great advantage for the Germany. The Americans scared and started to introduce the M4A3E8 variant, with improved suspension and a high-velocity 76 mm gun as used on the tank destroyers :))<br/><br/>The Tiger II was the successor of the Tiger I, combining the latter's thick armor with the armor sloping used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180 mm (3.9 to 7.1 in) of armor to the front, and was armed with the long barreled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun. The chassis was also the basis for the Jagdtiger tank destroyer.<br/><br/>The Tiger II was issued to heavy tank battalions of the Army (Schwere Heerespanzerabteilung – abbreviated s.H.Pz.Abt) and the Waffen-SS . It was first used in combat with s.H.Pz.Abt. 503 during the Normandy campaign on 11 July 1944 on the Eastern Front, the first unit to be outfitted with Tiger IIs was the s.H.Pz.Abt. 501 which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational."

","This movie tells us the story of five bad ass men (well, for Norman Ellison, the new recruit played by Logan Lerman, not so much at first. But in the end, he's a bad ass) who fights and defend their line. They are American soldiers fighting against the Germans, and seriously, guys, this movie deserved more than 7.9 stars. It needs 9, or 10! <br/><br/>When I say this movie is incredibly awesome it is incredibly awesome. I love how Logan's character, Norman Ellison, eventually grow into a real tough man from a normal typewriter. The moment he step out into a real man is when Emma is bombed. And you could see the change in Norman. And then Wardaddy, played by Brad Pitt. He's such an amazing man, never wanting to give up. It devastated me at first, but well, I guess soldiers are all designed and trained to never give up. I could understand why Wardaddy is a special soldier and a 'hope'. Not only he's bad ass at designing strategies, he also has a fiery spirit. I also love the rest of the three men. Grady 'Gordo', Con-Ass, and Bible. Con Ass, at first, pisses me off, due to being harsh at Norman and Emma. But eventually I began to like him, because I could see the softer side in him. <br/><br/>The plot and the story line is also amazing. The entire time I was watching with my mouth hung open and I was blown away by the teamwork, the explosive, and the cool tank Fury. Seriously, I don't think anyone in real life could bonded like those five guys did. Their teamwork is just amazing. We got Don Collier, Wardaddy, who basically takes control and tell the guys what to do, an amazing leader. And then there's team Bible and Con-Ass, working together to fire giant bullets. And there's also Norman and Grady, who were moving the tanks. Well, actually Grady move the tanks. Norman shoots using his guns. At first he is having trouble with it, but then he got the hang of it. This movie makes me experience adrenaline rush, and I know it might sound weird to the ones who don't like this movie (which I believe must be a few), and you guys should look at the explosive. For me, the fire, the got shot at leg, and everything, basically those effects, look so real. It's just so awesome. And I love how the guys called 'Fury,' their tank, their home. <br/><br/>Basically this movie needs more stars. It needs an 8, or a 9, or a 10. Not 6 or 7. This is such an awesome movie, I watch it twice. And I'm planning to watch it again."

In this movie too one Ameriacan can handle ten Germans single-handedly. One thing I liked about this movie was that it does not have any Jewish agenda--Too many (and in fact practically all of) the WWII movies that come out these days have one or more 'Nazi victimization of Jews"" subplot, which in the end ends up turning the movie into another one of those Holocaust Guilt Trips.

","More dudebro j.o. material from director David Ayer, given an air of respectability by its WWII subject matter. Really, it could have just as easily been the third G.I. Joe movie. Or maybe not. It's far more violent than that. You can really tell Ayer is getting off on the violence. He films it so lovingly, trying to pass it off as ""the horrors of war."" Yes, I'm sure war was this awful, but you're rolling around in it, dude. Brad Pitt stars as the commander of a tank crew. Logan Lerman stars as his new recruit - for many years now, Pitt hasn't lost a man, but now he finally has and Lerman is the unfortunate replacement (as Lerman arrives at the assignment, he's forced to peel the old guy's face off the inside of the tank). Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal round out the tank crew. Lerman is a newbie, and when he bitches out during the first big action sequence, the other men, who are already mean to him, are forced to make him a man by having him execute a P.O.W. and then get him laid. The action sequences are pretty good, truth be told, but this is WWII from the point of view of someone who's a big fan of Call of Duty, not from someone who has anything to say. The acting is acceptable, but nothing special."

The Sherman tank crew has been together since North Africa, but has recently lost a crew mate. They receive a untrained reluctant replacement soldier who causes problems for the tank crew and needs to adapt to his new job as assistant driver.

Fury marks the first time a genuine Tiger I tank has been used in the production of a WWII film. Fury features ""Tiger 131"" from the UK's Bovington Tank Museum, the only fully functioning Tiger tank in the world. Shia Lebeouf reportedly pulled out his own tooth and did not shower during filming. Fury is about the U.S. 2nd Armored division. The 2nd Armored is also known as ""Hell on Wheels"". The Assault Rifle carried by Brad Pitt is a German made StG 44 also known as a Sturmgewehr 44. A gun personally approved by Adolf Hitler for his SS troops. The fight with the Tiger tank clearly shows rounds from the Sherman tank guns bouncing off the Tiger's frontal armor. The L40 76mm M1A2 gun mounted on Fury was easily capable of penetrating the front armor of a Tiger tank at ranges of 400 to 700 meters. The fight was clearly under 200 meters, at which range the rounds from the 2 76mm armed Sherman tanks would have penetrated the Tiger's frontal armor. An experienced tank commander would attack the Tiger from the side, where the armor was only 60mm thick, rather than from the rear, where it was 80mm.e GOOFS: The mouths of the Waffen SS troops are not singing during that road marching scene to the crossroads were 'Fury' was stopped by an German anti-tank mine.<br/><br/>*Emotion- An extremely well produced and acted story about how tank crews bonded, died, and fought in Europe. Good demonstration of era tank tactics and daily life.<br/><br/>*Based On- Loosesly based on many Allied tank commander's experiences in WW2."

","I agree with peterh-140, this movie did not deliver. I thought the script was bland, Pitt's portrayal was pretty bad, which is surprising because he has potential and I like him in a few others; in this movie he didn't seem to embody the character. The Mexican Pena guy's lines during the lull in the lady's kitchen was not scripted well; I know he was drunk, but it wasn't emotionally heavy enough talking about Normandy and horses. Shia's character seemed authentic. I've read over 60 WWII memoirs and non-fiction books and there were a lot, and I mean a lot, of religious people in the ranks during that time. The writer did get a character right. Shia's portrayal was a little over the top though; it seemed he was crying in every scene he was in, am I right? Think back. When the new guy tries to go back and check on Emma after the bombing and the ugly guy stops him, the new guy throws a slap at him; what was that? I though the director made the actor take actual punches? That's what Pena and Shia said on Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. The Tiger tank should have hit the lead tank or second in line; that way the ones following would be blocked going forward. Shia peeing in the ammo box was uncalled for; there was a bottom hatch or he could have gone outside: I mean how much more conspicuous could he have been? There was a tank in the middle of a tank battle, Pitt had already taken care of the lookout on the horse. Okay movie, overall; marginally better than Monuments Men, which was another awfully written movie that deserved a better script; like this one. The tank battles were pretty good, points for that. I'm glad it didn't show sex and nudity; only implied it. That was tasteful and went with the flow of the movie well."

","I just watched ""Fury"" and decided to check on its score in IMDb and, boy, why did I ever do it... I don't understand the negative reviews... It's not realistic? The Tiger knocked out 3 Shermans and hit the Fury twice in the sides, before it went down. It was a very realistic ratio during WWII. The Tiger commander might have got overconfident, excited, overwhelmed, etc... Also, he ordered the Tiger forward, because he probably wanted to put a shell in the Fury's side. Why not?<br/><br/>Why is the last scene so criticized? The SS soldiers took losses, because they were surprised and because they didn't expect to fight a fully armed American tank, which can pretty much maw down a lot of infantry with its machine guns and shells. The Panzerfaust weapons were not very effective against thicker armor, so you need to get very close to the tank's sides and hope it would penetrate the armor... Good luck in getting into position, while the tank is shooting at you with .50 caliber machine guns and high-explosive/phosphorus tank shells.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about the realism, but I won't.<br/><br/>This is an artistic depiction of WWII and it is done very well. Do you think American soldiers were not committing war crimes? They were. And many of these war crimes were not documented or revealed. It's war, people become savages and their humanity is stripped away.<br/><br/>Last scene is a cliché? Read about the feats, accomplished by WWII Medal of Honor bearers... Compared to what some of these soldiers have done, mowing down 50 SS soldiers by a tank crew is nothing. So, educate yourself, people. And stop with the pretense you know everything about WWII."

I normally like Michael Pena, but he didn't belong in this film at all, nor did Shane from 'Walking Dead.' Horrible, cheesy dialogue, corny script with every cliché in the book - it just seems like they didn't even try with this film, and were hoping the action scenes would make up for it.<br/><br/>I did like the execution of the action scenes (though the logic behind them was often flawed), but I wouldn't wade through the rest of this horrible film to see them again.<br/><br/>I've always felt that David Ayers films are overrated, but this may well be the worst one he's ever done."

","Fury is another well directed, well written war film based on real events, directed by David Ayer (End of Watch, Sabotage). Starting off as a different take, the film does take a while for the initial plot to take it. Norman Ellison (Logan Lehrman) has been hooked out of the secretarial pool, where his skills included typing up to 60 words per minute, and shoved into a profane environment where his first job is clearing the remains of the unit's last driver out of the tank. His companions are archetypal warriors: pious ""Bible"" (Shia LaBeouf) is the main, ""Coon-Ass"" (Jon Bernthal) is the tank's belligerent loader, while ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Peña) is the driver. The ending may come as a surprise to some, however the film ends in a way which does take from its lead for the cause. Overall, Fury does not excite much, although the acting is well done from the cast, there have been more war films (in recent memory- Lone Survivor) which have more entertainment."

In a number of scenes we see the paradox express itself through both violence and civility. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Don, the tank - and later unit - commander, oscillates between the urbane and brutal in a sensitive and intelligent way. <br/><br/>As for the violence, view it as the pendulum that moves the characters to an extreme end of the paradox's spectrum and nothing more."
"visharl","7","2","6","19 April 2015"," A decent watch with a little bit of over dramatization of allied forces
","""yea lets smack some more Nazis !"" The movie is all about over glorification of the allied forces. I really find it appalling as to how the American movie industry still tend to think any thing American is good and others are good for nothing. Well acted and entertaining enough but the quality of the script is certainly lacking. Lack of genuineness, originality, subtlety. A lot of scenes were rushed, cliché,or just lacked a subtlety of acting that you'd expect from this movie.Experienced German anti-tank from defensive positions missing four shots in a row when firing at static targets? Come on we all know Germans were ain't that bad. I did find some scenes a little clichéd and unnecessary, trying to develop as a character but they didn't detract from the overall movie. Some of the unnecessary scenes did add punch to the character but they seemed a little forced into the story. <br/><br/>Coming to the good part of the story, The cast is great, Brad Pitt and all the rest making a great team and an interesting one, and even though this tank team does have some typical characters you find in war movies.Yet, the complex dynamic between Wardaddy and his men is far more fascinating. It's engaging and watchable, even as it marches toward a seemingly suicidal climax. The killing of the German SS man on knowing his involvement in killing of children and even the setting up of the horse free in the initial stages adds a lot of maturity to the character portrayed by brad Pitt which justifies his ability to command his men and the way he handles the situation. His expressions and his fierce eyes speaks volumes about what the war has turned him into. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is a great watch if you like the genre of war games. IF you expect too much of reality this is not a movie for you, but if you are ready to watch the American version of the war with some really interesting characters, this will not disappoint you. It takes you thru the emotions of men at war, their real state of affairs and psychology of warfare from their perspective."

","You can guess how boring I found this movie if I started typing this on my laptop halfway to it. I never had high hopes though. Another WW2 movie with exactly the same synopsis as always. A bunch of soldiers, dirty and desperate, in the darkest hours of history (as if WW2 was the only thing ever happened in Europe) and a dangerous mission. Oh well.<br/><br/>Dear Hollywood, please stop. There is NOTHING more you can tell about WW2. Yes, we admire how your SFX guys can rig explosions. Yes, your stuntmen still excel at throwing themselves in the air with a lifelike illusion of losing their limbs. And yes, good thing you can still come up with even more gross scenes more than fifteen years after Saving Private Ryan. Hey, yes, let's show a ripped off face on the tank's dashboard. Also, a half-rotten body, being treaded into the mud might also turn some stomaches. And add overdone visual effects to every gunshot so a battle looks like a lost scene from Star Wars. Literally, add the same laser bolts.<br/><br/>Is it a good war movie yet? Oh it's still boring. So let's just rip off some signature scenes from other, more successful war movies. Let's see what we have. German POWs being executed, straight from Private Ryan. Enemy soldiers burning, let's have a soldier telling others not to shoot them to let them burn. Or better repeat the same line three times in case the viewer still didn't get the point. Dead bodies being bulldozed into a mass grave, hey, that worked in Platoon, why not steal it? Soldiers find an abandoned piano in a newly occupied town, and it's boobytrapped. Yes, straight from The English Patient, but who remembers that? Maybe we can even throw in some tense dialogs around a table, as seen in Inglorious Basterds. No shooting at the end tho. Tank battle between Shermans and a Tiger, and who would've expected the hero having to shoot the German vehicle from the rear to disable it. Someone watched Kelly's Heroes, right?<br/><br/>Fury is definitely not a movie to watch if your age is over 25 or your IQ is beyond 80. You might still enjoy it if you haven't seen any war movies in the recent decades. Otherwise don't waste your time and money. We all know war is hell. We've seen it a couple of times. And please stop pretending that Germans were idiots and any rookie easily mowed down squads of SS on his first day. It was the other way around.<br/><br/>I just wonder why Hollywood is so obsessed with WW2 more than seventy years after it ended. Why is it mandatory to make another ""war is hell, look at the poor sobs in the mud"" flick? The very generation that actually fought that war did never took it this seriously. Besides of ""serious"" films there were a lot of WW2- themed comedies in the 1960s, both in the West and the East. Even the Russians made fun of it. There are no such movies nowadays. Does the current generation actually crave for their grandfathers' worst memories? Is it some bad conscience for being the first generation not having to go to a real war?"

","On the positive side, I think the action sequences were very well directed. The cinematography was great, and despite the grey bleak landscape and most action in the dark, it was still easy on the eye. However, the story is where it all really breaks down, is thin to say the least and even if the director just intended to show the ugly insides of a war, he could have been a little less biased when he did that. Again, I don't have issues with the performances or the technical qualities of this movie. Just that its about time someone made a more balanced movie about The War, or how about we have had enough WWII movies for a few generations."

They showed us each in turn That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind."" (The Gods of the Copybook Headings by Rudyard Kipling)<br/><br/>War, as it is - even a little bit embellished - dirty and ruthless.<br/><br/>To understand what ""Fury"" is and why all were so and not otherwise, you should look back a little, and then look around.<br/><br/>After the ""humiliating"" for the ""imperial nation"" Treaty of Versailles, Germany rather quickly disillusioned in liberal democracy of the Weimar Republic. Although after the hyperinflation economy finally stabilized, but only to be immediately ""decimated"" by the global economic crisis. New energetic leader and disgruntled by the defeat in the Great War military leaders whispered to Germans about betrayal, conspiracy of treacherous West against Germany, which was not defeated on battlefield and capitulated only due to the cunning and treachery of the liberal politicians. And the Third Empire began to ""get up off its knees"" under active and simply tacit approval of the German people, who listened enthusiastically every word their charismatic leader said.<br/><br/>""They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds"" (Jer. 14:14).<br/><br/>With its ""special path"", the bearer of an ""unique Aryan gene"", Germans, according to the Fuehrer was the only beacon of civilization, against which the rest of the world fought. But now Germany is as strong as ever. Western leaders, all these ""Daladier and Chamberlains"" were despised by Hitler as weak-willed and cowardly. They ""swallowed"" the Austrian Anschluss, the annexation of the Sudetenland, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia, accepted the infamous Munich Agreement. Meanwhile not confined by liberals and democrats and not burdened with the ""bourgeois morality"", the energetic leader behaved with unprecedented arrogance and rudeness. Together with his teacher from the East, he dismembered Poland. Then easily captured France. There only a defiant England left with this funny old man Churchill. Authoritarianism, when critics ""do not rock the boat"" with the stupid ""democracy"", confirmed its benefits - at that time, as democracies swayed in doubts, authoritarianism confidently went forward.<br/><br/>""There are no innocent. There are only varying degrees of responsibility.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jews were murdered in the gas chambers, from the East echelons of slaves arrived in Germany, while remaining were treated almost as mercilessly as by the Soviets. And all this is either with the active support of, or with the acquiescence of, or even indifference of the German people - finally ""raised from their knees."" ""There are no innocent"" - everyone took part in building of the Third Reich - someone shot, and someone produced shells. Difference only in the degree of responsibility. They're not going to give up - ""carriers of unique gene"" are invincible in battle, they have a ""wonder weapon"" and a great leader.<br/><br/>""Each person can err, but to persist in error is peculiar only to fool.""<br/><br/>Germans did not give up - they lived in a fictional reality of Goebbels's propaganda by which they were not deceived, but which gave them a great opportunity to deceive themselves and to ignore reality. Lie was their truth. But reality, even if it does not noticed, does not cease to be reality - ""brilliant"" leader who's ""effective"" government wasn't restrained by the ""democratic criticism"", quickly braked his country's neck, exactly because of the lack of democratic criticism, which may have returned him to reality. He also lived in illusions.<br/><br/>""And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!""<br/><br/>So, the reality that the Germans were so hardly trying to keep out of their doors, hiding behind the veil of propaganda lies, furiously smashed the doors of German homes, destroyed walls, killed old people and children, raped women, murdered men - actively supporting, tacitly endorsing or simply indifferent. It turned out that there is truth, despite all lie's efforts to hide it. And if you do not give up in your misconceptions, if you persist in lies - the truth will burst violently, relentlessly, destroying all in its path - there will be no innocent!<br/><br/>This applies to the past and to the present. ""Fury"" is a reminder to all about the price of ""mistake"" and persistence in delusions. Everyone will pay for the ""mistake"" - active and silent and indifferent - and payment after collision with reality will be cruel. Yet another ""imperial nation"", disillusioned in liberal democracy now tries to hide from reality under the curtain of lies. Russians believe that they have been never defeated by the West on a battlefield, and Soviet Union would have been victorious if not for the West conspiracy. They believe that Russians are bearers of the unique ""genes"" and are only beacon of civilization in the declining world. They despise Western leaders, considering them weak. Russians adore their charismatic leader - Putin. They are happy with the annexation of the Crimean peninsula, murder of thousands of Ukrainians and destruction of Donbas, boasting to turn USA into radioactive dust. They are leaving in illusions, considering themselves innocent. Yet their collision with reality is inevitable.<br/><br/>""As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man — There are only four things certain since Social Progress began: — That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;"""

","I enjoyed this movie, it is entertainment not a history lesson. Everybody who blasts this movie for the inaccuracies needs to step back and take a deep breath. All the actors did a fine job and I found it really cool to see what I believe is the only functioning Tiger tank in the world get some screen time. That in its self is history. Brad Pitt always does a good job, Shia Lebouf gives one of his best performances and shows that he is continuing to grow as an actor and also grow up. I became a fan of John Bernthal as Shane in the Walking dead and he brings a lot to his character in Fury. As far as how realistic the end battle was, well I will leave that up to you. I found Fury very entertaining and the run time seemed shorter than it really is because the action doesn't let up. One last thing, I like that it doesn't make any attempt at all to glorify or gloss over the atrocities of war."

","It's April, 1945 and the war in Germany is rapidly coming to an end. However, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis refuse to surrender just yet and are putting up as much of a fierce defense as they can. This movie follows a specific tank crew as they fight their way forward against stiff resistance. Of particular concern is the fact that their Sherman tank is quite inferior to the Tiger tank of the Germans. However, the tank commander, ""Don Collier"" (Brad Pitt) is both dedicated and determined and he has a well-seasoned crew serving with him. Unfortunately, after an extremely fierce battle he loses one of his men and the replacement named ""Norman Ellison"" (Logan Lerman) is too young and inexperienced to handle the job right away. As a result he is not only a danger to the crew but to himself as well. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had outstanding action and seemed realistic from start to finish. Definitely worth a watch."

","Military films which portray true military structure is hard to find. I am a military veteran. I served as mechanized infantry and as an information Technology Specialist (These are not official titles I am using layman's terms for non veterans). We all know the enlisted do most of the real brave work and the officers generally are in safe quarters but Hollywood rushes to make the officers war heroes in films. I am not saying that there are no war heroes that are officers, I am just saying the general norm amongst most military personnel. There are probably countless officers that have done brave things but its not as common as enlisted. This is part of the reason they say the NCO is the backbone of the Army. Anyways, This film shows where people truly are in leadership and how people generally truly act in the military. I am sorry you guys in the civilian world not every real military member is a highly intelligent ken doll. This also shows brotherhood and an NCO (Non Commissioned Officer Brad Pitt) that hardly looses his cool amongst his subordinates and has gained the respect of his subordinates. I can see this film being very popular amongst military veterans."
"savena95","8","2","6","22 November 2014"," A brutal thrill ride into WW2
","World War Two is an obvious focus for many film makers in recent times, ranging from Inglorious to The Book Thief, directors have always seemed to favour the dramatic tales of soldiers set against the backdrop of a Nazi Germany. Fury also follows this trend, but can this war torn story provide the audience with anything different? Set in 1945 Germany we are introduced to Don 'Wardaddy' Collins (Brad Pitt) who in charge of his five man tank crew which is consistent of Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal). Then along comes newbie Norman (Logan Lerman) who claims that he wasn't even supposed to be drafted. However he is soon plunged into the horrid world behind enemy lines as they take charge of tank 'Fury' travelling mission to mission, each one with a greater threat than the previous. Pitt plays an as an excellent mentor to the young Lerman, with the great teacher-student relationship being explored here. Both of them are able to carry the weight of such great characters, which was refreshing to see. Lerman's character development was well plotted throughout the film, and felt authentic even if a little rushed for the sake of the plot. Even more so LaBeouf, who despite his antics off screen, was very moving at times, with both him and Bernthal developing into characters worthy of our screen time. It was only really Pena who seemed to be the weakest link in the bunch, even if I do feel this was very much due to his poor underwriting as a character. However overall the chemistry between the group was perfect and were truly convincing in their sense of being a team with director David Ayer doing well to balance all the strong personalities here. <br/><br/>Wack-a-mole Brad Pitt edition Ayer also does a brilliant job at creating a movie which is well paced and stunning with it's actions scenes. It's relentless and with so many heart racing moments you'll forget when you're supposed to breathe. A pivotal yet quieter scene inside a German woman's home also holds so much tension, it shows how the film can shine through in even the quietest moments thanks to the cast. The shots of the thick mud and the claustrophobic sheltered setting of inside the tank itself were brilliant, creating the perfect cinematic war atmosphere this movie needed to explore Ayers theme of the brutality of war. It was sentimental and harsh at the same time, never shying away from the horrors that a battlefields hold, but rather lingers on them just long enough to make the audience feel awkward. It's a brilliant combination of director and cinematography. Despite this feeling like the best war film to hit screens in recent times, it's brilliant casting choices and beautifully devastating choices in directing, it doesn't feel as if it's able to move the genre forward it anyway. At times it feels like a huge ode to every other comrade based war movie, and at others it felts as if Ayers is almost trying to show how horrible war can be whilst also showcasing it's ability to transform people and help them grow into people we may even aspire to be. Be it cheesy and a tad predictable at times, overall its obvious how this relentless film will leave many awe struck at it's high octane action scenes and it's realistic attempt at re creating the war time for a modern day audience."

","Watching fury was an experience of a lifetime. The movie trailers hardly did nothing o dumb down the action, and heart racing theme of this film.

Watching Jon Bernthal be the most unpleasant character throughout the film was agitating,But however much you hate him for his actions you cannot help feeling bad for him once the in depth personal moments come into play. Even though I have nothing but praise to give this movie I will say that the plot was quite predictable, when I sat down at the movies to see this film everyone in the theater knew how this movie was going to end, and if they didn't they would after the two older ladies behind me correctly predicted the end of the film rather loudly."

","This is a good movie, and if you like war movies, this is one of the better ones. The movie is about heroes and how each person is a hero. There is more death in it than I like. Having one thing after another taken away is a bit heart rending. It also suggests that people in war do taken advantage of situations, and that means that they don't have as much integrity as I would like to think soldier would have. But the movie makes one think about how horrible war is for not only soldiers but for the communities that experience it. It doesn't have a good ending IMO. I didn't see the ""real"" hero as the best actor, and so this disappointed me. It is worth seeing, and I would recommend it."

","When it comes to depicting the brutal horrors of war, Fury does a commendable job in offering a visceral outlook through its numerous battle sequences that are relentless, unflinching & unforgiving yet the film as a whole feels more or less like a missed opportunity because despite having the potential & ingredients to join the same league as the finest examples of its genre, it comfortably settles for a score that's quite below its aspirations.<br/><br/>A fictional story set during the final months of World War II in Nazi Germany, Fury presents a fascinating portrait of tank crews that served during the last great war and concerns the battle- hardened five-man crew of a Sherman tank & the deadly mission they embark on behind enemy lines. The film covers the bonding between the crews & the team effort they put together in a heroic attempt to hold their position despite being heavily outnumbered & outgunned.<br/><br/>Written & directed by David Ayer, the movie makes it pretty clear in its opening moments that it aims to put up a mercilessly raw depiction of war in front of viewers & isn't going to be a nice ride for the easily distressed. Ayer's direction & script are really good in parts but where the movie falls flat is in the moments when bullets & shells are not being exchanged. However, camera-work is kinetic, editing is effective in battle scenes but choppy rest of the time & background score is a big plus.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña & John Bernthal as the five-man crew of the Sherman tank named 'Fury' and it's Pitt as Wardaddy who really has a commanding presence here & delivers a fab performance yet sometimes his star presence comes in the way. LaBeouf is surprisingly good, Lerman's character is our ticket into the battlefield & his bonding with Wardaddy is the core ingredient that drives this story. And I didn't care much damn about Peña & Bernthal.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Fury features a relatively less used premise in warfare filmmaking as there aren't many examples in cinema that have captured war from the viewpoint of a tank crew & in that aspect, is a welcome addition. But it is also ridden with almost every cliché of its genre, fails to provide a more compact structure to its narrative & certainly lacks the same level of devotion in handling its characters' arcs as the one present while it is revelling in its extremity. Not even close to the finest films of its genre but a viciously entertaining ride nonetheless. Worth a shot."

","The cover of the movie, displayed with well-known group of cast along with the mighty artillery and the name of Brad Pitt above the title definitely makes me want to consider watching it. However, it also creates a deliberate debate about whether the content actually lives up to billing or not. And, it turns out to be a well-acted and well-directed war film that dramatically depicts explosive and scenes of World War II.<br/><br/>The first glance of the scene is quiet gloomy and cruel as it takes place to a smoky land, fraught with crummy tanks and corpses scattered around. It gives you the surreal feeling of you being in the movie to sense a long-standing animosity against Nazi. From there, a series of emotions and battles build up till the final stage where a five U.S. armed contingent tries to execute a very reckless ambush while getting outnumbered by an advanced and a plethora of German legion. <br/><br/>Things that differentiate this film from other counterparts are strong sympathies towards hand-to-mouth citizens whose lifespan being on thin ice every moment by relentless barrage of bombs falling from the skies and mass shootings. When you realize that the death is approaching, anything can happen in such a short period of time from falling in love with someone you just met to killing anyone regardless of age or gender. <br/><br/>The last but not least, we all shall remember that any of us would not be able to watch this film or possibly, this movie might not have been made without the sacrifices of those who fought through their precious youth to provide us the rosy future that we are experiencing right now in some extent.

","In life I've almost never been interested in trying world war movies. If I'm not interested in trying a world war movie, it doesn't ever mean that I don't think I'll like it. My bets to whether I'll like them are 50% chances. It's just that I prefer to watch a film genre which is my favorite and which therefore gives me excitement in advance before I go to see this movie for the first time at the cinema. If it's not my favorite genre then I don't have much excitement in advance before I go and see it and I don't always accept that. That's the way I personally work with my mind. Somewhat, for FURY, which is a WW II film, the feeling was different and by this I mean that I looked forward to see it. Now, how come? Maybe it was because there was Brad Pitt and because I heard from my father and brothers that he is a really good actor. Even if so (knowing myself) I still don't think I would have wanted to see a film with Brad Pitt if it is a movie genre I'm not interested in so that would be weird if that really was the reason why I felt excited to see FURY! Or maybe it is because I just naturally started developing tastes in trying different genres I don't watch much because of teenage maturity. Or maybe it is something else whatever it is! Anyways I'm glad to say that I liked FURY mostly because of the way it was acted! It wasn't just well acted just like this - it was staggeringly well acted and some of the acting there has gone beyond my expectations (sure as hell it did) and marked me tremendously, and that tremendous impact on me from the acting came mostly from Brad Pitt's character! It is the acting that made Brad Pitt's character feel like a particularly interesting and damn believable character and he really was in fact! Brad Pitt was truly at his best here (in his acting not his performance) playing a Sergeant that acts and behaves like a mean character but is like that not for the sake of being mean but is like that because he is affected from his past experiences with the war and tries to teach other people about the cold reality of war for their own good. His character was brutal and so unbearable and that's what made him an excellent, truly original character to me! In fact, Brad Pitt's character was just so brutal that I couldn't help but wonder at first if he actually was an unkind guy in the deep of himself but as his character continued to develop 'till the end of the movie it became obvious to me that he in fact is a kind man in the deep of himself. Even if it is a WW II motion picture, this motion picture also had a few funny moments. Ahhhhh, humor is really what puts me in such a good mood and warms my mood of excitement like a jack- oozy that warms down my body when I watch films and that's how I felt like when I witnessed a few funny moments in FURY. And the dialogs are smart and very well done too! Other great things: the movie is sensitively portrayed, the addition of the new, young and unexperienced recruit in Wardaddy's tank crew in the storyline, the new recruit's inexperience causing trouble to the crew in the face of danger, the depiction of the horrors of war are suitably raw, the cast is strong and the char battle scenes are suspenseful. However, the movie has a few flaws. Two of them are that while Brad Pitt makes his character act in an exceptionally good way, some of the other actors playing the principal characters of the movie fit too simply into their characters and should get a bit of complexity + the movie doesn't fully live up to its larger ambitions. Nonetheless, the movie's overall outstandingly well handed direction helps save itself My rating: 7.7/10"

The acting (Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal) directing (David Ayer), soundtrack (Gravity's Steven Price), sound design, editing, cinematography, and visual and special effects are all some of best you'll see and hear all year. Where this movie falls short is in its pacing, storytelling, and characters. This is a war movie, and with that comes the same clichés and characters we've seen in all of them. That isn't to say the story is bad, it's just more of the same. The pacing however, especially in the second act, is mixed.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth seeing.

","Fury is the kind of film that I feel like doesn't get made often. It's a very ""Saving Private Ryan"" kind of WWII film, although this one has the twist of it being focused on a tank crew. I must say that I enjoyed this film quite a bit.<br/><br/>Fury is the kind of war film that looks closely at the mentality of the soldiers. We see things that are horrifying and make you wonder about the state of some of these people, but we also see the human side. I think it fairly displays the kind of people that go to war. It doesn't say that they are all psychotic killers, but it certainly doesn't shy away from the brutality that is war. We see people being torn apart by explosions or burning to death, and it's all there for us to witness, really shocking the audience by not pulling any punches. I think the themes it discusses and the way it's handled really make the character drama work.<br/><br/>The whole tank crew comes together quite well. We see the characters in different situations and we establish quite well what kind of people they are. Brad Pitt is the leader, Logan Lerman is the wimpy guy who doesn't exactly want to be there, Shia LaBeouf is the religious guy, and so on. There's even an extended sequence in a German home where the men sit at a table eating eggs, which reminded me of the plantation scene in Apocalypse Now Redux, except in this case I think it worked to establish characters further, where in Redux it just screwed up the pacing. By the end of the film, you're with these characters and want them to make it through these events. <br/><br/>I also found all of the sets, props, and costumes to be really good. It all felt authentic (which apparently some of it was according to IMDb trivia) and it heightened the films realism. Its always good to see such good production values in a historical film. <br/><br/>Fury is a great mix of both drama and war that really works. It brings up themes regarding war that can really get you thinking about how terrible it all is. The enemy may seem like pure evil because they're trying to kill you, but they are human too. There might be someone who is a lot like you but just so happens to be on the other side of the battlefield. War is hell, and Fury doesn't try to sugar coat it."
"Rendanlovell","8","2","6","4 November 2014"," World War 2 Brad Pitt movie
","Fury is a brutal take on a tank unit called fury. We join the crew just after one of their crew members had been killed. And just a few hours later a new recruit Norman, is sent to fill the position. Set near the end of world war 2 fury jumps right into things. It assumes the audience is paying attention and doesn't really ever stop to let you catch your breath. <br/><br/>Now when you think of a world war 2 film starring brad pitt you probably think inglorious Bastards. And even after watching this film that won't change. Which is sad really, Because Brad was great as the unapologetic leader of fury. The entire cast great as well. I was really happy to see Shia Labeuf back at it and turned in a career best performance. But the focal point of the film is definitely Brad Pitt and Percy Jackson star Logan Lerman. Logan as Norman, is a young man that has never seen any action but by the end of the film he is just as hardened as the rest of his crew members. Jon Bernthal Is also a surprise getting some great development as the bully of Fury. But Shia and Micheal pena just don't have the development they should've had. This is really disappointing because they have moments near the end of the film were we should've cared about them and just didn't.<br/><br/>Speaking of the end, I'm not going to spoil anything but the concluding action sequence is one of the best that movies have to offer. It is utterly intense and beautifully shot. These were really the only things that were consistently great here. The cinematography and action. <br/><br/>Great sound design also boasts the action scenes to a new level. Listening to tank shells whistle by narrowly missing someone is a real treat. The brutality of the action was another great factor. Watching people being blown in half is not only gruesome but oddly satisfying. And it left craving the next tank fight only to be handed overly long scenes of talking that didn't help the film in anyway. Granted this is only a problem nearer to the end of the film but it's still hard to overlook. During an especially long break from action I actually started to think of how this review would go. That's how uneventful these scenes were. There was no character development and mostly nothing happened in most of these scenes. <br/><br/>Overall Fury is well acted, beautifully shot, and offers impressive action sequences. Although Shia LaBeouf and Micheal Penas characters are depressingly underwritten and some of the breaks between action scenes are completely useless."
"krs_is_cool","9","2","6","4 November 2014"," one of the most realistic representations of life in a tank against the German Tiger and the relentless resistance of the Nazis
","For those people who have learned about World War two, you will know that it took many thousands of people from America, England and it's commonwealth, France and the rest of the allies to defeat the Germans. After D-day the push to re-gain Europe begun but it was a slow and damaging one, as the Nazis were relentless and were not easily broken. This film captivates this I imagine almost perfectly, from the view point of a tank crew(s). This film is like Saving Private Ryan in it's realism and detail, and doesn't shy away from showing you things which most people wouldn't actually want to see. I have seen real footage from WW2 and if it is anything to go by, this movie is about as realistic as you can get. Without a doubt the best tank film that I have ever seen, and one of the best ww2 films as well."

","What to expect from 'Fury'? A good and a bad experience both at once. One thing is sure that whatever the filmmakers tried to achieve in Fury, they certainly did and so this is an above average movie. Good things first. The direction is good. I didn't expect this good direction from David Ayer, he has surprised everyone I believe. Acting is really good here too. The brand new mustache has done wonders for Shia LaBeouf. Brad Pitt has done very well as usual, expect another adventure of Aldo Raine of Inglourious Basterds one more time from him. But the surprise package is Logan Lerman. In my view, Logan is the lead actor in the movie. The movie gives a real feeling of a battle in The Great War of 1945. Fury is descriptive, sentimental, intense and exciting, no doubts at all.<br/><br/>Talk about negative aspects, there are a lot. My basic question is why you need a drama based on the biggest event in human history- WW2??? Why why?? Just because Inglourious Basterds was a successful movie?? The story is about nothing but the courageous battle showed at the end of the movie that too is a stupid one. One has to ask whether the Nazis were so dumb as far as the strategy is concerned?? A two hours run into the battle is excellent but from a point of view of a critique, you got to feel a passiveness in the movie. You can expect a real feeling of a great war but let all the logics rest at home. For me, the positives outweigh the negatives, but not by much. A good one time watch but not good enough for another watch. You can watch it once or you can watch Inglourious Basterds once more or just wait for a few days for 'Interstellar'. I give it a 7/10 for the real experience of a battle."
"atulthapaua","9","2","6","2 November 2014"," War never ends quietly
","A great World War 2 movie. I was impressed by the tank effects. Fury talks about an American tank crew fighting in Germany in April of 1945, is one of the Great War movies—right near the top, within range of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) and other classics. Well written and directed by David Ayer. Fury may not be everyone's cup of tea but it serves as a great reminder of the devastation wars bring with them. The actors do a commendable job with both Pitt (a Sherman tank commander) and LaBeouf as standouts. In the movie they use proper terminology like when they face the Tiger tank head to head they switch to HVAP (high velocity armor piercing) rounds. They really did their research on this movie but Fury is not for the faint-hearted (If you know the WWII history, then you know how it ends). The movie was filled with war action, drama, tragedy, and a hint of comedy. I would highly recommend this movie, especially if you love tanks like I do."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","2","6","2 November 2014"," Change the ending, and its better than Saving Private Ryan.
","In many ways, David Ayer's Fury exceeded Saving Private Ryan as the go-to, ""war is awful"" film. Fury deserves to sweep the Oscars technical categories with amazing sound effects, editing, cinematography, production design and visuals. The opening and closing shots in Fury were absolutely beautiful, and the score that underlay the film was somber and triumphant, much like the film. David Ayer proved himself ten times over as a director, and the tank battle scenes were probably the most tense I have been at the movies this year, and there was some scenes in the film that will probably put me off war forever. Even the film's disappointing conclusion was edited and directed beautifully. <br/><br/>I expressed extreme doubts about the casting going in - a group of Hollywood misfits like typecast John Bernthal, the eternally supporting man Michael Pena and Hollywood dung heap Shia LaBeouf. I am absolutely delighted to say that I was wrong. I really think that a cast of Hollywood misfits was a perfect choice for a tank crew of misfits (bible-basher, Latino, brute, kid) I am opening my heart to LaBeouf after seeing the sensational performance he gave in this film as ""Bible"" Swan. John Bernthal stole every scene he was in as the asshole Grady Travis. Michael Pena was slightly less impressive but still brought a lot to the performance. Contrarily, the two who I went into the film excited for (Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman) were solidly adequate at best. I feel that any multitude of actors could have delivered in those generic roles without much effort, and whilst I enjoyed watching Lerman's baptism by fire, I feel that Bernthal and LaBeouf deserve most of the acting praise. The cast worked well together and boasted some absolutely sensational chemistry, and A SAG Cast Award nomination is extremely warranted here.<br/><br/>The screenplay was overall rather disappointing, and whilst delightful acting and direction glossed over it in many places, at times I could see dead weight or wrong choices that could have been altered. Case in point, the film's extremely disappointing conclusion. Just like Edge of Tomorrow, an otherwise flawless movie was undone by a completely nonsensical and thoroughly clichéd ending. I could see the film's ending coming a good 15 minutes in advance, and overall the action packed conclusion felt like it would be more at place in a Michael Bay movie than what was meant to be an anti-war film.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury is one of the best films of 2014, and I would consider it in my Top 3 were it not for the ending."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","2","6","1 November 2014"," Engaging and Exciting Look Through a Soldier's Eyes
","Fury is a blatant critique of war. While neither a bold or unique position to take, making WWII seem like more than just the justified good guys fighting the inhuman bad guys is no easy feat. Director Ayers has managed to really get into the heads of his characters, deftly showing the momentary boredom, the constant confusion and the incessant fear that come in battle. With a weighty and unglamorous bleakness, Fury stands out as a truly engaging and exciting look through the eyes of a soldier. Ayers and his talented cast have gathered a compelling and fairly accurate collection of war-torn men. Our door into this group is Norman (a well-casted Lerman), a mouse-y new recruit completely out of his element. Without the use of extensive backstory or flashbacks, we are fully engulfed in his brain through heart-wrenchingly intense introductions. Led by a strong and assured Pitt, the camaraderie of the group of weary warriors is palpably honest, but not without moments of natural fun. Rampant with melodrama, the confusion of war almost warrants it. Thankfully these guys are not cookie-cutter Hollywood heroes, but real men, complimented beautifully by the ""antagonistic"" yet utterly human German soldiers. If anything these themes of the humanity within real war are lacking in subtlety, but it's a point well-taken nonetheless. Action wise, I never would've thought tank scenes could be so packed with heart-pounding intensity and exhilaration while staying deeply personal. It's grimy and gory, but never to the point of inappropriate gratuity. So even in its slight downfalls of tropes and predictability, Fury is visceral and individual action-war filmmaking that delivers."
"darshil_mclaren","8","2","6","31 October 2014"," A must watch war movie!
","Fury is by far one of the best war movies I have seen. It not only puts you on the edge but also touches the various aspects of the war. Brad has acted great as usual, kind of reminded me of his character in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards. Logan Lerman has done a fantastic job playing his character. The audio visual effects are up to the mark, special effects are even better with real time blood shed that is equally well directed. The fired rounds in the movie looked a bit funny as they were shown a bright red/blue colour, like a jedi's lightsaber. Some intense attack sequences had extra bit of fireworks in them that could have turned out better."

Without much doubt this is amongst one of the better war movies in recent years, and along with it is a hard harsh look at the sheer ugly awfulness of conflict. Brad Pitt leads the movie with a strong experienced performance as a sergeant with more than a few battles under his belt leading a perfectly fine supporting cast. The plentiful battles themselves are very well put together and they'd almost be fun to watch if this didn't pull any punches with its grim effects of the bullets and bombs making for a more tense than exciting watch.

"dbryn","8","2","6","30 October 2014"," Slip Into A Sherman Tank In WWII And Hold On!! Awesome, but...
","I love war movies, and having served in the Armed Forces I won't pretend to know the ins and outs of everything that is WWII, but I know enough to support my opinion. From the first 30seconds of the movie I felt like I was the fly on the wall within a Sherman tank. For me, that's all that mattered, it made the movie, it was original, and it felt authentic. Loved it! I will warn you, the movie was pretty light on story and goals, and surprisingly stronger on character. I liked it, and the lack of story didn't matter as I was happy to be along for the ride. The acting was top notch as expected.<br/><br/>For the few people that posted that the movie was a disgrace to the American serviceman?? I presume you are referring to the 'guy talk' about female refugees, what nearly happened in the 'home', and the treatment of German prisones of war? You weren't there, and I wasn't there... but if you think this kind of thing didn't happen, you're a little delusional. Soldiers who lived this life and death volatility day after day? Suffering from inhumane conditions, sights, and sounds? They're going to be a little messed up. No disrespect to any US service people as we totally appreciate what you're doing (or the service personal from any nation out there)... but Iraq, Afghanistan... the situation was nowhere near the WWI or WWII environment. Just sayin. Look at the body count.<br/><br/>So, the movie was awesome until the end. The final battle scene? Wow. Who wrote this? You did such a wonderful job up until now, but then... wtf? What a disaster. SPOILER alerts! Here are the numerous ways you demolished a perfectly good war movie, that had my eyes rolling and the audience whispering about how ridiculous things got. 1. War Daddy's tank disabled via a landmine. Send the young guy to the top of the hill as a lookout. Young guy spots 200-300 infantry (every 4th SS soldier is carrying panzerfaust/bazooka), a few mounted officers, and a few armored vehicles. Young Sherman crewman runs down the road, discusses the oncoming force with the Sherman crew, the crew debates staying with War Daddy, they prep the Sherman tank disguise, they sit in the tank and discuss life for nearly 4mins... hmm, this is a lot of time, and I'm surprised the young crewman outran the Germans in the first place. 2. 200-300 SS Infantry descend upon the tank, and surprise... the Sherman is manned and able to mow down a large number of SS. Beautiful! OK, but we already saw that every 4th or 5th soldier had Panzerfaust/bazooka, so why is it when you showed us a single German soldier with panzerfaust blowing to smithereens a tank with a single shot in the first battle scene... that now 200 infantry can't do the same thing to War Daddy's tank? 3. The Sherman is about to be swarmed with SS Infantry, let's toss out fragmentation grenades. OK. But since when do fragmentation grenades explode in a fiery explosion? I know, it's Hollywood... but, you lose points in a war movie in my opinion. 4. War Daddy's crew runs out of ammo, so they jump on the external guns. Four exposed soldiers versus 150+ SS Infantry. Wow, these Germans have TERRIBLE aim. Hey, let's get all suspenseful and show a German sniper crawling along the grass. Will he shoot War Daddy? Come on, there's no reason 150+ SS can't take out a stationary War Daddy on the .50cal. The sniper crawls to within 100ft of War Daddy. He aims through his scope, slows his breath. Bang! Hits War Daddy, but he's injured. Shoots War Daddy again, and he's injured... more? Hits War Daddy a third time and he finally slumps into the Sherman. Obviously 150+ infantry have such lousy aim, I'd expect the sniper would be just as bad? RIDICULOUS!<br/><br/>Everything leading up to this final battle was awesome! But then they had the audience groaning at the final disaster. All in all, still loved the movie and will buy it when it's out. Just goes to show, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" are still the best WWII movies out there."
"sirisblack98","8","2","6","28 October 2014"," A two act movie with 2 ratings
","To start off, I am not a ""professional"" movie reviewer, just an avid movie-goer. I looked forward to Fury from the first trailer, seeing themes that reminded me of Band of Brothers. The movie was a great WWII film and will likely be enjoyed for a long time, but has some very cringeworthy items.<br/><br/>Trying to keep it simple: <br/><br/>Act I was great, heart-wrenching, cringe worthy character actions, good character development (Pitt and Lerman), and overall a good experience. What could have been the Act I in a WWII masterpiece film. It shows a young man thrust into a war zone with a bunch of, well, asshats. Some criticize the ""House"" scene, but I viewed it as a sergeant trying to maintain sanity in a insane world. The scene pushed clichÃ©s on you (soldiers being violent, rape, etc.) but turned to show a different side of the soldiers. As soon as you see that, the clichÃ© soldiers break the scene. <br/><br/>Act II was more battle oriented, with a better realism of war conditions than other ""war"" movies, but once the final battle started, all realism went out the door. The battalion of SS soldiers were made out to be the Stormtroopers of the scene, constantly missing shots, no spacial awareness (go around the tank?), and apparently unaware of how to take out a disabled tank. The final battle was drawn out to such an extent I lost all grip on the characters and just wanted the battle to end. The clichÃ©s present in the final battle just wore away at everything Act I was achieving. With all that said, the final scene (aerial shot) did leave a lasting impression that I wish I felt through all of Act II.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend the film if you like WWII action films. The addition of the tank centerpiece was a new, welcome view of war. The biggest con to this film was the long, clichÃ©'d final battle scene. <br/><br/>Act I: 8/10 Act II: 6.5/10"
"PyroSikTh","7","2","6","28 October 2014"," Doesn't always work, and yet still very enjoyable.
","Fury is a war movie with many war movie tropes and clichÃ©s. The cast of characters, for example, is one big clichÃ©; there's the hardened veteran who's respected by everyone he commands, the Christian guy who keeps spouting bible verses, the bulldog who is so brimming with testosterone that he almost becomes a parody of himself, the Mexican who keeps getting told off for speaking Spanish, and of course the new recruit that they all bully until he proves himself worthy of their respect. So it's interesting that the movie decides to take a character-driven approach seeing as all the main characters are shallow stereotypes. Fortunately it kind of works in being a vehicle for the movie's themes.<br/><br/>The biggest theme of the whole movie is certainly anti-war. It shows the brutality of it in all it's gory and psychological glory. It's a heavy movie to watch, both visually and emotionally, and that cast of characters are what helps push this along. But first the gore and violence. I mean, it's a war movie, this level of violence comes with the territory, however I'm shocked this got such a low rating (15 in the UK). The new recruit's first task is to clean up the mess of the guy he's replacing, whereupon he finds half the guy's face splat on the wall. The journey to his first mission ends up with their lieutenant getting set on fire and ultimately shooting himself in the head to make the pain stop. Yeah, this isn't a movie for the light-stomached.<br/><br/>But back to the character focus and how it aids the themes. While the movie might be visually challenging to watch thanks to all the gore and violence, it's also hard to watch because of the emotions and psychology at play. It's these emotional situations that really lift the characters out of their pigeon-holed stereotypes. Again, focussing on the new recruit who was never trained with a weapon or how to kill, he struggles to kill the German soldiers. Taking a life is taking a life even if it is a you-or-me situation, and he's adamant to keep his conscious clean. He's also bullied on by the other members of his crew because of his ""weak"" mental state, when in actual fact it's them who have grown apathetic and desensitised to the horrors of war.<br/><br/>The acting is the single-biggest driving factor of the movie. The characters may be weak, the plot simple, and the themes and ideas mishandled, but the sheer quality of acting on display makes sure that you never really notice how weak the characters are. Each and every actor shares a great chemistry with his fellows that instantly lends to these four guys having been together as long as they claim. Each one also manages to individually add a surprising depth to their otherwise two-dimensional characters. Brad Pitt's Don is indeed the hardened veteran he's made out to be, wise and commanding respect wherever he goes even though he's not the highest ranking soldier. However he is also a bully, running Norman hard and against his ideologies. But he's human as well. He's respected because he's a nice guy deep down and he's committed to his cause. A two-dimensional character he is not.<br/><br/>Every major character is given this same amount of depth by their actor. Logan Lerman's Norman may be the weedy greenhorn, but he's not a pushover nor is he socially challenged. He often goes toe-to-toe with the other members of his crew, giving as much as he takes, in defence of his stance. Shia LaBeouf's Bible (the Christian, if you couldn't tell) isn't your regular goody two- shoes that type of character is often portrayed as. He doesn't join in with the bullying as much, but he doesn't do anything to stop it, and in fact sides with his crewmembers even when they're being unreasonable. Of all the crew though, he's the one who gets most attached, so whenever another crew member dies, he's the one to add that emotional weight. I don't care what anyone says, LaBeouf is an astounding actor that deserves more credit - personal life be screwed. Jon Bernthal's animalistic Grady is every bit as macho (and slightly dumb) as his stereotype requires, but is again still human. He never quite reaches into parody land, and his short heart-to-heart with Norman near the end goes a long way to show that he's not just a brute. Michael PeÃ±a unfortunately gets the short end of the stick with the under-developed Gordo. Much like his Mexican stereotype, that's about all that's particularly memorable about him, and other than straggling the line between Bible's good nature and Grady's masculinity like a happy medium, he doesn't have a particularly well-carved out role within the crew (other than being the driver).<br/><br/>Fury is a suspense-filled, nail-biting war movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. It's the first movie I've seen that gives proper credit to the armoured regiments and this alone makes it stand out from the sea of WWII movies that are out there. The characters are weak, but the fantastic acting gives them the added dimensions they need, and the messages and themes are good and come across really well, but they sometimes become a detriment to the overall movie. Critically, Fury is a movie with many faults deserving of no more than a ""good"" 7/10, although I personally enjoyed it enough to maybe have rated it higher."

","April 1945, Nazi Germany. Don Collier leads his tank Fury's crew Bible, Gordo, and Grady after an ambush wipes out the rest of their platoon, killing his assistant driver. At the base, Don, speaking German himself, takes the liberty to crudely interrogate a Nazi POW on the spot. A young soldier Norman Ellison is assigned to replace the fallen driver, to the reluctance of Fury's crew. When Fury and four others convoy at a forest's edge, Norman spots a kid in Nazi uniform with a gun but hesitates to shoot, and the lead tank gets hit. The soldiers manage to retaliate, and Don smacks Norman, stating the soldiers' deaths are Norman's fault for not shooting. The remaining tanks then go to rescue soldiers in a field. When a fight breaks out, again Norman doubts to shoot. As the Americans win, Don holds Norman forcing him to kill a Nazi POW. Norman confronts Don about it. Don states Norman endangers Fury's crew by not doing his job, whereas Don promised to keep them alive. <br/><br/>The tanks go to secure a town. A battle breaks out. The crew fires incendiaries, burning alive two Nazis, which Norman shoots. Gordo tells him he should've let them burn. A civilian informs the soldiers of surrendering Nazis and they agree to it. An SS officer appears and Don orders a soldier to kill him, after confirming this officer hanged civilians refusing to fight for the Nazis. As the soldiers celebrate, Don and Norman see a girl and go there. Don asks the older woman there to prepare food and water, and gives Norman a chance to be alone with the younger woman Emma. The rest of Fury's crew arrive, disappointed they weren't invited. They then go for the next mission. Artillery barrages the town, killing Emma. Don then takes the tanks to secure a crossroads from an advancing unknown number of Nazis. On their way, a superior Tiger tank kills off one of them. The remaining three tries to maneuver at it as their guns can't pierce its armor. The Tiger manages to kill the other two but Fury manages to shoot at its rear, it's only weak point. <br/><br/>Fury reaches the crossroads but is immobilized as it triggers a land mine. As the crew fix the tracks, Don sends Norman as a lookout. Norman rushes back to Fury, informing the crew of hundreds of Nazis heading their way. The other men wants to flee but as Don refuses to do so, they eventually rejoin him for one last battle. They prepare guns and ammo and pass time talking. The Nazis come closing in, assuming the tank's busted. The crew opens fire, killing many. Norman runs out of ammo and the crew fights on to retrieve exterior mounted guns and ammo. One by one the crew is killed. Don is eventually shot several times by a sniper and he retreats inside Fury. Norman tells Don that he's scared and wants to surrender. Don tells him to escape through the bottom hatch. As Norman does so, Don is killed by the German grenades. A Nazi soldier crouches and finds Norman under the tank but he didn't say a word. As the morning comes, advancing US troops find Norman and retrieve him, stating he is a hero.<br/><br/>The story pits the moral contradictions in a war in such high extremes. Moreover, it shows that in such a situation of kill or be killed, often times there won't be enough time to choose, let alone to think. Failure to act can result in getting killed, or getting someone else killed. And after going through such hardships, having escaped and evaded death at times, one will surely find it hard to hold on his principles. One might even find it hard to stay sane.<br/><br/>The movie's vast reference to the Holy Bible somehow looks like it's trying to be such an ironic thing. It has gone well beyond the classic paradox of ""Thou shalt not kill' versus a soldier's duty of kill or be killed. The references are there, subtly and also distinctively, at the grand theme of reaffirming a soldier's cause to fight, and therefore to kill, by saying that it's the will of God, which builds on the said classic paradox. Thereference include the many scripture quotes, the direct nick-naming of Bible for Boyd Swan character, and also the ultimate reaffirming of the last shot's bird's eye angle.<br/><br/>The action is really nice, especially as there are less high profile movies focused on World War II tank crew. After having only The beast (1988) as a significant movie on tanks for quite a while, and that's not even entirely a war film, it's very nice to see great tank battle here in Fury. What's great about the action, particularly is the two tank battle sequences. They don't feature massive tank-on-tank all out shelling, but the real war situations where tanks are used mainly to cover for infantry movements.<br/><br/>For me the acting is a great job. The big names in the cast list really knows how to make the contrast of actions within the screenplay come out. Brad Pitt did a great job on being strict and harsh, and added in the nice accent play. Logan Lerman nicely depicts the fears, doubts and hesitations a newbie soldier has in the face of war atrocities, adequately balancing Brad Pitt's acting. Shia Lebouf really developed his acting and got out of his Sam Witwicky character nicely, playing his soldier role well. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal not only complete the real tank crew structure but they also provide contrasting characters that give the crew ensemble great potential for internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Fury (2014) is indeed a movie worthy of an 8 out of 10 score for me and a quick nod at recommendations. An entertainment it surely is, and a great new breath of fresh air for the focus on tank crews."

","The movie portrays the way that war effected those soldiers involved by following along with the newbie to the group, Norman. Norman Ellis was a thrown into his new position within the tank after only having been at a desk job before hand. The movie follows him through his transition of getting used to the job after fighting against what he is expected to do to his eventually starting to warm up to what his new position entails. Along the way he watches the war that is happening all around him and changes his view on what part he wants to play in it all. He becomes enthralled in the war and eventually has no problem aiming right at people, and soon enjoys the job and killing as many of his enemies as he can. This whole progression of just one of these five amazing main characters shows the massive effects that the war had on those involved with directly fighting in it. Norman showed us how an innocent young kid can be made into a barbarian killing machine when trained to be that way, or as some could see it, when thats what you need to do to survive."

Each and every scenes are very apt for the content / theme of war genre and they are very engaging for the audience.The performance by Brad Pitt, Shia are extraordinary. I personally liked the scenes with Brad and the youth guy who is reluctant to fight or kill.. the scene where they meet with a German family Brad asks the young lady to have fun with the young soldier as they are alive and young and the scene where Brad forces young guy to kill a Nazi soldier, and the scene where Brad says ""I am sorry kid"" at the end of the movie. All in all, it's a must watch for war movie lovers."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Fury follows a Sherman tank crew of four soldiers and a rookie as they take on a deadly mission in Nazi Germany. After being stranded alone, these men unite together to face hundreds of their enemy against overwhelming odds. This movie is small in scope but deep in showing the horrors of war and how it affects individuals. The story meanders from time to time but in the end the consistent brilliant performance by the cast is what keeps you engaged. <br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of war movies but I was excited to see Fury. This excitement was mainly because of Brad Pitt who is incredible, and Logan Lerman who I personally think has the potential to be a star in the future. <br/><br/>The strongest and best aspect of Fury is by far the performances by the actors. Every person, Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael PeÃ±a, Jon Bernthal, even Shia LaBeouf (regardless of his recent tabloid shenanigans) were all impressive. The characters they portray aren't exactly likable, but despite that you are rooting for them because through their performances you start to understand them. That's another strength of this movie, it shows the effect war has on the soldiers involved. They have had to do some horrific things to survive, the harshness of war has turned them into savages. At the same time you see some glimmer of humanity that they are desperately trying to cling onto. Logan Lerman playing the rookie, new to the war, is the perfect window from which we see these gruesome events. Also the tank battles and violence is not there to glorify war (this is not some 80s steroid-Stallone movie). Instead the gruesomeness is used to depict the brutal nature of war, there is real danger, real lives affected, with innocent causalities on both sides.<br/><br/>This movie is not without faults, and it has to do with the story. Overall the movie is just very predictable, and I don't mean just the ending, it is also the case for certain critical scenes. You know exactly how some of the scenes are going to pan out, so in a way there are some clichÃ©s that can be distracting. Also there is a part in the middle of the movie where the story slows down. Personally I didn't mind that because I thought it was vital to delve deeper into the characters, but I can understand the complaints from others that say that it felt like the movie came to a grinding halt at that point. Additionally it is a pity that the final climatic battle came off being unrealistic even though rest of the movie was depicted very accurately. The climax just went on for too long, making it very hard to believe that a stranded tank had any chance against hundreds of soldiers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Fury is a very strong movie with deep characters and perfectly showcasing the nature of war. This is not some grand war epic, it is an intimate story of five men trying to survive a war through the bond they have for each other. I would recommend Fury for the performances alone.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

"chantal-ashford","9","2","6","22 October 2014"," Fury is the War Movie of the Year.
","Fury is one of the best films of the year. It's amazing, emotional and definitely takes you into the world that was 1945 in Nazi Germany. <br/><br/>The film takes the journey of 5 men and their lives inside their home: Fury. A military tank, which they've been in for the last four years before one of them perished and is replaced with fresh meat. It shows the new soldier coming into this crazy world that is war and learning what he has to do to survive, even if it's not what he believes in. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is amazing as Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier, the man who has led these men to victory many times and promising them to get them home. As much as I don't want to say it, but this man carried this film, BUT Shia LaBeouf was right there behind him as Boyd ""Bible"" Swan serving as the moral compass of the crew. It was great to see LaBeouf back doing what he does best. He was amazing as well, and him and Pitt together is phenomenal. <br/><br/>Jon Bernthal, Michael PeÃ±a and Logan Lerman were incredible as well throughout the film. All five of these men were perfectly casted. They have the chemistry and made this movie. <br/><br/>David Ayer, the director gets dirty, gritty and bloody, showing what the soldiers went through in WWII. <br/><br/>I can definitely see this movie getting nominated in the following year, if it doesn't... It would be a disappointment."
"Matt_Layden","8","2","6","20 October 2014"," ""Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.""
","Fury is a brutal look at the men who find themselves stuck in the death traps known as tanks, in WWII. Brad Pitt leads those men on various missions and they just lost one of their own. A typist, who has never seen the war on the front lines, never killed man, never even fired a gun, is thrown into the tank, that these men call Fury. First, he has to clean out the blood and guts from his seat, the previous person in there has left pieces of himself all over, including part of his face. <br/><br/>Yes, Fury is gory, violent and relentless. It doesn't sugar coat the war and it shouldn't. Not only do people die left right and centre, but they do so in cruel and terrifying ways. One particular death that comes to mind is when a soldier would rather shoot himself in the head than burn alive. It's a shocking moment that makes you realize the horrors of our history. History is indeed violent. <br/><br/>Logan Lerman is Norman Ellison, the boy barely shaves and he is thrust into battle not knowing what to do. He is against killing anyone, it's against his morals, he simply cannot do it. That is until Pitt forces him, against his will, to kill a German soldier who pleads for his life. Another depressingly realistic scene in a film full of them. Pitt knows that if he doesn't break this kid down, he will be the death of Pitt's entire crew. His crew consists of a religious gunner, an impressive Shia LaBeouf, a hot headed redneck prone to outbursts, an outstanding Jon Bernthal and their driver who is consistently drunk, the always reliable Michael Pena. These men follow the orders of WarDaddy, a scarred and nobel Brad Pitt. People might try to relate his performance to Lt. Aldo Raine from Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, but the two are very different. He puts on a confident and brave face for his men, but behind the tough exterior is a scared man, who only admits his fear once. He predictably takes Lerman under his wing, the typical father-son relationship ensues, but aside from that and a clichÃ©d ""follow the leader at the darkest hour"" scene, the film is a fresh take on the WWII genre. <br/><br/>I say a fresh take because the focus is on the claustrophobic dynamic relationship these men have within the confines of the tank. I loved all the scenes that had me stuck inside with them. You feel the intensity in every moment. Ayer knows this and shoots the scene well enough so that even though you feel trapped, you never get lost or feel that you need to get out of the tank. When Ayer does take us out, he shows the risks and dangers of not being protected by Fury's walls. Even when you think you're safe, moments later you're not. Ayer shows his skill for the battle and the slow moving tanks make for heightened suspense. <br/><br/>Fury doesn't match the levels of Saving Private Ryan, but it's a realistic take on a time where good and bad men on BOTH sides of the war fought for what they believed in. Fury is entertaining and harrowing at the same time."
"joe_c_clifton","8","2","6","20 October 2014"," Enjoyable but could have been better
","With WWII being one of my favorite topics and Brad Pitt being my favorite actor I was certainly looking forward to this movie.<br/><br/>Pros: We see decent character development with the young adult, Norman, transforming from a scared kid to a warrior.<br/><br/>We got a look of Hollywood's take of the life inside of tank during WWII, which was very interesting.<br/><br/>We see an intense tank battle scene about Â¾ of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>We see a jaw dropping clip of what I assume to be hundreds of B-29 Superfortress bombers flying high in the sky on (or returning from) a massive bombing campaign. Although this clip was only about 20 seconds long it made seeing the film worth it to me.<br/><br/>We experience just the right amount of humor throughout the movie. There were a few scenes that cracked a small amount of humor, which is just right for a war movie. Too many action/drama movies seem to use too much humor in their movies, which ruins it for me.<br/><br/>Cons: The film appeared to be based on only one or two days, which sped up the character development way too fast (not a major con, just me being picky).<br/><br/>There were a couple of ""cheesy"" moments in the film, which I do not like to see in war/drama films.<br/><br/>The major con in this movie, for me, was the final battle scene. I hate to be ""that guy"" who points out the unrealistic scenes, but the final battle scene was incredibly unrealistic. 150-200 SS members battle it out against one immobilized tank and lose 100+ lives in the process. That would not have happened, even if the SS members were new and inexperienced.<br/><br/>Finally, I did not like how the SS soldier let Norman live at the very end. The SS were known for their brutality, and since Norman and his mates killed 100+ Germans in that scene I do not see that SS soldier sparing Norman's life.<br/><br/>Overall I found the movie to be entertaining but I was a little let down. 7.5 / 10"
"PostingandToasting","8","2","6","19 October 2014"," Fury: ""Ideals are Peaceful...History is Violent
","""Ideals are peaceful...History is Violent""<br/><br/>This is the justification that Brad Pitts' Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier gives to the young newcomer, Logan Lermans' Norman, as to why the violence and brutality exists in the war they fight. It also serves as the overlying message that director David Ayer is giving for his new WWII tank epic, ""Fury"". What is so hard with modern day WWII films is that it is so difficult to break new ground and try to tell a story that we haven't already seen before. Sure there are the aspects that we are always going to see (gratuitous violence, the male camaraderie, moral quandaries), but there is always a struggle to show the war in a different light that offers perspective and can challenge us emotionally in a way that we haven't seen.<br/><br/>""Fury"" does well in telling us a story from the unique perspective of a group of soldiers who reside within the thick, loud, and brutal walls of an American Sherman battle tank. Watching these men fight this massive war within the confines of a small metal box lets us see witness these men exist in an almost prison like state of violence ad bloodshed along with seeing their bond strengthen. The latter is even more evident with the addition of the new tank member who quickly learns what he is in for even though the only thing he knows how to do is ""type 60 words a minute"".<br/><br/>Some will criticize ""Fury"" for being almost over the top with the gore and violence, but that is how it was. Who are you servicing if the product that you put on screen doesn't accurately capture the brutality of the events? Will it make it more civilized? Will it make have more substance? Bullshit. These are the people who are turned off by the violence because they can't comprehend that part of history being the brutal reality that it was. Neither can I for that matter, but I recognize and acknowledge our violent history because without it the war isn't won and the ones who lost their lives ensuring that victory aren't given the justice they deserve. Not every WWII film can have some fictional romance or ""journey home"" that detracts attention from the violence just because you don't have the stomach to show it.<br/><br/>Again, Ideals are peaceful...History is Violent.<br/><br/>It's a treat watching Brad Pitt at this stage of his career. He is no longer the young and hot leading man whose main purpose is to be eye candy for the ladies. Here he is the grizzled veteran whose job is to lead men through hell and back and keeping them alive while doing so. Even when he isn't speaking, we feel that command that his Wardaddy has over the men under his command. They prove to be loose cannons and capable of losing control but at the end of the day, they acknowledge their C.O.'s control because they have an almost unbreakable trust in him. This is portrayed the best in a scene involving a captured German town and Wardaddy and Norman break their way into the apartment of a woman and her young daughter where they get a chance to have a meal and for Norman to get a little action with the daughter. In come the rest of the tank crew, drunk and disorderly, wondering why they weren't invited to this peaceful meal. The supporting cast does an admirable job as well. Lerman doesn't have much to work with in his role unfortunately as we see nothing new from his other past roles from films like ""Noah"" and ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal are solid here and Shia LaBeouf reminds us that he is very good at being able to cry on screen...he cries a lot....but it's OK...he is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>Now will ""Fury"" reach the level of ""Saving Private Ryan"" as some have said? No, but there is nothing wrong with not reaching the level of the best war film ever made. It's also a problem I have with how movies are received these days, especially when it comes to WWII films, in that there is so much pressure for them to be GREAT. It is the ""Great War"" (part II) and the most glorified event in entertainment history (especially in the American film industry) and the pressure to try to live up to that is unfair. It's interesting because the more recent war films that do tend to be more in the same violent vein as ""Fury"" (Lone Survivor comes to mind) have tended to resonate with audiences more. Seeing the brutality, as horrible as it may be, accentuates the story to a degree and makes the characters' triumphs/failures that much more profound. I think that should be the main goal for ""Fury"". If audiences walk out of this film feeling like they watched something powerful, something intense, that made them ""feel"" then that is all the recognition it needs."
"nathanaeldallaire","8","2","6","19 October 2014"," Pitt holds the movie together, much like he held his tank together as he commanded his men in battle.
","Fury makes a clear statement about war, holding closely to the tagline: ""War never ends quietly."" Yet, it does not come off as pretentious. Fury made a point, but, did not go as far as to border on agenda.<br/><br/>To be honest, this movie would be nothing without Pitt. He held the movie together, much like he held his tank members together as he commanded them in battle. The young Logan Lerman (Norman) did an alright job acting wise. Shia LeBeouf (Boyd 'Bible' Swan) really stood out in his supporting role. His character forced him to radiate a lot of emotion. Shia was able to let it flow naturally. John Bernthal was a nice fit as a crazy man role-player. Trini Garcia played the highly forgettable 5th wheel of the Fury tank. However, that is OK, he was not a detriment to the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline was not complex, it didn't have to be. Fury was a well written, very well acted, war movie. I really appreciated that Sony Pictures Entertainment avoided a lot of the normal war movie clichÃ©s. Also, the violence was rugged and may have been enough to make some viewers queasy at times. But, it was not gloriously forced in your face like as in Inglorious Bastards or Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>In my eyes, the last five minutes of Fury elevated itself from a 7/10 to an 8. There were a few different directions it could have gone. Lets just say it went in the correct direction. The ending is the most important above all part of a movie for me. Fury ended in a fantastic way. A particular one minute closing scene left me speechless. Very crafty and symbolic wrap up writing.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury reminded me of a serious version of Inglorious Bastards. I would not rate it as high as the great Tarantino flick though. Fury will not leave you with a pleasant taste in your mouth. But, it will leave you with things to think about. To me, Fury was about as good as a movie can be, without making me want to view it for a 2nd time in the next few years. 8/10"
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","2","6","17 October 2014"," War is Hell
","Though it can't seem to avoid dusting off nearly every war movie clichÃ© imaginable, 'Fury' is well made, well acted and features some of the most white-knuckle battle action ever captured on film.<br/><br/>The still somehow underrated Brad Pitt commands the screen just as his character Wardaddy commands his men. It would've been easy for Pitt to simply give in to caricature here, but he's become much too fine an actor for that. The rest of his men are more than equal to the task of overcoming their stock characters, particularly star in the making Logan Lerman.<br/><br/>'Fury' is no flag-waver, yet it also never strays into the realm of moral relativism that typically plagues modern war films. Instead any message fittingly gets lost in the haze of battle."

Although this film is somewhat mythic, it does reflect/represent the horrors of war. Logan, an Army typist who is sent to the front lines in Germany is an accurate statement about how our U.S. Army will recruit one for a specific specialty; only to send that soldier to God knows where else! (Sorry, Army buds, but that IS your rep even these many years later!)<br/><br/>Norman is an innocent lad tossed into the mire of WWII warfare. Somewhat studious and faithful, he has been thrown into a body mangling pit.

","Good old war crimes to the applause of the ignorant. As a movie it has great acting and cinematography. Maybe a good 'feel good' message you'd expect from the biased end of the hero's/winners, but it denies the truth of history, and is factually inaccurate. Right from the get go Hitler did not declare ""total war"" in 1945 and he did not mobilize all men women and children. He did declare total war in 1943 for materials and goods to be allocated to the war effort. War is harsh, the harshest even of human device, and of course no one wants to root for the historical 'bad guy'. However to glorify dehumanization in this way is also deplorable. If anything this film only affirms how just as guilty the US (who were late to the war to begin with) is of war crimes, and hopefully isn't meant in any way to be historically accurate. Watching this film as an aficionado of history especially pertaining to wars I was left more with a sour taste in my mouth than being entertained.<br/><br/>I understand this is a fictional movie based on fictional characters with fictional backstories in a true historical background. But that doesn't justify the glorification and demonization expressed in this movie. Every soldier follows orders, even when they don't know the truth of maliciousness behind them, no army is exempt from that fact. Maybe that was the message?, Didn't translate well."

","As war movies go, this one is not so bad. Lots of clichés of course. But I can't remember a war movie without any or all of those. That said, I don't remember seeing a WWII movie almost totally shot from inside a tank. I saw the cramped space. I imagine the stench of decayed bits of corpses in all the little places unreachable and «unbleachable». Little windows to see outside and the high probability of getting your upper body blown off if you have to open a hatch. And all this in a Sherman, a tin can compared to most of the heavy tanks the Nazis brought forth during the war. In battle, you're stuck in there, day after day, for months, if you are lucky, until you get finally blown off, just like the crews who were, minutes ago around you. I like this movie because it reminds us that men, ordinary men, fought and died in those things. Maybe some viewers have missed the point. As to the big fight scene at the end, well, I'll never get tired of seeing Nazis get mauled, even if it's just a fantasy. The bad guys have to fall."

Well they probably were trying to not give away their position as they were attempting to get into a better position. <br/><br/>Then people mentioning WWII movie clichés... Maybe that's because it's what happened during WWII??? I don't know just guessing there. <br/><br/>If you want to watch an entertaining movie with a well put together cast then give it a try.

I really don't think all these actors and crew got together for a charity film for Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>Really not sure why everyone is so upset that the Nazi's weren't depicted as being smarter.

"Wizard-8","Null","1","2","12 June 2015"," Not a classic, but serviceable
","In some aspects, ""Fury"" feels like an old fashioned war movie from several decades ago. The movie does dabble with character clichés that are right out of the golden age of Hollywood (the green recruit, the ethnic soldier, etc.) Though the war films from the golden age usually went into better depth with their characters; the characters here are somewhat thin. In its defense, the movie does make the interesting decision to not make all of its main characters completely likable; they all are shown to have some negative aspects. And while their constant swearing is a little annoying, I think that's how many soldiers in the battlefield talk. The movie is also more explicit than older war movies with its violence. There is some truly graphic violence here, but it's depicted in a way that shows that real warfare is not fun and games - it's serious business. I will admit that some of the tactics used by both sides in warfare in the movie are a little hard to swallow, but the battles are compelling all the same. And while the story suffers from the fact that it's basically a collection of (long) vignettes instead of one solid story, the movie is not boring despite lasting more than two hours.

","First of, Fury is just flat out awesome! You will be hooked from start to finish and there is never a dull moment. It has everything you look for in a war movie: Epic battles, blood, gore, and a love story.<br/><br/>The movie is also historically accurate when it comes to the equipment used and the clothes that are worn. Even the haircuts are historically accurate. It helps that all the clothes and weapons in the movie came from museums to ensure authenticity.<br/><br/>The plot is perfectly told and executed. The characters are developed perfectly as well. When you leave the theater you will want to go see it again as soon as you can! Two thumbs up! Best war movie ever made, hands down!"

"kevindahlen","7","2","7","15 April 2015"," VIsually Spectacular but Lacking Emotional Element
","The idea behind this movie, showing an in-depth view of an M4 Sherman Tank crew in the European theatre of WWII.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the movie is worth watching the movie on itself; the OK Corral final showdown was hokey at best, and Hollywood drivel at worst; to the point that it's just too easy to criticize, so I won't waste any more of your time on that subject.<br/><br/>The main character is extremely interesting, and well done by Brad Pitt. I think the movie also does a nice job demonstrating how war is ""not real"" in how people act. Nobody behaves in a manner that is indicative of normal life, nobody. They use the ""Typist"" as a person whom juxtaposes all of the others (including civilians) whose lives have been completely turned upside down, and they are just counting down to the moment they die. This is actually really unique, and never done before in a war film, but the producers couldn't just use that element as single dramatic element of the film; too busy trying to sell tickets with silly action movie scenes, and nut just the final scene.<br/><br/>On a technical point, the tank warfare shown is not accurate in that 4 Shermans would have never attacked a single Wehrmacht Panzer Tiger tank in the open field on purpose, when they could have easily called-in an air attack once they ID'd the Tiger tank. The US (by the way) produced 25 times more Shermans than the Germans manufactured Tigers, so obviously Tigers were not their only tank, but were there best (by far). The truth is the Germans made a mistake in producing such a sophisticate tank for the Wehrmacht because they took too long to produce. People love to hyperbolize how inferior the Sherman was to the Tiger, but war (as the movie states very well) is about killing your enemy as quickly as possible, and not about winning design contests."

"targe1314","6","2","7","9 February 2015"," A visual masterpiece that falls short on accuracy
","I had high expectations watching this movie, as I am a huge WWII tank buff and love the late model Shermans.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie was over the top and completely ridiculous, even more so than Saving Private Ryan, which until now was my worst modern WWII movie.<br/><br/>If you don't give a damn about historical accuracy then proceed no further as I have no time for you....<br/><br/>If you really want to understand tank combat, in WWII, then proceed further...<br/><br/>First, a history lesson. The Americans produced a very successful tank, the Sherman, during WWII. It was very easy to build, very easy to drive and fire, and they pumped them out like sausages.<br/><br/>The Germans, they went the other direction, starting in mid-WWII, they began producing very sophisticated tanks, including the Tiger I, the Panther, and late war, the Tiger II and JadgPanther (tank hunter) tanks. These tanks were very expensive, in very short supply, and the majority of tanks that the American shermans faced in the D-Day landings and beyond were the earlier Panzer-III and IV models. The IV was a basic match for the Sherman.<br/><br/>OK, so the movie starts with some random German officer riding his white horse through a battlefield, and getting jumped by a tank commander. this is ludicrous. No German officer would risk his life alone to ride through a recent battlefield. Silly.<br/><br/>The tank commander orders his new hull gunner to execute a German prisoner... Completely false and a HUGE insult to our veterans! The tank crew gets drunk and storms the tank commander's party. In WWII, that would have earned you an immediate court martial if they did not leave the room IMMEDIATELY. The tank commander was GOD, and he decided if you were going to be dragged away by the MP's or not.<br/><br/>A Tiger Mk 1 charges across an open field to engage 4 Shermans. Crazy. The Tiger was a long distance engager. It would sit back with it's 88mm gun and pick off enemy targets at will. It took an average of 5 sherman tanks, rushing it at FULL SPEED, to take one Tiger out. 4 of the 5 Shermans would NOT SURVIVE. THIS IS WAR, and the Americans knew this, which is why the Sherman crews would bail out as soon as they heard an 88mm shell landing anywhere near them! They knew their country had the advantage in production, and a new tank would be coming soon down the road.<br/><br/>On hitting a tank mine... you DO NOT send your crew to check out the local area! You are asking them to be ambushed and trigger further booby traps! Crazy stupid tactics. Any tank commander would leave the sides of the road for the infantry backup.<br/><br/>You are a single enemy tank in hostile territory and you find out a company (300+) of enemy infantry is moving on you. What do you do? Well, the easiest answer is you call in artillery and air support and get the hell out of there, on foot if possible.<br/><br/>A force this size, especially with anti-tank panzerfaust weapons as portrayed in the movie, is bad news. They will easily surround your tank, overcome the defenses, climb on board if they have to, and chuck grenades and high explosives down your hatches.<br/><br/>The tank commander takes 1 or 2 bullets and falls down into the tank and does not immedietely call for medical help.<br/><br/>Finally, if you want to watch a decent tank movie, watch ""the beast"", which is about a T-62 tank crew in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Before you reply to this, I am an experienced Canadian Soldier with multiple years of experience..."

","In first place I have to say that the current rate (7.7) is ridiculously high and therefore this is a highly overrated movie which should not have much more than a 6...<br/><br/>I was expecting much about this movie, since Brad Pitt usually has a good choice in movies he participates in, but how I was wrong in this case!<br/><br/>The movie's first half develops the story a little bit, introducing a young soldier who doesn't want to be there, and the path which leads him to be a real soldier, but even then I could not stop thinking that I've seen this before, and the sense of ""deja-vu"" doesn't stop there and kept me haunting on and on. I won't mention much of what are this ""deja-vu"" scenes, there are many reviews around which talk about them, but I couldn't stop being disappointed because I was expecting much more from Fury. The character development is poor and until the end of the movie I was expecting to know a bit more about those 5 soldiers on Fury, specially sergeant Wardaddy which the character is clearly ""lost"" in depth. I was also expecting some realistic war scenes but most of the battle situations are ridiculous, not only on the way they end, but on the way they start...<br/><br/>Although the action scenes are good - improbable but good - although the acting is nice, it all feels void, and in the end I could felt that this was just a movie and actors acting well, but not something to be taken seriously, specially the last battle which on a real situation would result on a quick defeat and very low casualties for the highly specialized German SS troops.<br/><br/>Overall this has to be considered as a poor movie, currently highly overrated on IMDb."

","It's too easy to hate on this guy, simply because of the sh*t he says or does. What makes it harder is that he's incredibly talented. He was unbelievably good here. The whole cast was strong, but he just did so much to a higher extent. He has a scene near the end that basically encapsulates how powerful acting can be when it's delivered in such affecting, lived-in realism. Not a single ounce of superficiality. Definitely in my Supporting Actor line-up, possibly my win, and I so wish the film was a bigger awards player just so he could be in the conversation <br/><br/>As for the film, way better than I expected.

Apparently they also killed women!<br/><br/>Another scene shows 4 Shermans, out in the open, right next to each other. A German heavy antitank cannon fires and misses, it bounces off, blabla. The tanks take it out quickly (what a surprise). Then, another German cannon fires at them (and misses of course) and quickly fires again. Why wasn't it firing together with the first cannon? Well, the movie would have ended pretty soon i guess. Also, reloading it was suddenly way slower for the third shot, how convenient. Tanks destroy it and advance. Total carnage, blabla, then a German soldier pops up from his foxhole with a panzerfaust. Tankdriver yells to shoot him, keeps yelling. The German soldier could have fired that thing 3 times by now!<br/><br/>Another scene shows the tank moving into a town, MG crew fires and the MG42 doesn't even sound like an mg42!<br/><br/>Tank turns right and faces an antitank cannon which fires but the round bounces off......again!!!! Also, what's with the tankcommanders standing out of the hatch during battle?<br/><br/>This is all at the beginning of the movie and the ending made me laugh, it's THAT horrible.<br/><br/>It's a brainless actionflick."

As I understand, they go from Town to Town fighting and fighting. Literally that's the case. They encounter one town, whereby Norman and Don are at a house. And as Norman is so under stress and distressed. He plays the piano and a lovely piece. You can see the happiness in his smile. I found that heartwarming. Considering what he's been through etc., etc., Sadly ALL but one perish in the final town. The Tank fell victim to a mine. So with that, they were stuck. One cool thing about the movie thou was we got to see INSIDE a tank. It was so awesome. So overall not bad a movie."
"squirrel_burst","8","2","7","15 November 2014"," Fury has its cake and eats it too
","There is a paradox in making an anti-war film. If you're telling the audience how awful war is, you don't want to show everything that you would expect out of a movie about a war. Things like protagonists who survive mission after mission, villains who need to be taken down and are finally defeated at the end of the hour-and-a-half running time, dramatic deaths where people get to give a short speech before life exits their bodies, cool sequences of combat and exciting moments with explosions. They're essential to a movie because movies are a visual medium and the moment you bring those images to the screen, you're glorifying combat. ""Fury"" is one of the rare instances where it can have its cake and eat it too. It is both an exciting war movie and a condemnation of the ugliness that is brought forth by armed conflict.<br/><br/>I want to talk about how brutal this movie is. This is an incredibly violent film. It's not gory, but it's violent and very disturbing in its violence. When people die in this film, and there are a lot of people that die, they die horrible deaths. People are set on fire by bombs, have their limbs blown off by high-speed projectiles, get reduced to red pulp by grenades or have chunks of their heads ripped out by shrapnel and bullets. The battlefield these soldiers are fighting on are covered in mud, the people that are fighting are covered with grime and the animosity between the two sides mean that for a lot of these people, a quick death is the best you can hope for. I found the violence to be shocking, sudden and very unsettling, even more so because it's often so casual. Someone gets shot in the head and crumples over like a rag doll but it's no big deal because these soldiers have seen it time and time again.<br/><br/>There were things that never dawned on me before I watched this movie. Things like the fact that tanks are more than bullet-proof cannons on wheels, they're also massive vehicles and if you don't get out of the way fast enough, you're going to get crushed. Reduced to paste underneath those treads. That's a frightening and horrible way to die and something that probably happened to a lot of soldiers. Let's say that you've got a scenario where you're in a dugout and you're shooting at some tanks. The tanks just keep advancing no matter how many bullets hit them and they fire back. Get out of that hole, and you're going to get shot. Stay inside and you're going to get crushed. Other things that I never really thought about that I saw during this movie included the way tanks must have operated in combat. The way not only bullets, but rockets easily bounce off of the armor, the way the people inside have to look through tiny slits and bombard opponents or the way that these armored fortresses becomes people's homes once they've been in there long enough fascinated me.<br/><br/>I found that all of the performances in the film were quite good. I thought the characters were deceptively complicated and it allowed the performers to really shine. Even some of the ""bad guys"" that at first I thought would just be one-dimensional jerks have moments where they show that they are real people. I thought ""Fury"" looked great not only because of the special effects, but also because of the accuracy of the sets, the costumes and the vehicles. I even liked some of the visual stylistic choices. There are some examples of great cinematography, a lot of images you've never seen before and some small decisions here and there that really help make some of the battle sequences easy to follow.<br/><br/>Some people are going to criticize the end of the movie because a large chunk of it is dedicated to a big, special effects-heavy and impressive sequence. For the majority of the film, we're seeing combat through the eyes of the newcomer to the crew. He is appalled, as we as regular civilians are, at what he sees. The carnage on the battlefield, the way that war changes good men into animals, the senseless death, the degradation of morals, the way people revel in killing each other. As it is explained it to him though, this is what war is. Even though that enemy soldier has a wife and a son, he is going to kill you unless you kill him first. So what can you do? To stop yourself from going crazy, just embrace your situation. It's really easy to say that shooting soldiers that are surrendering is wrong, but until you've been in that situation yourself, you don't know what it's like. That's what works about the end here. For the bulk of the movie, you're the civilian on the outside looking in. But this movie runs 2 hours and 15 minutes. The running time means that eventually you begin associating more with the people in the movie than you do with the ""real"" world. Like the men inside the war, your attitude changes and you don't think of enemy soldiers as people anymore, you see them as threats. The film is more than just a show you're watching, it's a way to get yourself into the head of the people on the battlefield. If only for that second half of the movie, the story changes you.<br/><br/>""Fury"" does not glorify war, but it isn't a sappy drama on the subject either. It's an exciting action movie and a moving drama too. There are some images and some ideas brought forth by this film that I will never forget. I have a lot of admiration for ""Fury"" and I strongly encourage you to go see it on the big screen, where the explosions are going to be loud and shocking.

"TheSquiss","8","2","7","27 October 2014"," Shocking, bloody, harrowing film of WWII depravity and heroism.
","Fury has arrived amid much fanfare but it opens with a slow, cold eerily beautiful shot redolent of Lawrence of Arabia, albeit with an air of doom rather than mystery and promise. As the distant, wandering human figure arrives at an impromptu tank graveyard haunted by the smoky spectres of burning machines and the silence of death, the scene is set, the characters are established and we are left in no doubt as to the tone of the next two hours.<br/><br/>David Ayer's war film sits somewhere between Saving Private Ryan and The Magnificent Seven as a film of brotherhood against all odds. It is April, 1945 and the Allies are pushing through Germany in the final stages of WWII. In the midst of it is a battered Sherman tank that will not die, containing a crew of cynical, war-hardened, embittered soldiers who will not give in. Commanded by Wardaddy (Brad Pitt), the crew emerges from yet another onslaught, bloodied, shattered and one soldier down. There is little time to recover before they are sent on another mission, the quintet completed by greenstick Norman (Logan Lerman - Noah, The Perks of Being a Wallflower) a soldier whose only war experience is a few months typing at a desk.<br/><br/>The greatest achievement of Fury is the depiction of the horror and barbarism of war. Horror is not vampires and monsters, it is what humankind does to its itself; it is what ordinary human beings do to each other in extraordinary circumstances. Wardaddy might have been a decent man once but now he has been all but stripped of his humanity. He and his crew fight, kill, maim and abuse in order, not just to survive, but also to inflict pain and degradation on whatever and whomever they determine is the enemy. This is horror, physical and emotional, in great, grotesque, slopping bucket loads from the pieces of face splattered across the tank to the knuckle-chewing dread of what they might do to German civilians or prisoners of war.<br/><br/>Director David Ayer (Sabotage, End of Watch) has not taken the gung-ho stance of showing American soldiers as the heroes of the hour nor presented the convenient 'truth' that the enemy was bad and the allies good. We like to convince ourselves that the Allied troops fought a gentlemanly war against animals but Ayer leaves us in no doubt as to the horror and crimes they, too, committed in the name, and under the pressure, of war.<br/><br/>Fury is intense. It is angry and shocking. It is sickening and harrowing. It is a bloody, stomach-churning insight into the despicable acts that both sides committed and a particular sequence in a house with two innocent German women is terrifying for the possibility of what ordinary men may or may not inflict upon them.<br/><br/>Frequently Fury is not enjoyable, and nor should it be. At times it is harrowing to observe and Ayer has ensured every shot is truthful, even if the plot is rather more fantastic than realistic. The production design is remarkable with ankle-deep mud hindering escaping refugees while rubble smoulders around them. Even the peripheral shots are crafted with wince inducing care from the crushed and humiliated POWs pressed against wire to the desperate woman hacking at the carcass of a fallen horse for food. <br/><br/>But though Fury is often difficult to watch, Ayer's screenplay is also funny at times, lightning the atmosphere and allowing us to understand the camaraderie between Wardaddy, Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Peña), Coon-Ass (Jon Bernthal) and Norman. Though their actions are frequently unjustifiable, Ayer is careful to make them understandable without giving them a rose-tinted glow. That they regard the breaking of Norman's spirit as an achievement and an imperative is a damning statement about their war thus far. It is little wonder that so many veterans refused to discuss their experiences of war.<br/><br/>Steven Price's score takes us back to the atmospherics of his Oscar-winning composition for Gravity. Again, his work is powerful, mechanical and intense, accentuating the harrowing visuals beautifully.<br/><br/>The final act of Fury is a Custer's last stand of epic proportions. It is unrealistic and portrays the SS not as evil but as thoroughly inept. No, there is little chance of such a stand off occurring or lasting so long but Fury is, after all, a work of fiction set against a very real, actual horror. The Boys Own adventure heroics are forgivable in a film of warfare when no pretence has been made of this being a real occurrence.<br/><br/>I've read a couple of other reviews in the 'established' magazines/newspapers and there seems to be a snobbery about Rage, with them awarding low ratings. I don't see the issue. Nothing will have the impact that Saving Private Ryan did with the Omaha beach scenes. In that, Spielberg set a whole new benchmark with visual impact. But here Ayre takes us back to similar emotions and doesn't pull any punches in his depiction of the depravity to which some will stoop and the heroism that a few will attain.<br/><br/>Fury is not a fun war movie. War is horrific and we should not fool ourselves into believing otherwise. In that, Fury is a triumph.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"Troy_Campbell","7","2","7","25 October 2014"," Tense, entertaining and occasionally brilliant.
","Following a tank crew on their trek through Germany, this WWII saga is a mixed bag; it has a list of flaws as long as a small novel, however it also has energy, intensity and acting prowess to burn. David Ayer (End of Watch, Street Kings, Sabotage) has always been a take-it-or- leave-it type of filmmaker that has split critical opinion, and his latest won't change minds on either side of the Ayer-fence. A mishmash tone that swings from earnest war drama to Hollywood action flick and a propensity to linger too long on certain scenes are the primary faults that stop this motion picture from soaring. Yet somehow it still comes out the other end as a largely entertaining and gripping film with glimpses of brilliance. There are two tank battle set pieces that are utterly enthralling and showcase Ayer's obvious skill for action, whilst Roman Vasyanov's magnificent cinematography – all gloomy clouds and dirty, muddy realism – brings a sombre atmosphere that lends the film an extra layer of gravitas. Ultimately, though, this a showcase for the ensemble cast to shine. Brad Pitt is commanding as the gruff and uncompromising tank leader who just wants to keep his men alive; Shia LeBeouf defies the Shia-haters with an impressive turn as Pitt's emotional right-hand man; Logan Lerman delivers the finest performance of his burgeoning career as the inexperienced newby; and Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal round out the gang solidly. Despite not being the Saving Private Ryan of 2014 it could have been, Fury remains a tense and occasionally fascinating cinematic experience."

","Not as good as Das Boot of course, but you get glimpses of the same gritty, smelly cramped soldiers who desperately fight their war through a machine they have to be completely in tune with.<br/><br/>This film has been plagued with Saving Private Ryan comparisons and that really is too bad. Those expectations will cause some disappointment. There was a wholesome all American quality to the soldiers in SPR that is nowhere to be seen in this film.<br/><br/>These 2nd Armor guys have been fighting since North Africa and are still trudging along at the spearhead of the Allied advance almost a year after D-Day. If this were a modern conflict, they'd be pulled off the line and would be undergoing PTSD treatment. You wouldn't want to share a cab with any of them, and if you threw them in street clothes you might mistake them for homeless people with mental illnesses.<br/><br/>There is an ""End of the War"" quality to this film that doesn't match the D-day esprit de corps. Most of the soldiers you see in this movie have already passed their breaking point. This fact adds a realism to these characters you rarely see in movies like this.<br/><br/>Excellent historical realism. Excellently choreographed tank battles. Excellent character performances.

"eddie_baggins","8","2","7","23 October 2014"," A gritty well acted war film with an overblown ending
","As much as I was personally anticipating Fury, I must admit to not being fully prepared for just what a visceral and uncompromisingly brutal film David Ayer's war tale is. Without question this is one of the starkest, dirtiest and most downright unflinching big-budget war films I've ever seen. Every bullet that flies past, and every dropped bomb that you feel is quite an experience, and its full credit to Ayer and his very talented cast that the film is the end product it is.<br/><br/>Fury opens without any fanfare, showing a smoke strewn battle field punctuated by a lone German officer on a white horse, but what happens next sets the tone for the entire film. Ayer cares not much for backstory, there are no training montages here and he cares only to thrust the viewer straight into the belly of life in the Great War, and more accurately life in a tank. This is one of Fury's greatest strengths; much like Wolfgang Petersons submarine-set masterpiece Das Boot, when the camera is in this confined space so too is the audience. It's not at all a comfortable experience, but as we see here, and know anyway, war is anything but comfortable. As Brad Pitt's ""Wardaddy"" tells Logan Lerman's fresh-from-the-office Norman: ""Don't get attached to anybody"" and ""you're never safe,"" never do we feel that these men inside ""Fury"" are safe nor do we truly become attached to anyone. It's a feat for the film to achieve this, but also ultimately a downfall.<br/><br/>There is so much history to these characters in Fury, from Wardaddy's scarred back, through to their time in Africa, yet we remain largely un-privy to these events and it lessens the impact we feel for these men and their mission. The crew is all largely likable, with Pitt once more producing a star turn, but his ably supported by Lerman in what is a finely grown-up turn by him and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal in what is his best big screen role to date. Michael Pena is solid if not overwhelming, while brown bag wearing Shia LaBeouf is a weak point in a role that sees him crying at any given opportunity. It's one of the more memorable war parties we've been witness to in recent cinema history, and while it doesn't quite reach a Saving Private Ryan level of success in concerns to this, it's not far off.<br/><br/>Sadly though, no work by the actors could've truly saved the film's weakest and most disappointing element, its finale.<br/><br/>All the groundwork laid so solidly by Fury's opening stanzas and realistic approach to the war is almost entirely undone by the films last hurrah. Without entering too much into spoiler territory, to say that Fury's big showcase is overblown would be a massive understatement. It feels driven by a want to once more showcase Americans as one-man wrecking machines and actually feels like it belongs in another film. The actors are all still great, and the direction consistently engaging yet it can't help hide the fact that the film an entirely different beast in the last 30 – 40 minutes and it's sadly worse off for it.<br/><br/>Barring its ending, Fury is often close to masterpiece-like material, and all being said the film judged as a whole is still one of the more memorable and well-made war tales in recent memory. In setting out to show that war is hell and anything but glorious, Fury succeeds in all departments bar its misguided ending.

"mm-39","8","2","7","23 October 2014"," One strong movie!
","I went into the theater wondering if Fury would be just another war movie. Been there done that. Fury is well acted, written, and directed. The character driven story is one of Pitt's strongest performances. The story of an innocent young recruit who is mentored by a harden warrior. As the movie unfolds one sees the human side of Pitt's character tempered with the warrior side(Brad Pitt). The director unfolds the brutality of the human experience, and the reasoning for the butchery. The Waffen S S marching scene creates an essence of the spirit and fanaticism of the enemy. One understands after seeing the enemy why Pitt's character goes on the suicide mission. Compassion/responsibility drives Pitt's character to fight so others may live. A powerful ending where a young S S soldier shows his human side gave the movie hope in a world of brutality. Fury is an eight star movie."
"alemieux34","9","2","7","23 October 2014"," Great War Movie. Soon to be a classic
","So, if you saw Oliver Stone's Platoon (with Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willem Defoe), well then you basically saw Fury, albeit in a different setting. In Platoon, Charlie Sheen's character is a new recruit taken to the jungle's of Vietnam and having no war experience, is taught the ways of war by two separate father figures in Defoe and Berenger.<br/><br/>In Fury, Logan Lerman's character is also a new recruit with just 6 weeks of training and is forced to join Brad Pitt's Fury crew. Throughout the story, it's a troubling journey for the young belly gunner who has trouble killing anyone, even the enemy. Pitt becomes the father figure and the rest of the crew initiate the recruit into the ways of war.<br/><br/>Whereas Defoe's character is the religious or spiritual type and tries to good by everyone, Leboef's character is similar, though gritty. I think he's come a long way from his Transformer days and gives an amazingly poignant rendition of his character. Although Pitt's character is clearly in command, it's Leboef's character that is the glue that keeps the crew together, the heart of the crew.<br/><br/>There are some pretty gruesome war action sequences which are tough to watch. The violence is as real as the brutality seen in Braveheart. It's a gritty war movie with a lot of raw moments. There are some very real tension brought out between these characters and the enemy and some very gripping sequences of tension between the characters themselves.<br/><br/>In the end, Fury is a fantastic war movie and brings about the same questions all war movies tend to ask: ""What is war all about?"" ""What's it like to be in war?"" ""What is the point of this war?"" But also, what is the personal journey of the soldier through such actions. Lerman's character goes through a very personal transformation through his comrades in arms and through the painful reality of war. As usual Pitt puts in a great performance and his portrayal of the conflicted commander is very real."

","Last night I watched ""Fury""... It's a good movie. Actually, it is a great propaganda movie. Who was at war can identify a dose of reality in this movie, although sometimes it looks like a first person shooter. It is impossible that a tank surrounded by soldiers with anti-tank weapons survive as long as the Fury remained at the end of the movie. Fury is certainly worth a look. Fans of the genre and fans of Brad Pitt will most appreciate this movie. After watching this, I look at the killing of children in Afghanistan, Iraq or Syria with a lot less conviction. How it sounds ""Taliban youth"" (German word for youth), ""terrorist youth"", ""chemical weapons youth""... Or collateral damage remains politically acceptable term?"

","Fury has its truly astounding scenes while also having some forgettable scenes. No spoilers, but the movie would have been near gold had the ending not be so cliché. All in all, a solid film. Pitt delivers as expected as does the rest of the cast. Shia for sure did not have an Oscar winning performance, but surely shut down all the hate that has been thrown his way. He played the part extremely well. The film doesn't deliver on ""best war movie in 30 years"" but does deliver a film that will mean something to you. One last note-the special effects were flawless minus the absolute horribly colored rounds of bullets/tank guns. Fury."
"Kmark1293","7","2","7","17 October 2014"," Not the best WWII movie, but still worth a recommendation
","Fury stars Brad Pitt, Shia LeBeouf, Logan Lerman, John Bernthal, and Michael Pena as a five-man operating squad commanding the tank known as ""Fury"" in an effort to push the Ally forces into the heart of Nazi Germany. After seeing and enjoying David Ayer's ""End of Watch,"" I was curious to find out how his gritty, fast-paced style of directing could work in a World War II setting. Surely enough, it was another great offering in the plethora of films based around the second world war, showcasing the amount of tension the Allies were facing on the European side. Although it is not the best war movie out there, it is still worth a recommendation if you're not sick and tired of seeing another depiction of the WWII.<br/><br/>In terms of having an engaging story, Fury's script is fairly simple and straight to the point. It follows a tank crew lead by Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) in an effort go further into deep Nazi territory, which includes all the drama and intensity associated with such a daunting mission. The dialogue is fairly blunt and straightforward and at times, the plot can be easily predictable. The pacing of the story manages to keep the plot going despite having some scenes that were unnecessary filler and could have been taken out from the final cut. <br/><br/>The cast of characters are fairly solid across the board with just the right amount of interaction and personality to make them worth rooting for. Although I would have liked to see more development within the cast being presented, each one of the actors did a fine job portraying their given roles. As for standouts, they mainly consist of Brad Pitt's role as Wardaddy and Logan Lerman's role as Norman, the newly enlisted member of the tank crew.<br/><br/>The biggest standout for Fury is the grueling action being depicted on screen and it is definitely not a pretty sight. The various scenes of violence are very brutal to watch and they end up painting a bleak, ugly picture of being out in the battlefront of a major war. The cinematography is also being utilized fairly well to keep a steady focus on the action along with the nice editing to further add a stylized touch.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury remains as a well-made WWII movie and all the usual acts and clichés associate with this genre. With its simple story-line, brutal action sequences, and a good cast to boot, this latest offing by David Ayer is another great hit in his directing career. It may not be the best war movie ever, but it is still worth checking out nonetheless."

"bjones","9","3","13","19 October 2014"," Superb
","The last couple of years have been rough for me. I even asked myself if I should be going to a movie like this at all. But curiosity overwhelmed me. My expectations weren't high, but I had a vague hope that at least the production values looked good from the trailers. I didn't expect more than that. <br/><br/>I have to admit that I liked this film far more than I expected to. It was excellent all around with few sour notes and those are too minor for most people to ever notice. <br/><br/>To begin, the score, art direction, sets, set decoration, makeup, costuming and cinematography were superb. The cinematography was what, in my opinion, really made the look of the film. It took the most barbaric, brutish of subjects and made it visually glorious. It was really beautifully done; definitely Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>The sound and sound effects were excellent throughout; especially difficult in this type of film. Location selection seemed to fit perfectly as well. <br/><br/>That brings me direction and acting. David Ayer directed as well as wrote the script. Perhaps that made the direction part of the effort easier; no arguments with the writers! He's known for some fairly good action films; of which this is now the best.<br/><br/>The primary actors, Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña, and Jon Bernthal all had significant screen time. All of them were superb with this material; with Pitt shining the most. His blunt portrayal is spot on to some actual soldiers I've known quite well. Congratulations Mr. Pitt; you deserve some recognition from your peers for this. If you don't get that - which seems unthinkable - you at least have my thanks. I found myself wondering, as I almost never do, where Pitt, LaBeouf and Lerman found within themselves the appropriate and terrific emotions for the job they did. I can't imagine it being easy for them at all; which somewhat adds to the experience of watching them.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were quite good as well, especially Peña; and Bernthal may actually be somewhat hurt by his excellent portrayal, such was the degree of unpleasantness he elicited.<br/><br/>Two ladies, Anamaria Marinca as Irma and Alicia Von Rittberg as her cousin Emma; were excellent in the small dialog they were given to work with. Both had to convey a great deal through unspoken action and I could almost taste their discomfort and fear. This was especially true of Marinca for me. I couldn't take my eyes off of her when she was on screen; especially in closeup.<br/><br/>For the rest, for me this was so realistic it teetered on the edge of uncomfortable, being too close to some exceedingly unpleasant personal memories; especially with the great sound effects. I especially liked the job they did of bringing the MG42 and Ma Deuce to life. Congratulations for a job well done!<br/><br/>For older ladies in the audience, I can hold this film up as an example of why many veterans do not talk about their experiences. They are too inhumanly ghastly to withstand explanation to those without such experience, and trying to find the words to explain things is just too emotionally draining. <br/><br/>All of this ads up to a great movie going experience. I hope you can enjoy the film. I may have a few nightmares; but I handle those better than I used to."

The young gunner in the front seat with his single forward pointing machine gun having hundreds of German running back and forth like chickens in front of his sights for the entire battle is ludicrous... In the real world a crew in this situation (Trapped in an immobilized tank surrounded on all sides by 200 veteran SS soldiers with dozens of anti tank weapons!) would have been killed within 10 seconds. The dialogs are long-winded, absurd and destroy the momentum of the movie. The script seems copied on SPR without the realism and the intensity.

"michaelradny","6","2","8","11 October 2015"," Furry
","Fury starts out gritty and ends gritty; blood, guts and faces flying all around the place in this violent war action films. However, despite a solid start to the film, the majority of it just doesn't pop, with boring action and fighting sequences, one dimensional characters and a pretty clichéd and rundown storyline. The final scene feels to much like a Tarrentino film, and doesn't fit in with the rest of the films pace and the suspense that is meant to be given just doesn't reach you. <br/><br/>Whilst it is moderately entertaining, there are just too many holes and unrealistic scenes to make this a classic war film. Whilst I will say it is a different take on the World War Two battlefront, it just doesn't always connect."
"reallaplaine","8","2","8","15 March 2015"," Excellent rendering
","This was an excellent rendering of life in a war zone. It defies the propaganda war films which came out post-World War II which portrayed the glory of it all. The characterizations were believable. The internal conflicts that the Fury (the 5 man tank-team) experienced, fighting to survive in a brutal war where humankind murdered one another, all the while challenged by their own basic goodness, was compelling. Brad Pitt's performance was his most mature. Fury is on the same level as Band of Brothers - showing that when a high caliber bullet hits a man's head, it disappears. It's horrific, but real. And like the film Platoon, one of the best renderings about the Vietnam conflict, Fury also helps to debunk the ""glory"" of war, demonstrating that innocence is one of its first victims, and showing it for what it really is - insanity with a uniform."

","Incredible film, definitely one of the best films made in the war genre. the performance of the actors is outstanding and very realistic, as one who has served in the army and with many friends who actually served in tank crews and even some that were in war can really appreciate the amount of work the director and actors went through to make sure this film is as realistic as possible, if someone would have told me that the film was a true story i would have believed it. exceptional performance of the actors and their relationship with each other is one of the parts that make this film so special, i have read on Wikipedia that the director David Ayer made the actors actually live for a period of time inside the tank, eating sleeping and defecating in the tank, i think this definitely added to the realism in the film. one of the best films of the past 10 years for sure."
"matija-lozancic","8","2","8","10 February 2015"," A great insight to a soldier's life
","Here is a movie that really set up a high level of expectations by huge advertising and hype. Some people tend to look at it through the scope of trailers and expectations but in case of ""Fury"" they shouldn't.<br/><br/>Sure, having Brad Pitt in a new war movie creates enough hype itself, but if you want to enjoy a new movie, do not come expecting an all-time blockbuster just because you saw a great trailer. That's why many people bash this movie. At start, I must say that I enjoyed the movie all along. There were some slow-paced moments but later you see why they fit in and build the story. Sure, driving around in tank isn't much of an excitement and nothing we haven't seen before, but it's the really emotional moments that make this movie stand out in it's genre. For example, when Don makes Norman kill a Nazi soldier, the apartment scene, and the preparation in the tank for the last battle. Action scenes are average, with the exception of the Tiger vs. three Sherman tanks, which was really realistic. What really drives the movie is the connection of Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. Logan as Norman is the key here. Brad as usually delivers a fine act and he almost completely becomes this allied war veteran, while Logan is, I dare say, even more convincing. John Bernthal was also a key ingredient in the crew chemistry. Shia LaBeouf and others are not worth mentioning.<br/><br/>This movie may have unrealistic battles, but that's not what it's about. ""Fury"" brilliantly shows what it means to be a soldier in a tank crew and having your life hanging on a thread, being prepared to die any second. Again, Norman as a rookie who haven't killed anyone before and Don as a veteran, make it great. Character development is good and steady, and some scenes will make you even cry. For the unrealistic last battle, i give it 8/10. Don't miss it."

Even when a movie is so horrible, I still grit my teeth and bare it, if not for the hope that it'll get better, than at least to be able to complain and joke and jab about it that much more with my husband.<br/><br/>This one was different.<br/><br/>Without revealing any spoilers, this movie pulls and tugs on the emotions, drawing them out much like a conductor draws music from their musicians. Watching the main character's transformation was heart wrenching, painful, and yet somehow natural.<br/><br/>It's a sad thing to see so many people dislike this film not because it didn't have amazing acting (which it does), not because the storyline was awful (which it isn't), but because it doesn't stick to historical facts. Movies are made for entertainment. Nowhere in the synopsis did I see any claim that this was based on a true story, or true events. They're robbing themselves of stunning entertainment because they chose to assume that every WWII movie had to be by the books.<br/><br/>If you want a fact-based movie about WWII, check out some documentaries. There are some really great ones out there and hold far more accurate facts than any movie made for entertainment. If you're looking to be entertained, to be engaged, to be drawn in, to be in tears, then this will be right up your alley."

Suffice to say Fury would not make my top 10 war movies list, and it beats me that it has a higher score than movies such as Cross of Iron. Well just my opinion of course! It's not all bad of course, but if you are looking for realism then I wouldn't bother, or watch it and turn away for the last 30 minutes."

"brendon653","3","2","8","10 January 2015"," Not very good...
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*** I will just get this out of the way quickly... Movies this bad haven't been made since the 1980's cliché flicks that usually involved Chuck Norris or Jean-Claude Van Damme. Brad Pitt I think is a very decent actor and I am surprised he accepted this role. This movie had a great potential to be done correctly, but it ended up being one of those movies where the enemy is incapable of returning accurate fire and the hero can stand up fully exposed unleashing thousands of round of ammunition without contest. Now for some back story about me, I am a WWII history buff and have seen many WWII movies, more than one of them has been bad but few of them make a mockery out of combat like this one. The scenery in the movie was great, the tanks were great, the costumes and the weapons and many more things about this movie were great, but the writing was AWFUL and the actors couldn't make anything out of it. This movie is an utter disappointment. I only enjoyed seeing an actual Tiger tank. Not many movies would I classify as a waste of time, even bad movies could have a good laugh or two or a good scene but this movie was really bad and it does go on my ""waste of time"" list. Only watch this if you want to see a Tiger tank in motion and see Brad Pitt do a good job with a horrible story, and most of the supporting actors were quite bad as well but its hard to judge with how bad the writing was."
"shaneb-209-806026","3","2","8","10 January 2015"," Although loud, Fury still fires a blank.
","If Saving Private Ryan is a heat seeking missile then Fury is a stray mortar. It has a target in mind, but is way off. There are ahem, 'similarities' in both movies (some would argue blatant concept rip offs). Although the WW2 setting is really where they end. Saving Private Ryan was a brilliantly constructed war epic which looked at soldier's battles, literally and figuratively - during a horrific time in history. It had gore, but the right amount at the right time - which can be highly effective. It had moments and conversations that were pertinent and not contrived, and showed us characters with great depth. Fury, was just dark and gory for the hell of it. In fact the gore was teetering on comical at times. Running over bodies, twice, thrice. Or the half a face left scorched on the inside of a tank wall. And how would war virgin 'typist', Norm - who had never seen battle or even fired a weapon react to said face on tank interior? 'Oh Darn', it seems...and then proceed to pop it in a bucket - instead of reeling back in horror, which would have been much more realistic. It gets better though. A few scenes on this rookie tank gunner swiftly morphs from melancholic mummy misser, to fearless tank ace screaming wildly at the Nazis. In fact, the naive young kid became so irrationally agro and unlikeable, we wanted him to die. I'm sure that wasn't meant? In fact, he and the entire tank squad were so over the top in their tacky, ribald behaviour - it was annoying. Sure, war can cause people to 'harden up' and become a bit sociopathic, but these characters were created to be downright Neanderthal -like; it was hard to watch. Brad Pitt plays Sergeant, 'Warddaddy' who is a part time maniacal, pugnacious, war crimes criminal - part time articulate philosopher. ''Ideals are peaceful, history is violent'' he exclaims at one point. Funny though, all this not taking the War Daddy advice is in fact what keeps Norm alive in the end. 'Don't surrender', he urges his young protégé at the end. Funnily, Norm's surrendering to a young SS soldier who, inexplicably doesn't report the sighting, saves his life - instead of the war daddy advised, shoot em up. The bible came up now and then, but seemed under effective as a component. Only until the final shootout did the religious Shia LaBeouf read a passage that one might have thought it would be the profound idea to sum up everything. But it wasn't. It was one of many segments in the movie that sought to establish some idea exploration, or emotional response - but didn't. They ended up being empty time fillers. As if it was just a gore obsessed flick with an uninspired attempt at a thought provoking war story. Apart from the intense, well shot action scenes- the rest were unnatural and artificial. For instance, the dinner scene promised some catharsis and some 'meat and potatoes' to the characters. Instead we got a bizarre scene where attractive 'shaking with fear' German girl, Emma, bursts into song with Norm on the keys. So once again, we are meant to believe a typist who is a gun on the piano is the only guy available to drive shotgun with a bunch of blood lusting tank guys. Right. Soon the rest of the squad stumble into the room, all liquored up which promised some pertinent confrontations. Granted there was some raw dialogue and a tense situation, which was for a moment promising something quite poignant - it too went nowhere. In fact, the detached tracks on the tank at the end was quite the metaphor for the entire flick. Loud but directionless. Almost as if the movie periodically switched between genres. War drama at times. Then bodies comically strewn everywhere, Tarantino-style at others. I found myself waiting the whole movie to get the point to it all when really I should have switched off and watched the bang bang. Oh and Pitt took his shirt off."

","Without being facetious at all, the only worth while moment in this film was Brad Pitt taking his shirt off and revealing that yes, at 51, he's still got it.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was an endurance test through some of the worst 'frat boy' dialogue I've ever heard. If you took the words ""pv$$y, ""motherfv*ker"" and ""Nazi scum"" out of the script, you'd pretty much be left with some bible quotes and a few lines of Brad Pitt speaking atrocious German.<br/><br/>Characters shout, cuss and antagonize each other to an aggravating degree. The story arc is so predictable you will have figured out who's going to die in the end after the first 15 minutes. The pacing is arduously bloated in parts, most notably during a sequence involving the film's only two female characters. It drags out for what seems like 20 minutes during which very little is said, but has plenty of pointlessly awkward tension that amounts to nothing.<br/><br/>I was at least expecting to be entertained by some explosive action, but the battle sequences were disappointingly dull, repetitive and messily edited. Also some of the post-production effects were rather cheap; the bullet rounds looked like laser fire from the Starship Enterprise.<br/><br/>Worst of all for me was the director's failure in his obvious attempt to impart emotional weight to all the flagrant violence. We see glimpses of the crew's frailty beneath the veneer of bravado, but it all feels so forced. Shia LaBeouf spends the majority of his screen time with a puffy frog-eyed expression as if he's constantly on the verge of tears. Bible verses are recited, violins surge, people are blown apart like shredded pork, yet I never felt impassioned by any of it, and kept thinking how Spielberg did it so much better in 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>Performance wise, Logan Lerman's character is the only one who generates any sympathy. Brad Pitt talks in that same fake-sounding 'Muurican' accent he adopted for ""Inglorious Basterds"". It sounds strained, like a teenager trying to seem gruffer than he is. The other two mutts are clearly meant to be annoying and antagonistic, but their 'redemption' doesn't come early enough, and I was honestly willing them to die sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>All in all, I cannot understand how ""Fury"" garnered such positive reviews. It's undeniable that compared to the many great war movies from which it borrows, it is definitely on the lower tier."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","8","4 November 2014"," superb moments amid 'Hollywood' war-time stuff
","I have to wonder if Fury had been made by, I don't know, Sam Peckinpah or Robert Aldrich or George Roy Hill or someone if it might be more effective or memorable. Of course, those guys have been gone for years, and David Ayer seems to want to aspire to those filmmaker's heights of having real 'macho' male cinema on a grand Hollywood scale with blood and guts and camaraderie for the characters and all. Fury is more ambitious for this director than some of his past work - think Hard Times with Christian Bale or even End of Watch, which had a wonderful script and performers amid some terrible direction - and he clearly put a lot of heart and soul in to it. Sadly, there's some Hollywood Movie-BS as well.<br/><br/>This isn't to say the premise isn't intriguing, and one we might have not seen quite this way, though there have been countless WW2 flicks: a young man, basically untrained outside of clerical work (Lerman) is assigned to the 'Fury' tank led by Brad Pitt and including the likes of Shia LaBeouf (rocking a mean mustache), Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal, and among them he is by far the greenest of the lot. The men don't like him that much - the beginning of the film shows one of their men has just died, which is why they need a replacement - but have no choice as they plunge ahead in Germany near the end of the war.<br/><br/>The problems with the story come from familiarity, and lots of it. It's hard, for example, if you have seen Saving Private Ryan to not see the similarity with Jeremy Davies joining Tom Hanks' bunch in that film. This time Ayer ups the sort of 'horror' quotient of war, like Pitt's Sgt making Lerman's character shoot a captured German soldier and it becoming a whole big thing. It's tough to watch, but more-so because it feels too melodramatic, even for a war film. Of course Pitt's character has his reasons: as he says he's killed Germans in Africa and throughout Europe for three years, and he's been weathered by the war. It sets up a natural conflict to have this newbie in their ranks who has to come up to snuff with where the real MEN are at (in caps).<br/><br/>There's a lot of big talk, and even bigger war set pieces, especially when it comes time for tank vs tank (and while the Fury isn't the only one, there are a few others, it comes down to one tank vs the other and it is probably the most thrilling part of the film as far as the action goes). But the characters just didn't seem that deep at all, though the actors certainly try to imbue them with more. Pitt of course just has full-on Star quality, as he also did in his other (much greater) war flick Inglourious Basterds. LaBeouf is half very good and half... well, when he gets upset in a scene or emotional, tears flow and it feels just uncomfortable to watch. Bernthal is one dimensional. Pena is okay, and Lerman does what he can as the sort of ""audience"" surrogate.<br/><br/>Fury does have a tremendous set-piece though, which feels almost like a short film amid the other set-pieces of the whole (its not like there's one mission for the Fury tank, it's a bunch leading up to the climax which Ill get to in a moment). But it doesn't involve a lot of violence on the physical scale really; the men take over a German town that's been a stronghold for a long time, and Pitt and Lerman see a couple of women looking at them from an apartment. They go up, and at first we're not sure what will happen. But Pitt... just needs a shave, and some food, maybe, and he can speak German which helps, and encourages Lerman to spend 'time' with the younger, more attractive (really, really beautiful) younger woman (I believe he says ""If you don't take her, I will""), and yet it's not savage, it's more delicate and about trying to find that human connection that, as the film drills into the audience, has been lost by April of 45.<br/><br/>But this isn't all - the other men in the Fury tank come up to the apartment as well, and it becomes much more tense and awkward, especially with Bernthal's meat-head personage. The scene takes on so many qualities and feels like Ayer at his true strengths here: showing power dynamics, especially between men, how women figure in to it, and what trauma does if you stop and think about it. It's not like the film stops to have this whole scene in this apartment unfold, on the contrary it seems like it's from a better, more engaging film.<br/><br/>Sadly, this doesn't last though, and the climax is disappointing mostly as the characters do what they do just because it seems like the time to do it in the story, and it gives one of the main characters a big 'out' that doesn't feel earned or properly explains. It just seems to happen because, you know, Screen writing-Hero reasons. Fury ultimately is a grueling, depressing and super-violent and grim film that may do what it's supposed to do for an audience, but it's also come after movies like it before and doesn't explore (with some exceptions) what can be more remarkable about a war film in the little moments."
"achyutaghosh","8","2","8","2 November 2014"," Hits the nail on the head
","Fury is the most authentic war movie in a decade. Shot from the point of view of an American Sherman tank crew driving towards the heart of Nazi Germany in 1945, it is grim, visceral and remorseless, at the same time it is graceful, honest and uplifting.<br/><br/>Boyd- ""Wait until you see it. Norman- ""See what?"" Boyd- ""What a man can do to another man""<br/><br/>Wars are never good, even the ones we celebrate for being for the right reason. While we tend to gloss over the way it is waged, there is no denying the fact that it brings out the animal in us humans. Especially so the Second World War, that claimed over 80 million lives through genocide, massacres, civilian bombing, disease and starvation. Towards the end of the European theater of war, Hitler declared total war, throwing every man, woman, and child available at allied armies. Fury starts by saying that the American tanks were out-gunned and outnumbered by the German tanks. Sure the Tiger tanks were superior, but the allies outnumbered everything the Germans had, four to one. <br/><br/>Wardaddy: ""I started this war killing Germans in Africa. Then I killed Germans in Italy, and then Germans in Belgium. Now I'm killing Germans in Germany.""<br/><br/>Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) is an illustrious tank commander, leading a battle hardened crew, together since the North African campaign, Italy offensive and the Battle of the Bulge, in the final push towards Berlin. The tank was the most useful instrument of terror in WW2, and invariably for the crew, the tank is both their armor and their coffin. The fulcrum of Germany's blitzkrieg in 1939-40 was largely fast moving tanks, and the allies gave a taste of the same medicine 5 years later. The crew includes Shia LeBouf as Boyd Swan, Michael Pena as Trini Garcia, Jon Berenthal as Grady Travis, and new recruit Logan Lerman as Norman Ellison, who joins in place of the recently deceased assistant driver. Norman has never seen the insides of a tank, and is not ready for the kill or be killed job description. In a way much of the movie is about Norman coming of age as a soldier.<br/><br/>Irma: ""Where are you going?"" Wardaddy: ""To take the next town. And the next. And the next. Till you guys give up""<br/><br/>The best part about Fury is that it does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war- blown up limbs, cut up torsos, crushed bodies, burning men shooting themselves, kids fighting tanks with nothing more than panzerfausts, earth movers shoving piles of corpses into mass graves- it is all there. Director David Ayer bases the screenplay on a collection of true stories from war veterans, and hence it is extremely realistic- right down to the wanton destruction, the claustrophobic setting, the alternating of the crew between animalistic and humane, noble and brutal, and how easily the feared tank can become an easy prey to superior tactics and technology . The film is technically brilliant, the script is overwhelmingly quote-worthy, the cinematography, and action is original and sensible. The world's only working Tiger tank was used in the rollicking sequence against Fury and its cohorts. The casting, and as a result the overall acting is spot on, as is the rousing music score.<br/><br/>Norman: ""They're coming"". Wardaddy: ""How many?"" Norman: ""They're 300 of them"" Trini: ""It's five against 300"" Wardaddy: We ain't never run before. Why we gonna run now?""<br/><br/>Pitt is relatively restrained and does an excellent job as the responsible leader, keeping his wits about even in the most trying of times. It is only towards the climax, when it is 5 men and a broke tank against an entire SS battalion, that the super hero in him emerges. Spoiler alert, it is easier to survive a zombie apocalypse than WW2, even if you are Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Wardaddy: ""It will end, soon. But before it does, a lot more people have to die""<br/><br/>The best kind of war movies make you squirm in your seat and hate war. Despite being kind of predictable, and with an unrealistic climax, Fury passes this litmus test with flying colors. Gory, yet sensitive, Fury is overall, very very impressive- 8/10"

","The movie, up to the end, was a realistic portrayal of WWII tank combat. The battle against the Tiger was superb! But then a single, immobile tank is pitted against 300 SS PanzerGrenadiers, and here is where they lost me.<br/><br/>The tankers would have the advantage of surprise, and might have mowed down 15 or 20 of the Germans in the opening burst,but the suicidal attacks against the front of the tank, where the bow machine gun is, would not have occurred. <br/><br/>Several of the troops are shown carrying Panzerfausts as they march, and a single one of these lethal anti-tank weapons would have destroyed the tank and killed the crew, depending on where it hit. This battle should have ended ten minutes after it started with Fury aflame. But it's made by Hollywood, so the Germans pile up like cord wood, and the heroes die one by one<br/><br/>Worth watching, but don't expect a Saving Private Ryan."

","After going through pages of reviews, I have come to a singular conclusion...the majority of low scores seem to come from basement- dwelling cretins whose most distressing moments come when they realize their cell phone batteries are at 5%, with a sizable contingent from the British Isles. The former were, are, and always will be cowardly losers, but can be somewhat excused because they have never actually had to live in reality of any sort. <br/><br/>The latter share some of those loser traits, but should know better. If history serves me correctly, we expunged them from our shores (not once, but twice), then showed up to help bail them out in their own back yard (gee...not once, but twice). If you twerps want to see Brits in wartime action, make your own damn movies (you haven't done a good one in 45 years or so).<br/><br/>Having gotten that out of the way, I just finished watching Fury for the third time, and was as amazed as the first two times. There have been precious few films that have truly showed the utter brutality that is war, none as frankly as this one. No flag-waving, no nationalism beyond hatred of the Nazis, and NO reset button if you screw up. All in all, a stellar telling of the lives of tank crews (without a transformer or comic book superhero in sight)."

","An actual line from the movie, and so it stuck with me. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of war movies, but I am a fan of good movies and since there are a lot of good war movies out there I thought this one might be worth a view.<br/><br/>I know the movie is based off true events, but if this is portrays the way Americans act then, or even now, I can honestly say I feel a small amount of shame. <br/><br/>The acting was pretty bad, even comical at points; especially the accents they try to put on. The constant shots showing FURY on the tank felt a little pretentious. Yes, we know the name of the movie, stop showing it every two seconds. <br/><br/>In the end the movie in no way moved me, and in fact had me honestly laughing a lot of the way through it."
"SquigglyCrunch","5","2","9","22 October 2015"," A Decent War Movie
","This movie was highly recommended by a friend, and although I was already interested in watching it, it heightened my want to do so. I'm sad to say that it was just kind of 'meh'.<br/><br/>The movie felt rushed already, looking back on it I realized that nothing ever really happened. The characters were poorly developed overall, and although they had one or two distinct character traits, I never felt like they were really explored all that much, so I really didn't care about them.<br/><br/>The action itself was all fine and dandy. The movie progressed really quickly. I don't know if it was just short, or if so little happened that it just felt short-lived. Either way, the action was entertaining enough, but that was the problem. Unlike movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Sicario' which don't glorify and overdo violence, I felt like this one did overdo it. Maybe this was made more noticeable when I heard people saying ""Its the Saving Private Ryan of this generation"", but it didn't feel the same as the other two movies I listed. Sure, I've never been in a real war, but I felt like the fighting and whatnot was all so Hollywood and it just ended up feeling fake in comparison to the other two movies and what I've studied about war. <br/><br/>The plot itself was a little unclear, but so little happened it was hard to find where the introduction to it really was. It seemed to be more character driven, but it struggled in that aspect (as stated above) and thus the movie as a whole struggled. It was extremely predictable as well. I was never surprised, and always found that I knew who was going to die, who would live, how and where they'd die. It was, once again, too Hollywood, and that made it predictable. <br/><br/>Overall Fury isn't horrible, but it's not great. I'd consider it a stretch even to say its good. It's just okay. The characters were weak, the plot wasn't really there, it was predictable, and it just felt fake. I've seen plenty of good movies with some of these attributes, but all of them piled atop one another is just too much. The ending to the movie (no spoilers) was a major disappointment as well, as it felt incredibly forced and unnecessary. Sure, it was exciting, but I constantly remembered how dumb it was as I watched it, and that really took away from the whole experience. But if you like war movies, like my friend does, then go ahead and check this one out. It's not bad. If your curious, give it a watch. I personally would not recommend it, but maybe you will."
"febru3012","9","2","9","16 February 2015"," Like Das Boot (1981) only American & on land - see it !
","Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot is one of THE best war movies of all time and it's German. If you haven't seen Das Boot its great. The comparison with Fury may not at first seem obvious but the tight quarters these 5 Americans have in the Sherman tank commanded by Sgt Wardaddy (Pitt) is remarkable in its sheer grit, gore and terror. By the way, Pitt should have received an Academy Award for Best Actor for Wardaddy but won't because he wasn't nominated for 2014. Moving on, the battle sequences are many and you won't see but one brief romantic interlude in the whole picture, which most guys will appreciate. The scenes of fighting and background are gut wrenching and realistic as war should be portrayed. This movie spares no one in demonstrating the brutality of both sides during the fighting in WW2 Europe. If your non squeamish I highly recommend seeing this movie. The blood and violence no doubt turned off enough movie goers here on IMDb to rate this excellent flick a mere 7 - it's easily a 9 or a 10. All I can say about that to those low raters is this, go to Disney's Frozen if you want to live in a fantasy world. SEE THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE."
"jb07-660-944395","2","2","9","25 December 2014"," Obscene and insulting war comic
","Fury was written and directed by the same person, and it shows. The Characters are cardboard cut outs and the story goes south when it gets bogged down with our ""heroes"" being fed by German young ladies.<br/><br/>It goes into fantasy territory when one of the females willingly has sex with the new guy.<br/><br/>Our ""heroes"" have the charm of a drunken, rabid bikie gang ploughing through another bikie gang's territory.<br/><br/>No way would all those men stand around in the scene where Brad Pitt's character shoots an unarmed German Prisoner. Most people have morals and most would have interjected. This scene is so insulting to our veterans!<br/><br/>The writer needs to read up on Max Hastings and Martin Middlebrook - and research BEFORE writing.<br/><br/>Just as well this film was released after most of the veterans have passed on. While it has been documented about Russian atrocities as they rampaged through Germany, most, if not all military historians agree that U.S. And allied servicemen treated (on the whole) civilians with respect. Unlike what is depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>These wooden characters don't even treat each other with respect. Brad Pitt's character is more Jekyll and Hyde in an unbelievable way. One minute he is getting the new guy to remove half a face from the inside of the tank, the next he is acting like his best friend, procuring a Freulien for his new best mate's carnal desire.<br/><br/>The special effects are obscenely real but the action isn't - most German infantry units were issued with anti-tank weapons, and a single tank, as depicted at the end, wouldn't have lasted five minutes.<br/><br/>And what is with Brad's character jumping off his tank onto a German officer on horseback? This is straight out of a World War II comic.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie has such a high rating on IMDb is a sad reflection on the lack of knowledge about what really happened during the war."

Your backbone will be stronger too and your head will be held high , you will stand tall , your shoulders will be straighter, and you will see Americans won war war 2 because they knew they would be able to endure whatever comes there way. They stood with God as was mentioned many times in the movie. They stood up when the road assaulted there faith . They knew they were going to make a decision. Where they going to leave the road or were they going to actually stay.? This was no ordinary road. It was a road with incredible boldness and a road that would get the admiration of fellow soldiers and seemed more powerful than the administration of God. Little did they know this would be a moment that would define all tank units for the rest of their life's . This was a defining moment as warriors. You Will watch a real modern day scenario that possibly happened and never talked about. These are fiction warrior heroes as well, and some of the best directed we seen. These kind of decisions define who we are in the USA and set the standard for all warriors on the field
These warriors refused to give in and who are willing to stand up for strength and honor and duty and glory and faith . This stand, found others standing strong for many years to come. My hope is that as others saw this it will inspire your faith and encourage people
to inspire your faith and encourage people to make the correct choice when you face your defining moment<br/><br/>This scene transformed tons of others into world master changers for all the other units. The odds were 300 men to 5 men and one loved and lived on to tell the heroism and courage and commitment of the USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ In times of war.<br/><br/>You see this movie had a message and I thought this would be a good way to reach to others or at least get them to think at viewing movies differently.<br/><br/>Every single person who has changed the Earth had to leap out and totaly do something risky and with faith. So this is more than just a war movie Today and tomorrow and next year is going to be the day to seize every opportunity you can to be that person who will stand for God against the Earth that enjoys to do be evil at times.<br/><br/>Of course during that time the enemy during war time was extremely evil and only few of Germans were true nazis and many negative things were done.<br/><br/>God did not give us a spirit that gives us fear but a spirit of power and love and self confidence and self control."
"davidmvining","8","1","3","22 November 2019"," Brutal tanks
","Tough, wounded men arguing with each other in a metal beast upon a scarred patch of earth. Their tank needs some electrical work before it will move again, and everyone's growing impatient with the increasing sense of danger around them. As we learn later, all four of these men have been fighting in that tank, named Fury, since the Allies first landed in Africa, but now it's 1945. The German war machine is broken but not gone, and Nazis are still trying to protect their homeland as America rolls across the German countryside towards Berlin.<br/><br/>I loved how this movie looked. Dirty, grungy, and smoke-filled, it looks like a dirtier Ridley Scott movie. There's one scene where one of the characters gets clean, and the event occurs in the middle of the tense central section where cleanliness ends up feeling wrong somehow. Everyone is always covered in dirt and blood. You can almost smell the weeks of sweat and mud and grease clinging to them.<br/><br/>The story is rather simple. The tank, having just lost its assistant driver, picks up a new guy to fill the post. He's been in the army for eight weeks while they've been in the war since Africa. They must go from town to town, engaging what little, but dangerous, German forces are left and ultimately defend a crossroads for the furtherance of the army as a whole. That simple story, though, is supported by a simple element. Its structure is centered around the new assistant driver, our eyes into this world. We are there as he goes from refusing to fire guns on possibly dead German bodies to mowing down lines of SS marching towards the tank. The execution on the journey (some might call it a character arc) is so well executed, and I knew it within the movie's first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>At the center of that journey (the exact center of the movie, actually) is the scene where Brad Pitt's character cleans up. The tank has advanced into a German town, wiping out the handful of German soldiers and our main character has joined Pitt by invading a small apartment that houses a middle aged woman and her teenaged cousin. The entire point of the movie is to watch humanity strip away as people wade through war, and seeing these two women cower in fear at these two American soldiers creates a sense of unease and unpredictability. But the scene flows from one emotion to another. Tension gives to innocent love and breaks down into sheer terror. It's a fantastic little journey, as claustrophobic as life in the tank.<br/><br/>Outside of that, though, are a handful of action scenes that are completely convincing in their brutality. The standout, of course, is the final battle at the crossroads. Heavily inspired by Audie Murphy's heroic action that bears some similarity to the action on screen, the battle is an extended descent into Hell as battle surrounds a broken down tank housing our heroes.<br/><br/>Oh, David Ayer...what happened to you? Immediately after this you gave us Suicide Squad. What happened to the efficient and focused storyteller? I would blame Warner Brothers, but then Ayers gave us Bright."

"Svenstadt","6","1","3","24 April 2018"," Strong performances and special effects pick up the slack of this schnooze-fest.
","This movie really shows how well Brad Pitt has aged as an actor over the years. He and Shia LeBeof really give great performances that add to the suspense. Brad Pitt is a laser-focused combat officer with a certain vinegar-laced personality, and Shia LeBoeuf plays a religiously inclined main gunner who is perhaps his second-best soldier. 
This story moves along too slowly for my taste. There's alot of stopping and starting in the action, and at least one scene we see in every war movie: soldiers bust in to someone's home and take advantage of their food supply and recharge their batteries. One of the crew has a romantic relationship with a German girl in the home he busts into. It might be a real experience in war but I think I've seen it one too many times. 
The one thing you WON'T get in this movie is any sort of epic tank battles such as made the theatre of the Atlantic Campaign famous. The movie starts out inside the tank after a mission, and the forward machine gunner is killed; all you see is his bloody neck stump and spine sticking out which is graphic. 
I reduced one star because this movie has moments where the action isn't that great. In a couple of scenes guys are getting blown up everywhere, and in real life there would be grunts and cries for mommy and, well, internal organs lying everywhere, but in this movie they clean it up too too much. I heard that the insides of those Sherman tanks looked like slaughterhouses at the end of a mission! There is the one crew member who gets a Panzerfaust rocket cut straight through his abdomen, but very little guts and grizzle are seen! Another guy leans into a German grenade, but again, there should be blood everywhere, but there isn't!!!!! 
There's alot of German language in this movie. As having taken four years of high school German, I can appreciate that part of it. But still, this movie's setting takes place later in the Atlantic Campaign, so there's really often times no direction in this. Very much feels like the film stops where it starts and starts where it stops. There are a few tank battles but are so brief that you tend to get bored. 
Also, the German gunners in that one scene are firing into the tanks, and miss three times in a row!!! No way that is true; I happen to know that the Germans were reknowned for their accuracy and the Sherman was an easy target."

In fact, I'm willing to go on record as saying that Suicide Squad is possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen, so I really wasn't expecting a lot from ol' Davey-boy. My expectations were proven wrong almost immediately. The vibe is gritty without being melodramatic, the characters are interesting and well-written, and the plot kept me fully invested throughout. Even better, the film (mostly) steered well clear of the ""brave soldiers"" trope, presenting both the Americans and Germans as humans and not stereotyped cartoon characters. A quick glance at previous reviews mostly yields up the word ""unrealistic"", and in all honestly the final scene deserves every complaint it gets.

Don't get me wrong its not a masterpiece like saving private Ryan. but works as great entertainment with a little extra...<br/><br/>Brad who pretty much dominate the film does a good role.

Read the script boys, it was written in the script. Way to show the world what a bunch of overpaid, high maintenance Hollywood queens you are. If I can avoid it, I will never watch another Brad Pitt or Shia LaBeouf movie in my life. the storyline was good but I feel the cast could have been picked better. Christian Bale could've easily played the lead role, and Shia could have been replaced with just about anybody. For example, anyone remember Norman's real name? I don't but I remember his name was Norman in the movie or ""Machine"" as he was dubbed in the end, he was good. There are plenty of actors that could've not only pulled this off but made it better.

The repeated pseudo-epic scenes of combat with video-game tracer firing games tried to make the Germans of this time look like they overwhelmed the US tanks when in fact Sgt Dipshit and his crew of morons had to be told everything that troops do automatically when they're a...well...""crew."" Interestingly, those outgunned, starving German troops who were bombed with volumes of air and ground ordnance they could only have dreamed of, took far better care of their ""new-joins"", making them feel welcome and taking them under the arms of a ""tutor"" who would show the new joins the ""ropes,"" instead of a canned idiot line like ""Don't get too close to anyone.""

Well that's what fury is about. It's about entertainment. Many of you would think that it's an illogical movie without any head or toe, but what it does is entertains. According to me movies are just meant to sit back and enjoy. If you think too much, you are not enjoying. Fury has got emotion, drama, fun, action i.e. a perfect recipe for an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Every character has done well. Brad Pitt (Wardaddy) looks good as the commander who has promised his men that he is going to keep them alive. The way he tries to teach the new guy (Logan Lerman) to kill is interesting. You see the sophisticated side of him when he is with the ladies. Shia could have had more screen time. But he plays his part well as the Bible. The transformation of the new guy (Logan Lerman) from beginning to the end is good to watch.<br/><br/>The final battle or you can say the boss battle has its own moment of oomph.

Basically, set in April 1945, the Allies are making their final push into Nazi Germany, and in battle an M4A3E8 Sherman tank is captured by the 66th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Division, led by battle- hardened U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt, also producing), with his all- veteran crew: gunner Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), loader Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal), and driver Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael PeÃ±a). The tank is named Fury, its original assistant driver/bow gunner was killed in battle, and recently enlisted Army typist Norman Ellison (The Perks of Being a Wallflower's Logan Lerman) is his replacement, but he has never been inside a tank or experienced the ravages of war, so Wardaddy is reluctant to let him join the crew, Grady later nicknames him ""Machine"". Having been together since the North African Campaign, the surviving crew upon meeting despise the new recruit for his lack of experience and reluctance to kill Germans, especially teenagers of the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) in cold blood, this decision causes Lieutenant Parker (Xavier Samuel) with his crew to be killed in the destruction of their tank. Furious with him, Wardaddy attempts to brutalise and ""educate"" the young man about the realities of war, violently attempting to force Norman to shoot dead a captive German artilleryman, Norman refuses, so Wardaddy forces the gun into his hand and makes him execute the prisoner. A stronger bond forms between Wardaddy and Norman, when after a battle and capturing a small German town, they meet German woman Irma (Anamaria Marinca) and her cousin Emma (Alicia von Rittberg), Norman presumably has sex with Emma, then the two men join the women for breakfast, during which Norman sees horrific burn scars sustained on Wardaddy's back, and soon the rest of the crew barge in and cause tensions at the table, soon after leaving the house a German bomb hits and kills the women and some American troops. The crew, alongside other tanks, get a mission to hold a ital crossroads, protecting a clear way to supply trains, but a Tiger tank attacks, and following the battle only Fury remains, but it is immobilised after hitting a landmine, Norman wanders off and spots a battalion of three hundred Waffen-SS infantry approaching, Wardaddy refuses to leave, and the initially reluctant the rest of the crew decide to stay and plan an ambush. Outnumbered and out gunned the crew nevertheless combat the Germans with the weapons of the tank and the crew, but one by one, Grady, Gordo and Bible are gradually killed, with a sniper wounding Wardaddy, he and Norman remaining retreat back into Fury, sharing their last words. Wardaddy tells Norman to use the bottom hatch to escape the tank and hide in the crater made by the landmine explosion, Wardaddy stays and is killed by soldiers dropping grenades into the tank, a young German Waffen-SS trooper does find Norman, but he does not inform the other surviving Germans as they move on, U.S. Army units discover Norman the next morning, apparently the German offensive failed because of the actions of the crew, Norman is taken to safety and looks back at the carnage and the destroyed Fury. Also starring Jason Isaacs as Captain Waggoner, Scott Eastwood, Clint's son as Sergeant Miles, Kevin Vance as Sergeant Peterson, Eugenia Kuzmina as Hilda Meier, Brad William Henke as Sergeant Davis and True Blood's Jim Parrack as Sergeant Binkowski. Pitt is great commanding the troops, LaBeouf is well-prepared as the bible-bashing soldier, PeÃ±a gets his moments as the loudmouth, Bernthal is fine being cynical, and I agree it is through the vulnerable performance of Lerman that you get the reality of conflict. The story is nice and straight forward, a crew of soldiers in a tank together going across the country fighting whatever battles befall them, mostly seen only through the insights of the heroes, only snippets of the Nazis, the breakfast scene is long and uncomfortable but interesting to see play out, the appearance of the Tiger tank makes for an exciting scene, many of the battle sequences in fact are marvellous viewing, and it has surprisingly grisly moments too, with body parts and blood all over, all together it is a fantastically thought out and most memorable Second World War drama. Very good!"

","This movie could exceed my expectations. It could keep me attracted up to the last minute. I am always about the story, the effects and speed of sequence of actions in the movie, and this movie could get the best of me!!! I loved it, when I really expected from the trailer that I may get bored or has nothing added to me. But it could exceed my expectations with the first ten minutes. This is Brad Pit, and I love the way he acts. This movie is all about love story, action, thriller, and story of war. I've watched it for like five times, and still able to repeat it again.<br/><br/>I can remark this movie with ""epic ending""."
"s3276169","5","2","10","8 December 2014"," Horrors of war drama that falls short of the mark
","CONTAINS SPOILERS: <br/><br/>Fury is a drama about a US tank team in war torn Europe. Brad Pitt leads a motley bunch who have managed to survive the carnage of war in spite of the stated inferiority of US armour in the face of German tank technology. <br/><br/>Without going into too much detail what appears to be the focus of the drama, that is, showing the horrors of war, is lost due to the unlikable cast of characters and a rather absurd end scene. <br/><br/>The tank team, with the exception of Pitt's character and that of a young recruit can, in my estimation, best be described as repellent. They are cruel, crude and a generally unsavory bunch. <br/><br/>I suspect the reason for depicting the key characters in this manner was to show how war hardens people.Yet the reality is they could have been, I feel, better presented as human beings surrounded by the horrors of war. <br/><br/>The lack of likability of the majority of the tank team makes it difficult to empathize with the characters when they do inevitably meet their end. For me this deadens the message the film is trying to convey about the horrors of war. <br/><br/>The ending does the film no favours either. Pitts character stands Rambo-esque atop his immobile tank cutting down hordes of, seemingly suicidal, German soldiers. Its a ""hero moment"" not I felt a reality of war scene. Indeed even when a German sniper finally shoots Pitt's character at relatively close range he turns out to be an implausibly poor shot. <br/><br/>Its these rather glaring shortcomings and others that really rob this film of its impact which is a shame as it could have had a lot to offer with a good cast and very good locations."
"cdleorivera","9","2","10","19 October 2014"," ""A Furious Return""
","I think it's safe to say that we all thought that the age of World War II has been gone for a while, the last major film being 1999's Spielberg epic, Saving Private Ryan. That is, if you don't count the Eastern version of World War II, which was brought to life with 2006's Letters From Iwo Jima. But, primarily focusing on the European fronts, you cant deny that its been quite some time since we last saw a great film on this subject, but with David Ayer's Fury, the European front returns to the big screen, and its probably one of the greatest of its kind. <br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. I can't really say much else, except for the fact that there is definitely a nomination for an Oscar in this category, if not a win. <br/><br/>David Ayer's direction and use of physical tanks rather than CGI is impressive, and is sure to at least be remembered among many WWII film veterans. <br/><br/>And the acting, oh, the acting. <br/><br/>Everyone brings their best to the table on this one. Brad Pitt will be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Shia LeBouf might get nominated for Supporting Actor, but it is without a doubt that Logan Lerman's performance as the new guy on the block is the best of all, and he has high chances of snagging home the Oscar for Supporting Actor. In truth, it may seem at first that this is Brad Pitt's movie, but come the end, Lerman steals the show, emotionally enrapturing us and giving us the best performance of his career. I've always sort of had a problem with Lerman, knowing that the guy has potential but never quite manages to make it, but with this film, he writes his name into our minds as one of the best performances of 2014. The rest of the cast is also pretty well done, and it's safe to say that the acting is the movie's strong-point.<br/><br/>The film's score is a beautifully written masterpiece that sways with feels and emotions and will at least get Steven Price a nomination for best original score, and it will for sure give you the goosebumps with its orchestral style of sound.<br/><br/>The score isn't the only noise the movie produces that is good, but the sound effects are definitely a plus. You jolt at every boom, awe at the sound of the marching Germans, and constantly want to shift in your seat whenever a bullet fires your way.<br/><br/>The visual effects are pretty impressive themselves, explosions and gunfire making you feel like your in the heat of battle. Other than that though, there's not much to marvel at.<br/><br/>And the ultimate part of this movie is it's depiction of war as a dangerous chess game played by politicians, even though they never actually show those figures, you still imagine them not caring at all as an individual soldier dies for their nation. And you can actually feel for the antagonists, knowing that they are only in the same position as the protagonists, that some have families to care for and yet their lives still end brutally. I love Fury's depiction of war so much, that I believe it is comparable to Saving Private Ryan's.<br/><br/>While still not being a major fault in the system, the film's biggest problem is its script. There are some lines in there that are somewhat cringe-worthy, and while the dialog remains alright overall, it still negates it that the words are actually uttered from the actors's mouths.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury is one of the best pictures of the year, sure to be remembered as time moves on. I'd like to say that Fury will get nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Sound Effects, and Best Picture, and win Best Supporting Actor for Logan Lerman's performance (yes, it is quite exceptional and it will stick with you), and maybe Best Sound Effects. <br/><br/>And as the holiday season of movies continues, we continue to look forward to many great movies such as Interstellar, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Nightcrawler, A Most Violent Year, Unbroken, and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies."

","FURY (2014) **1/2 Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Jim Parrack, Brad William Henke, Kevin Vance, Jason Isaacs. Filmmaker Davy Ayer's foray into male bonding via WWII warfare hits all the right marks for a steadily paced but somewhat rote period piece about a tank squadron in 1945's battle-weary European front attempting to remain alive in spite of impossible odds to the no-end-in-sight battles yet to be fought. The characters are somewhat cardboard thin, cookie-cutter (i.e. noble ethnic, muscle-head jerk, religious peacenik and green around the gills rookie) yet the ensemble of talent - particularly a world-weary Pitt (starting to show some character in his handsome face) as the sergeant in command who can feel the unbearable gravity of their plight weighing them down in to only a matter of time. The ugly muck and mire, grime soaked bruised palette by Roman Vasyanov's cinematography and Andrew Menzies production design allows for the gritty verisimilitude amidst sprinkling of graphic red bloodshed and unspeakable violence."

One of the best war movies of last years, very good plot, and excellent acting. The story is of war ugliness and the ties between people thrown into the hell of war.
One of the people from a US tank team was killed in action. He is replaced by a fresh recruit.
Later the plot accelerates when the US tank encounters the SS regiment and the tanks have to defend the US troops remaining behind.

This film is really moving, we can project us in the violence, the difficulty of living during WWII. Logan Lerman's role puts us in the place of a young soldier between joy of youth and horror of the war.

"dahlswede","Null","1","4","11 June 2017"," A Very Gritty Antiwar War Movie
","This superbly written film impressed me as perhaps the grittiest, hardest-to-watch war movie I've seen. It does embrace a lot of clichés surrounding the Greatest Generation, yet the writing makes the actions of the characters plausible. Well acted, well written and well directed, it offers riveting viewing.<br/><br/>In order to prevail during the war, the officer in charge of a tank (played by Brad Pitt) and his men force themselves to view the world in very stark terms. The tank commander does not hesitate to commit violence to achieve his military objectives, even to the point of abandoning law sometimes. He compels a younger soldier joining his team to adopt this view, even though as the plot unfolds it appears the tank commander does subscribe to essentially the same value system as the younger man. The film suggests the ability to maintain an idealistic (and ethical) society perhaps ultimately rests upon the willingness to enforce the rules of a just society, something the Nazis has completely abandoned. The Allied forces found themselves meeting violence with violence. For instance, after capturing a German town the American tank commander asked a terrified municipal official to point out the German officer responsible for hanging children so his men could exact swift retribution.<br/><br/>I thought the acting and special effects contributed to the overall effectiveness of the plot. ""Fury"" displayed the cruelty of WWII against the backdrop of human foibles and strengths. It highlights both the senselessness of violence and its recurring role in arbitrating geopolitical affairs. One line from this movie particularly seemed to encapsulate its message: ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent."" The closing scene vividly depicts the wastefulness and cruelty of warfare, while also acknowledging the critical role of individual acts of self-sacrifice and mercy in promoting survival."
"yoranalflat","8","1","4","3 April 2017"," Gritty and great
","Fury is an incredible war film about Norman's (Logan Lerman)story of the war from wimp recruit to a shell-shocked and battle hardened soldier. This is one of the best war films from the last couple of years only competing with: inglorious basterds, American sniper and the hurt locker for the top spot. this is unfortunately because of the drought of war films but with The wall starring john Cena and Aaron Taylor Johnson coming up the future of war films is looking up.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jon Bernthal have worked together before this in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds gaining some good war film experience. Micheal Pena and director David Ayer both worked together on End of Watch. I'm also sure Shia la Beouf gained a bit of war film experience from transformers.<br/><br/>From the very start of the film Logan Lerman puts up a great performance as Norman and does very well to fit in with the all star cast. The film has some incredible shots showing the good the bad and horrific bits of the war. The tension is great throughout the film but sometimes stops because of long drawn out scenes.<br/><br/>Altogether fury is a great war time drama/action film with an all star cast the only bad things in it are a couple of clichés some unnecessarily long drawn out scenes and the film being a little bit too long."
"KineticSeoul","6","1","4","10 April 2015"," So that's it?
","In my opinion this was a pretty disappointing movie. Sure, if you want to watch some tank battles this might be for you. But overall there isn't anything that makes this movie stand out. The story is weak and that applies to the character development as well. When it comes to the plot there just wasn't anything gripping when it comes to the action sequences or anything that leaves an impact. Now we all know the Nazis were the bad guys during WW2, but they are just ridiculously stupid in this movie. It's like the American soldiers have all these tactical guerilla warfare skills and the Nazis fight like soldiers during the civil war. This movie would have worked if it was a video game and it might have even won some awards, but as a movie it just isn't that good. And speaking of movies the enemy soldiers like I said fight like Call of Duty enemies in campaign mode one easy. On a positive note though, the acting is good but it's still wasted. Since the character development is so weak and the transition just doesn't make much sense. Chances are your not really going to care about any of the soldiers that manuevers the tank Fury. I recently saw ""Furious 7"" and watching this movie was part ""Furious 7"" where a group goes on explosive mission after mission. Except when it comes to ""Furious 7"" it had other previous installments for character development. Part ""Inglorious Basterds"" when it comes to the interaction except not as good. And part ""Miracle at St. Anna"" because of the costant talk of spirituality. I think this movie would have worked if it tried to just be a balls to the wall action popcorn flick. But it tries to be something more and that is where it falters.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Fury is alright. There is nothing seriously wrong here. Everything wasn't just sloppily thrown together. It is a competently made film. Problem is there is literally nothing you haven't seen before in other, better war movies. What's even worse though, is that this movie does everything worse than those other movies. Certain scenes just don't have the intended impact because either they were maybe rushed a little or we've just all seen it by this point. Every scene that isn't an action scene is also rather boring, unfortunately. The movie just didn't have strong enough characters to keep my attention during dialogue scenes. I don't remember anyone's names or personalities, which is a real shame. I can say that, overall, you'll enjoy the movie though, especially if you're really into war movies. It has enough for those who haven't seen lots and lots of war movies. For everyone else, it's probably best to skip this one."

","In the push into Nazi Germany in the closing stages of WWII, a battle-hardened tank crew come up against fanatical opposition. In addition, a rookie soldier is added to their crew and has to be educated in the ways of war. There is grit and rawness here, and the Allies are shown to be capable of brutality, shading the moral tones. The battle scenes are tense and dirty and ring with authenticity. Brad Pitt is magnetic as the leader trying to save his men while keeping as much of a lid on their excesses as possible. The film's flaw is that it shows the men not so much as soldiers, or even heroes, but as supermen, cutting through SS the way Aragorn cuts through Orcs. The ingénue Ellison gets to share a moment with a German civilian who is then conveniently, plot-wise, dispensed with in an air raid, though quite who is bombing who isn't clear. The crude moment seems forced in order to have Ellison be told ""This is war!"" This is a decent if not great film. If they'd made it 50 years ago it would have starred John Wayne."

No characters means inauthentic acting (acting - toward what?).<br/><br/>I was actually waiting for the movie to say at the end that it was based on real events. I mean, that would have explained the rather bouncy, incoherent story development in the movie. But the movie didn't say that in the end.

Instead, we got more explosions instead.<br/><br/>Speaking of the fireworks, David Ayer really knows how to put on a show. This film was a high octane spectacle, and it was beautifully shot, but Ayer is probably a better director than he is a writer. I would hate to call this film mindless, but it was close. Some of the gore in this film was over the top too.<br/><br/>Fury is a decent depiction of tank warfare and features some interesting characters with psychological conflicts.

"Franco_Strydom","7","1","4","2 February 2015"," A very entertaining and very realistic war film; till a point.
","The narrative of ""Fury"" (Ayer 2014) is laden with war film clichés, but they all work as a vehicle for character development and interaction, which makes them more effective than a completely original and surprising narrative which doesn't leave enough space for the story to be told. <br/><br/>It's been a while since we've had a war film on the circuit where the war and the fighting of the war is a main plot line. Reality has become more and more important in cinematic story telling over the last decade or so with films striving to get closer to what events would look, sound and be like if they weren't choreographed by a screen writer, and watching a world war two tank film with this as a key element is incredible. Ayer did an amazing job in making a tank feel vulnerable and indestructible where many other films and TV shows have mostly shown them as plain war machines. The film plays with tension and anticipation incredibly well and I can't remember when last I felt this emotionally involved in the development of a war film. INSERT: The reason for this is the solid characters, their interactions, relationships and development, which is the best narrative part of this film, as it should be. <br/><br/>I'm slightly disappointed in the ending of the film as the first three quarters works really hard to convince you that it's all real and it succeeds at it, then the conclusion is so censored for audience approval that it subverts a lot of the force the film builds up. To hold off on any spoilers I'll just say that the film is violent and gory; at the pinnacle of the story however it tones down on the gore to not leave the audience with a bad taste in their mouth, while also keeping the romanticized war idea alive. That was disappointing. <br/><br/>The most powerful war films are those that don't try and sprinkle your drink with essence of rose; war is violent, people die, and they don't look pretty when they do it. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is really starting to make a name for himself as a serious actor and the role he portrays in ""Fury"" (Ayer 2014), and the way he portrays said role, really counts in his favor. Likewise, it's been a while since I've seen Brad Pitt in a film that requires more of him than just arriving on set and he how fulfilling it is to see him really act. This is not to say the other members of the tank crew didn't do an amazing (acting) job; Jon Bernthal specifically was incredibly effective in his role and I had the appropriate mixed feelings towards his character as a result.<br/><br/>This film could have been better, and I blame a need to be accessible and enjoyed as entertainment for this shortcoming. Ayer should have stuck with the power he started with and while some audience members might have left the cinema a little distraught than you would have wanted, the story of ""Fury"" (Ayer 2014) would have been much better for it."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","4","12 January 2015"," Has its flaws but still packs a punch
","War films aren't the easiest to depict for a number of reasons. Depending on the era the war took place; the period had certain items. These items range from weapons, tools, clothing and vehicles. Not every item from every era exists nowadays. Even if they are still in mint condition, that does not mean it will be available for use. This kind of permission only happens when the people making the film really know what they are doing and have the respect to take care of it and use it in a way that not only shows it in its prime but glorifies it when it's over. The production behind this movie did exactly that The story follows Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) and his small crew that end up accepting a reassigned typist turned rookie soldier (Logan Lerman). Together, they face incredible odds to break what's left of Hitler's Nazis.<br/><br/>As a war drama, this film has it. Writer/director David Ayer displays that he worked hard for what he puts up on screen. The realism is definitely illusive, with lots of blood, explosions and ugly ways to die. It'll make audiences wonder how does one accept such a horrific fate or if they survived, how does one cope with what they saw. The best sequences however do not belong to the gun shootouts in the field or urban terrain. The notable scenes belong to the Sherman tanks. Visually watching these behemoths literally punch holes in anything they launch their projectiles into is enticing to see. This also goes with the mechanics behind how trained soldiers operate and direct these monsters. The operations also do not always take place from the inside, to give a better idea of what the tanks try to accomplish, cinematographer Roman Vasyanov also shoots from a bird's eye view. It's a different angle and it works in helping the audience understand. Vasyanov also gets other good shots of the urban and rural terrain, either by infantry POV or just showing the devastation. The sound quality is also praiseworthy; much of it sounds like what you would hear from the old Call of Duty games.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good along with most of each one's development as an individual. Although this isn't Brad Pitt's first war film, he continues to show that he can immerse himself in the role that he plays. Here, Pitt portrays his character as a softy but only when it comes to his men and Fury; everyone else he could care less. Surprisingly as much as he continues to trash his reputation, Shia LaBeouf demonstrates that he can act too and not like the punk character of Sam Witwicky from Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) sequels. For once, LaBeouf is a man and that deserves a thumb's up. Logan Lerman's performance is a great representation of the relatable character for the audience. This is due to his combat experience and how he sees warfare. As time progresses, audiences will understand why his view on war changes. Michael Peña as ""Gordo"" the only soldier in the crew to give a little foreign flavor provides much of the dry humor (it is done appropriately) that is easily understandable for the situations the crew gets into. Finally is Jon Bernthal who plays a somewhat uneducated soldier but even with his lack of respect for certain things, he also exhibits some likable humanity from time to time.<br/><br/>The only real blunders this movie makes, belongs to its writing. The characters are developed accordingly but backgrounds are left out entirely except for a few tidbits. Aside from Lerman's character, nobody has any kind of back story other than the crew used to have more tanks and first met in Africa. Okay that's when they met, but what about family at home? This would not only flesh out each individual but also give them a more human persona than just military guys who have nothing but their comrades. Then again, that may be the case but it's never stated clearly. Also, how is that Wardaddy knows fluent German? And why couldn't subtitles be put for those moments when German was spoken? It's not like they were the most pivotal points in the film but it would've been nice to know what was being said.<br/><br/>Besides these two components, the only other part that felt sluggish and extended for too long was a dining room table scene. Here, Wardaddy and Lerman's character take some time to settle down in a German woman's house. There they have them make a meal and sit down to eat. At that moment, the rest of the crew comes up and sits down with them. This scene drags, and in some ways feels intentional while also being unintentional. My guess is that the intentional was supposed to emphasize the importance of enjoying the moments of rest soldiers had. However, the unintentional may be that it went on for too long of ""enjoying the moment"" and forgetting where the time went. I guess the editors (who have worked for other well respected movies) forgot to trim this scene. On the other hand, the music composed by Steven Price was a new listening experience. Price included choirs that highlighted the doom and gloom of the Nazis and the horrors of war for the Allied troops. When it came to the tank scenes, the instruments kept the scene very tense by using deep brass and percussion. Considering he's only scored a few films, score collectors should keep an ear out for his next entry.<br/><br/>Writer/director David Ayer's story omits character back-stories and has one scene that drags but everything else works wonderfully. The acting is solid by all actors, the music matches the period's tone and the tank warfare is highly engaging."

"TheMarwood","7","1","4","31 December 2014"," Grim and well made.
","After the incredibly stupid and incompetent film Sabotage, David Ayer returns to screens only a few months later with the well crafted Fury. It's a major return to form for Ayer and this grim, gory tale of a small crew commanding a tank during the end of WWII is a worthy submission to the genre. For about the first hour, the film is all business, a relentless onslaught of one gruesome situation after another and the heavy toll it's taken on our leads. The film stumbles a bit when things quiet down for an extended sequence in a German civilian home, where getting a cooked meal turns into a difficult time, when civility is absent from most of the crew. It felt like it was inspired from the French plantation sequence that was reinstated in Apocalypse Now Redux - but the story in Fury is just too lean and small in scope to withstand a narrative detour like that. The cast is uniformly excellent, with the exception of Jon Bernthal who overplays his role as a broad cliché, who never feels human. Fury doesn't quite pull off the ending, but there's enough quality filmmaking throughout to recommend the film."
"pinwang","3","1","4","29 November 2014"," Saving Private Ryan meets Rambo
","Fury is in some ways a serious war film, with engaging characters and storytelling that– though clichéd– is carried by strong performances. It is indeed predictable at times but then again what story isn't? What is more important to me is that the characters are interesting, and that their choices engage me as the viewer. This film certainly did that for me.<br/><br/>The battle scenes with tank tactics are extremely intense, and rank among the best battle scenes in any war movie. Pacing is great, so the amount of action feels just right while the scenes in between move the story forward. The end scene is absolutely insane. Brad Pitt has got to hold the record for most Nazis killed in movies by now. Realistic? No, but still damn enjoyable.<br/><br/>Fury is a serious war film that also stays fun. This is probably what bothers the naysayers. It is an action movie for adults who want both of these things in a war film– the people who like Saving Private Ryan as well as Rambo.<br/><br/>Is it as bad as the negative reviews are saying? No, we're storytelling not recreating WWII. And does it really show the horrors of war? Same as above. All Fury is, is a good story and good entertainment, and that's plenty enough for me. 7/10"
"dgrv75","8","1","4","5 November 2014"," A brilliant war drama
","(Please remember this is an opinion and not an objective review) Fury comes in a very long line of war movies. But David Ayer manages to transform a good but not perfect screenplay into a near perfect piece of art.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Look at the list on the casting. The rhythm is flawless. From quiet silence or talking moments to gut-wrenching action.<br/><br/>I've really liked David Ayer's visceral movie style since the beginning. Violence, brotherhood, have been his central themes. And it feels like he found a perfect subject in this movie.<br/><br/>The character study is powerful. Fury is built around an initiation process that reveals all of the characters' background and complex personality. A brutal, terrifying initiation. The first scene is a clear indication of the tone of the movie : harsh, almost silent, Grey.<br/><br/>The violence is terrible. Blown up bodies, pieces of flesh. I was shocked more than a few times. as the end credit beautifully portrays it, there is a total sense of realism and brutality that transpires through this. It is packed in an relentless death and carnage, to demonstrate how it physically and morally destroys those who face it. All of them.<br/><br/>Now what I liked most is a ballsy move by the director : when the final scene begins, and a seemingly hopeless and endless violence starts, he moves from day to night shooting. It is a quite surprising and bet-it-all move. And in my opinion, it works brilliantly. It becomes hauntingly beautiful, colored in red and orange, and shows to me, that this is the kind of director I like. One that takes position and tries things.<br/><br/>As the main character, we start the movie all clean and shaved, and finish it with mud, blood and despair all over us. There is no escape."

","This movie is definitely worth the price of a theater ticket, you won't be wasting your money. Character development is outstanding and the realism is convincing, it's a close look into the human psyche under traumatic circumstances. The struggle that Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, Norman and Boyd 'Bible' Swan has to undertake, to keep their humanity and some semblance of civility is poignant in this film. I might be wrong but there is also a delightful hint of Tarantino in the script.The superb script and acting will keep your interest peaked from beginning to end, you won't find yourself dozing off to sleep from boredom during this one, that's for certain. It also forced me to think about my Father who served in World War Two, and reminded me of the immense sacrifice that was made to free the World from tyrannical forces, this movie left me saying thank you to him, and I'm sure millions of others who had loved ones who served were left with the same gratitude."
"szoke_jokepu_1","8","1","4","3 November 2014"," You've probably seen this before
","I'd like to start out by saying this is not a bad a movie. I needed to say that, because in the next few lines it may look like I'm saying the opposite. If you've ever seen a more modern war movie, than this won't bring any surprises. I'm thinking at movies like Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket or The Thin Red Line. These movies were all pretty great and brought something new to the image of war and war movies in general. This movie, on the other hand, doesn't do that. It's a 'dog death' away from being the biggest horde of war movie clichés of all time. If you love seeing them again, because you liked them in some more original movie, then this is the movie for you, if not it will be pretty boring most of the time. But enough of that, if we look at the main ""theme"" of the movie, the Father-Son relationship between the characters and the sacrificial ending. That's pretty much straight out of Saving Private Ryan, only with Brad Pitt in the place of Tom Hanks. But I can't be mad at this movie, cause although it's full of clichés they are executed very brilliantly. The feeling, the action, the scenes are very good and beautiful. There are some especially awesome scenes, like the one with the girl or the one with the Tiger tank. At the end what saves the movie from total failure is the acting job of Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. Their characters are built well and they make a good job with them. On the other hand the 3 other tank members really don't have much character to them. All in all I think it's watchable. If you've never seen a war movie, you can start with this. But I recommend the other's... As for the reasoning for why did I give such a high score after bashing the hell out of the movie: I think it should be a message to everyone, that even if this is not the worlds best movie, we want more movies of this caliber or higher (get it?)."

The battle with the tiger tank was also ineptly handled, a superior tank would not throw away its firepower advantage by moving into the open ,nor would it have been attacked frontally, they would have tried to use their numbers to outflank it. Really, this is post-war movie standard, was the military adviser bound and gaged ?. The apartment scene was quite emotive although the issue of rape was glossed over ( the audience laughed ) there was no way the girl was going to avoid it. In all, a timely morale boosting film, harking back to when the enemy was clearly defined and you could win by throwing enough hardware at it."
"godagesil","7","1","4","24 October 2014"," Good but with some reservations....
","I really enjoyed the movie. It is not for the squeamish, and has upped the ante in the Saving Private Ryan level of graphic violence and gore. Being a long time avocational historian of WWII I was impressed by the historical accuracy of the equipment on display in the movie. Aside from some quibbles with some of the Sherman Tank model improvements having not been available at the time, one has to marvel that they could find as many serviceable Shermans as they did. The only thing that detracted from the movie was the standard clichés. The is one, and I dare say you'll notice it, if you ever watched the old Henry Fonda – Telly Savalas epic, The Battle of the Bulge, and the HBO mini series Band of Brothers, which stole the cliché from the former and now it's in Fury. (Spoiler) Let's just say, it isn't safe to be a nurse or civilian female who makes an attachment to a paratrooper or tank crewman. It turns your domicile into an artillery shell magnet. Remember the typist/interpreter from Saving Private Ryan? He's ba-a-a-c-k! This time in the guise of a bow machine gunner and is just as inept and pacifist as before. Hell I even think they hired the German trooper he refused to shoot and released only to have him kill Tom Hanks, and who he finally decides to execute. You know, the worm turns scene near the end. I believe he's the guy Pitt and the typist shoot with the pistol. The undercurrent of the movie, I believe is that Pitt has seen too much in the war, from North Africa, (he left out Sicily), France and Belgium, and is looking for redemption and finds that there is none for him or his men. Pitt wrongly states he's in the 6th Army (commanded by Gen. Patch,) when the 2nd Armored was part of Patton' s 3rd Army. Hollywood has some kind of aversion to Patton these days as if you acquire some kind of taint if you served under him. Another cliché is they make out the Germans, particularly the SS, as inept bumbling suicidal numb-skulls, when arguably they were the most combat effective soldiers of the war. Sure they lost, but they didn't fight for six years against Russia, US, France, and Britain by being stupid. I know Hollywood has to make concessions to the camera, like cramming things into a scene that normally would have been 50 to 100 yards apart (like tanks). Dug in anti-tank guns usually had a pretty high first shot kill average, but these Germans keep missing at less than 200 yards. Panzerfausts the German bazooka like things, (the word means Tank Fist) were good out to about 100 yards, closer than 50 yards and you'd likely get killed by your own success. So why do the Germans insist on charging suicidally close to use them? The attack across the field against a dug in company of Germans with two maybe three antitank guns and they have no mortars? A small mortar barrage into the packed lines of GIs behind the tanks would have ended the attack in about a minute. Standard Doctrine for every army is to strip attacking tanks of infantry support and then kill the lumbering blind pachyderms at your leisure, if they are so stupid to keep attacking without infantry. This German commander must have missed that lesson in basic infantry school. Similarly, the commander in the final climactic scene must have learned his tactics and doctrine from the Japanese, and his German troops stage the first and last Banzai charge executed in Europe. The final and most ludicrous camera shot was at the end, an aerial shot of the tank standing guard at the crossroads, surrounded my masses of German dead, and not a one was so stupid as to get shot and fall on any of the four roads around the tank, which were pristinely clear of any debris of battle, corpses included. There was a shot earlier in the film of the body of a fallen German being run over by a tank in a grisly close up, but here we are to presume that the relieving soldiers meticulously picked up the dead as to not mess up the treads of their tanks, and hear I recall Patton telling his troops to use their guts to grease them! Now having vented, I reiterate, the movie was good, go see it. The success of the film will no doubt encourage Hollywood to continue to use the same clichés until we begin to wince and only then will they stop using them. Pitt, Labeouf , Jon Bernthal (Walking Dead) and Pena all turn in good solid performances and will have you engaged and at times even repulsed. The action will have you on the edge of your seat."
"peakcrew","7","1","4","23 October 2014"," Well worth the viewing
","I enjoyed ""Fury"", and the evening's thought it has given me.<br/><br/>The movie is reasonably well-cast. Once again, Brad Pitt is not the best actor, but he provides a solid core around which the others can anchor their roles. I have previously heard a great deal about how bad an actor Shia LaBeouf is (I haven't seen any of the ""Transformers"" franchise), but I thought he was excellent as the barking-mad gunner only just holding on to reality.<br/><br/>The portrayal of tank-battles was a delight to see - and the reason I went to see the movie. It was great to see a more realistic demonstration of what tanks can do than in previous tank features. The scene with the Tiger and the four Shermans made my hair stand up on end! The only thing needed to make this movie real tank-porn was more engine-sounds! The character development of the rookie didn't really work - he said he'd been in the Army for 8 weeks and had been trained as a typist, but he handled a sub-machine gun very well (and didn't forget to take it with him everywhere). Also, he seemed to go from complete naif to steely-eyed killer very quickly (seemingly a few days). I didn't buy that at all.<br/><br/>There are a few other problems with the construction of the movie - the clichéd ending being the worst - such as the sanitised depiction of the damage human beings sustain in war (Brad Pitt being recognisable after two grenades went off in the tank), but, hey, this is Hollywood. Other parts of it - the killing of the captured German soldier, and the uncomfortable scene in the apartment - reflect rarely-depicted aspects of war, and what happened (and is still happening) on all sides of a conflict.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it, but accept that it isn't for everyone. It is a much deeper movie than many are depicting it, and that is part of its charm. It will not be as good on DVD - it needs the big screen to show the whole thing at its best - but it deserves a mention or two during awards season next year."
"MandalorianXYZ","8","1","4","22 October 2014"," Fury is destined to become a new classic.
","Fury is the kind of film that actually gets richer ever time you view it. I've seen it twice now and enjoyed it even more the second time. As much as I loved Saving Private Ryan, I think I may grow to love Fury more. The details in this film are the best I have ever seen in a World War 2 movie. Everything looked very ""lived in"", as if the gear, vehicles and uniforms had been in use for years. I also enjoyed the crew and the occasional banter they shared. The movie was 2:14 but it seemed like 90 minutes. I actually wish it 30 minutes longer, which is extremely rare for me.<br/><br/>The finale that some viewers seem to take issue with is the classic ""defending the Alamo"" scenario. Movies like The Wild Bunch, Dirty Dozen, Saving Private Ryan and 300 all feature characters facing insurmountable odds and making a decision to deal as much damage as possible before going down. The crew of Fury actually takes out half of the threat before the Germans can even figure out what's going on. Add to that soldier fatigue, smoke, confusion, mud, darkness and chaos and I don't find the damage they inflict in the finale as unbelievable as some. The last battle was rather beautiful in many ways as the tracers and explosions lit up the sky while enemy soldiers were seen only in silhouette.<br/><br/>The tank (Fury) itself actually became a character in the film since it's the shell that protects the crew we're riding with (in a way it's protecting the audience as well since we're also inside of Fury). I think a lot of viewers don't appreciate how well David Ayer shot those interior scenes. For the first time (yes, I've seen The Beast) I actually felt like I was inside of a tank watching the crew work together as a well-oiled machine. You could almost smell the stench of sweat, fuel, powder and oil in the belly of Fury.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot if the disposable action and superhero films that Hollywood vomits out year after year, Fury is the kind of movie that stays with the viewer and demands repeated viewings. A true classic that is sure to be watched for generations to come. It's also my favorite movie of 2014 (Guardians Of The Galaxy drops to #2)."
"MikelMask1","8","1","4","19 October 2014"," Good But Not Great
","I saw ""Fury"" today. I am still trying to figure out how much I liked it, especially when comparing it with Saving Private Ryan or the German mini-series Generation War. ""Fury"" takes place in Germany in April 1945 and all of the scenes are shot with overcast skies, fog and mud which adds to the generally dark atmosphere of the film. The combat scenes are very visceral and exciting, especially the battle against the Tiger tank. In most cases they are realistic although the finale is a bit over the top. Death is present at all times but comes unexpectedly adding to the tension of the movie. As Brad Pitt observes, ""the war will end soon but before it does, a lot more people have to die."" No one wants to be the last person to die so the film's depiction of emotional toll on soldiers and civilians alike is especially well done. Yet, ""Fury"" dragged at times and is formulaic enough that I knew early on how it would end and who would ultimately survive. It is definitely a movie worth seeing, especially on a big screen. However, I rated it only 7 out of 10 on IMDb. I had expected to rate it much higher."

"robertmaybeth","10","1","5","23 May 2018"," Well made and authentic, with ""Beast of War"" one of the best WW2 tank movies ever made.
","Probably earns itself a spot in one of the top 10 war movies ever, if only for the great effort made at historical accuracy. <br/><br/>The genuine Sherman tanks used in the movie, along with one of the only running Tiger tanks left in the world, really give this movie a fantastic historical feel. That, and the fact that they do not try to portray American troops as real ""good guys"" as they murder surrendered prisoners and do other things not so nice. I don't doubt these incidents occurred in World War 2, as they do in every war - but there are some genuinely ugly moments in this movie that taint the movie slightly - no doubt as intended, since real war is a million times uglier. Nevertheless, the story has enough scenes to give you something close to a feeling on what being an American tanker in WW2 was like. <br/><br/>The movie moves along briskly from the beginning, and never slows down for long, especially not with excess character development - but enough is revealed about the main characters to show that the tank crew believes they are all more or less a collection of doomed men. The crew know they are probably going to die before the war ends - it's 1945 and the Germans are fighting harder then ever, now that they are on home ground - and their every word and action reflects this idea. So it's no surprise that we will take on the viewpoint of the newby of the group. Norman (Logan Lerman) is a GI that's ordered into Fury (the Sherman tank and the real star) as a radio operator when their last one is KIA. .. and it's Norman's eyes we see the movie through, since he is just as unprepared for what is going to happen as we in the audience are. <br/><br/>Sent to stop German forces in a last minute defensive action, Fury and her fellow Sherman tanks face German army and SS troops in a virtual whirl-wind of crashing violence and furious attacks from a desperate enemy. There's nothing to say about this in a review without ruining the movie, but there were several glaring errors in the portrayal of wartime events...nothing bad enough to spoil the movie, but just enough to be annoying to WW2 history/weapons buffs. <br/><br/>For instance, we are several times shown columns of marching German troops, who are heavily armed and are equipped with several Panzerfausts (German one shot bazookas) yet not once is one of them even fired at Fury! Moreover, ""War daddy"" (Brad Pitt) is shown popping out of the commander's hatch of Fury and firing a captured Sturmgewehr MP 44 (German assault rifle) at enemy. 
There is nothing truly wrong or unauthentic with this - all sides often used captured weapons, but an MP44 would be a very clumsy weapon to be used from the hatch of a Sherman tank (or any tank). This particular rifle was over 3 feet long, and using it from a tank hatch would be very impractical and would seem to involve quite a lot of fumbling. It would also be ridiculously slow to bring into action (tank crews were usually armed with .45 1911 pistols or M3 Grease gun submachine gun for this reason, NOT a full size rifle - even a carbine would really be too long).<br/><br/>Despite the few (very few) silly aspects and historical inaccuracies that happen in this movie, overall this is one of the very best tank movies ever made (the only better one is ""The beast of war""). ""Fury"" is a very good war film, and definitely worth a watch by any war movie fan."

","In my opinion , this is one of the best World War 2 film's I have ever seen. Brad Pitt commands a Sherman tank with a five person crew on a very scary mission behind enemy lines in Germany. Throughout this whole movie it shows how one man's morals can change in a very short time due to a traumatic change of event's. We can see the struggle and pain Brad Pitt (Don Collier) feel's when he is forced to train a young rookie soldier ( Norman Ellison ) how to shoot through a tank and be able to spot and kill the Nazi's. I can tell that the pain and suffering Brad causes the young soldier remind's him of what he had to go through at that age. The whole movie show's perfectly the awfulness and inhumane nature of the war against the Nazi's in Nazi Germany, and the father and son kind of bond that Brad Pitt and the young soldier have together. In the movie it also shows the awfully scarring moments for all the soldiers and how awfully they cope with their emotions. It's a thrilling and heart pounding movie that I think alot more people should appreciate."

It's poorly developed characters left the audience with little to no care or emotional attachment. Like all WW2 movies, when our ""beloved"" characters started dying off, it wasn't as impactful as it should have been. <br/><br/>It tries to hide it's lack of plot with isolated gruesome scenes that you can tell are there to just ""wow"" the audience and make them feel like this is a ""serious or legitimate"" war movie. The environment crafted by the director was lacking and failed to resonate the death or danger of the situation. <br/><br/>Soemwhere in the middle of the movie our band of heroes gather in a house along with the household. For those of you who have watched the movie, you know what I'm talking about.. the dreaded 30-40 mins of no character development, no plot development and frankly just filler material where our main character decides to have or not to have sex with a girl he just met. The scene when her house gets hit by a shell and dies is even more absurd, as our character tries but fails to create an emotional scene.<br/><br/>The final scene is unrealistic with the TC standing on the mounted machine gun with no cover and not get shot by anyone. It requires a damn sniper to finally end his life. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for a good ww2 movie, you can skip this movie or at the least don't expect too much from this."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1945, as the Second World War draws to a close, Hitler has ordered a final, all out assault from every member of the Aryan race to ensure a clearly unattainable victory. In this culminating desperation, Tank commander Captain Collier (Brad Pitt) leads his squadron of men, only now they have a new recruit, in the shape of Private Ellison (Logan Lerman), who's got a whole lot of learning to do in the brutal realities of war.<br/><br/>The Nazi Supermen may not have lasted for a thousand years, as Hitler wanted, but yarns from the battlefields of World War 2 could quite conceivably do so, and Fury is the latest in a long line of such stories. David Ayer's addition to the genre thrusts us in to that period towards the end, when desperation to secure victory was pumping from both the sides of good and evil, more so evil, and as such their panic was leading to ever more extreme and twisted methods to win. As such, like the best war films, Fury does not shy away from showing the brutal, horrific reality of life in battle, unflinching in both blood-letting and human drama. Sadly, Ayer just bumbles the whole thing around, without any solid narrative or structure to hold it together.<br/><br/>The humorous touch from more recent films like The Monuments Men and Inglorious Basterds is not present, and the film is aiming to come off in the league of such fare as Saving Private Ryan and the lesser heard of, but raved about A Midnight Clear. But while those films did a marvellous job of bringing real characters to life, with deft, subtle touches that exposed their human frailties in the most real way, Fury's characters can't help but project the stereotypical blandness of your average war film. Pitt is an effective leading man, and he does his best here, but he doesn't quite have the charisma to really make it great. Likewise, the supporting cast are also unable to rise to their best.<br/><br/>It's a shame, as with tighter writing and a more structured plot, Fury could have risen from the good to great category. I didn't think it was quite as bad as a lot of other people seem to, but that's not to say I can't see the missed potential. ***"

","This film is great in parts and a bit long winded in others. Pitt is excellent in the role of war weary sergeant and gives a gutsy performance. Shia Labeouf is good, Pena and Bernthal are OK, but the best acting is by the young Logan Lerman in the roll of 'Norman'. I feel this film would have been better condensed into 90 minutes, instead of the 2 hour 14 minutes it ended up as. The length of some of the scenes is unnecessary, and in the tension of war you expect something to happen, but it doesn't most of the time.<br/><br/>This is not a pretty film in many scenes and the blood and guts may upset the weak willed, but for those of you who like that kind of film, then this film is a must.<br/><br/>When it ends, see if you think.......'Platoon'."

Pool fight against the Nazis of any primary colours,with Ayer and Vasyanov rubbing dirt into the movie,as the tank (which was not a prop,but actually the last known surviving version of a Tiger I) crushes the mountains of broken bodies & gunfire in its way.Locking the Tiger I down for the final 30 minutes,Ayer and Vasyanov cast a rusty mist across the title to create a ghostly atmosphere,as the Nazis stomp out of the shadows.<br/><br/>Aiming for a ""realistic"" feel by having the characters speak in a harsh,brittle dialogue,the screenplay by Ayer completely misses its target,and fails to explode.Failing to give even the barest outline as to what locations the tank finds itself in,Ayer makes ""Wardaddy"" and his crew flat,cardboard cut outs,who are each shown to be extremely vicious bullies,who experience a sudden change of heart towards Ellison,despite Ellison not having done anything to make ""Wardaddy's"" gang of jerks display such a sudden difference of option towards him.<br/><br/>Appearing this time without a paper bag on his head, Shia LaBeouf gives a good,rough performance as the worn-down Boyd 'Bible' Swan,whilst Brad Pitt does well at barking orders as the stiff- drinking Don 'Wardaddy' Collier,in a film which fails to strike down with furious anger."

","This film has the best recreation of WW2 tank warfare you will ever see, but to my mind, it captures roughly the same level of truth about combat in WW2 as ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Inglorious Basterds"".<br/><br/>I think the guys who manned those tanks in WW2 deserved a better homage than this.<br/><br/>Much of the film revolves around veteran tank sergeant, Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt), 'blooding' replacement Pvt. Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) in the ways of war and Nazi-hating. He does this with techniques such as making the 'newbie' shoot an unarmed prisoner in the back and scaring defenceless German women as they 'liberate' their town. Before long 'Wardaddy' has Norman joyfully creating the red mist around many of the Herrenvolk before most of the crew go out in a blaze of glory.<br/><br/>For a while now, filmmakers have revelled in showing 'how war really is' with plenty of the stuff the old Hollywood Production Code used to stop. But in ""Fury"", the US Troops are so badass that it wouldn't have been a surprise to see the Germans head for the Russian lines to surrender because they thought they would stand a better chance of survival.<br/><br/>There are some odd touches in ""Fury"". 'Wardaddy' cruises around with a far too modern haircut, and about the same level of authority as George S Patton - he also makes nearly as many speeches as 'Ol Blood 'n' Guts'. It actually comes as a surprise when we see him taking orders from an officer.<br/><br/>With the exception of Norman, the guys in the tank crew are played in a rather dumbed-down way. However, that doesn't stop them from also making speeches - there are more before-battle speeches here than in Henry V or John Wayne's ""The Alamo"".<br/><br/>Even when a film isn't based on a specific historical event, the expectation is that it will attempt to capture a feeling for the time it portrays. Although ""Fury"" captures the look, I'm not so sure about the feeling.<br/><br/>Was executing prisoners the norm? Credulity is stretched to breaking point in that scene where 'Wardaddy' teaches Norman how to whack Germans, especially when it was done in front of such a large audience. What, no officers around to have 'Wardaddy' arrested and sent for a court martial or most probably a Section 8? Or even any Army Intelligence guys who needed prisoners for interrogation? It would be naïve to think US and allied forces didn't kill prisoners in the heat of battle during the war in Europe, but some of the scenes in ""Fury"" seem informed by the fact and fiction of all the other wars the US has fought since WW2.<br/><br/>Without the touches of nastiness and the brilliantly-staged battle scenes, the storyline of ""Fury"" is decidedly routine, not much above an episode of the old ""Combat"" TV series, and in my opinion, falls way short of other portrayals of WW2 such as ""Band of Brothers"" or Carl Foreman's ""The Victors"".<br/><br/>Millions of people around the world will see ""Fury""; most won't have a keen knowledge of history; they probably won't differentiate that much between wars - a bit like the people who actually made the film - and if that is the impression they get of the US army, then the job of the modern-day soldier is made just that much harder."

"whistler118","7","1","5","13 February 2015"," Immersive, Gritty but Disappointing.
","There is no doubt about it, Fury is perhaps one of the best war films to come out in the last few year, but unfortunately for either film buffs or history buffs this film disappoints on many levels. <br/><br/>As a film, Fury does a good job of building the characters and the environment that they are in. This has to be the strongest part of the film, its ability to portray the war and the crew of Fury, the tank, in a human but gritty manner. Through this, it presents a number of unsettling scenes which help pull the audience into the character development and general war time environment. However, by doing so its falls into a number of cliché's that we expect from a modern American war film; young recruit, alpha dog sergeant, shocking gore, a love interest and a heroic jingoistic final battle. By following these cliché's I cant help feel that the film was already written and that too much time was spent developing the characters rather than what the audience is there for, to watch a war film.<br/><br/>On this, Fury mostly does an great job. The battles place you on the edge of your seat, the graphic are superb and the sounds are some of the best I have heard. Combining this with overview and crew point of view camera angles its immerses the watcher completely into that world. We also see the current fashion of attempting to shock the audience with gore. This current fashion suits Fury well as it compliments the gritty cinematography, however, I can't help feel that they have over gored it at times. <br/><br/>However, for any audience, film or historical backing, the film falls apart in one main area, the portrayal of the Germans. It is because of this the film will never be a war film classic and will quickly be forgotten about in the coming months. The Germans are depicted as faceless, brain dead, incompetent idiots and plays the roll of a target for Pitt's crew's machine-guns. Some scenes are more comparable to a zombie movie than a WW2 war film! There is also no need for this apart from supporting the film's American patriotic hero vibe.<br/><br/>In summary, Fury is a immerse, gritty and largely enjoyable film, however, the ever increasing jingoistic wave reaches a tipping point in the film leaving many bewildered audience members disappointed."
"fredwalker94606","3","1","5","27 January 2015"," This director would get fragged in combat.
","I only watched this film due to believing it addressed, at least to some degree, one of the worst failings in the U.S. war machine during WW2, the Sherman tank and our other armor. Starting the show with a reference to this issue, I expected something of substance to follow, but that was totally incorrect. Since I'm not a fan of Hollywood garbage, I had to look up this director and his other ""work,"" and I immediately saw the problem. Ayer is a little boy who seems to think he can run roughshod over history, and the people whose sacrifices made possible his arrogant and foolish productions. Being criticized by the British Prime Minister for re-writing the the past, specifically the code breaker's war in the European theater, with his shlock ""U-571"", didn't teach him a thing, though he espoused his shame and guilt at the time. Why there's not a veteran's lobby to shut down quacks like him is a real tragedy, just like the soldier's helplessness over useless commanders. Comic books like this film belong in the kiddy aisle in life, not the history section.<br/><br/>The reviews I've read are spot on, covering in detail the execrable ending as well as other nonsense scenes, so I'll give the reader a little background on why our soldiers were stuck in the ""Death Traps"" that usually just carried them to their doom. I don't know all the details, meaning how much pressure or resistance was placed on the U.S. Army by Detroit, the manufacturers of the tanks, or the financiers. But the General in charge was named Lesley McNair, and he was incompetent on several levels, not just armor. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he insisted our tanks could stand up to German high velocity anti-tank weapons and heavy tanks, such as the Tiger I in this film and the Panther, not shown. He held up the development of a heavy tank, the Pershing M-26, which could do battle with them, until General Devers, who was actually leading troops in combat, went over his head to George Marshall. There's much more to the story, and the director has claimed to have studied Belton Cooper's work explicating the horrors and shortcomings of the Sherman, but only the opposite of that, his adolescent mockery of the tactics of our tankers, is in evidence here. It is sufficient to say that absolutely no one approached either the German tanks or their anti-tank weapons head on at this stage of the war, not voluntarily; all those types were sent to the bone yard back in France if not before. But that doesn't get other ignorant boys, as I used to be, into the theater, and doesn't give them an unrealistic view of combat making them amenable to recruitment. <br/><br/>The good news for future armored units after WW2 is that McNair was killed by friendly fire in Normandy, when a heavy bomber actually dropped one right in his foxhole. Now THAT'S what I call precision bombing! It's a shame this phlegm maker is turning people's suffering into more padding for his bank account, without any leader in the U.S. stepping up as did Tony Blair previously.<br/><br/>But that's Hollywoodtown Jake. It don't mean a thing."
"Argemaluco","7","1","5","15 January 2015"," Fury is an entertaining, but not very memorable, war film
","With so many wars available as an inspiration for modern cinema, I like the fact that World War II keeps being visited with quite a frequency, because it was the last conflict with perfectly defined ""good ones"" and ""evil ones"", and with a concrete purpose which wasn't guided by ambiguous economic goals or questionable political interests. What I don't like too much is that, in 21st century, I generally keep finding the same clichés of the films I used to watch when I was a kid with my dad, in which John Wayne or William Holden played brave soldiers who didn't only fight the enemy, but who also represented the noble and fair North American ideals of post- war world. The difference is that, back then, it was considered propaganda, and nowadays, it's considered art... or sarcasm, according to the spectator's criterion. Anyway, the point is that Fury is a clichéd and not very memorable war film, but nevertheless, I found it entertaining, mainly because of the solid performances. Brad Pitt brings a credible and charismatic work in the leading role, and he's well complemented by Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal. Fury employs the same characters and situations from old war films, but its representation of the combat displays in detail the effect of the bullets and explosions over the human body, as well as the degradation of physical and psychological conditions in the line of battle. But the blood and devastation don't feel morbid or gratuitous, but as a reminder of the price many people paid for the sake of freedom (or whatever we currently enjoy). So, Fury isn't an excellent or particularly memorable film, but it managed to keep me entertained, and I can give it a moderate recommendation mainly because of its adequate balance of drama and action and the good performances."

One also sports a goatee, another what appears to be a wedding ring on his right hand, a third a chain on his neck. The dialogue matches: lots of ""fucks,"" but none of the ""shits"" and ""goddamits"" much more likely to have been heard in the '40s. <br/><br/>But there are shades of the '40s in FURY. Shades of '40s war movies, that is. There's the mixed crew - an ""ethnic,"" an innocent, a lout, a tough guy, who all ultimately bond together. There's the bittersweet interlude with German women ( even including one whose hairdo is reminiscent of Veronica Lake). And there's the almost futile battle with at least one good guy surviving. <br/><br/>Of course we now have color, more and bigger explosions, and more graphic blood and guts ( or paint and animal entrails).

"Hawkensian","7","1","5","10 November 2014"," Its climactic scene descends into Rambo territory, however outside of this David Ayer's Fury contains some impressively loud and brutal scenes of warfare.
","I had been eagerly anticipating Fury, I had faith in it as director David Ayer proved his skill in creating searingly intense action sequences in End of Watch (2012), a film that had a palpable sense of danger. Despite Fury following a tank crew during WW2, I don't think it matched End of Watch's pervasive sense of looming peril, as the latter had a hyperrealism and an urban environment more familiar to me than a battleground, thank goodness.<br/><br/>The film opens with several lines of text explaining the situation, it's simple but rather chilling, informing the viewers that it's April 1945 and that the German defence is the most 'fanatical' the Allies have encountered in the European theatre.<br/><br/>Fury follows a tank crew comprising Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt), a battle hardened veteran of North Africa and Europe; Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a timid rookie with only 8 weeks' training as a typist; Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the clichéd zealously religious southerner; Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal), a genuinely hateful, obnoxious, rancid Neanderthal who regularly boiled my blood.<br/><br/>Fury's chief merit is its war scenes. The film features some excellent sound engineering, which was delivered to me by Vue's thunderingly loud sound system. Be prepared for the frenzied chatter of MG42s, the sudden, reverberating boom of artillery fire and the piercing shriek of tank shells ricocheting. The instantaneous, ceaseless death is executed well, men's lives end forever left, right and centre in the most brutal fashion, whether it's death by headshot, fire, explosives or tank tracks – it's anonymous slaughter on a massive scale. Like any combat-intensive war film should do, Fury leaves you feeling battered, however its power is unfortunately hindered by its stupid concluding battle.<br/><br/>With publicity photos of Brad Pitt posturing meanly with his cool hair, I had worried that Fury would be a Brad Pitt vehicle, a film in which Pitt is a gunslinging B-movie war hero instead of a real soldier. I felt my fears were being confirmed when in the first minute or so Pitt jumps off a tank and launches himself at a man on horseback, knocking him down and vehemently stabbing him in the eyes; however his Rambo emulation was generally kept at bay until the film's final battle, where his character and indeed the whole film goes awry.<br/><br/>War films and the moralising that comes with some can so easily become hackneyed, and there are times where the dialogue veered very closely to the trite 'war is hell' territory with lines such as 'You'll soon know what a man can do to another man.' delivered portentously and too early in the film by Gordo.<br/><br/>Characterisation also suffered from tired conventions at times; although LaBeouf went method actor for his character (he cut his face and pulled one of his teeth out), he rather wasted his commitment, as Boyd 'Bible' Swan is the tiringly familiar southern drawling preacher that, according to cinema, was present in every platoon. Saving Private Ryan was also guilty of this with Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), the stylishly ultra-accurate, cross-kissing sniper. Indeed, the areas that these characters hail from constitute the most religious region of the United States, their presence I suppose is entirely plausible, however I think they stink of stock character.<br/><br/>The worst instance of engagement breaking clichéd tosh happens at the beginning of the film's final scene, in which the heroic Wardaddy decides to fight a much, much larger SS division that possess both vehicles and a comprehensive arsenal of weapons. Initially, the men protest it, but of course one by one they declare that 'I'm stayin'!' I did much head shaking during this moment. Despite these brushes with cliché however, I felt that Fury didn't become a serious offender.<br/><br/>There's a protracted scene in which Wardaddy and Norman seek refuge in the apartment of a German mother and daughter. Initially, the scene is wrought with tension as you don't know the battle-hardened Wardaddy's intentions; rape of German women was commonplace, particularly by Soviet troops during and after the Battle of Berlin. However the scene eventually becomes overlong and rather misguided, the ambiguous tension is lost long before the expected payoff or denouement, a variety of which never arriving.<br/><br/>And now to the aforementioned final battle scene. I have read numerous arguments defending the scene's credibility, however the reasoning is invariably flimsy – demonstrably, the scene is very flawed indeed. I have heard some remarkable stories of bravery from WW2, the most recent one being Robert Cain (Jeremy Clarkson's father-in-law). Major Cain had been driven to a frenzy during Operation Market Garden, resigning himself to death and managing to disable or destroy six tanks using his deft skill with a 6-pounder anti-tank gun and, believe it or not, a two-inch mortar fired from his hip. Cain somehow survived the ordeal, winning a Victoria Cross for his gallantry. Despite such stories, there are just too many holes in Fury's last standoff; it's a lazily written stain on the film that breaks the momentum of the electrifying collection of war scenes that preceded it.<br/><br/>71%<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"DareDevilKid","7","1","5","9 November 2014"," Well-Crafted War Film that Explores the Depths of Hell in Battle
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.3/5 stars<br/><br/>The first thing that you notice inn ""Fury"" is the mud. Even more than the copious blood and violence, it represents the defining visual element of ""Fury"". It's everywhere. Feet are caked with it. Tires and treads churn it under. Roads - if they can be called that - are paved with it. Rarely has a World War II film depicted just how filthy everything was during the 1945 slog across Germany's rural country on the race to Berlin. If writer/director David Ayer is to be credited with nothing else, he gets this right, illustrating that, unlike what's shown in less historically exacting war films, the final push for the Allies was no post-D-Day picnic.<br/><br/>Tanks have featured in countless war movies yet rarely been the focus of those films. Slow, hulking and claustrophobic, they lack the 'glamour' of planes, the scale of battleships and the vulnerability of the lone soldier. Two rare exceptions are 1943's ""Sahara"" and 1988's ""The Beast of War"", both of which centered on lone tank crews bravely engaging the enemy against seemingly impossible odds. In that vein, ""Fury"" is a fitting new addition. In the closing stages of the Second World War, a single US Sherman M4 tank (baring the nickname from which the film takes its title), is tasked with holding a vital crossroads deep behind German lines. Led by their tough-as-nails sergeant, ""Wardaddy"" Don Collier (Brad Pitt), the crew includes Bible-thumping Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), pugnacious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal), and immigrant Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena) - a hardened bunch of veterans who do not take kindly to their new, fresh-faced draftee, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), whose mobile armored experience consists of knowing how to operate a typewriter. The fifth seat in the tank, tragically vacated, is filled by this typist-turned-gunner/driver, who is as unenthused about being with the four as they are about having him there.<br/><br/>Norman's initiation is quick and uncompromising. His first job is to wipe down the tank's interior and scrub away the fleshy remains of his predecessor. Then its straight into action, where the true horrors of the conflict are seen, felt and heard all around. One thing ""Fury"" does exceptionally well is demonstrate precisely how devastating a tank was to anything less than another one (unless that other one was the German ""Tiger"", whose forward-facing armor made it invulnerable to all US counterparts). ""Ideals are peaceful"", explains Wardaddy, ""history is violent"", and the sound of enemy shells tearing holes through the sky as they blaze past or into the American units is a terrifyingly violent experience.<br/><br/>Indeed, all the combat scenes in ""Fury"" are brutally graphic, offering a ""Saving Private Ryan"" level of gruesome reality to the war experience, even if the film as a whole fall slightly short of meeting the lofty standards of Spielberg's ultimate war classic. Bodies are burned, shredded and liquefied, yet what truly startles is the matter-of-factness with which the other soldiers regard it all. This is the final stage of the conflict, remember, by which time most troops had experienced years of dehumanizing savagery. ""It's just war!"" one of them explains to Norman, whose revulsion to the death around him is neatly reflective of the audience's.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's Don is a toned-down version of the memorable character he played in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Bastards"". Though this role might not have the same impact as the Tarantino-scripted one, it's still noteworthy for portraying Don to be just as determined and uncompromising but far less gung-ho. He lives by a code of honor with principle #1 being to keep his men alive and principle #2 follows Patton's directive about killing Nazis. In particular, he has no sympathy for the SS. The only good one is a dead one, and it doesn't matter if he has surrendered. Pitt is more than believable in this role, and completely vanishes into the character. His performance is genuinely affecting - barking orders, maintaining camaraderie, and at times being brutal to the point of risking real inhumanity, as when he forces Norman to shoot a captured German soldier in the back just to give him the experience of doling out death. Yet there are other moments when he is able to shed that horrible armor for just a few minutes, and convey a man who is terribly frightened, not only of his own possible death, but of what he may have become in keeping himself and the others alive. Logan Lerman doesn't have Pitt's screen presence, but he fills the role of the clerk-turned-warrior capably. His character has the longest and most extreme arc. Shia LaBeouf, who may or may not retire from acting after this performance, fulfills the promise that once had Hollywood insiders predicting great things from him. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal ably fill out the quintet.<br/><br/>David Ayer has directed a work that moves with a cinematic force; even grace. It is a difficult film to discount. From the vivid, fluid photography (Roman Vasyanov) to the mournful and muscular score (Steven Price), ""Fury"" is irrefutably crafted. Over two hours long it is tense going, a sturdily acted affair, and yet, as the author of this drama, Ayer has penned a work that takes us no place new, or illuminating, or even exciting, but what it does manage to do is give us a brutally realistic war film. ""Fury"" is a war movie as much as an anti-war movie, with an emphasis on the horrors of war, and which minimizes the heroic aspects of being a soldier. In this film, war really is hell."

The Germans were typically portrayed as easy kills even though the Americans were surrounded by dozens of them. I can't imagine that the moment you get out of the tank you're not blown away immediately. The action pauses whenever one of the allies gets shot because thats where the dramatic scene occurs. The first two hours of the movie are in that sense kinda misleading because you can taste a sense of realism there. <br/><br/>It's also very predictable how the main cast dies in the expected chronological order. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a realistic war movie then this for sure isn't for you.<br/><br/>This movie will soon be forgotten."
"ClaytonDavis","7","1","5","29 October 2014"," David Ayer's war epic is a tightly constructed cinematic piece featuring standout works from Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman...
","You want some intensity, heart palpitations, and just sheer pulse- pounding action? You don't need to look much further than David Ayer's monumental war film ""Fury"" with an all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LeBeouf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal. In the vein of any edge-of-your-seat thrill ride experienced over the past few years, ""Fury"" ignites a passionate look at the brotherhood of war and the beauty that can peak its head out every now and again. Honest, raw, and vividly shot, Ayer's war epic stands as one of the best surprises the year has offered.<br/><br/>With elements of Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and a ""dinner scene"" that would put ""Django Unchained"" to absolute shame, ""Fury"" is full of wit, charm, and affection. The film takes place in April 1945 Germany. A five-man crew of a Sherman tank, lead by a battle- hardened sergeant named Wardaddy, take on near-impossible odds to hit the heart of the opposition towards the end of the war. When a rookie infantry member joins the group, they will learn several things about each other, and ultimately themselves, in the face of a motherless war.<br/><br/>How can you start anywhere else, without beginning with the writer and director David Ayer? Already gaining a legion of fans following ""End of Watch,"" the impressive filmmaker takes on a new realm of storytelling that feels intimate, and consequently real. We spend over 60% of the film, inside the belly of a mechanical beast. Paul Greengrass executed a similar take with ""Captain Phillips"" last year in the lifeboat, and Ayer illustrates the same quality that is sure to be appreciated and loved. From a directorial standpoint, Ayer is unmatched by any action filmmaker that has hit screens this year. He owns every shot, every emotion, and every ounce of pride that the cast and crew exhibit. He controls the ship (or in this case TANK) with an effortless ease. There will be no doubt that this is a testosterone driven film, and the average movie guy will be screaming from the rooftops in an action-packed blissful state. However, there is an emotional core that is so very present in every scene, even when its ugly, that it allows an accessibility to every movie-goer. You won't find a more genuine depiction of war since ""The Hurt Locker.""<br/><br/>From a writing standpoint, Ayer puts forth a solidly valiant effort, with minor missteps along the way. I would have wanted less clichéd behaviors from certain characters at times, even some richer dialogue. Ayer constructs his story with precision. He absolutely knows when, what, and how he wants his characters to react. Every action feels fluid, and moving towards an ultimate resolution. He finds the beats of a scene quite well and at over two hours, the film moves like a freight train. You never feel a second. I do feel that Ayer missed out on some opportunities for a ""real"" breakthrough in a character, or a revealing quality of a character that didn't feel like I've seen it before. There were moments that were predictable but in no way do they bog down the overall experience of ""Fury.""<br/><br/>A slick and magnetic ensemble are present on screen. This is one of the best performances that Brad Pitt has ever done. Continuously pushing himself as an actor, his depth and vigor are both alluring and hypnotic to watch. The real breakout star of the film is none other than Logan Lerman. Already exhibiting an awards worthy performance in Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" over two years ago, if there was any doubt that this young man is one of the most exciting actors to watch, they should be laid to rest. Lerman is sensational from front to end. Calling back some young actors that have played in war films and have stood out (I kept coming back to Jeremy Davies' unrequited work in ""Saving Private Ryan""), he plainly steals the movie from underneath every actor's eye. Lerman's work is an awards- caliber performance that the Academy Awards should not hesitate to recognize.<br/><br/>Co-stars Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena, and especially Shia LeBeouf all have individual moments to shine. Bernthal is a tornado of frenzy rage, taking out everything in his path. LeBeouf calls back to his stunning work in ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" from nearly a decade ago. Quietly powerful but loudly present. Pena is your most underwritten and clichéd character, but someone of Pena's talent ability, rises above in nearly every instance.<br/><br/>""Fury"" has an abundance of technical highlights. Recent Oscar- winning composer Steven Price, puts forth another emotionally resonate score that stands out. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov captures shots of anxiety and concentration that only a master could accomplish. Film Editor Dody Dorn, who's crowning work will always be Christopher Nolan's ""Memento,"" should be commended for making a 135 minute war epic, feel like a fleeting anxiety attack.<br/><br/>""Fury"" is an emotional extremity. You don't get films like this that both operate on an accessible entertainment level for all audiences and still remain awards-caliber. It's a tremendous achievement, unforgettable, and one of the richly rewarding films of the year."

","'FURY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>World War II war flick written and directed by David Ayer (who also performed both duties on multiple cop movies like 'END OF WATCH', 'HARSH TIMES' and 'SABOTAGE'; he also wrote 'TRAINING DAY' and directed 'STREET KINGS'). It stars Brad Pitt as a U.S. Army Staff Sergeant leading a crew of men into battle in Nazi Germany, in a Sherman tank, on the last days of the European Theater. It costars Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal and Michael Peña. It's pretty gruesome, and very dark, but also a fitting tribute to the soldiers who gave their lives in that hellish war.<br/><br/>The story takes place in April of 1945, as the Allies battle bravely to take control of Nazi Germany; during the last month of the European war. Pitt plays Don 'Wardaddy' Collier; the leader of a M4A3E8 Sherman tank, and it's five-man crew. The film centers on each man as they horrendously fight off Nazi soldiers, behind enemy lines. It especially focuses on the relationship between Wardaddy and an inexperienced private, named Norman Ellison (Lerman).<br/><br/>The movie is very bloody, and disgustingly violent, and there is some controversy over how accurately it depicts the horrors, and atrocities, of World War II. One of the technical advisors on the film, a World War II tank gunner named Don Evans, says the violence shown, in the movie, is much worse than he remembers (and he wasn't looking forward to seeing it, on the big screen). All of Ayer's films are extremely brutal though, and he did grow up in South Central Los Angeles, so if you can stand the gore I'd definitely still recommend it. The directing is technically (near) perfect and the character study, being presented, is extremely fascinating. I especially like the performances of LaBeouf (one of my favorite actors) and Lerman. Pitt is really good too (but he still always seems like Brad Pitt, in the movie). If you like and respect war films I'd definitely recommend this movie!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/GmFPW994ONg"

It's just keep killing or end up dead yourself. There isn't much story or character development either. Fury just rumbles on, from one battle to the next. As a result, despite being over 2 hours long, the movie still feels cut short.<br/><br/>My only real gripe is the ending. After being gritty and ""anti- Hollywood"" for most of the movie, there is the most clichéd and unrealistic finale ever. Other than that, the movie was hugely entertaining.<br/><br/>7/10."

Very predictable, but in a good way, reminiscent of a traditional war movie with a ""Saving Private Ryan"" nod to realism and ""war is hell"" sentiment. Good ensemble cast along the lines of classics like ""Battleground"" and ""Guadalcanal Diary."" Brad Pitt makes a very good hero, reminiscent of his role in ""Inglorious Basterds"" but not as over- the-top.

I was really impressed that it is not only a real tiger tank but is actually the only surviving functional tiger tank in the world. Now the bad. The story of the fng being thrown into a group of hardened veterans has been done to death. The fact the new guy was never trained to drive a tank and had never seen the inside of one and was a typist before seemed alittle dumb. Why wouldn't the military retrain a seasoned soldier to do it. I had a hard time sitting through the whole meal eating and the new guy and his German girlfriend. They drag it on way too long and I was falling asleep. I hated what low life's most of war daddies crew were. It made it hard to feel anything for them. Then I felt there were a lot of misplaced ideals like the end when the German soldier discovers the new guy hiding under the destroyed tank and doesn't say anything and let's him live even though he had wasted tons of that Germans platoon. Does that mean the Germans had more morals than Americans? they show scenes of not only abuse but executions of German POWs by Americans. It sounds like I'm being harsh, all in all not a bad movie but certainly not ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". I will probably still pick it up on DVD because I can always fast forward through the boring parts."

","It is 1944. US forces are taking Germany back from the Nazis. FURY is the name of one of their tanks, and its crew are Brad Pitt, Shia LaBoeuf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal.<br/><br/>A screen commanding film, Fury is an achievement for Director David Ayer. He rises to the occasion summoning strong performances and crafting brutally vivid images and rousing fight scenes.<br/><br/>The story is told largely from the point of view of a recent draftee, who wants nothing to do with war. He is assigned to Pitt's crew and there is a good scene where Pitt attempts to 'christen' him by handing him a pistol and bullying him into shooting captured Nazi, but the kid is too squeamish to do so. <br/><br/>Despite being in some great movies, Brad Pitt hasn't done much for me in the last ten years. Since Inglorious Basterds, he has become a little monotonous. In fury he succeeds in channelling a convincing real beast which he hides behind his patriarchal composure.<br/><br/>There is an intriguingly lengthy scene where he and his tank crew have breakfast in the home of two German women (complete strangers) , in a half abandoned town. It's not much of a breakfast but it becomes clear that the meal is less important than merely being in a home in the company of women (something that soldiers don't get the luxury of). <br/><br/>Kicking off the last act there is a memorable one on one tank fight between our guys and a German Tiger tank. In the middle of an open field, they fight like man o' war ships in a bay, each relying on strategy more than fire power to bring the other one down. The climax is a suicidal stand off between our guys and a German platoon. Bullets and shells go flying amidst the surrealist lighting of explosions and flames. <br/><br/>The ending we get is an inevitable one, but it is perfectly appropriate for the kind of war movie that Fury wants to be."

","Ruined by a Preposterous Ending.<br/><br/>There are not that many films about Allied tank crews, and the idea has potential with the cramped confines of a tank doubling for those of a submarine, and submarine films, with their claustrophobic intensity have a rich history. Director David Ayer has a distinguished action track record behind him, and was behind the commercially successful, but historically risible, U 571.<br/><br/>It tells the story, warts and all, of an American tank crew in the final push into Germany. Authentic to a fault, Brad Pitt is suitably muscular as the tank commander, Shia Lebeouf shades the acting honours though as the reluctant rookie.<br/><br/>Ayer handles the story, and the action sequences well. The gruesome reality of war is well told. But he loses the plot as the story rolls to its climax. Modern audiences are beyond the good guys surviving and triumphing over overwhelming odds, yet at the end, Ayer cannot resist the ""against the odds"" shoot out, and the SS are caricatured as evil, but inept, fighters.<br/><br/>Without the preposterous ending, ""Fury"" would be a creditable 7/10, with it, it slips to a lazy 5/10."

He's only trained to be a typist, so what he sees upon joining the tank really blows his mind. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, the boss. Boyd is the religious one, Gordo the cool one, and Grady the crazy one. At first, Norman doesn't want to shoot and is taught a humiliating lesson by Wardaddy about shooting Krauts. I thought that went against character and made Wardaddy not likable. Soon they are fighting and survive a close call, and then take over a town. While there an extended scene is thrown in where Wardaddy and Norman take up in a residence with 2 girls. It seems Wardaddy just wants them to make something to eat, but it is so weird and then wants Norman to take one girl into the bedroom. Then his other 3 crew show up and are so rude, but Wardaddy doesn't throw them out. Why not? Then the tank crew is given a mission to hold crossroads and they have to do it by themselves. The tank breaks but they hold on when a Nazi caravan show up. Only Norman survives. What I didn't get was they throw some grenades inside, and later when Norman climbs back into the tank, Wardaddy is still intact. Wouldn't he have been blown to pieces? Anyway, at the end we see they had killed a large number of the Nazis and American troops had showed up.<br/><br/>I thought the gore and war violence was pretty good.

Now it did show the grim side of war from the side of battle hardened and fatigued soldiers which actually fits the name of the film now that I think about it. While watching this film I did notice one or two things taken from ""Saving Private Ryan"", but that was O.K., because it was still an O.K. film. Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) is a sergeant who commands a Sherman tank called Fury and it's crew of five who are of course outnumbered, out-gunned, and has a newly recruited rookie fighting along with them.

His character is not too far removed from his Lt. Aldo Raine character in 'Inglorious Basterds'.

"stanferguson87","7","1","6","28 March 2015"," A refreshingly shot war movie about five ""brothers"", their tank and their journey together.
","First and foremost, I would like to applaud the casting department in this movie. It was brilliantly done because this is the type of movie which needs actors. No, scratch that! It needs talented actors to really carry the audience from the very first scene to the very end. Mr Brad Pitt leading the ensemble as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier. A very engrossing and visceral performance as the Captain of the tank unit. Immediately commanding and owning the father figure role of this self contained brotherhood of men. This excellence of performances continues to filter down through the ranks, from Sia Labeouf as Boyd 'Bible' Swan, Michael Peña as Trini 'Gordo' Garcia, Jon Bernthal as Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis and to complete the fighting five is Logan Lerman as the wet behind the ears pencil pusher, Norman Ellison. This is where the heart of story lives, with these guys. All day and night. WW2 stories like this have been told a thousand times over, especially in this kind of genre. Unfortunately this is completely true but the massive difference here is that it's from a fresh perspective for a ""war story"" and the fresh perspective continues throughout, especially in the shooting style of the movie as well. Four lads in one of the most claustrophobic environment's conceivable, whilst engaging and witnessing some of the most savage, brutal, and most tactically fought tank battles they'll ever see through out their lifetime. By filming it in such a boxed hand-held manner, it fully immerses you as a viewer and that coupled with these outstanding performances creates this concoction that pulls you in so much that you almost feel like the sixth member of this dogged unit. Whether you want to be there or not. David Ayer is at the helm of this movie and has definitely pushed himself in a different direction in comparison to his previous films, which were very modern in comparison. Such the likes of ""Training day"", ""End of watch"" and ""The fast and furious"" etc. The shooting style in ""Fury"" is unconventional because it needed to be. To David Ayer's credit, empathy is the greatest reason why you keep watching these guys and really start to care about them because they're emotive reaction to everything they encounter is so human. They shout at each other and get on each others nerves. They joke and laugh at one another just to pass the time. They share the same pain when they lose a comrade in battle. It's a job, that's what these brave young men did and still do to this day. The crux of the whole movie is about this tight knit family group of brothers. The way they react to each other when they're in trouble or when they stumble upon something seemingly impossible to survive, there is that over whelming sense of brotherly love and respect for one another. This is apparent on and off the screen. It's an absolute pleasure to watch these actors verbally and sometimes physically spa with each other, you see why they were cast for each of their individual roles. To quote the film ""best job I ever had!"" I truly believe it when each one of these guys repeats this simultaneously as characters on screen and even more so as friends off the silver screen."

","The setting is the near end of WW2. A US tank crew is stranded in Nazi-Germany, holding position at a crossroad on a self-imposed suicide mission. <br/><br/>This is a typical war movie, entertaining, violent, but not very deep. The side characters are portrayed according to the situation. A main character needs to learn to kill: an an ugly German soldier with a stolen American coat appears. Tragedy of war is displayed: A beautiful girl in a short skirt, in love with the rookie soldier, dies in an air strike. <br/><br/>But what bothers me most is that Hitler would probably have liked the movie. A tank crew facing an overwhelming enemy crowd refuses to surrender, but sacrifices itself (of course praying) for a higher cause. In fact, this glorification of martyrdom has been idealized by the Nazis, e.g. when the 6. army was sacrificed to hold Stalingrad, and civilians were mobilized to extreme (and futile) resistance. It leaves a bitter taste to see such stuff nowadays. <br/><br/>5 stars for showing the ugly face of war unadorned. In that sense, it resembles an anti-war movie."

I enjoyed the Movie, the story and the Characters in the movie, it's a tale of heroism in the face of overwhelming odds. I thought the casting was excellent,the acting performances were believable and the combat scenes were brutal. Reviewers who feel compelled to condemn every detail of a WW2 Movie for it's lack of realism or unbelievable scenarios are just clutching at straws because they had no idea what really occurred on the battlefields of Germany in the last days of the War and how desperate both sides were to put an end to it all. Whether or not they could destroy the Tank with their Panzerfausts or not? how would you know what could have transpired in such a desperate Combat situation?

Character motivations that are unclear and clash with the character that was established in previous scenes. There are several time-warps where in a scene towards the end time does not seem to pass at all while the characters converse and bond, then, during a battle it suddenly becomes night within the time it takes to shoot empty one machine gun belt of ammo.<br/><br/>There is a lot of bible-quoting going on that also really has not much to do with the scene and seems out of place. Finally the German SS infantry seems to be unable to perform the most basic of tasks and acts entirely irrational and unorganized.<br/><br/>Could have been a great movie, ended up being a bunch of seen-before scenes stitched and cut together without the viewer being able to make an emotional connection to the characters."

","Fury is a war movie that depicts war violence in a real form. Realistic war is throughout, but that's all this film has going for it.<br/><br/>All of the actors in the film did their jobs. However, all I saw were actors in a film. Brad Pitt gave his performance but, the only person I saw was Brad Pitt. Shia Labeouf did his job and he was good but, I only saw Shia Labeouf and not the character. All of the actors played different types of characters but, none of the characters in the film were important.<br/><br/>In my opinion, none of the actors characters held any significance. When a situation occurred it didn't really matter. The Characters (in my opinion) ultimately ended up nowhere. The film stayed on an A line and never really progressed to a B or C line. Nothing really happened in the film but the exact same situations. The film didn't try to go further.<br/><br/>The story moved and it moved along and then, I slowly started to realize that the story wasn't really going anywhere. All of the characters in the film went through a continuous series of circumstances. The characters formed a bond, they stuck together, and they tried to survive. The physically and emotional scars of battle (I felt) were freshly drawn on the characters faces. The characters showed their emotions through action. However, there was nothing more in the film than continuous circumstances, sticking together, trying to survive, and fighting in a gut-wrenching battle.<br/><br/>I felt like the tedious display of non-stop gut-wrenching survival war violence just didn't stop. The film didn't switch gears or even try to offer anything different.<br/><br/>I was suppose to care about what happened to each character, but I only partially cared. When something happened to a character I'd say, ""Oh, you can't do that to Shia Labeouf or etc."" I wanted to know who the character was and that didn't happen. I wanted to understand each character. I wanted to get inside each of the characters heads. I wanted the characters to be drawn out more. I knew how the characters felt during their moments of despair but, I didn't understand each of them as an individual. I wanted to know the characters stories, motivations, and what made them tick besides Nazis and losing their brothers in battle. How can I really care when I don't really know who you are? Moments happened in the film but, moments happened fast. Moments zipped by with no real connection. I wanted to soak everything in and feel the moment. Give me some time with the moment and the character. I want to feel the pain and sorrow the character feels but, I only partially did. Some scenes where better than others but, not one scene in the film (to me) was really memorable or impactive.<br/><br/>Fury is a good movie. Fury is bloody, cruel, unmerciful, unsettling, and realistic. However, Fury is not emotional, depressing, eventful, or charterer driven.<br/><br/>Fury has context but it lacks substance.<br/><br/>Fury could have been so much more."

","It would have been nice if...<br/><br/>They had someone who actually had any inkling of tank battle tactics to do the choreography for those scenes. A Tiger tank would not simply sit in one place whilst another tank went behind it. It would either pivot in place to keep its superior forward glacis facing the enemy, or just back away from the approaching tank to acccomplish the same thing. Likewise, in open terrain, there was no need for the tanks in that particular battle to be as close as they were. In short, it was dumb.<br/><br/>It would also have been nice if they had someone who could just point out that the behaviour of the German SS in the final battle was just ludicrous. Oh look! There's an American tank at a crossroads. It looks like it is destroyed. Let's not send some scouts ahead to check, but just all bundle up to it as if we aren't in the middle of a frickin' war! And, once the ruse was uncovered, the SS all act like completely inept lemmings, throwing themselves repeatedly at the tank armed with ineffectual sidearms.<br/><br/>I suspect the point of the movie was to show that war is hell and good people can turn bad, but there was really nothing much likable about the tank crew at all. Most of them came across as loud-mouth, drunken jocks for the most part. In the end, their deaths meant little to me as a viewer and even the token act of kindness at the end had me rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>Some people have praised the ""realism"" of this movie, but honestly, there isn't much on display here.<br/><br/>But... you said you enjoyed it! Well, yes i said I somewhat enjoyed it. Putting aside the nonsense above, I enjoyed the acting on display. Even Brad Pitt wasn't as wooden as normal and I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBoeuf and Jon Bernthal, though the latter is getting typecast as an a-hole I think. The cast gave it their all, though Jason Isaacs was wasted in his token role.<br/><br/>Though I disliked the characters, the actors made me believe they were real enough. It is just a shame the plot wasn't up to the task of being as believable.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Some nice acting, but unlikable characters and woeful lack of common sense in the action scenes make this a bit of a chore to wade through. A nice idea, but needed a few more technical advisors, methinks."

There are a lot of battle scenes in the movie and all of them are done well especially the tank battle with the German tank Tiger ,it was intense and well shot ,the best scene in the movie in my opinion .

But Tere is too much of unnecessary fancy stuff in the movie . and tho there are really some rough and violent scenes you never feel the horror of the war .the movie succeed as an world war 2 action but fails on dramatic and emotional level and the reason for that are the storytelling and character development issues , you never feel connection with them .the movie was good but it could have been so much better that i was a little disappointed"

","Would've given the film a higher rating, but in one scene day turns into night instantly over two to three camera pans. It's not an effect, it's just really obvious and detaches you from the action.<br/><br/>Speaking of, the film is action-packed, although a little gung-ho America it all seems fairly realistic. Certain aspects, such as having green tracer fire for Germans and red for the Americans seemed a little...strange and for stupid people to understand who was firing at who, very star wars.<br/><br/>The acting is actually very good for the most part although the story let it down a little bit, with the fighters showing very little morality and overly dehumanizing the German forces who in reality were also just men on the march, not necessarily all chanting sadists who want to carve everyone up.<br/><br/>Interestingly for a film that mentions allied forces, we meet none of them, all the dialog is either German or American sources.<br/><br/>Despite these few pitfalls, the film is gloriously entertaining. All the characters have distinct enough personalities that you get their cohesion rather than a faceless shooting match between two sides. The insight into a veteran commander and his rookie assistant gunner/driver as well as the scarred remains of the tank crew make for enough of a story to break up the breathtaking and intense action. <br/><br/>Definitely worth a see at the cinema for its depth and special effects. Please be aware it is a glorified, Hollywood-esque picture, with gratuitous violence rather than realistic firefights, but that doesn't make it any less fun."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","6","8 November 2014"," Gritty, but lulls in places it need not go.
","It's been a long time since we've had a good World War II film that's in the middle of combat. It seems to have been topped by the twofer of Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line 15 years ago. The thing with war films is that no matter how intentional or not the approach is, it holds an inherent social commentary on the development of how violence and conflict between two countries is portrayed. It goes for western too, there's politics. If the film is smart, it'll do something with it. Fury doesn't seem to have anything to say. It doesn't have to, but it results in a film that doesn't have anything to take away from it. Perhaps on a deeper level there's something to study regarding it's theme of masculinity, given the all-male cast (save for an appearance from Anamaria Marinca) and the phallus symbolism of guns and tanks, but it's not coherent enough to take anything from it. Instead, it seems it has some small things to say about ends justifying means and religious morality, but it doesn't exactly resonate or feel fully developed. However, Fury is generally inoffensive.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that it lulls too often. We spend 24 hours with this unit on their journey and it suffers from constantly stopping and starting the story. It inches character development, but not enough to really chew on outside of archetypes. The performances are generally strong, especially from an underused Shia LaBeouf, with the highlight being Logan Lerman. I couldn't really enjoy Perks of a Wallflower but here he showed his chops, even if he isn't quite measured. Brad Pitt is always a good presence to have and he certainly anchors the movie in a comfortable place. Unfortunately it's just quite sloppy. It achieves a gritty and gory atmosphere of war by being utterly drenched in smoke, though evidently they had to borrow the lasers from Star Wars so we could see the bullets. It struggles to hold tension due to the liberties in logic it takes and not being able to invest in and follow the action. Its best chances are nominations are with the sound categories, but they're kind of a given in this genre. It is good to see a film that doesn't rush, which happens far too often these days with hyperactive editing, but Fury drags in places where it doesn't have to go.<br/><br/>6/10"
"shawneofthedead","7","1","6","27 October 2014"," As solid as a tank, though it rings hollow when it tries to go for bigger emotions.
","War is nasty business, and David Ayer has no intention of making it any less so in Fury, his bruising, dark and very violent World War Two drama. It's easy to be caught up in the fast, furious action of it: Ayer liberally peppers the film with explosions and gore. But that's not all there is to the film. While Ayer does lose track of it at a few points along the way, Fury, at its best, digs into some bitter and very hard truths about the sacrifice and loss - of blood, of life, of innocence - that must accompany a war, even one fought for a genuinely good cause.<br/><br/>The action and the narrative revolve around 'Fury', a five-man tank commandeered by Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt). He's promised the men who serve with him - Bible (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo (Michael Pena) and Grady (Jon Bernthal) - to get them through the war alive. When they complete a mission that took out the rest of the platoon of tanks, the men meet their new assistant driver: Norman (Logan Lerman), a sweet young man who trained as a clerk and is painfully ill-suited for the rigours and demands of battle. Nonetheless, they are forced to become a unit and, finally, a team, as Fury trundles across Germany to free trapped American soldiers, capture towns, and cut off a battalion of top-notch SS soldiers.<br/><br/>Fury can be roughly divided into three acts, the first of which is easily the best and most thought-provoking. Many war movies set during World War Two are infused with at least a hint of nostalgia and romance - it's what naturally accompanies the notion that the Allies are fighting to free the world from the uncomplicated evil of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>But Fury resolutely refuses to take that route. This is a film that stares the cold, hard nature of war in the face, and highlights the callous way in which it strips morality and innocence even from men who, as history tells us, are fighting on the right side. As the titular tank makes its way back to camp and out again, it becomes clear that the Allied soldiers are beaten and worn down by battle, their bodies and spirits caked in mud, blood and cynicism. The tanks roll over the corpses of the dead, pressing them - forgotten and lost - into the welcoming ground. It's a startlingly bleak picture to paint of the realities of the situation, one which highlights to an almost unbearable degree the monsters that are made in war: of men who have had to get used to killing nameless others as long as they're on the other side.<br/><br/>Less successful is the film's strange second act, set in a hollowed-out town 'freed' by the Americans. With Norman in tow, Don enters the apartment of an understandably edgy German woman, where the two find hot water, food and other bodily comforts. Shorn of the gory violence of the rest of the film, this segment feels strangely stagey: the characters are trapped in the oddest of situations, soldiers and civilians, enemies or friends, sat awkwardly around a dining table or in the bedroom. There are moments of almost heartbreaking insight: Don peeling off his shirt to reveal the wounds of battles past, or opening a box in which he's carefully stored precious items for a moment just like this one. But it also feels rushed and a bit silly, as Norman grows up off the battlefield and their fellow tank-mates turn up for some uncomfortably confrontational moments that should but don't quite pass for character development.<br/><br/>Ayer devotes the final act to a bloody, bitter battle, fought from within and around the tank in a bid to prevent SS soldiers from clashing with the Allied forces. It's a powerful climax, crammed full of incident and devastation, as each member of this ragged, raw team - a dysfunctional family, with Wardaddy as the patriarch - chooses whether to fight, and then must decide how they want to die. It manages to be rousing and repelling all at once, as bullets fly and grenades stir up mist and blood that paints itself across the tank. Indeed, Ayer makes it almost exhausting to watch, especially when the sequence goes on and on for just a little too long.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent. Pitt leads the charge with an electric performance, one that makes it possible to believe the hell Don has gone through to ensure his tank-mates can live. In a moment when he shrinks to the ground, tears shuddering out of him before he reins it all in again, you get a clear picture of the scars this man bears that can't be seen. Lerman again proves that he's a great actor outside of the Percy Jackson franchise, with a quite devastating array of shell-shocked reactions to the horrors Norman is forced to witness and commit. LaBeouf contributes unexpected gravitas in a tricky role but makes his character's constant reference to scripture something complex instead of potentially frustrating. Pena and Bernthal have less to do, but they both convince with the depth of their respective amiability and hostility towards Norman. In Bernthal's character, especially, it's possible to see that men who are not themselves strictly 'good' can fight for good causes too.<br/><br/>Is Fury one of the great war movies? Probably not. On occasion, it approaches magnificence in its depiction of the wear and tear of war - even for the eventual victors of the conflict. But, for every spine-chilling insight it provides into the monsters made of men in the heat of battle, the film also wanders off in odd directions - particularly in a middle section that feels deeply out of place and hugely rushed. That makes for rewarding, challenging but also frustrating viewing."
"neil-476","7","1","6","25 October 2014"," Brutal war drama
","Fury is a tank operated by Sgt Brad Pitt and his crew in Germany in the closing days of World War II, against increasingly desperate German forces. This film tells of events from the arrival of inexperienced replacement Norman (Logan Lerman) to a battle to hold back forces at a strategic crossroads.<br/><br/>If I had a criticism, it would be that there was no sense of an overriding narrative purpose to tie together the episodes which the Fury crew go through. In particular, there is a lengthy sequence in an apartment with two German girls which seems to have little to do with what comes before or after and, in showing strange and unpredictable behaviour from all the crew members, doesn't provide too much clarification on the effects of war on them, either. It is a good sequence, but it leaves you uncertain as to what it was intended to achieve.<br/><br/>But, for the most part, this is a very good film. It conveys the brutality and violence of war in the visceral Saving Private Ryan fashion, and you get a strong sense of what it must have been like to have been there. It is brilliantly staged, and the performances are mostly very good (although I thought Logan Lerman, despite having some very good moments, mostly had his face stuck in one unchanging expression)."

The truth is this was nothing more than every hillbillies dream movie. Guns, Nazi's, and Murica. Let's start at the beginning with the whole shooting the Nazi thing. If you're trying to make is look like the bad guys making kids shoot people, you succeeded. Then, we have a shootout, which looks like the precursor to star wars. And from there on out every gun shot or tank round is a laser gun. The one part of this movie that gave it hope was when they invade the girls house and they have some romance. But not a second later, the rest of the team comes up acting all rape-ish, and they both end up dead. Now at this point I am routing for the Nazi's, because they seem like saints compared to the US troops we've come to know. Finally we have the end. The track is destroyed by the only mine in the movie, and instead of leaving to warn the others, or just escaping with their lives, they decide they can take on over 100 troops with 5 people. Now we have the last few minutes where everyone except the kid is dead, and again we are shown how kind the Nazi's are to our troops, by them letting him live.

","This movie seems to spend about half the time inside their tank with about a whole lot of Germans trying to get in. As a lot of this greatest generation is gone, there is few very few proud people who could address realism in the story. Brad Pitt and the cast do make it feel like the real thing. As the relation to the real World War 2 fades out, it feels like this kind of stuff has been done before. If someone really wants to get some fresh material going, some good Eastern Front Drama might attract more audience. The accounts of the Russians taking every woman from 7 to 70 when they entered Berlins tells me that front has a lot of emotion not yet depicted in movies.<br/><br/>This is the western front towards the end there is material not covered but there are some excellent films already made about this.<br/><br/>There are always films of action films and this is made well enough to make that fan happy.

Time and time the little tank unit is tested and each time they are the bond between them grows and grows. The plot is quite intriguing however the execution was a miss. The gun fights look like they are straight out of Star Wars. Red and green lasers firing across the battlefield, I actually did a double take. I kept waiting for a Jedi to swoop in and take out some storm troopers. Predictability ran throughout the whole movie right down to the different type of men in the unit. The newbie, the bible thumper, the renegade, the minority, and of course the hard nose leader that stares death in the face and never gives up especially when the odds are overwhelming.

"larry.launders","7","1","7","7 June 2015"," I watched it for only one thing....
","I went to go see this movie because I'm a bit of a World War II nerd. <br/><br/>So my main focus was simply seeing the Tiger tank (a real one, and unless I'm mistaken it is the only remaining operational German Tiger in existence) in action. Truly frightening!<br/><br/>I did like that tank battle because it did display authentic tactics, and serves to remind us of a handful of things about armor engagements in that war. Two primary accurate things were: 1) Those tanks move slow, compared to today's versions. 2) At the least, allied tank units quickly developed a preferred operating procedure of needing at least 3 Sherman's to 1 Tiger (if not more) to overcome the Tiger. And they did it pretty much to code - get one Sherman behind the Tiger where it is weakest. <br/><br/>When you see the beginning of that engagement, the three Shermans are not widely dispersed. You see that as they get closer, they start to spread apart. But you also have to remember that over rough terrain, they're probably moving at the blistering speed of maybe 5 miles per hour. <br/><br/>I found that scene both frightening and exhilarating all at once. <br/><br/>So beyond that, I found I enjoyed most of the movie. The scene in the town (early on) and the interaction with War Daddy and the FNG (er, new guy) with the two female residents ran the gamut of ""this is a good scene"" (it was) with a heavy dose of ""why are the other crew members being such jerks"" (to put it mildly). <br/><br/>And the crew is justified on being hard on the new guy, given the story we're told. That crew, before losing their assistant driver, had been together quite awhile. Not only have they lost a brother in arms, but now they have a new guy that they don't know how well he may or may not do. And that is amplified by our new guy pulling a Dante (from Clerks) reminding them early and often that ""he wasn't supposed to be here"". <br/><br/>However, some of the harshness, nigh cruelty, just doesn't really do much for the story. Sure, there are points where they sort-of warm up to him, which to me only served to highlight their earlier useless behavior. <br/><br/>One note - Shia LaBouff's character (forgive me if I spelled his name wrong) was much better than I was expecting, given the articles I had read about him during it's making. I'm not much on 'method' actors, but his character was mostly more likable than I would have anticipated. <br/><br/>Overall, don't look for accuracy. I could go on about damage done by a grenade inside a tank being COMPLETELY overlooked for the sake of the movie (ahem, instead of people almost dead, at best you MIGHT have someone almost alive) but then this isn't a documentary or a training film - it's a movie. <br/><br/>You can enjoy this movie."
"kaustubh241997","7","1","7","20 February 2015"," Looses a bit of the furious steam
","Hollywood is abundant with war epics coming from skilled directors who put a classic edge to the genre , and creating a classic that would be memorable for years to come. Fury from start is an ambitious project , a movie directed ground up to visualize the clear and dense darkness in the lives of people during the war and worlds that collide in the gruesome battle for victory. <br/><br/>Now , when we talk about war movies one of the most prominent ones include Veteran Director Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket , which i feel is a brilliant war epic, does 2 things with perfection.<br/><br/>a) Give a gripping edge of the seat narrative b) And Build characters with a context and depth making you to root and care about them , even though they are a bit rude , and out of place with their characterization sometimes. <br/><br/>And what fury fails to do , is an error very significant , leaving a hole of void characterization. In this review I will breakdown and analyze the movie explaining the good and bad aspects of the movie and justifying my rating of 7.<br/><br/>1 ) Story :- David Ayer's previous projects such as fast and furious and end of watch , are good movies not known for its story , but it's character events and directional set pieces , with end of watch known for its different style of direction. It is surprising to see how David has evolved in his filmmaking career ,now venturing into a story , scripted , binding narrative driven experience. To be honest , Fury has the best story and a background atmosphere as compared to any of David's previous projects , and it is a good thing to see David Ayer working hard in favoring a strong storyline backbone , over shaky cams and out of context screenplay. The story of Fury revolves around a Sherman tank named Fury ,carried a hostile and deadly crew whose leader is Wardaddy, played excellently by Brad Pitt. Wardaddy commands his subordinates to take the tank and move into the enemy territory to destroy as many Nazi's as possible in the Eastern front. The story might look blunt on a first glance , but the rich narrative experience can grip you throughout the movie no questions asked. The story is beautifully crafted , but David is a good illusionist giving an existential presence of rich deeper flesh to a more on linear experience.<br/><br/>2 ) Casting and Performance :- Casting for this movie is spot on. With a wide array of characters in line starting from a man numb with battles Don Wardaddy played by Brad Pitt,Binkowski played by Jim Parrack , all of them resonate the essential elements of expressions and emotions of men tired with endless grinding battles. Michael Pena rides along David Ayer once again since end of watch doing his character justice to both the source material and the character itself. The standout cast member for me is Shia LaBeouf.Shia in the movie gives a stellar performance overthrowing even Brad Pitts acting throughout the runtime. Shia pin this movie plays the role of Bible Swan , with emotions throughout the spectrum exhibited by him. Shia easily shadows all of his previous mediocre performances from the transformers or even the unsuccessful Indiana Jones movie. One thing to be said , is that if Shia continues to give performances like this , then he would surely be an actor to be looked forward to for his future presentations. One of the biggest flaws in this movie though is the execution of chemistry between the characters. The ideal character model for each character keeps alternating and fluctuating , thus not giving you time to analyze and root for a person when the movie forces you to feel sad for something. Also there are many scenes in the movie that contradicts the moral code for these people on screen , but the characters never regret their decision. These minor hiccups bring the well narrated movie on a speed breaker as towards the end of the movie you would be puzzled to understand and create a character sketch of any living soul who was present on screen.<br/><br/>3 ) Direction:- David Ayer knows exactly how to take an intense scene and grind his cast to give a magnificent outburst to flesh out a gripping and ' edge of the seat ' experience. The movie can be divided into parts.<br/><br/>a) Character development structures b) The actual war scenarios <br/><br/>What David Ayer does effortlessly is the brilliantly choreographed action sequence. There are parts in the movie where I actually felt I was in the tank in the middle of the war , and a feeling of Claustrophobic environment easily steps in for any person viewing this film. The camera is used with a neat steady cam motion capturing every aspect of a dark gory battle , making this war epic virtually gritty and standing true and perfect to its cinematic ' R 'rating. What David fails to do is fail to make the characters grow on us. Throughout the entire movie,I did not bother to care about any of the characters as much as the director wanted me to. There were intense scenes in this movie where i had no reason or incentive to care about the safety of the characters lives. Each character with their dynamic personalities don't exactly shake well with the narrative of the story thereby acting as a bump in this smooth war drama.<br/><br/>On a whole , Fury is a well directed,well narrated well casted,characterized mess that is a good drama war movie that is way too ambitious for its current state. It might not be referred to or called a war epic , but David Ayer has done a perfect job is visualizing world war 2."
"bloodclay","5","1","7","7 December 2014"," Not Original in Any Way
","I'm not sure what to say when it comes to David Ayer's latest film ""Fury"". It's a movie that rides a fine line between mediocre and good. There were moments when I realized how great this film could have been, but those split-seconds were sparse. It's not as if it's particularly unpleasant, It's just not anything new, and none of the characters stuck out to me.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty commonplace, set in the heart of World War Two. We follow Brad Pitt's character, a battered sergeant nick-named 'Wardaddy', who has his hands full commanding his five-man crew in their cramped tank. Dealing with the harsh realities of war and a new man aboard, a young soldier who hasn't been properly trained, they're forced to fight outnumbered and out-gunned.<br/><br/>The movie is exactly what you might expect and that's probably why I didn't enjoy it. I was able to predict every move, all the way down to each character's arc, and it wasn't an original experience in any way. It felt as if they went down the list of every great war film collecting each trope they could and threw them in as needed.<br/><br/>The most redeeming aspect is the cinematography (which I found to be Oscar-worthy) but the other aspects can't match its greatness. The acting is fine, with Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf bringing the most to the table, but as a whole it's pretty substandard. If you're a fan of the genre you'll probably like this, but I'd recommend skipping it and revisiting classics like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Patton""."
"tomhg38","Null","1","7","2 December 2014"," Just saw the film, what a let down.
","I was with the film in the beginning.<br/><br/>There were some unoriginal characters, the war crazed veterans and the experience guy who is replaced with the young idealistic fresh new recruit, a pretty common tactic used to give the audience a window into the situation and make something so foreign to the average Joe relatable, the rest of the crew was equally derivative, the ""token"" ethnic guy, the crazy out of control cruel guy who ultimately has your back, the scarred and hardened leader who still maintains a kernel of humanity that he hides from his subordinates etc.<br/><br/>But I was with it. The tanks looked great, the tracer fire, while reminding me of some 70's Star Wars gunfire, was great, I enjoyed how the story progressed with the girl and the action scenes, everything was not particularly unique but really well told.<br/><br/>Then the finale hit. An insurmountable number of enemies descends on the good guys, who choose to fight in a crippled state for some idealistic reasons rather than simply walk away and live to fight another day. I was immediately put in the mind of the movie ""300"", but I'm sure there are almost countless instances of this ridiculous story premise.<br/><br/>When earlier we had seen action in the film, it was tense and realistic. Ambushing enemies hitting tanks in their convey with anti tank weaponry and burning soldiers pouring out of the hatches, dead. Even in relatively equal numbers and strengths, except for the tank with the main characters, pretty much everyone was dying as freely on the allies side as on the Germans, to the point where only the main characters were left.<br/><br/>It ruined the entire film for me. We saw that there were no guns facing to the sides of the tank, the guns mounted in the front having a 90 degree range of motion, but the Germans just run back and forth in front of the tanks machine guns being slaughtered for minutes on end. <br/><br/>They took the time to hide grenades (or land mines?) in anticipation of the enemy force coming, but left a significant portion of their ammo outside the tank? We literally see Germans running side on to the tank, with a clear shot at Brad Pitt's character, when the tank has absolutely NO way of firing upon them at that angle, but the Germans just run past (where to? Nobody knows).<br/><br/>They FINALLY, after hundreds of their force have been shredded by the immobilised tank housing 5 soldiers, pull out some anti tank weaponry, rocket launchers, and fire it from the tanks unprotected flanks meters away, and yet two of the three rockets STILL SOMEHOW MISS. I don't even understand how its possible to hit an immobilised vehicle the size of a small house from a few meters away.<br/><br/>I wish I could go back and tell myself to stop watching the movie before that fight started, I would consider it a very strong movie and likely one of the best things I'll watch for the year. Instead I am left with a sour taste in my mouth, as a film I was thoroughly enjoying shot itself in the foot."

"The-Sarkologist","9","1","7","1 November 2014"," War turns men into animals
","This is a movie about a tank: okay, it is about the tank crew, but the closing shot to this film told that the story is about the tank and its journey through the final stages of World War II. To be blunt, this is not a pretty film, but then war is never meant to be pretty. While World War II in many cases was a modern war, it is not as clean and surgical as wars are portrayed these days with sophisticated fighting machines that you can plug your iPhone into so you can listen to music while rumbling across the desert. This was a dirty war where people fought using dirty tactics, especially at the end.<br/><br/>We all know the story about the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, and we all hear about the glorious battles that resulted in the Allies achieving victory, however we need to be reminded, time and again, what it was like to be a soldier in this war, especially in the closing stages. The Nazi's were not going to go down easily, and the closer the Allies got to Germany, the more vicious the Nazi's became. They even began recruiting children to fight for them, many of these children having grown up knowing no other government than Hitler's.<br/><br/>Mud plays an important part in this film as everywhere you look there is mud. Okay, there is the scene in the middle where they 'liberate' a town as spend some downtime in relative luxury, however that quickly comes to an end when they are ordered out to continue to fight, and just in time too, as becomes evident a little later on (though I won't necessarily say anything more than that).<br/><br/>The film is also a coming of age film, with the character of Nelson joining the fight at the end and coming to understand what war is really about. This was still the time when people saw fighting against the Nazi's as fighting the good fight, but it wasn't until their boots were on the ground that they realised the reality of the horror that war truly is. However we see Nelson thrown in with the battle hardened warriors who have been fighting since Africa and have fought battles all the way through Europe. We see this contrast especially at the beginning with Nelson's clean white face standing out against the dirty grime covered faces of the veterans.<br/><br/>War changes Nelson, and he goes from being an innocent boy entering war for the first time, afraid of killing a defenceless person because 'it is just not right' to killing any person that vaguely looks like the enemy. While we see this change in Nelson, I still could not get past the fact that the veterans who have been fighting this war for years at this time know only one thing and that is how to fight and to kill. The question that this raises is whether it is possible for these veterans to be able to return to a life of peace?"

","I finally went to see the much anticipated ""Fury"" . I had high hopes because I'm a war history fiend and love David Ayer films so when I saw the trailers this past spring I couldn't wait to see it (much like gone girl"") and it didn't disappoint on either fronts. It was very well made and a different spin on WW2 tank battles towards the end of the war when Hitler just threw his citizens into the line of fire in one last maniacal effort to win a losing war. It was untouched ground in that sense which was very good . It wasn't the best WW2 films but it's in a discussion somewhere I think many other enthusiasts would say ?? Also the soundtrack was perfect for the dark and at times gloomy film. It went perfect with the atmosphere which was at times very tense and dramatic. Well worth the wait for me to see this and would recommend to anybody but especially WW2 buffs. 9/10 . Enjoy the tank battles there are many good ones and fighting in general but careful if your squeamish because it can get rough at times but in all not to bad in ""war gore"" department.. Go see this film. You won't regret it!!!"
"RforFilm","6","1","7","21 October 2014"," Ravaged? Yes. Bloody? Yes. Different? Fury Recycles Old Messages About War but Delivers High Action
","Passing down the street, I see all sorts of people, young and old. They present themselves as how they want the rest of the world wants to see them. For guys like me that enjoy walking, I often pass by folks with caps that say they were veterans of some sort. They don't seem to be asking for a lot of attention, but they want people to know that they worked hard to protect us from villains. They took the risk that could have gotten them killed, but had managed to put out enough to take themselves home. They may have been able to return to a normal society, but some of them may not come back with solid minds.<br/><br/>I have only seen people killed in the movies and television, and I don't have the stomach to look up death footage, but from what I hear, the real deal is nothing like the Stallone that can gun down a bunch of bad guys and return home with a smile. The armed folk that have seen how severe and bloody a war can become only see the world for what it can be; a savage place where only the strongest survive. The sick minds that fill the ranks in Fury will make you question just how damaged a veterans mind could be.<br/><br/>Our crew is in the last months of World War II as Army sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (played by Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank called ""Fury"", working to make the final push into Nazi Germany. It's crew consists of Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (played by Shia LeBeouf), Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (played by Jon Bernthal) and Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (played by Michael Peña). During the opening segment where an assistant driver is lost in an attack, an enlisted typist, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is unfortunately transferred to fill the vacant spot.<br/><br/>What Ellison finds is a crew that would rather have their old driver back then someone who has never even killed a Nazi. During a gut-wrenching scene, the poor boy gets his bitter taste of blood when Wardaddy forces the trigger of his gun upon a German who may have been innocent. Ironically, Wardaddy is the only one who seems to be keen on making Ellison a full- fledged tank driver, by giving him the privilege of joining him for food in a captured town. The stakes are put to test when the tank becomes immobilized after driving on a land mind and has be ready to aim and fire upon hundreds of incoming Nazis.<br/><br/>Fury places itself in the ideology of something like The Dirty Dozen where a group of solders are pitted against absurdly huge forces. But it comes off more like The Expendables where the action becomes so over the top that it nearly becomes senseless. I can tell that the movie was trying to mix in the bloody (and I mean really bloody!) along with the message that war can damage to the human mind and it nearly works. <br/><br/>The effect of war on people in film has been done several times before, so what Fury does have to offer are some good performances. Brad Pitt plays the total opposite of his Inglorious Bastards character, becoming someone who has become so scared by the war that he is more machine then human. Logan Lerman is really evolving into the serious adult actor that he wants to be, as he displays the only traces of humanity left in an Evil Germany. The best part of the movie is the final act of the stuck tank and it's last stand, but you need to get through the roughest trenches of gore and slow pacing that could turn away some folk. Fury is an interesting case of being too gory for an award audience and possibly to highbrow for a mainstream crowd. I'm sure there's a middle ground that going to enjoy this more then I did.<br/><br/>I'll give this six-damaged tanks out of five. It's best to know that Fury is not fun action movie, but an action movie at least. If that's enough to persuade you, this is probably for you. Maybe the next round of World War II ammo can fuel me better."
"moviescoundrel","8","1","7","20 October 2014"," Fury-iously Good
","Fury comes out as a pretty believable military film. Set at the end of WW2, one crew has been together for a majority of the war and we see how they interact, their bonds, their angst, their struggles, and their humanity. Intermingled with those things are quite a few tank battle scenes, which although may not be perfectly believable, they are pretty entertaining for the most part. A rookie soldier is assigned to the Fury after the crew gets back from their latest mission where they lose a soldier. The rookie not only is new to the war, but does not have combat or tank experience, and has no intention of following some of his soldier's orders or doing what it takes. As the drama unfolds, the sergeant's, the rookies, and the rest of the crews humanity and and character development are evident. The depictions of what they soldiers have been through together and have endured are evident in their conversation and on their faces. Although not necessarily and uplifting journey, this is one that is worth taking and checking out."
"jackhoyle1985","4","1","8","23 January 2015"," David Ayer, lazily unoriginal...
","This was a film that on paper genuinely excited me as a fan of war films for their port rial of humanity in adverse circumstances. Then I watched Fury...<br/><br/>Obviously off the back of the heels of Brad Pitts great success a few years back with Inglorious Bastards, David Ayer clearly thought Brad Pitt excelled in this role so snapped him up for his war film. There was the first act of laziness essentially the man from this point forward has signed up to attempting to make a film about ""coming of age"" during World War 2 centered around Logan Lermans' character to throw us off the scent of any ""Ingloriousisms"".<br/><br/>I therefore did not attempt to watch this film in the same way David Ayer did not attempt to write this film. The cast were impeccable but when the man at the helm clearly just writes a film every few years to remain in Hollywood what can you do to save that?"

","I've been obsessed with War Movies and War journalism since I was a kid. My grandpa was a Colonel in the U.S. Army. He went in with Patton during D Day and fought in the Rhineland campaign. I couldn't wait for Fury to come out on DVD. Man was this movie a serious disappointment. Goes back to the quote, something like you can make a crappy movie with a great script, but you can't make a great movie with a crappy script. The acting and crafting of the film was okay, but the script was terrible. The opening was a bad version of The Big Red One and the rest was ripped off from every other war movie I've ever seen. The only thing interesting about it was the actual tank battle and tactics used to take out German positions. That was one of the worst World War 2 movies that I've seen and I've seen them all."

","Gritty, raw and unrelenting... Thank you Brad Pitt and Kudos to the cast for outstanding work! Fury is a totally visceral experience which holds nothing back... In fact, I'm pretty sure I could smell the stink on these guys! Don't expect a feel good time with this movie, but, as a tank enthusiast, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail (yep that is a real Tiger from the Bovington Tank Museum in England) although there are some hogwash Hollywood moments... such as a German 88 not penetrating Sherman armor! Overall, I left the theater haunted and somewhat bewildered by the whole experience, but also greatly appreciative to those who sacrificed so much for our freedom. It may not be a true story BUT it told the story of American armor in Europe during WWII all too well & I, for one, was very glad to see it told!"
"FilmMuscle","7","1","8","19 October 2014"," War Has Never Looked This Uneasy and Horrific!
","In David Ayer's Fury, you will not find the Malick-like romanticism of war or vague, beautifully symbolic shots of war's ravage. No, Fury seeks to paint as ugly of a literal portrait of war as possible with this latest WW2 film. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov's remorseless navigation through innumerable mutilated, flattened corpses and exploding heads, as well as the total distressing destruction on display, makes the viewer feel all kinds of unpleasantness, especially in view of the purely morose and gritty color palette. Steven Price's effectively mournful score never ceases its emotional impact as viewers squirm and helplessly witness never-ending death and repugnant human behavior. <br/><br/>After narrowly surviving a vicious battle against the superior German tanks and being left out to dry among countless American dead bodies, weary and downcast Don Collier (Brad Pitt) and his brutish crew are handed a young, inexperienced, and sensitive kid, Norman (Logan Lerman), who's just another one of the draft's victims—required to quickly transition from a relatively calming desk job to a mercilessly exhaustive position on the battlefield that forcefully strips all of your morals away. ""I can't do it!"" Norman finally yells after being slapped around and taunted in the face of having to shoot a Nazi, otherwise a father with two kids and a loving wife. The amount of horrific, gory sights and the expectation to kill and kill some more is even greater than unbearable for this innocent man as he vomits and weeps, knowing full well he's a changing man. He will never return to the normal, comforting world he thought he knew. <br/><br/>Paralleling the fierce war the story guides us through, we see Norman's gradual desensitization at the hands of unforgiving crew members: a pensive, pious man of God (Shia LaBeouf); the obnoxious, hostile big guy (Jon Bernthal); and the humorous one who goes on tirades in Spanish every now and then (Michael Peña). A soldier's virtue here is to act solely as a killing machine and end the day with the duty accomplished; tear through the meat and only leave the Germans' bones to rot behind. The violence we see on-screen is brutally realistic and disheartening in its portrayal—sometimes less theatrical than expected and sometimes just incredibly graphic. Whether it's a body crushed under tank treads or a man's left leg blown right off by a machine gun, the audience is in for an excruciatingly difficult glimpse into grueling and revengeful warfare. David Ayer brings his unvarnished style to the war genre; after exhibiting the raw ferocity of police work, his next focus is on an even more perilous task with a larger scope: combat itself—the largest war of all time. <br/><br/>The aspect I was most torn on though was Logan Lerman's whole character arc. The runtime of this picture wasn't nearly adequate enough to convincingly show a fulfilling evolution of his character, ending up more rushed and artificial than anything. It takes a matter of scenes for him to suddenly foul his mouth and dramatically increase that pulse for ruthless killing. It's like that good kid in school who makes friends with and starts hanging around the naughty ones as he quickly (superficially) starts acting like he's one of them even though everyone around can tell the personality doesn't quite suit the kid yet. I wouldn't go so far as to blame Lerman's performance itself, but more so place that blame on the way his character was written and utilized. The first half of the plot features a heartbreaking, gut- wrenching look at his jarring introduction to combat, providing most of the compelling thematic material of the movie. That angle is unfortunately abandoned about an hour into the movie. <br/><br/>All in all, the film carries neither the thematic complexity nor the narrative memorability some of the best war movies benefit from. The story is also not daring enough to depict the familial/civilian atrocities that transpired during the time as well—the abuse—as none of the American soldiers seem to cross the moral boundary to deranged extremes. The characters have hints of moral grayness to them but not enough to detract from its apparent glorification of the ""Oorah!"" comradeship that forms under war, and this is where the film's agenda becomes somewhat mixed. Is it blatantly anti-war or more sentimental and simply patriotic in its messages like Lone Survivor or Saving Private Ryan? With that being said, Fury still manages to remain compelling and technically impressive throughout. We get several tense tank showdowns, entertaining character interactions between these loud personalities, and a real poignant climax."
"andrew_rigsby","9","1","8","19 October 2014"," ""It will end, but a lot of good men have to die first""
","Fury is a movie of epic proportions. War movies are hard to take beyond the point of another shoot em up bang em up plot. Adding depth and emotion to a movie takes brilliant casting, direction, and plot; all of which Fury has. Although I am a HUGE Brad Pitt fan, he is not the only reason I liked this movie. Yes, he has a way of bringing the viewer in and making them feel apart of something but he was not the actor who spoke to me the most. Logan Lerman (yes the kid from Percy Jackson) did a bang up job of making this movie great. He has a fantastically written character and portrays his struggle in a very real way. I could relate with him and I could relate with the man he became as well, fantastic portrayal of a WWII soldier. Honorable mention goes out to Shia LeBeouf. Yes he is a method style actor and his character has the most emotion and grasp throughout the movie. Side note: the cuts on his face were real cuts he made himself, prime example of method acting. <br/><br/>There was nothing I didn't like. Some people I talked to said that it was slow in the middle but I would have to entirely disagree. The climax the movie and stage it for an epic ending. The middle adds depth and meaning to the tragedy to follow. Without the emphasis on life and personal gratification amongst soldiers during that time, the ending would not have meant so much. <br/><br/>One Liner: If you want something that clinches you in the gut, shows you the rawness of war, and reveals the realities of war and emotion and victory; watch this movie."
"jokersonyou","8","1","8","18 October 2014"," What a Fury
","Think of great war movies and you think of movies that focus on a mission. Das Boot, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and so on.<br/><br/>Fury tells the story of from the perspective of a tank crew. They've been through this before, through Africa, and France and now Germany. They are worn down, and firmly entrenched in the warfare. Then along comes Norman, a new recruit weeks out of camp.<br/><br/>The film starts with a bang, meanders through some character development and settles into one of these battles. The thing with Fury is that, it seems to lose some of that momentum when the characters come across some German women. I understand the need to slow the pace, but the claustrophobia lost some of its impact.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf stands out. His best performance to date. Wonderfully acted, and solid entertainment."

The film deals with the character of Norman played wonderfully by Logan lerman who does a good job showing lots do emotional range as his character who is young and was a typist was drafted into the war and shows the characters fear of being forced to kill. German for the first time, his commending officer dom played by brad Pitt shows norms that war is ugly and that sometimes you are forced in a game of survival in which it is kill or be killed.

It was action packed movie about a tank squad fighting in Nazi Germany fighting there way through towns and boy did it kept me on the edge of my seat all the way till the credits. The movie was straight forward and to the point, it was about killing Nazis with a great back story. This movie is for those who those who would like to know how it was in a battlefield where you feel compassion, fear, devotion, and fury. It is by far the best war movie I have ever seen.

","The storyline is very similar to Saving Private Ryan. With different location and different tools of war but overall, the conflicts and plot to be fairly similar. The difference however is the poor acting. Brad Pitt is one of the actor who never changes... I mean in a bad way. Isn't it about time his acting gets better? But no... he's same as he was in Legends of the Fall. It's not horrible, it's passable. But his role in this movie is so interesting that it could've been a great role if played by someone else more capable.<br/><br/>Other actors didn't live up to their names either. Shia Labeouf started out well but looked like he was over the top. Still don't understand why he cried during the meal conversation. Logan Lerman is touted to be the next big Hollywood star but not based on his performance here. Towards the end he said he's afraid but I certainly didn't feel the fear in his voice or face.<br/><br/>How can so many great actors perform so ordinary? I would put the blame on the director. Well known for gang/crime movies as it's something he's familiar with but this movie proves that he can't handle genre he's unfamiliar with."

If you like WW2 movies-and I like good ones-it has all the elements needed, including a tough leader, Brad, taking his men into battle against those dirty old Nazis in April of 1945 in Germany, during the last few weeks of WW2. Brad is in charge of a Sherman tank called Fury-it's painted on the barrel of the tank-and everyone has appropriate, descriptive nicknames. Brad is Wardaddy, and his squad includes Shia_Bible, Michael_Gordo and Jon_Coon-Ass. After loosing a fifth man in a heated battle-they were the only survivors to hobble back to base-Logan joins the team. The only problem is that Logan has only been enlisted in the Army for about 8 weeks and he was a clerk. It doesn't take long for Logan to discover the true meaning of the old saying, War is Hell. The battles are really brutal, in a Saving Private Ryan way. In the opening scene, Brad takes out a German soldier on a horse that brought several squeals from the audience in my theater-Brad does not use a gun. There is a 4 on 1 tank battle-4 Shermans against 1 Tiger-that is pretty engaging. But, if you have a weak stomach, you may not enjoy this one; one of Logan's first duties is to take a bucket of water and clean his seat in the tank-where his fallen predecessor once sat-and not only is there blood everywhere but even chunks of flesh and body organs. I saw a few of the actors on talk shows saying how they were encouraged by the director to get into actual fist fights with each other before filming a scene. He said it would help the actors bond with each other. It seems to have worked. The movie ends ala Alamo style with Brad's Dirty Five taking on about 200 German soldiers in a spectacular and bloody battle. It's rated ""R"" for violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

We see his struggle to cope with the morals of war, and how it affects him physically and mentally. The chemistry among the cast was great, and they did very well to show that regardless of race, religion, and ethnic background, friendships are forged in the flames of war. Logan Lerman depicts a new, innocent recruit, new to war. His character profoundly changes over the course of the movie as war slowly eats away at his innocence, and he begins to realize that war is a gray area morally. Overall, this film was less about war, and more about developing relationships, and how each one of the members were brothers, willing to give their lives for each other."

","There's nothing in this film that you haven't seen in another thousand war movies before. What is perfectly clear is that David Ayer is a hack writer. The story doesn't matter, nor do the characters. The dialogue is laughable. I challenged myself if I could guess the next line, and that was no problem at all. This script is filled to the brim with clichés.<br/><br/>If one is to believe the stories about the production of this film, Ayer put his actors through hell, egging them on to be macho a-holes against one another. For someone who used to work in this field I can tell you that it only results in a miserable shoot, not a more authentic product. They're actors, trust them to do their job. Or perhaps Ayer is simply too much of a failure as a director to be able to coax a good performance out of his actors without treating them like dirt.<br/><br/>The level of testosterone in this movie is ridiculous. Everyone in the cast is so desperately trying to out-macho one another, Jon Bernthal is painful to watch. Michael Peña is playing the same character that he does in every movie, Michael Peña. He might be the nicest guy in Hollywood, but he keep getting gigs as an actor is beyond me. A pitcher with late stage Lou Gehrig's disease has more range. I have apparently seen some of Logan Lerman's work as a child actor, but it made zero impression on me. Which describes my impression of him in this movie. And Brad Pitt's greatest contribution is inspiring the haircuts of a million Chads.<br/><br/>Also, everyone who knows the least bit about World War 2 knows that the ones who mostly bore the brunt against the Nazi forces were the soldiers of the Soviet Union. Any chance Hollywood will make some movies about them?"

","Up to the end scene, I would be inclined to give this movie a 9. Beautiful scenes, decent global story, good music, but most importantly - a captivating brotherhood of people that have each other's life in their hands. I loved to see how the circumstances push people to become very different - annoying, loud, brutal, primitive... But that's the outer shell - inside, the brotherly bond is always there.<br/><br/>However, then comes the ending... Up until here the fighting was already quite Hollywood-esque - the protagonists are always the winners and everybody depends only on them. But then at this end, where all normal people would have run, our heroes decide to stay in a suicide position ""because we are told so"".<br/><br/>Very surprisingly, the enemy is retreating for 5 minutes long, and luckily, our 5 heroes can already kill 100 enemies. Also luckily, the enemy forgets that they have anti-tank grenades or that there is a possibility to wait for backup since our heroes are trapped, and sacrifices 100 more units to the stranded but invincible Sherman tank. And who would have guessed, when they find their anti-tank grenades, they cannot succeed again.<br/><br/>What's the next step to keep the suspense? That's the unfortunate loss of our heroes. But again, we movie-goers are lucky, because our heroes do lose the battle easily - they die one by one. Even the boss dies! But of course, not easily - because Germans are only allowed to shoot from the front and only one person at a time. Oh, and with large calibre bullets that are actually not lethal. I am so glad that we had such people, I'm sure we've won the war because of a few dozen of such Americans.<br/><br/>Anyway, in short: the story of the battles, especially the last one, is laughable. But the friendship that is portrayed throughout the movie is brilliant!"

","I saw this in theatres and it was quite a visceral experience on the big screen when the tanks do battle. Great script, awesome action and fantastic drama about the horrors of war as we watch a young man transform from an inexperienced soldier who'd rather be killed than kill to a vengeful machine gun shooter. The action scenes are really well done and worth the price of admission. Highly recommended for WWII enthusiasts."

","The whole movie was really brilliant. True face of war was shown to us, there is mug, death and blood everywhere, troops are frustrated and shocked.
But the ending... It seemed stupid even for a person who is not a military expert. Why did the tank crew allow Nazi to surround it? Why didn't they shoot them using heavy weapon while they were marching?
Overall, this movie is one of the best WWII movies, I'm just disappointed about the ending"

","I've just finished watching Fury for the second time, and yes it was better than the first, very much so, I watch films purely for enjoyment I'm no armchair critic any reviews I do are just my own somewhat myopic opinion.
So a war film, I find it somewhat surprising that war films seem to be harder to make than war itself, good war films anyway and this is a damn good one, I was surprised to see this was a work of fiction it was very well put together and as authentic looking as modern morality will allow, so watch Fury and then watch it again because though the producers state it's fiction I would bet a good limb that that actions like this happened many times during WW2, it's just they didn't really rate a mention, and while I find that a little sad don't let it detract from a very good film."

The acting was superb and their feeling hit you hard, so when they cry - you cry.<br/><br/>The sound design from Fury is some of the best sound design Ive ever heard in a war movie. It was overwhelming and so amazing without be a distraction and hard to distinguish what from what. Whenever a shell hit a Tiger or anti-tank gunner you felt it, and it gave chills.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the movies where you NEED to have surround sound and subwoofers to watch it.

","An unrelentingly grim portrayal of the horror and brutality of war as seen through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. War and the wholesale slaughter of human life is horrible, and this film successfully portrays that, mostly without glorification, and with unflinching attention to detail of the physical horror. The filth, gore, violence and death of war is shown in graphic details. A great deal of effort went into showing the authentic armour, weaponry and paraphernalia of the period, which combined with the detailed locations, filthy ruined environments and human desolation, paint a realistic picture. Many of the battle scenes feel realistic, with a few exceptions, notably the finale battle which is a borderline ridiculous turkey shoot and lets the film down very badly. The characters and acting are first class, really exceptional, but be warned these are not heroic figures you can feel good about. Be ready for harrowing camaraderie, broken bodies and broken minds. Deserving of praise for its integrity to its purpose, which I think is solely a portrayal of the horror of war."

"RBRNS","7","0","1","28 April 2019"," Could've been the new Saving Private Ryan, but missed the mark
","I can't remember the last time I was this excited for a war movie. A movie about a tank crew in World War II?! It sounded amazing from the start. Although I must admit I was a little bit disappointed when I heard who they casted for the roles. After Inglourious Basterds I found it hard to take Brad Pitt seriously as a tank commander and Jon Bernthal was still fresh in my memory as Shane from TWD.<br/><br/>But nevertheless this couldn't stop my excitement. This was, as far as I know, the only movie about a WWII tank crew made in the 21st century. THIS could be the next Saving Private Ryan. But it didn't live up to my personal hype for numerous reasons.<br/><br/>The acting itself was mostly good, but specifically two events ruined the movie for me and that's why I only gave it a 7.<br/><br/>1) The Tiger vs Sherman tanks. Let's imagine you are a German tank driver. You have perfect cover and can easily pick off the Sherman tanks one by one. What do you do? Obviously leave the cover and charge at multiple tanks coming at you. Mistake number one. Secondly why do these Sherman tanks don't have infantry covering their every move.<br/><br/>It's very hard to observe your surroundings from a tank and it's not that the Allied forces lacked manpower in this movie. Thirdly Fury was equipped with a canon that could easily destroy the German tank. There was no need to circle around it to hit the rear.<br/><br/>2) I've had the honour to meet veterans from WWII, Germans, Americans and British. And all these veterans had one thing in common: they just wanted to make it back home alive.It makes the final battle in Fury harder to understand.<br/><br/>It's April 1945. All the other tanks that accompanied Fury on their mission to defend a crossroad were destroyed. Fury(the tank) hits a mine on a road near the barn and can't move anymore. Making it an easy target. Norman(a member of the tankcrew) is on a reconnaissance mission. In the distance he sees 200 to 300 SS soldiers with Panzerfausts and other weapons. At this point the movie goes full Hollywood and in a bad way. It makes sense to retreat and regroup with other Americans to fight this enemy. But NO, let's stay in this disabled tank thus an easy target and try to fight off 200 to 300 German soldiers although the war is almost over.<br/><br/>It's realistic that they could surprise the first soldiers, because they made it look like the tankcrew was killed. But after that it's one big joke. Stormtroopers would be embarrassed. It's almost like the elite of the German army forgot everything they were taught. The SS soldiers didn't know how to aim, shoot and flank a disabled tank. It was a joke.<br/><br/>Obviously everyone, except Norman, dies in this ridiculous suicide mission. I still get angry about how they ruined the ending of this movie."
"ironcraftleague","10","0","3","25 February 2019"," A fantastic war movie.
","This was a gorey, gritty, and one seriously messed up film. That makes the film so great however, giving us a crystal clear mirror into the life inside a tank. The characters all have distinguishable personalities. One is the guy who is scared and doesn't want to kill people. One is the guy that's the leader and has been through a lot, the list goes on, and that's just to name a few. The tough scenes were hard to watch due to the subject matter relating to war. Such as the death of a loved one, comradery, even pstd briefly, and even simply getting adjusted to life in a tank. Much appreciation by the war for using real tanks used in World War II, it added to the realism the movie was going for. The ending to be put into one word, awesome. It was filled with guns blazing action and I enjoyed every second of it. This was a great war movie, 10/10."

","9 February 2015. Fury has nice pacing, engaging, and a balanced action drama of the tank warfare of World War II. This movie excels in its presentation of war that is both shocking as it is penetrating in its intensity and different perspective of military shells. There is a surprising, almost a futuristic laser blasters visual in the action scenes.<br/><br/>This what is an essentially coming of age movie for one young new recruit at the end of the war exposing him to the horrors and delicate negotiation between war's insanity and human propriety. Fury, though doesn't quite have the intricate touch of comedic subtlety and cultural imbalance of Tropic Thunder (2008), nor the epic presentation of Saving Private Ryan (1998), the intimacy and continuous singular battle event focus and intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001) or We Were Soldiers (2002), the comprehensive nature of a predominate war struggle of survival of The Great Escape (1963), the darkness and totality insanity of Apocalypse Now (1979), or the raw, authenticity of Jarhead (2005)."

Counting on the presence of celebrities such as Brad Pitt, Jon Bernthal, Logan Lerman, Shia Labeouf and Michael PeÃ±a, Fury is a fast-moving, action-packed and gripping film that will show you the real meaning of soldier camaraderie."
"joker-scar","10","0","3","9 September 2018"," For those who feast on comic-book violence, a much welcome wake-up call
","I gave this film a 10 not because it is a great and satisfying narrative film that one would watch over and over but for what it accomplishes. This film is not plot driven, it doesn't need to be as it accomplishes all it set out to do. No punches are pulled in this one. This is an intense character study of mankind's brutality against his own. This is ""probably"" why this film got poor reviews because it doesn't have a plot and the standard Hollywood satisfying ending. It is gut wrenchingly truthful and most people don't want to watch films like this, reminding us how shit the world and humans are. But humans have short memories and they need to be reminded of history. This kind of film is very hard to do, many others have attempted this theme, some succeed but many fall short, not to a lack of trying. To sustain an audiences attention while hammering home its theme is a careful walk along a razors edge. Too much one way or the other and the viewer will tune out. Very few of this generation will have the patience to watch older films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, PATHES OF GLORY or other such B&W classics, but hopefully they will watch this film because of Brad or the war aspect. Whatever drives them to watch this film is a means to an end. Super hero and cartoon violence has its place and are escapist for sure, but too much of that will convince growing minds that that is what war and violence is, this film is a rude awakening to that juvenile thought process. Fury is one of those films that should be shown in schools, watching a film like this and similar films based on real-life drama, is worth more than reading a hundred books on the subject. History is not dead, it should be re-booted as often as possible to remind the younger generation that the world they live in has not always been this way and simply taken for granted that it has. As much as my life revolves around film, I know life is not a movie. I know the difference. Those that don't, are in for their own rude awakening at some point in their lives. This film reminds them that peace and freedom has the highest price."

"gavinp9","7","0","4","2 January 2018"," Solid, realistic war film, if unspectacular
","'Fury' is set right at the end of World War II, with the American's slowly forcing the Nazis back towards Berlin. This is different to lots of WWII films, since it's not D-Day, or the Western front, or Pearl Harbour - it's just five guys in a tank, driving across Germany, fighting Nazis when they appear. And that's the film's strong point - it's very realistic. There's death, mud, weary soldiers, fleeing civilians and prisoners everywhere.<br/><br/>Sure, it wasn't filmed in Germany (England instead), but the costumes and sets look believable. There's really only three battle scenes, with the reality of war (lots of waiting around) being illustrated to full effect. And while probably accurate, the drawn out interludes of no action make the film longer than necessary - I think this would have made an excellent 1 hour 45 min film, rather than 2 hours 15 min.<br/><br/>Don (Pitt) is not actually the main character - it's really about new recruit Noman (Lerman) and how he fits in with this tight Sherman tank crew, and more importantly, how he deals with the horrors of war and killing other humans. The tracer fire looks great on the screen, but there's not enough action or incentive to care for the characters and their mission to make this a classic war film. See 'Patton' if you haven't!"
"rjm-geo","6","0","2","18 August 2016"," ""A"" for effort, but execution too sloppy.
","The cast is clearly committed. The special/practical effects, props, and battle reenactments are convincing. The historical details seem well-researched. The production values are very high.<br/><br/>And here's an action/drama that isn't a superhero franchise or any kind of existing property - you really want it to succeed.<br/><br/>So it's all the more annoying that it doesn't quite come together.<br/><br/>I'm OK with the clichÃ©-ridden story. The story arc basically works. It gets us what we want to see. It's in the smaller, technical details - and at the thematic core - where things falls apart.<br/><br/>1. The editing and cinematography feels off. For example, the movie opens with a sweeping Laurence of Arabia horseback entrance which doesn't fit the European rural setting. Little things, but almost the whole film is like this: wrong composition, wrong music cue, poor choice of edits and shots.<br/><br/>2. The filmmakers flinch. So it's clear we are going to be shown the ""hard realities"" of the closing months of WWII in Europe. German women selling themselves for a packet of cigarettes or some fresh eggs... yet the movie bends the story into contrived knots to avoid giving the crew of the Fury in any really hard moral choices to agonize over. Any Germans they have to kill in cold blood are conveniently SS (or accused of ""murdering"" US soldiers.. huh?). The German women they have sex with are willing and grateful for the experience.<br/><br/>3. *Spoiler* Look, as many others point out: you explode two grenades inside a tank with 4 bodies inside, I think anyone can fairly extrapolate what the interior decor might look like afterwards. Instead, we are shown it's like nothing happened. The incredulity of that late scene just totally dropped me out of the movie. I get the feeling that the final battle scene was reedited and significantly reworked - studios demanding more action or something along those lines. It feels very sloppy, with many continuity errors and none of the historical fidelity visible in earlier sequences.<br/><br/>4. It was well-acted, Pitt especially, Logan Lerman (who played Norman) also, but I never bought into the other characters as anything more than a collection of random (if historically accurate) personality ticks. Again, maybe the choppy editing is at fault here - but there isn't enough interplay to get to know them well enough to care about - or even empathize - with them. Which brings us to the biggest fault,<br/><br/>5. Why are we supposed to be watching this movie again? There are a bunch of themes or dramatic arcs, but what, if anything, the filmmakers want to say about them remains pretty much a mystery. So it ends up being a movie with some cool reenactments of WWII tank battles ... and not a whole lot more."
"DVR_Brale","6","0","2","27 July 2016"," Keeps focus almost entirely on few people thus failing to provide deeper insight to war terror
","I believe war movies are the most challenging ones to make. What other situation is so terrifying? How do you convey all the emotions one experiences during war time? Making a good war movie is such a hard task because it involves doing great camera job which is vital, developing deep characters so that viewers care about them, building a realistic world based on actual history (if the movie is WW 1 or 2) etc. But most of all, real war movie has to be disturbing just because real war is disturbing. You don't achieve that only by gore but by showing how pointless the war is. And that's not easy to do.<br/><br/>Fury doesn't do that. It's got solid camera work, different type characters, some nice effects, in my opinion very good soundtrack. There are some scenes which bring emotion to surface. But they're done superficially. I didn't feel real terror while watching this move.<br/><br/>Americans are as usually to powerful to stop. SS soldiers are on the other hand depicted as almost not being human. The movie really focuses on Don (Brad Pitt) and Norman (Logan Lerman). I was watching other protagonists through their point of view because two of them permeated the entire movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion: if there were more external aspects alongside main characters, like other people's tragedies and survivals, this movie would be a lot better. But that might would've made this movie a whole lot different.<br/><br/>If you're in for some shooting - go for it!"
"willicarr2012","Null","0","2","21 July 2016"," Enemy tactics
","Maybe spoiler here but other reviews have said similar. I was struck by the leader of an elite SS unit who appeared to have no idea how to attack a tank! That only happened in WW1 when the Germans were shocked by the newly invented tank. By the end of WW2 they had ample experience of how to deal with a disabled tank The tank is obviously most vulnerable from the side and the rear, so why did the 'elite' SS keep attacking from the front only to be mown down by the bow gunner? Another tactic for the crew would have been to lob a couple of HE shells into the marching column before they got close, which would have killed and incapacitated a substantial number of the closed ranks. Of course that would not have given opportunity for all the later heroics. There were a few times when Pitt was using the turret mounted machine guns and nobody managed to hit him, even the sniper who only appeared at the end. I enjoyed the movie though and Pitt gave a very fine performance. As did the others. By the way for the review reviewers, the word mown is areal word in the English language"

The rookie gets his baptism of fire and learns from Pitt that in war it's kill or be killed. There's no time for morals or civilised behaviour. <br/><br/>It's the ending of the film that totally ruins it for me. <br/><br/>4 Shermans are sent to hold a cross roads. All except one (Brad Pitts) are destroyed en- route. <br/><br/>But it arrives, drives over a mine and is disabled. Shortly after they discover there's a host of German soldiers on the way. Not just any Germans but fanatical elite SS. <br/><br/>So does veteran hard bitten realist Pitt do the sensible thing? i.e. abandon the tank and withdraw on foot. Go to the rear, get a new tank etc. The rest of crew see the sense in this and suggest doing it. <br/><br/>But no, Brad decides to stay with his disabled tank because ""it's his home"". WTF ! <br/><br/>The crew being similarly mentally impaired decide to stay with him. <br/><br/>I can't help think that the writer/makers of this film were trying for the same great ending as 'Saving Private Ryan'. But where as infantry trying to hold a bridge for tactical reasons had some logic to it. <br/><br/>Staying with a disabled Sherman didn't make sense. I mean it's disabled, it's a sitting duck. <br/><br/>Fortunately the approaching Germans were also clearly retarded. <br/><br/>They kept doing these infantry charges at the front of the tank. Apparently in infantry school they were never taught to 'go round' and flank a strong point. Attack from behind. <br/><br/>Or even just leave a couple of snipers and go round. <br/><br/>After an intense bloody and pointless battle, everyone in the tank, except the rookie, is killed. <br/><br/>The rookie hides underneath the tank. Unfortunately one of the SS see's him.<br/><br/>But fortunately this kindly SS solider decides to say nothing. <br/><br/>Even though about 60 of his colleagues are lying dead in the mud around him because of the idiots in this tank.<br/><br/>I never realised the SS were noted for their compassion. I thought the fanatical SS were responsible for most of the atrocities committed by the German army during WW2.<br/><br/>Later the next day the rookie is discovered by advancing G.I.s and thankfully the film is over. <br/><br/>Who ever wrote that ending should be run over by a tank at least 10 times.

","Yeah it's not the best film. In short the title says it all; the film reflects the fury felt by people fighting in war. This, like many other films, reminds us that war is hell.<br/><br/>What's the point? To exhibit the growth of a bond that is forced to grow or they all die. They all depend on each other for the tank to operate.<br/><br/>One small aspect that makes this film worth while is the way the kid is not killed in the end. As was portrayed in the beginning the kid does not want to partake in killing or the war in general. When the audience sees that he is spotted but the German soldier, the common trope of thought is to expect that the kid's goose is cooked. This film reminds us that all of the soldiers, on both sides, were humans. This one, like the kid, had no interest in causing more death. For t was a possibility that both of these characters were forced into the war and that it went against their values and morals. This is an interesting thought which is off=ten attempted at being explored, but never done sow well. in Saving Private Ryan Upton saves the German, but he ends up killing his mates.

","Fury is a pretty standard war movie. The big attraction being Brad Pitt, who does a decent job as the head of a tank in WW2 in Europe. Tank crews were vastly overpowered by German tanks. This movie shows that even in a tank, you are really vulnerable.<br/><br/>There is a weak storyline where you don't really learn much about the characters, other than this new kid who gets drafted as a replacement to one of the crew who gets killed. The plot is very thin in this movie. People die. People kill people. Good people get wrongfully killed. It gets a bit tedious without much of a story to cling to.<br/><br/>In the end, it seemed almost Terminator-esque as the tank battles the evil humans. I think Hollywood got a little too full of itself with the final scene, which leaves you with a - so what - moment. No big surprises. <br/><br/>The acting is good, the tank scenes with firearms coming at you at 1000 mph is terrific.

But this doesn't mean this movie is realistic. German guy looks inside the tank and gets shoot in the face with a pistol, just watch that scene its so stupid. German sniper shot Don 'Wardaddy' Collier three times and he still live like couple shot to the face from like 20 meters away, then the Germans threw 3 Grenades inside the tank right next to Don 'Wardaddy' Collier and his body was stick in one piece. Not sure if this is based on real events or what but in the movie that one tank at the end wouldn't last 10 minutes. German running 13 meters in front of the tank and get killed. Who made that scene up? The scene I hated the most is when Don 'Wardaddy' Collier is forcing the new recruit to murder a POW and there's American soldiers just watching. Some great action scenes but overall this movie is simply stupid and I think that THIS MOVIE say that Germans are more friendlier or better people than Americans Examples from the movie: Don 'Wardaddy' Collier attacks an SS officer who was already beat up and looks almost dead, Don 'Wardaddy' Collier forces a new recruit to murder a German soldier ( I know Don 'Wardaddy' Collier hate SS but in this case its just a soldier), don't know it this is realistic but Germans shoot you see a green line of bullet flying but for Americans its red, when Americans captured a German they killed him but when a German soldier finds Norman Ellison he lets him go even thou Ellison just killed +50 German Soldiers/Nazis."
"brchthethird","6","0","6","19 July 2015"," Impressive-looking and well-staged while lacking in emotional impact
","So many war films have been made that it's very hard to create something new or original anymore, at least as far as the drama and story is concerned. David Ayer's gritty, realistic style is pretty much a perfect fit for this type of film, but it was lacking in rich characters and emotional heft (at least to me). The story is about a Sherman tank crew during the final days of WWII who must face overwhelming odds to survive. You have Brad Pitt as the chief, Michael Pena as the driver, Jon Bernthal as the loader, Shia LeBeouf as the gunner, and Logan Lerman as a doe-faced replacement who must overcome his reluctance to fight and kill. I don't think you could have a more stereotypical group of people in a war film. Brad Pitt seems to be playing a more grounded, stoic version of his character from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, while Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal barely register as little more than caricatures of people. Shia LeBeouf actually acquitted himself rather nicely as a Bible-quoting soldier, which at least distinguished him somewhat from the rest. Logan Lerman, as a conduit for the audience, has a good character arc although it's one we've seen dozens of times before. From a writing perspective, FURY settles for ""been there, done that"" and it suffers as a result. However, David Ayer knows his way around action and the various battle sequences were pretty awesome. I don't think I've seen a war film centered around tank warfare, so at least that was new to me. The violence was gritty and realistic, but not overly graphic. I also thought that the color palate and cinematography helped to create a very distinctive mood and atmosphere, helped along by the often melancholy score. Aside from this, there was a respite from the violence in the middle where Logan Lerman's and Brad Pitt's characters get some development as they temporarily shack up in a house with two German girls. This segment of the film had my favorite part, which is when Logan Lerman plays a song on the piano and one of the girls starts singing along. It was the sweetest moment in an otherwise rather dark film. Thematically, I think the film was often at odds with itself. It wants you to see the protagonists as heroes, yet other than the fact that they're fighting for what we already know is the winning side, little they do would suggest that they are heroic. I'd also be hard-pressed to call any of the characters ""complex."" When it comes down to it, FURY is a rather simple war film that has visceral action and intense visuals. It should do fine for the average film-goer, but I was left wanting a little more."

","This is another of those war movies where existentialism becomes about desperate men traipsing through a blasted landscape strewn with debris and mangled shapes of a life that failed to make sense and provide order that prevents it.<br/><br/>Existentialism originally comes from studies on the logic of perception but somewhere along the way it has come to mean, in lay terms and otherwise, laments about how cold and repetitively pointless life can be, with only negative connotations. No matter. This hue came about by minds aghast by a couple of world wars and no real peace after.<br/><br/>It is WWII so we can have it all fairly removed from the doublebinds of politics and shrouded in common myth, a necessary struggle against evil but one that mitigates the horror and pain? The soldiers are for most of the film inside tanks so we can have visual imagery of men crawling through that horror in metal hulls that are as much weapon as they are home and self.<br/><br/>But the most important thing for me in something like this, is there insight of the urges behind that madness, insight of the rituals that make it up and diffuse it? Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Red and the White, Thin Red Line, they all attempt these insights.<br/><br/>There is one here, a startling insight as the disheveled crewmembers from the same tank gatecrash rudely a German home where their commander has sought a few moments of refuge away from the carnage and a calm meal cooked by a German mother. <br/><br/>In the next room the young greenhorn recruit has just had sex with the beautiful daughter, which underscores something we've been seeing for most of the film and should be the existential focus, that this is a war where good and evil should be on clear sides, but beneath this duality we see life as a parade of games and rituals; the tank battles on a field, the ribbing of the greenhorn recruit by the grizzled veterans, the bartering of sex for safety and a meal.<br/><br/>So when their cohorts foul up this moment of quiet, we see a few of those things with some clarity, how it's not some other cruelty that gives rise to war than what we see in that room, their sudden pettiness and vindictiveness, how evil doesn't think of itself as evil and how it's really ego and ignorance. How morality is nothing more than a bunch of agreements we make and decide to uphold and how easy it is to tear up once you are excluded from the benefits.<br/><br/>So this is more or less fine, some flaws of formulaic style rather than observation. But the end is where it completely loses me.<br/><br/>We have rituals throughout the film, and in the end we have the most momentous one that decides life and death for these people but now it becomes a defiant stand of the brave few against the many, mawkish and reductive when this is the climax to a WWII movie but without any insight either. Of course it plays long enough for us to see a last German soldier keeping silent, sparing a pointless death, and this too a part of gamesmanship."

","Review: What an epic movie! I couldn't help feeling emotional during the big shootout at the end and I felt for the crew who only had the tank to protect them from the many Germans who were attacking them with ultimate force. The director done extremely well by making the film look and feel realistic and you really feel like your in the tank with the crew. All of the actors put in great performances, especially Brad Pitt who was the head of his 5 man crew. I would have liked the director to go in depth with the individual characters except for concentrating on the new comer to the group, but thats just me being picky. I also thought that it could have done with some more scenes with them away from the front line because it does jump straight in at the deep end, right from the beginning. Anyway, the storyline is quite basic but interesting throughout and I really couldn't imagine how it must have felt to be in such a soul crushing situation. They only had each other to pull through combat and tackle the tricky a Germans so it was important that the director got the chemistry right with the actors, which he done very well. Its basically what it says on the tin and what we expect from a big budget Brad Pitt movie but I must admit, the bonding and brotherhood of the tank crew did touch me. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: You can really see were every penny of this budget went in this movie and I'm surprised that it didn't cost more. The many explosions and attention to detail made it seem like you was right there with the soldiers, who I have to give recognition to. On the bonus parts of the DVD, you get to see the actors talking to the real tank crew of that period so it shows how in depth the actors went to get there characters right. Brad Pitt isn't one to take on any and every role, so he only really comes out of the woodwork when the script is totally perfect. In this case, I can see why he took on the role as ""Wardaddy"" and his professionalism and humble way of acting, really worked with this character. At the beginning, I was cursing Logan Lerman who plays Norman, because it seems like he really won't fit in with tight crew, but as time goes on and with Pitt's guidance, he bonds with the team and he becomes one of there family. The scenes in the house with the girls showed a different side to the characters but when they went back to battle, it was quickly forgotten and straight back to business as normal. Anyway, the ending was a bit predictable but I did enjoy the film!<br/><br/>Budget: $68million Worldwide Gross: $212million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their war movies about a tank crew who have to fight against the Germans under extreme circumstances. 7/10"

","A quality movie that I regretfully missed in theaters. Through it's scope and it's realism it paints a moving and uncomfortable picture of war, definitely taking a page for ""Saving Private Ryan"" on the visual front, but not always on the storytelling front unfortunately.<br/><br/>Ayer works very well both as a director and as a writer, he gives proof he knows what he is doing and even manages to pull off some very delicate elements: you can see from frame one that he did his homework and his research. In the last year or so I have really noticed how movies, especially true stories or history ones, will either pull your heartstrings with wide, epic moments or small intimate ones. I personally tend to prefer the latter, but I really missed looking at something in the middle and ""Fury"" really nails some of them. This is due to a really, really strong cast. I was thinking who shines the most, but I realized that I could have almost talked about every one of them. Brad Pitt is awesome, but that's kind of a given by now. I have been a Logan Lerman fan before it was cool to be so, I have humongous faith in this actor and this is yet another performance where every good word I said on him comes through. Moreover I will say that Shia LaBeouf, another actor whom as a performer I am a fan of (not of the person), really gives proof of his abilities and makes so much out of a role that any other actor would have made forgettable, hats off to him for that, I really respect him as an actor, he has a very strong on screen presence. Finally the film is almost flawless on the technical side: beautifully shot, sound is amazing and production design is staggering to look at. Yet, most of all was a brilliant use of very good music.<br/><br/>There are no two ways around the fact that ""Fury"" is overlong. There are moments where it slows down, but I actually really appreciated those, it just required a 15 minute sharpening in my opinion and could have been a lot better. But, my main problem with the movie is its flirting with realistic storytelling. As I said in the intro it does that only visually, on the other side it falls trap of many clichés that make their way into the movie the more you go on and whilst they were handled well early on the more it went on the more I thought: ""I've already seen this"".<br/><br/>""Fury"" is a very intense and thrilling watch that I would definitely recommend, yet it isn't one that will really be stuck in your mind for long."

","A two-faced movie. First of all watching this one worths your time. It embraces you with great action sequences, an epic tank battle including the legendary tiger, good acting and carefully and rigorously designed scenes. Atmosphere, soundtrack and specially tanks totally get you. David Ayer proves that he is not only a good writer but also he can direct. Everything seems perfect but suddenly it goes all the way down. The depiction of psychological effects of war that we are all familiar with since full metal jacket makes fury a dull one. There are third class laser gun effects and unnecessary social messages. Cheap American propaganda over and over again tops it all. So, another American ww2 movie but still has something precious in it."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","0","5","11 February 2015"," A very good Anti-War drama...
","The way I see it there are 2 types of ""war movies"": The first type aims, if not to glorify war (that it would be plain stupid) at least to inspire and promote an heroic behavior that leads to a stellar victory where the ""good guys"" prevail over the (often faceless) bad guys, like Top Gun or Rambo.<br/><br/>The second type of war movies though, despite any heroic achievements, has a more than clear Anti-War message. You she clearly people suffer, even the ones who are victorious. You see people fear. The cruel face of War.<br/><br/>Without a doubt Fury is in the second (and more preferable) category.<br/><br/>Fury is an Anti-War movie where the audience can see how people, even regular, good people could be transformed in a time of war. You get tougher in a bad way. You struggle to maintain your humanity...<br/><br/>A substantial part of Fury happens inside a tank and that claustrophobic feeling adds to the terror.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, but praises need to be addressed to the cinematography (as a bonus notice the ""color coded"" firing effect) and the direction.<br/><br/>Overall: A sophisticated approach to the genre of war movies.

"Bruce722","7","0","5","8 February 2015"," Good WWII movie.
","Fury is a good film that depicts an American tank crew towards the closing of World War II. This movie had a lot of hype coming out and I think it largely was able to live up to most of it. Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shai LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pena form a fantastic cast of unique and substantially developed characters. The acting of Pitt and Bernthal especially carry the film. The plot, though lacking much premise beyond the war itself, is also developed really well throughout. There is one particular scene towards the midpoint of the film when they're about to leave a city after capturing it that really stood out and is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes in war movie history. Unfortunately, the movie couldn't carry that emotion throughout the rest of the film. The closing battle sequence was a little too ""Hollywood"" and didn't vibe with the realism and grit of the rest of the movie. Because of that, many of the character deaths felt unauthentic and didn't deliver the emotion that they should've. Overall, it's still a solid movie but it had potential to be much better."
"AkelaLoneWolf","7","0","4","7 February 2015"," Macho movie - tanker team in WWII
","Went in expecting to see a macho film on brotherhood in WWII and was not disappointed. Here the character of Brad Pitt as Wardaddy was portrayed as a war-hardened leader who was nevertheless soft in the core and tried to protect his team and his comrades in his own way. His closely knit team, though appearing like a band of misfits, outdid others in their solidarity and performance. The finale was heroic and dramatic with only the rookie surviving due to a German solider's mercy. All very grand with fraternity with a capital F. The movie was however marred by some parts. The slightly pathetic ""playacting"" with the two German women initiated by Wardaddy to foster an illusion of truce and short-lived peace amidst the plundering of the rest of the company was unreal - was that trying to convey that underneath Wardaddy was as innocent as the rookie? The ensuing dissonance (almost a mutiny) by the other tankers was also trying the audience as the presumed tension was not as poignant as the director would have it. There were several good side shots on the cruelty of war; the wounded, the corpses, the hanging of ""child traitors"", the blood bespattered family photos, etc. All in all, this serves as good entertainment even if it isn't top notch of its genre."

In some parts, it seemed like Brad was channeling George Clooney's character from O'Brother Where Art Thou.<br/><br/>This could have been a much better movie, but it felt too modern and thrown together. The characters were caricatures of war movies - the foreigner, the fresh-face, the a-hole, the bible thumper, the boss. Shia LeBeouf and Logan Lerman stood out as the most authentic, though.<br/><br/>The ending was really far-fetched. It felt too much like the Call of Duty/Medal of Honor video games. The scene in the apartment with the girls felt really awkward, too.<br/><br/>It's still an entertaining movie - if you're not a WWII history buff or war movie fan. They did work to make the tank feel like home to them, and the guys really did feel like they had bonded. There were some heart-wrenching moments, of course, and you kind of knew who was going to die before it happened. The tracer rounds were a nice touch.<br/><br/>It got its point across - war sucks."

","The main thing for me is that I enjoyed the movie. The acting was first rate, it looked great and the action keeps you invested for the over two hours. Where it fails is in the writing. There is nothing new here and quite a few scenes that are just too much for the imagination. A movie has to decide if it is going for realism or expects you to suspend your imagination as in a fantasy. This one tries to do both and leaves itself open for criticism. I also thought that Pitt was not at his best as the other performances out-shined him. Having all the main characters played by familiar faces also hurt any attempt at realism.<br/><br/>So if you go into this one looking purely for entertainment and ignore the flaws and attempts to make a statement, you will enjoy it."

","Even though Fury is not based off of any source material, it had it's moment of reality mixed in with many far-fetched moments. It's a highly entertaining World War II drama that although can be exaggerated, turned out to be a very solid film. The cover presents a quote that it's the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. That's a lot to live up to, especially in an age where we feel like we have seen all types of war films. Fury takes a different approach to the genre. It follows a crew of men who strictly work in tanks. Not only do you get a feel for the comradery that exists between soldiers, but you get a sense of the extreme conditions and hardships these men went through on a day to day basis.<br/><br/>The acting is really solid across the board. Brad Pitt is great as usual, but the real praise goes to Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf. These young actors surprisingly hold their own next to Pitt, Pena, and Bernthal. I was really impressed with David Ayer's script, especially the scenes involving the whole crew in the tank. There are moments of weakness though. Including some inconsistencies with Pitt's character, Wardaddy. At times he is completely against killing women and children, the next he is yelling at Lerman for sparing the lives of Nazi children. Or even the fact that it doesn't make much sense why Lerman was put into this situation in the first place. It was just mentioned as a 'mistake'. There is also a lack of female characters, besides one elongated dinner scene. It makes me wonder about Ayer's writing for Suicide Squad. Especially as DC's most famous female super-villain, Harley Quinn, is in his hands.<br/><br/>The production design looks great. The filmmakers really give you a feel of what Germany looked and felt like in the 1940's. With that being said, for some reason the bullets special effects really bothered me. They looked green and red at times, reminding me of a Star Wars film. It's a small complaint that is likely nitpicking, but if it's noticeable it's worth mentioning. Steven Price's score is noticeably his style, which worked both for and against him. His score went from being awkwardly unfit for WWII, to being emotionally powerful. But this all leads to the terrific finale. If you didn't care for the first 3/4 of the film, they make a point for you to care about the ending. Once again, a few far-fetched moments don't go unnoticed, but it's still an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>+Lerman & LeBeouf <br/><br/>+Production design <br/><br/>+Ayer's script <br/><br/>+Finale <br/><br/>-Character inconsistencies <br/><br/>-Special effects iffy <br/><br/>7.1/10"

","This is a typical Hollywood movie, with a clichéd script. No need for spoilers here, the end is typical, unsurprising, and a bit overly dramatic. But that does not mean it is a bad movie, and it is worth watching for Brad Pitt, alone.<br/><br/>The movie itself does have some character depth, and Shia LeBeouf does a quality job (though the script does have him make a significant character jump), Brad Pitt is the star. And he should be. This is his type of movie, the type he seems to do better in. Brad Pitt's character, Don Collier, is a bit darker, more philosophical, and is similar to what he played in Legend of the Falls, Se7en, The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Robert Ford, and even Troy. They are all darker characters, different from the Oceans series or even World War Z, and in those movies Pitt is in his element. In all of those movies, there are many scenes in which he speaks with stoic movement (or lack of) and his eyes. Behind all the pretty-boy comments, when he is given the opportunity to slow down, there is a serious depth that comes across on screen.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the basics are that it is about a tank crew in World War II. The battle scenes are high powered, seem to be almost Tarantino-esc, but are quite entertaining. The story moves with a variety of tensions and actions, and does not have very many serious logic gaps. In watching, it almost felt like a darker version of Inglorious Bastards (2009). <br/><br/>This is not a movie that will ever rise to the level of major award winner, but it is also not a movie that should be skipped. Though there are a few graphic war scenes, the violence is not overkill nor grotesque."

","Brat Pitt self indulgence and while the first half of the film shows the harsh realities of war, you know with a Pitt war film, this is going to degenerate as it goes along and on that score, Brad does not disappoint. Given I like a bit of historical context and accuracy in a film and they had someone from the dreadful Inglourious Basterds involved, this film went down the same path. It's not bad up till the completely over the top last twenty minutes. Its not anything to write home about either up to the last twenty. It does show the brutality of war, and some questionable morals with the attitude towards prisoners, something Band of Brothers and Thin red Line also hinted towards.<br/><br/>Had to look an see if Quentin Tarantino directed the end of this film given how over the top it all was as all the Germans were missing were bullseye targets on their uniforms as Brad manages to wipe out half their army in one night. It makes the German army incapable of taking over even a dog kennel. Kinda reminds me of Hot Shots! Part Deux when the Iraqis were coming out with bulleyse target and there was a score counter at the end of the screen saying it was surpassing other films kill totals.<br/><br/>Like cartoon violence really at the end and maybe they forgot to add in Yosemite Sam as one of Brads crew. If would give historians something to think about given history tells us that 80+% of German casualties were caused by the Russians but we would have to re-write history and at least attribute 20% to Brad alone. Maybe that is why we see little in terms of film on the Eastern front in what was truly brutal compared to the western campaigns. Of course at the end, you do wonder why the US Army didn't sent Brad on his own to win the war. Hopefully Pitt never makes another war film."

So honestly the ending is just plain stupid, for the most part the Germans just well ignore the tank and don't shoot at them when the Americans are in plain sight. But hey I haven't been in a war (and won't ever be, I hope) so I am not the expert here<br/><br/>However the camera work was very well done and the action and the hate felt warlike (what ever that means).<br/><br/>One point I appreciated though in this film, how it was portrayed (actually hinted at, will probably take another 5 decades before that is shown as it really was) how the Americans treated the women of the countries they liberated. Fact is they treated them like many ""warriors"" treat women. They do as they please with them. <br/><br/>I am glad they showed this, cause many Americans live under the illusion that American soldiers were somehow more decent and respectable than the soldiers of other countries (which in a way they were ;). But Americans raped 14,000 women in Great Britain, France and Germany. Men are Men, no matter what country they are from. And some Men take advantage of the weak. <br/><br/>So even if war is fought for the right reasons, the ""good"" people (and yes America was good back then and Germany evil) still do a lot of bad to the bad guys (and the bad innocent girls).<br/><br/>But well super mass rape and torture in Iraq killed those illusions, but don't think it was much different in WW II, even though that was a ""rigtheous war"".

","As if he had mixed up the potential of the excellent ""End of Watch"" with the apathy of the low ""Sabotage"" and bring them both together to cooperate in this new tape of war against the Germans, led by the always reliable Brad Pitt, ""Fury"" is a feature that in a good way draws the atrocities that had occurred in the early 40 ', but that is exceeded by the amount of blood offered. It is a feature of basic stereotypical characters rescued by a distinguished cast and although it is a script that is not very polished, there are dialogs and a scene of juvenile love, that should be highlighted. ""Fury"" is a feature that has both good and bad things.<br/><br/>Guided by an always magnanimous and already known Nazi matador and supported by a devoted religious man, a sensitive animal, a sacrificed Mexican and a young rookie, i think Ayer didn't worry enough for those soldiers stamped in his book of scripts. Stereotypicals and with endings written quickly and with indifference, ""Wardaddy"" and the rest of the crew members of the ""fury"", are medium-sized characters, which by grace, were redeemed by, Pitt, LaBeouf, Bernthal, Peña, and Lerman, a handful of good warriors. In 135 minutes, we have the opportunity to see a good use of shots, ranging from close ups to aerial shots in a good direction. Who is able to avoid the excess of viscera scattered by a few German towns and steel shells that are seen as lasers and rejoices in several scenes that stand out, such as the undaunted duel between tanks facing canon against canon, will not hesitate in the form they will catalog the film. Although, ""Corazones de Hierro"" (The name of the film here in Chile.), is the owner of several clichés from beginning to end, it is worth highlighting the always entertaining internal dialogs that Ayer is able to write for his characters. And although in the end, in my opinion, fog in an exaggerated manner, I must stress the beautiful and patient scene in that ""Wardaddy"" and ""Machine"" meet two German girls.<br/><br/>While there are bad things, is a good movie that does not remove the time invested. 7/10.<br/><br/>Ayer as a writer/director. Harsh Times: ? End of Watch: Excellent with many great things. Sabotage: Poor with a lot of bad things. Fury: Good with bad things. Death Squad (He lost Tom Hardy, that's pretty bad.

","If you want to spend time on typical American made nonsense than go ahead. This movie is so filled with stereotypes that it reminds me of Rembo. Even the battle with Tiger tank could not save the day. Well OK the explosions and ricochets are kinda cool but the rest is far from even OK. Like the way tanks burn down. C'mon how hard it is to look up how a tank burns down if the ammo rack is hit. Since when panzerfaust was shooting projectile that left a huge hole? It was firing shaped charge that left a hole no bigger that your finger. How can you hide from German bone crusher MG 34 that shoots 900 rounds a minute without having any cover? The end fight is just ridiculous. Seems like they wanted to make drama and war movie but failed in both. A lot of scenes made no sense at all."
"chernia-739-55522","6","0","5","18 January 2015"," Ridiculous battle scenes. Does film makers care about reality of war?
","I didn't like that movie. It is ignorant of basic facts of tank battles. 1. Tiger's 88mm gun was the best tank gun in WWII with twice the effective kill range of that of any allied tank gun. A textbook tactic for any German tank commander,was, when confronting a superior number of enemy tank: Don't make a charge attack! Ambush the enemy and kill them one by one. Use in full your superior gun range and don't let them come near to you. 2. Moreover, in WWII, there was no gun stabilizer, therefore, it was basically impossible to hit a target while on move. In reality,American Shermans would not hit their target while charging in a John Wayne style. In opposite, the concealed two German anti-tank guns would easily destroy the Americans. 3. The scene where American tank commanders are riding in open turrets while dozens of foot soldiers hiding behind their tanks, charging the enemy, was ridiculous. Tank commanders are a prime targets for enemy fire and no-one, ever, attacks the enemy positions with open hatches. 4. There is no way, a non officer would get a command of a tank-platoon. If his CO is killed, another would be appointed. 5. But most disturbing scene is, undoubtfully, the murder of German POW as a pervert lesson to childish Norman and very degenerate, unmoral conduct of American personal. Maybe the director got confused with the Vietnam war, in WWII the American soldier was a naive, moral and courageous man, believing in what he was told by his CO and more important: very disciplined."

","I am not the biggest fan of Brad Pitts acting, although like Leonardo DiCaprio he's having a sense for decent roles in good movies.Or he's just in the privileged situation of choosing any role he wants. That's not different wit ""Fury"". <br/><br/>Despite the bad German title ""Heart of Steel"" (Retranslated) i was thrilled to see this movie. The last good anti-war movie (""The hurt locker"") was released quite a while ago.<br/><br/>The Movie starts with well-made pictures and stereotype, but interesting characters with uniformly bad attributes. Something i expect from a good anti-war movie. Therefore the confrontation between Brad Pitt's character an the newbie along with the quiet scenes in the village are among the best scenes of the movie. Last one is also the only characterization of the German enemies.<br/><br/>All the action sequences in the beginning of the movie are nice to watch and seem to be quite realistic. But then everything changes.<br/><br/>Suddenly the whole tone of the movie is changing. From one scene to another the movie seems more like a part of the ""Expandables""-Franchise. The lead characters find themselves without any reason, background or storyline in a confrontation between a enabled tank and an army of German soldiers. Although the characters have no reason or special purpose to act the way they do. Suddenly Brad Pitt and his men are doing their best Rambo-impersonation by killing German soldier with any kind of weapon. Luckily for the filmmakers all of them are dying beautifully lined up next to each other, so there is the possibility for a good shot from above.<br/><br/>BEGIN SPOILER: This scenario is reaching it's poor top when the German soldier are even too stupid to hit the tank with one of their rocket launchers. And when they finally do, the projectile is just going through even though in every scene before the tanks were totally destroys while forcing a similar impact. If that's not enough minutes later you see Brad Pitt's character standing on top of the tank firing without being harmed or hit. And then with the victory in reach, suddenly everyones starts dying just for dramatic reasons. <br/><br/>By writing these scenes the author must have thought, ""Oh my god, the Germans are looking pretty bad in this"". As a consequence he may have added one of the last scenes with the absurd help of one German soldier. Hopefully this should not say that he was so impressed by the American will to combat that he forget about his killed friends and fellows. I rather go with the interpretation that the young age of the character or the bad lighting was to be blamed for that. END SPOILER<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: After all the movie had a good first half, which was partly destroyed by a miserable but entertaining second half. In the end there should have been less what i call ""America F*** Yeah!"" and a bit more focusing on realism and characterization of the soldiers with their bad sides would have made this movie great. What we have instead is an entertaining movie with great optic and a bitter taste."

But the scene in an apartment with a mother and daughter, intended to intensify the characters, doesn't work.<br/><br/>Tracer bullets are amazing on screen, but not a single frame of this equals the cow scene in Come And See.

","Fury is not a realistic war movie. Fury contains palpable violence, diverse characters, and a series of gut wrenching scenes, ending with an astonishing body count. A great deal of the death may not illicit desired empathy and consequences, but for the characters fleshed out the audience gets to experience the finality of a violent end. Who thinks this a heroic movie? These are not heroes! Brad Pitt's character is scared both mentally and physically, and is appropriately out of place as a tank commander. Who chooses to be a killer? None of the characters in this film, and this is so much of the point of this fable, story, and movie. This is war, and war as hell. Glory? No! A point? Absolutely! This movie has something to say, and is crafted as such by developing film maker David Ayer - one of my personal favorite writer/directors currently making big budget American films. David borrows heavily from a wonderful (and apparently forgotten) author from the past: Jack London. Pitt is Wolf Larson, with his disguised brilliance beneath the grime and camouflage of the cynical, brow beaten soldier. Logan Lerman, the child like recruit Norman Ellison, serves as the audiences entry into the war torn tank, Fury. An inanimate object, but also character within the film. Fury is confined, simplistic, and an effective film. Nothing is hidden, yet the baggage brought in through expectation has, apparently, changed the obvious for many viewers. 7 out of 10"

","A frustrating film. Much of it is one of the most realistic depictions of war I've seen - up there with ""Cross of iron"" and ""Come and see"". Heads and limbs are blown off, rotting corpses are flattened in mud, and the chaos and brutality of the last days of Nazi Germany are also unflinchingly portrayed. Civilians hanging from trees and lampposts; snipers revealed as terrified schoolchildren in uniform; a grizzly tableau of bodies slumped round a table - Nazis unable to face defeat. There's also a graphic display of tank/infantry tactics which leaves nothing to the imagination. <br/><br/>The last third of the film sadly descends into cliché as the tank platoon makes a suicidal last stand against a 300 strong SS regiment. An odd decision by Brad Pitt as he's spent most of the film vowing to keep his platoon alive now that the war is almost over. Even odder is the platoon's decision to stay with him. A more appropriate response would be something along the lines of 'This is a fine mess you've gotten me into....' As you'd expect almost everyone perishes in a blaze of pyrotechnics, expertly staged but in terms of raw realism a damp squib compared with what's gone before."

Brad Pitt delivered a wonderful performance as the leader of the tank.

","Finally, I went to see Fury. I can't say I am a big fan of war films. I wanted to watch it just because of Brad Pitt. Just to see how he would deal with not typical for him role. Plus, there are many positive reviews that also influenced on my decision to watch this film. And, I admit that, I was really impressed. It wasn't waste of time.<br/><br/>The movie tells us a war story placed during World War II. Fury is the name of the tank that is the central figure of the whole movie. But the main role is given to Brad Pitt who plays the tank commander Don Collier (also called Wardaddy) and whose mission is to hold crossroads from Nazi soldiers until US reinforcement arrives. He leads his crew with who he has been fighting for a long time: Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBeouf), gunner; Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal), loader; and Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Peña), driver. Their original assistant driver/bow gunner was killed in battle and he was replaced by a recently recruited Army typist, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). Norman has never been inside of a tank before, he has never killed people in his life. So, getting to the war was like a nightmare for him. And precisely this ""freshness"" is what makes him another central character in this story.<br/><br/>Norman and Collier are totally opposite characters. Collier is a weathered soldier, who is used to war atrocity in all its aspects. He has no fear nor mercy. He is just like a killing machine. But there are scenes where we can see he is not that tough and fearless. He is a human as well, he has feelings and deep inside he does care about what is going on, he is already tired of this war and it hurts a lot to him to see people dying.<br/><br/>Norman is a newcomer. He is afraid of everything. He can't stand all that blood mixed with mud. He can't kill and he doesn't want to. And all along the movie we see how Collier tries to change Norman, to help him to survive that war. And it's really very interesting to see the development of these two characters.<br/><br/>I should point out the excellent work of all actors. No doubt, Brad Pitt is an amazing actor! I was really impressed by his acting. I remember first time when I felt similar impression was when I watched Fight Club. He is really great! While I was watching the movie, I could feel Pitt's character with all his feelings, emotions and conditions.<br/><br/>And, of course, some words on the whole film-making, how it was shot. Absolutely, Fury is a great director's work! David Ayer, director, managed to transfer that gloomy and terrifying war atmosphere. Bloody action scenes together with the thrilling music makes you feel all that horror reigning on the battle field. I won't tell much about the end because it is very very sad.<br/><br/>In general, the whole movie is very tense and emotional. There are moments when the characters try to make jokes, but it's just because they don't know how to deal with all that pain and tiredness they feel inside. All the battle scenes where people are torn apart and everything is in blood are so horrifying. And due to the excellent acting you feel this atmosphere and you just can't stay indifferent, it's just impossible."
"therocksbarneyreviews","5","0","4","9 November 2014"," ""If I was to watch the film again...""
","""Fury"" is a brutally honest depiction of war, following the five man crew of a US Sherman tank during the Allied Army's final push on Germany in 1945. Although it's close to the end of the war, 'Wardaddy' (played by Brad Pitt) points out that ""a lotta people gotta die"" first, and boy do they in this film, in fact so much so in the final third of the film that it lets it down. Yet as the dead built-up I found myself consistently referencing back to Boyd 'Bible' Swan (played by Shia LaBeouf), telling Norman Ellison (played by Logan Lerman), to wait till he sees ""what a man can do to another man"" and that is what this film is all about; the horrors of war. The film is obviously anti-war and this is vividly illustrated by the impact of the conflict on the five man crew. We can tell these men are changed men and we see this change in its entirety in Lerman's character, whose performance is commendable here, going from hesitating to kill to enjoying it. These men are broken by war and we see this for example in the moments when Pitt's character goes to take a break from it all with a cigarette in mouth, almost breaking down, and incredibly well-acted. These painfully long shots have impact. It is important here not to forget to mention how well the rest of the crew perform too. What I picked out best of all though was how these men were just as bad as the Nazis, leading me to question whether any one side was worse than the other. The film's director, David Ayer, does well to pose these questions. He also does extremely well in the first two thirds of the film. If I was to watch the film again I would stop at the end of the second third and give it 4 stars, but the film's final third lets it down. The finale is full of blood, guts and glory and, although it is somewhat fitting considering the questions that Ayer poses, did well to detach me from it, leaving me far from caring about the lives, even of the crew members, that were being taken as well as the questions that Ayer had done so well to pose. A tank battle just before this also did well to detach me, with the Nazis suddenly forgetting how to aim, but hey, this is Hollywood. The film's strengths instead lie in its earlier stages, as well as its cast, all doing well to emphasise that war really is hell."

The thing that is missing is a connection with the characters, like I said before, they are all unique and interesting but I found it difficult to feel for them; I said my review contains spoilers and here is why: I didn't feel for the characters when they died one by one. Even when the sound got muted out and went slow, it wasn't emotional for me. Also, their accents were so strong, without subtitles I missed the (I'm assuming) heartfelt story's of their past.

","Fury opens with the calm before the storm: a quiet battlefield at sunset. A single German officer rides his horse through a series of fallen tanks, destroyed at the end of battle. As he calmly rides through, a character by the name of ""Wardaddy"", played by Brad Pitt, leaps from one of the tanks and brutally murders the officer, then quietly returns to his tank with his three other living officers, and one deceased.<br/><br/>I wish the film was punctuated with more moments like this; Fury is an aptly-named film that almost never lets up. It is packed with entertaining action sequences, and not much else. Characters are horribly underdeveloped; aside from our two leads, who had no back story, I knew nothing about the other characters. They are played to the fullest by their respective actors, but we never learn enough to truly determine the motivation of their behaviors, or even to care much about them. The only characters that get any real attention are Wardaddy and Norman (played by Logan Lerman in the only non-convincing performance of the film); and still, we get no back story for them either.<br/><br/>In addition to not being given any inkling of what might be driving the character's motivations, we get no real motivation for the story either. Norman is introduced to war-torn Germany, and he does not fit in. We know the film is going to revolve around the relationship between him and the other men of ""Fury"", but there is no foreground story- no mission or destination guiding their journey. The tank rolls around a lot, but where is it going? With what purpose? Wardaddy tells a young German woman at one point ""we're going to the next townand the nextand the nextuntil you people quit."" Is that it? It makes the movie feel aimless. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. I hope that's the case.<br/><br/>There are a few other issues with the film. The fired shots in the film look like something out of a Star Wars film. I'm not sure what they were going for here but it was awfully distracting. The writing for Norman is not believable either, and might be the reason for Logan Lerman's acting not seeming seemingly weak performance. The rest of the actors do well because they are all experienced actors who know what they were doing- Jon Bernthal in particular has made great strides, and I wanted to see more him; a sense of the director's presence is not present here. The film is both generic and specific- the muddy, gray atmosphere of Germany is a specific look done to death in WWII films).<br/><br/>Although Fury misses a lot of its marks, it is not a bad movie. The action sequences are entertaining, in particular, a scene where three American tanks take on a German Tiger tank. It is one of the most memorable scenes from a war movie I've seen in a long time. There are lots of powerful little moments throughout, and the gore of the film, though meant to shock, is not photographed in such a way to elicit such a reaction; it is cold and straightforward, to show us exactly how things are in war. There's another great scene in a German town, one of the quieter and more focused scenes of the film, involving Wardaddy, Norman, and two German women, which bounces back and forth from heartfelt to tense, over and over again. <br/><br/>However, by the end, I felt I had learned nothing, took away nothing from the film. Sadly, Fury is nothing but more than it's title. There is no point, and if there is something nuanced to take away from here, it fails to show at all. Fury is an entertaining two hours, but ultimately forgettable, and in a few years, will probably be referred to as ""that other WWII movie Brad Pitt starred in, the one that wasn't 'Inglorious Basterds'."" I was a little disappointed, and unimpressed. <br/><br/>Grade: B"

Yep, that's war, no matter where it's fought, no matter who wins, no matter what they win, and no matter who they butcher doing all that.<br/><br/>I'd like to believe that Ayer had that thought while making this one, which I consider his best to date, at least in terms of ambition, of not in terms of execution as well (I'm in his corner, but many don't seem to be).<br/><br/>If you wanna watch the horror of war, and feel it hit you over the head and smell the mud and the grime and become numb at the end of it, and still wanna talk about it, trying to make sense of it all, while staying anti-war, this movie achieves that remarkable feat.<br/><br/>A respected friend, in his/her critique, called this clichéd and predictable, and I think it is a little bit of both, in parts, but never loses sight of the human tale it tells, even during the final relentless set-piece that doesn't seem to have an end.<br/><br/>Of course, harsher people have called this the worst ending in years, and I think they missed the point completely, just as they're sure to have missed the point of the clean-up-and-sup sequence that serves to take us (and mainly, the ravaged characters, who have been through a lot, and have nothing better to look forward to) away from the relentless (there's that word again) brutalities and atrocities of war (and its inevitable fallout), if just for a few moments. In that scene, you completely understand what the main characters want, have been through, and are about. Sadly, the main point missed by most audience-members (it's okay - at least they paid to watch the flick and then make their observations - the movie deserved that much).<br/><br/>Every performance, be it the lead (not Pitt) Lerman, or Shia LaBeouf (surprisingly, almost cast against type - imagine the kinda lobbying he and his agent would have had to do to land him this gig), Bernthal (apparently channeling his 'Shane' from 'The Walking Dead' according to some ignoramus who thought he/she could understand what characterization is all about), Peña (always solid, but not given much room over here) or (unsurprisingly) Pitt is grounded in the conflict, and you believe that these men have been serving together as long as they have, and bond as easily as they do. I also cannot get enough of watching Jason Isaacs perform, and he's in 2 whole scenes in this one. I don't think his talents are being utilized the way they ought to be. <br/><br/>One of the best sequences, for me, was the infamously derided clean- up-and-sup sequence, and it is so contextual and plausible that I am even more surprised at audience reactions, and wonder what some people expect from a work of fiction. It's almost as though no one has heard of artistic liberty at all, when it comes to this flick, but all the liberties taken by other mainstream flicks are alright. Separate rules indeed!<br/><br/>I also got diverted by all the talk (to be fair, I've heard only 1 opinion on the subject so far) on how there were no tracer bullets in WWII. I confess I found it to be slightly distracting initially, and gave the movie-maker the benefit of doubt thereafter, but the one who accompanied me said he was completely out of it all after he saw that, and the movie made no impact on him at all. So it's possible that the other audience-members who felt differently found their own (or the same) points due to which they felt no longer involved in the movie-watching experience for this one. IMHO, they missed a good one.<br/><br/>A good time at the movies this weekend - definitely to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","4","5 November 2014"," Effective and powerful
","This film tells the story of five soldiers in a tank, who valiantly enters deep into Nazi Germany in the Second World War.<br/><br/>""Fury"" is the name of the tank that houses the soldiers and keep them alive. It is also the raw emotion that fuels the soldiers to plough on, and the catalyst for the typist to transform into a brave soldier.<br/><br/>The story is intensely captivating and moving. It tells how brave the soldiers are in advancing through enemy lines. Yet, it is also human. It shows love and innocence from the typist. It shows leadership and courage from the commander. And even the most courageous can get scared.<br/><br/>There is much blood and many gory scenes, but they are not contrived at all. They are there to remind people the horrors of war. When the film ended, I was left dumbfounded for minutes because ""Fury"" is such an effective and powerful film."
"vincent-malisse","6","0","4","4 November 2014"," Not what I hoped for
","This movie was entertaining, but did not live up to my expectations and has many similarities with Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The story was shallow and though some scenes were impressive I often could not relate to them. Occasionally the story goes too fast, then too slow and scenes were not really tied together in a fluent manner. Other scenes were such an obvious setup for a certain moral explanation later, it became a little too predictive. Characters have little or no background.<br/><br/>A plus in this movie, is the acting which was very good. Usually you can recognize the actors by their acting style, but I didn't remember Shia Labeouf playing in this movie when watching it and did not recognize him at all. The other actors perform equally well and on occasion seem to their very best to save the thin story line.<br/><br/>All in all it was a very watchable movie, though more for a Friday night movie at home setting than for in a movie theater."
"dirtywesterner","7","0","3","3 November 2014"," So close, but yet so far from what it could have been
","As a big fan of ""Kelly's Heroes""(and a lifelong reader of ww2 history), when I saw the previews, I thought FINALLY, a ww2 tank film with modern elements of ""realism""-having heard they used the first actual Tiger on film I had high hopes.Halfway into it, I still did. Rich with excellent depictions of tanks vs anti-tank guns,tank vs dug-in infantry,and some amazing Tiger vs Shermans footage,it is full of very graphic portrayals of the horrors of war,and initially there were few flat spots.The scene where ""Warlord"" and the rookie interact with the German civilians was electric-a mix of calm and horror all at once.<br/><br/>In terms of historical accuracy, visually it was spot on. I think the dead German draped over ""Fury""and set afire, was wearing ""flecktarn""(west German camouflage)pants,but Im not certain. ""Warlord's"" use of an STG-44 was rewarding; his use accurately showcased it's effectiveness. There was a degree of the ""hapless German soldier"" element, but this was set in April of 1945,so it was forgivable,up until the final act.<br/><br/>The final act was similar to the final act in ""Saving Private Ryan""- in both a large force of German soldiers skipped the standard procedures of reconnaissance and artillery preparation, and then marched single file into the gun-sights of a badly outnumbered force of Americans.In ""Fury"", it was even less plausible, as the Germans could have easily destroyed the disabled tank with a single panzerfaust. Overall , I enjoyed the film , but hated the ending. If I could re-write it, I would have had the tank crew slowly worn down on a desperate run through hostile territory,against overwhelming odds,like the previews suggested.."
"arielharabalja","7","0","3","1 November 2014"," Excellent beginning, disappointing end
","In short, the beginning really made me feel like I genuinely witnessed a real ww2 battle. I was totally immersed in the action and when the fighting stopped I still shivered for a few minutes. Pure 10 on that. Then the movie slowed down to give us some insight in the characters personalities and the reasons why they are the way they are. In my opinion this part is too long and although it succeeds in making you feel the tension and anxiety that something bad is going to happen, it is ruined by a conclusion that resolves all uncertainties. It served the purpose of making a soldier out of the soft rookie but it reminded me of the times i told stories to my younger brother and sister and just concluded with ""lived happily ever after"" when I wanted to do something else. An average 5 on that. The last part is poor to say the least. I had to force my brain to ignore all the ridiculous scenes in order to enjoy the rest of the movie, and I failed. If you want details, read the many reviews dedicated to that because i see no point in re-writing the same. My theory is that we, the audience, are too stupid to watch anything but super hero movies. The reality is not good enough. The director remembered that when the movie was almost over and acted accordingly. Pure 0 on that. Not because of the lack of realism but because I was constantly rolling my eyes thinking ""Come ON""<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Maybe the average would be a 5, but my general enjoyment grade is a 7. I enjoyed most of the movie a lot so i will not let the bad ending ruin it for me. The acting was OK, but then, I am more of the general feeling guy. In such movies I usually notice the actors only if they are really bad."
"ihvhadni","6","0","4","1 November 2014"," Yanks in a Tank
","The platoon of an American Sherman tank pushes through an oddly Winter-like Germany in the springtime and the characters, who repeatedly claim that tank operating is the 'best job of their lives' can't decide on their motivations: at one point the team is extolling the virtues of their commander (played by Brad Pitt) -- to the point of being fearful of disobeying him, and the next they're on the verge of mutiny after having downed a couple of drinks. The cinematography and acting are both very good (although anyone besides American Red Necks may have trouble understanding a third of the dialogue), but some plot point absurdities, such as an SS brigade taking fifteen minutes to march a hundred yards in order to give the yanks-in-a- tank enough time to bemoan their fate, strain credulity. Overall an entertaining film which tries to walk the line between anti-war messages and expected action film tropes."
"toh_jun_yong_1995","7","0","3","1 November 2014"," Fury: On the horrors of war
","I initially had high hopes for 'Fury', with it having such star-studded names like Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf and Jon Bernthal of 'The Walking Dead' fame. The movie itself did live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>Firstly, I would have to say that it captured the horrors of war spectacularly. Right in the first scene, we see Brad Pitt's character, Collier, repeatedly stabbing a Nazi soldier. After that, we see when Norman (Logan Lerman) cleans up the tank, the remains of the previous gunner in the crew. Not only does the movie capture the physical nature of the war with its gruesome depictions, we also see how man's morality and conscience are affected by the war.<br/><br/>A line that particular struck me was when Collier, asking Norman to shoot a Nazi Soldier in cold blood, states that the Nazi's job is to kill them and their job is to kill the Nazis. From here we see how one's conscience can be hardened through war experience. Norman represents the naivety which people who have not experienced war or killing display.<br/><br/>Norman himself would begin to develop a hardened conscience and grayish line of morality. Ultimately, viewers are made to understand, that war is war and regardless of one's own inner sense of justice or morality, they must do their jobs, just like how their enemies would do theirs. Another powerful scene was towards the end when we see Norman, hiding from the German troops, being discovered by a Nazi Soldier who is also a young man like himself. He lets him go, probably empathizing with him. From here, we see that despite war and its horrors, there is good to be found in it, and not all soldiers from Germany's SS are bloodcurdling killers. In fact, several scenes in the movie depict Germans who were hanged for refusing to participate in the war.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, with all its good points, i find that Fury could have done better with the character development. I find that the pace of the development of Fury to be somewhat lacking and too fast. At the start, we see Norman refusing to kill a German soldier, to the point of breaking down and wanting to quit. Yet, after that he obeys Collier's orders dutifully and even states that he enjoys killing Nazis. A crucial turning point would have been the death of the girl which Norman had taken a liking to. I do feel this scene was especially powerful in showing how there is nothing you should not expect in war and how cruel it can be. This scene should, i feel, be placed before Norman starts killing German soldiers as it would then have more of an impact in showing the poison of revenge.Although, applause have to be given for the camaraderie shown between the crew of Fury. We are treated to bits of smack talk between the crew, and there is even quarrels between them now and then. Yet, in the end, they are blood brothers to the end, with each of them sticking together throughout.<br/><br/>Overall, Fury is a movie which satisfactorily fulfills the crucial points a war movie should have, and yet i do find that it could have done slightly better in some parts."
"paris_whitney_hilton_nyc","7","0","3","26 October 2014"," The Good , The Bad , and The Silly
","April 1945 with the war in Europe practically over the men of a Sherman tank named Fury must go on one final secret mission . It was so secret we were never told exactly what it was ! The Good : Shia LaBeouf is the young new replacement for Fury's recently killed crewman . Shia is also the only American soldier left in the army who has not lost his humanity towards his fellow man even if they happen to be the enemy . The Bad : Brad Pitt as the ruthless sergeant who for no good reason forces Shia to murder a German POW in cold blood and thus becoming a war criminal in the process . The Silly : After Fury is disabled by an enemy land mine , Sgt. Brad Pitt decides to take on 300 elite German SS troops rather than simply walk away from the immobilized tank and certain death . Don't get me wrong , Fury is a very tense and somewhat disturbing movie about men in war . It does not glamorize warfare as most movies often do . Other than Shia , there are no likable American soldiers in this movie . Except for the grand finale, the battle scenes seem very real . Four Sherman tanks taking on a huge Tiger tank was exciting . However, in the final scenes Fury is reduced to that of a typical action / war movie . How can one poorly armored tank and 5 men take on so many enemy soldiers before being blown to rubble ? A few SS soldiers drop 2 hand grenades down the tank's hatch but they don't go off . The enemy gunfire seems to stop whenever someone in the doomed tank has something to say . The most unbelievable scene is when Pvt. Shia sneaks out of the tank's trap door in the floor and partially covers himself with dirt . An SS soldier shines a flashlight on him and gives a smile but for some unknown reason doesn't shoot lucky Shia ! ... I once saw a 1943 war movie called Sahara . Sgt. Humphrey Bogart and a few British soldiers he picks up along the way manage to kill or capture a few hundred thirsty German soldiers with a single tank called Lulu Belle . But then again, that was a typical feel good movie that was made during the darkest days of WW2 ...... Fury is seriously flawed and not a feel good movie but still worth seeing . I think the director must have filmed a few alternate endings but chose to go with this one as not to have the movie end on a such a depressing note .. After all is said and done, Fury is better than average ! ............. PWH"
"searchanddestroy-1","Null","0","5","22 October 2014"," Forget Kelly's Heroes
","Blood, guts, tripes, death. Here are the key words to describe this absolute masterpiece. The true face of war. Far ahead before PRIVATE RYAN. And also a tank movie as were BEAST OF WAR, in 88, and STEEL LADY, back in the fifties. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is here so poignant, so terrific and Shaia Le BÂœuf has never been so good in a supporting character. The 135 minutes are not so long for the audience. And above all, SS troops are not shown as jerks. SS were butchers, assassins, beasts, yes, yes, yes, but certainly NOT jerks. The behaviour of one of them, at the end, is surprising and why not unbelievable. But why not? One last thing, the final battle begins in broad daylight and ends at night...But, again, why not?"
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","4","22 October 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Fury
","War is hell. And in the case of 2014's Fury (my latest review), war is sometimes a popcorn flick. In other words, this thing is not gonna wow the Academy nor is it gonna garner any award nominations come January. It is alas, just another battlefield relic, a sort of second tier Saving Private Ryan that also lacks any sort of poetic grandeur from other WWII vehicles such as 1998's The Thin Red Line. Granted, my halfhearted recommendation will stem from it having a few decent performances and a compelling, final thirty minutes involving the protective stand of a broken down Sherman tank. But my bar for scope and sophistication via war movies has always been set very high, and Director David Ayer, who was once in the armed forces himself, unfortunately only raises it a couple of notches here.<br/><br/>Edited by Dody Dorn who handled Ayer's last picture in Sabotage, filmed primarily in England, UK (masquerading as East Germany), and having an opening shot that is equal parts scintillating and downright horrific, Fury is an October release that could possibly be labeled as true fact (that's if in the 1940's, killing a defenseless, innocent man wasn't a war crime and head decapitation was how every soldier bit the dust). But come on, does it really matter? As you view it, this dirty, grimy, overcast looking flick is almost plot free in its otherwise two hour-plus running time. What precludes is something minimal about a time during WWII (April of 1945 to be exact), where a five-man tank crew must take on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. They must stop hundreds of German Nazis (who else?) at all cost. So in retrospect, watching Fury made me wonder two things: 1. could what have transpired in this movie succeed more as a sort of documentary shot by an ancient TV crew patiently following a bunch of soldiers around? 2. why is director David Ayer so hellbent on having his characters one up each other, measure each other's manhood (figuratively speaking of course), and having their scenes of conflict being taken way too far (beyond the point of reason)? There's a sequence where these five grubby tankers sit down at a dinner table to eat with two German woman. It's drawn out, cruel, boring, and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Regardless, the cast in Fury is for the most part, pretty decent besides the clunky dialogue that they sometimes have to belt out. Sure, they are your typical war stereotypes with lousy attitudes, born to kill instincts, somewhat fake southern accents, and plenty of nasty battle scars. But their acting is way better than in any John Wayne war film (The Green Berets, ugh!) or any John Woo war film (Windtalkers, double ugh!). First off, there's Brad Pitt looking Kelly's Heroes chic in the title role as Sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. His character is the leader of the five-man crew and his performance sort of riffs off his Nazi-hating role in Inglorious Basterds. Is it entirely similar? Sort of. But where his Lieutenant Raine in ""Basterds"" was more of a cartoonish impersonation, this is something much deeper. Then we have young Logan Lerman playing effectively, the rookie US Army Private Norman Ellison. He's been a working actor for fourteen years (and he's only 22). Here's hoping this role is a sure-fire breakout one for him. And for the record, his frightened, bewildered military rook reminded me solely of Jeremy Davies as Tim Upham in ""Ryan"". Finally, we have Shia LaBeouf giving Fury its strongest performance. I've always thought of him as being extremely overrated as an actor. But when you put a mustache on him, he totally immerses himself into his role as a bible-thumping Technician 5th Grade. His Boyd Swan is a stultified standout. As for the other two thespians that make it up the gritty five-men crew, well we've got Michael Pena (an Ayer veteran) and Jon Bernthal. Their roles are equal parts token, bigoted, and misogynistic.<br/><br/>Performances and direction are key, but when Fury is about to reach its forgone conclusion, the film score actually becomes the main star. It's stirring and it deviates from the pedestrian battle scenes that clearly lack the brilliant technicality of the similar themed (and similar looking) Saving Private Ryan. As mentioned earlier, Fury is sadly, a unintentional popcorn flick rooted in the concept of being non- monumental. It will entertain you like any other vague action film. But the battle sequences depicted (and there are many) are not that compelling. I mean, they are violent but they are laughably rooted in midnight horror fare more than anything else. Case in point: an M4 Sherman tank runs over an already dead corpse and it's the equivalent of a motorcycle squishing a pop can. Also, the outside, facial imprint of a mutilated assistant bow gunner is shown in detail and it would make Hannibal Lecter (or even Nic Cage's Castor Troy from Face/Off) supremely jealous. Anyway, towards the end of Fury's exhausting third act, Pitt's Collier grabs a bottle of liquor, takes a long, slow drink out of it and says, ""that's better than good."" The same can't quite be said about this rollicking grimfest. It's just good enough so I'll roll with a three star rating."
"rbs546","7","0","4","21 October 2014"," Sargent Pitt and his howling tank crew
","I am a long time WW2 buff and any movie which is set during this time is one I will see no matter what. Set the story during WW2 and I am at the theater. Fury was a mixed experience for me partly because I am a WW2 history geek and some of the action was preposterous. Us WW2 geeks can get too picky and I really feel that I try not to be that way as much as I can when I see a movie made of this period, but Fury went off the rails. Yes, the Sherman tanks were authentic as were all the small arms and uniforms. They did a good job with many aspects of authenticity. <br/><br/>The movie went off the rails with Pitt and his tank. I understand that our American heroes have to be mostly bullet proof and that the Germans have to die like flies in idiotic assaults while being incapable of shooting accurately at our Heroes. Fury is an American movie made by Americans about Americans and I understand that, but Brad Pitt and his crew really joined the ranks of the comic books about WW2 that I used to read way back in the 1960's. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here though! There are many scenes in the movie I loved. Seeing a Tiger Tank in action was almost a religious experience for an old time WW2 geek. The movie has great dialog and indeed all the actors do a great job. It is tightly paced and does show that war is a very nasty business. So ultimately I do recommend it, but it really is mostly a comic book vision of the war. For those unfamiliar with my meaning about comic book war then google ""Sargent Rock"" or ""Sargent Fury and his Howling Commandoes"" to see my meaning. I grew up long ago reading those comic books and they were my first introduction to WW2 history so they have a place in my heart."

","I generally like to digest a film for awhile after I see it. Case in Point: ""There Will Be Blood"" The first time that I saw this masterpiece by P.T. Anderson, I thought that it was an average film. By the third time I watched it, I was blown away. Anyway, I caught this movie yesterday at a local movie tavern. There are some subtle nuances in this film, directed by David Ayer that are worth mentioning.<br/><br/>In an early scene, the allies endure a bombing run carried out by ME262 aircraft, the first jet fighters in the history of warfare. We never actually see the ME262s but the unmistakable whine of jet engines are brilliantly mixed into the audio portion of the film. Also, the audio mix of 30 cal, 50 cal, and and 75mm guns are among the best I've experienced in the cinema. I would not be surprised to see this movie nominated for Best Sound. This film makes you feel like you're there, from the cramped, fetid quarters of a Sherman tank to the open countryside of western Germany.<br/><br/>The battlefield choreography is on the same level as ""Saving Private Ryan"" with an intricate dance of American and Nazi tanks engaged in a ballet of death. The dramatic action is solidly presented as bonds of brotherhood are formed within this tight knit tank crew led by Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier played by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The screenplay is decent, the acting is good, the directing and cinematography are very good. Shia LeBeouf steps out of his usual comfort zone and turns in a very good performance as Boyd ""Bible"" Swan. There are also solid performances by Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena, and Logan Lerman."
"hfclement","7","0","4","20 October 2014"," The Sound and the Fury
","After months of having to wear the ""Fury"" shirts to advertise for the film at my theater, I finally sat down and watched the new World War II movie. <br/><br/>I was excited for this film, because unlike most war movies; that are propaganda and ""America F*CK YEAH"", Fury sold itself on being a realistic movie that not only focused on the horrors of the theater of war, but the psychological damage that affects the lives of our veterans. <br/><br/>The movie delivered; gore that was not for entertainment but a gritty reminder of what man can do to each other, and great acting that illustrated perfectly the constantly conflicted mind of the soldiers. <br/><br/>That being said the film is not without flaw. I wont spoil anything but those of you who have seen the film will know what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>In the second act there is a ""Breakfast"" scene that tries to tell us more about the characters and what they go through; and honestly this is a good scene- at times. At other times it feels like it is telling us more about what we already know, and starts to drag on. <br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are fantastic, along with the sound effects. Every gunshot or cannon blast has serious weight and makes you feel practically every recoil of every shot fired. The movie also gives brief exposition on tracer rounds; how they glow so you can see where you're firing. I don't know if historically they used red and green tracers in World War II, but at times the way they did it, I felt almost like I was watching Star Wars. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the film would have to be the unfortunate ending, which followed an absolutely amazing climax. Again, I wont spoil, but I just felt very upset with what I would call a cop-out. In a film that was trying to be an Anti Hollywood War Movie, they really went with the Hollywood ending; which was disappointing. <br/><br/>Overall Fury is a very entertaining movie, and one of the more better war flicks that I've seen recently."
