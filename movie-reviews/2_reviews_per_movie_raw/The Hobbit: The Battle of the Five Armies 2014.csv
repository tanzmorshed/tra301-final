"syes97","4","910","1150","11 December 2014"," A big disappointment.
","A couple of years ago, when I heard Peter Jackson would direct two more Middle-earth movies, I started crying out of excitement. Those two movies soon got changed into three and I was angry because I was convinced the story was too short for three three-hours-long movies. Despite the book being approximately 300 pages long, Peter Jackson & co. proved me wrong and managed to not include big parts of the books in these movies, even though there's more than 8,5 hours of total screen time. ""Disappointed"" is an understatement.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie was supposed to make me laugh at the serious scenes and sigh at the 'comic relief' scenes -basically everything Alfrid was in- but sadly it did. At least the 'funny' scenes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were subtle and less in number; BOTFA was supposed to be ""serious and dark"" and those silly, ridiculous scenes pretty much ruined that.<br/><br/>I have nothing negative to say about the acting though. The amazing cast of this trilogy did the best they could with the awful script they were given, and I'm thankful for that. It's not their fault that their character development was rushed because the movie was full of pointless Legolas Vs. Gravity scenes, dull Tauriel scenes who fell in love with Kili after having a conversation with him once or twice - same goes for Kili who fell in love with her and even gave her the token his mother, Dís, gave him.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie isn't even that it's full of badly done CGI or the big lack of proper character development. It's the fact that Tauriel, a badly written, impossible character made up by Peter Jackson & co., had more screen time than characters who were in the actual book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Beorn basically got fifteen seconds, if not less, screen time in the last installment of this trilogy. Most of the dwarfs from the Company barely got a line, and a LOT of things are left unexplained.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AFTER THIS LINE<br/><br/>For instance, what happened with Thranduil and the white gems? Did he ever get them back? <br/><br/>What happened to the gold? As a fan of the books I already know the answer, but the movie didn't really care to explain this important part of the story. Come on, the entire battle was about the gold. At least take a minute to explain how it got divided. <br/><br/>Where did those goats suddenly come from?<br/><br/>Why were the dwarfs wearing helmets when they were still inside the mountain, but had no helmets on when they actually went to war? <br/><br/>What happened to the people of Lake-Town? Why didn't the movie explain that Bard became King of Dale? If I had not read the book, I'd get really annoyed after watching this movie and not knowing what had happened to them.<br/><br/>What was the point of those ridiculously large worms and why did no one else /ever/ mention them before? And why were they gone after ten seconds? Did they ever get killed?<br/><br/>Why mention Legolas' mother and never explain anything about her at all?<br/><br/>Besides all these unanswered questions, there are certain things which bothered me more than all of those questions combined. 1. The Durins (Thorin, Kili, Fili) didn't get a funeral. In my opinion it's ridiculous to cut something like that out because they were basically the main characters. Which brings me to my second point. 2. I think Peter Jackson forgot that this story is called The Hobbit because Bilbo is supposed to be the main character, not Thorin. 3. Kili basically sacrificed himself for Tauriel which is unforgivable. In the actual story, Fili and Kili died defending Thorin in battle. Now the poor boy is dead because he had a crush on a badly written elf which also completely degrades the importance of Legolas and Gimli's friendship. <br/><br/>Let's not forget about the scene wherein Legolas grabs a flying bat, or when Bard uses his son Bain to shoot an arrow, which should make him fall but somehow it doesn't, or when Dain and Thorin decide to hug in the middle of a battle, or when Azog somehow manages to float and dramatically opens his eyes. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They are my favorite movies of all time and the reason I became a fan of Tolkien's works in the first place. It's sad that Peter Jackson desperately tried to link the Hobbit movies to the LOTR trilogy, because it's partly the reason why the Hobbit movies are so awful. If the unnecessary Dol Guldur scenes and the Tauriel storyline were skipped, every good part from the book which is now cut out would have easily fit in. I'm still giving this movie a 4 out of 10 though, because I absolutely love the cast and I think they did a brilliant job, especially Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman. Also, the very last scene was exactly like I imagined it would be, with Ian Holm's Bilbo and Gandalf knocking on the door. Loved that part. And ""The Last Goodbye"" by Billy Boyd was a beautiful way to end this movie and trilogy and made me tear up.<br/><br/>You might enjoy this movie if you really liked the first two -I didn't-, if you're into bad CGI or movies that look like video games or if you don't really care about Tolkien's Middle-earth and are content with a movie that doesn't do Tolkien and his characters justice at all. Otherwise you're probably someone like me and you'll leave the theater disappointed and grieving over the characters you love so much."

","Good but it was dragged on a lot. A lot of people didnt like this movie but nothing can ever come close to LOTR and it will always be in its shadow. If LOTR hadnt been made yet this would have been a great movie but unfortunately it wasn't up to the same standard and should have been but you have to remember Peter Jackson will always be one of the best directors ever.Overall I think that this was a good movie but wasn't up to the standard that it should have been"
"account-184-125611","1","612","838","13 December 2014"," I have no idea what happened
","I should begin by saying that I am a big fan of Tolkiens work, and have read LOTR and The Hobbit (and his other books) many times. I did enjoy the first trilogy, and thought that the changes Jackson did to the story were sometimes understandable, sometimes acceptable. However, I have no idea what happened with this movie and the whole second trilogy. <br/><br/>I am terribly disappointed, and I have no idea whether the changes were necessary simply to milk as much money as possible out of the whole project (spreading out the story to get 3 long movies, even if that meant adding many new things), or whether Jackson actually thinks he knows better than Tolkien... knows better how to explain things, how to connect the Hobbit to LOTR, or how to make a compelling story. <br/><br/>And yes, an adaption doesn't HAVE to be close to the book. However, if you mess with the story, if you include things that contradict the whole story, and if you essentially kill off the charm and warmth and concept of the book the movie is based on, things get dangerous.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was a book written for children, and while there are scenes in the trilogy that will definitely be fun for children (the dwarfs offering a lot of those kinda scenes), the violence and amount of killing and cut off heads make me wonder how suitable the movie really is. <br/><br/>However, watching this movie, and having seen the previous ones, these questions came up in my mind:<br/><br/><ul><li>Is it really FORBIDDEN to make a movie that Doesn't have a love-story involved? Isn't the Hobbit legendary enough, hasn't the book proved often enough it is a great story without a love-story included? Why did Jackson have to create Tauriel, the female ninja-elf and her love-story with a DWARF? Why did this have to be added? Would the film would have so much more terrible (hard to imagine) without a cliché and badly-written love-story that was added by Jackson and Walsh? - I sincerely think that, if the elvish race is capable of doing the things Tauriel and Legolas do in battle, not only could the small group of elven warriors Jackson added to the battle of Helms Deep in Two Towers have totally defeated the orcish army in less than 2 minutes... the history of Middle-Earth would be very difficult if they all could fight even remotely as well. Also, the fighting skills of Legolas in this movie are totally inconsistent to what he was able to do later on in LOTR. Considering that elves live incredibly long, the amount of time that passed between the Hobbit and Lotr is no explanation of why Legolas is a walking ""ninja-god"" in the Hobbit and much less superman-like in LOTR. - The incredible length of the scenes... it sincerely feels like the movie team was paid by the minutes of film they produced - The worms... I reckon they are based on a small comment by Bilbo, mentioning ""were-worms"" (a comment that has often riddled Tolkien-fans). Is this an attempt to somehow win over the fans of Tolkien-lore that feel insulted by Tauriel, the changes to the story, the goats, rabbits and deer-mounts, the fact that the WONDERFUL scene of Beorn appearing at the battle in the book and turning the tide, bringing relief and a change to the battle was kinda removed because the ninja-elves prove that Middle-Earth is located in the Matrix? - I really would feel bad for JRR Tolkien if he was able to watch these movies. He felt so much love for the world and characters he created, and put so much time, effort and feelings into his work. All this now was steamrolled over by the production team of this movie. After the rather respectful handling of LOTR, Jackson changed so much about the Hobbit that it feels totally disrespectful to the lifetime of work Tolkien put into his stories. </li></ul><br/><br/>What went wrong? Did Jackson think that, in order to attract and convince all those that haven't read the books, he would need to turn a wonderful book, written for children with a lot of warmth and charm, into a medieval Transformers (regarding amount of CGI, length of fights, lack of realism, character depth and taste)? <br/><br/>Did he really think this was in any way a respectful adaption of the work of a man who invested DECADES into writing, refining and perfecting his stories? Who, instead of focusing on just hours of battle, managed to create a world full of lore, charm, and wonderful characters?<br/><br/>I have no idea what went wrong behind the scenes. Have no idea whether the movie studio said ""Jackson, forget about what people love about the Hobbit. Turn it into three overlong movies for more profit, get us as many battles and skirmishes as you possibly can milk out of this, and just to make sure, add a love-story (we don't care how you do it), add a popular character from the previous trilogy so people will dig that. Oh yeah, the book was written for children, so make sure there is a song or two, bird poo on the nutty wizard who escaped from Hogwarts (Radagast), a dwarf with a pickax stuck in his skull, and funny bits that children love. But don't forget we want adults to watch it too, so please, add tons of action and cut-off heads, too... gotta hit all those demographics"". <br/><br/>I know a lot of Tolkien-fans apparently love this movie and the trilogy. One review even said ""...from a true fan"". Please don't think this is the case in general. I have grown up reading Tolkiens work, and I am simply stunned by how bad, how tasteless and disrespectful this trilogy is."
"Swisschick09","1","340","501","18 December 2014"," The Hobbit: Battle of the Dwarfs, Elves, Orcs, Humans, Trolls, Giant Worms, Pigs, Goats, Eagles, and Anything Else That Peter Jackson Thought Would Make Money
","I was as irritated as most people when I heard that Peter Jackson would split The Hobbit into three movies because it was obviously a decision based on nothing more than getting as much money as possible, but even I never imagined that he would stoop to making a movie like Battle of the Five Armies (a.k.a. Battle of the 25 Armies plus a couple of random giant mountain goats and a pig thrown in for good measure).<br/><br/>The CGI was as bad as something you would see in a B movie—even worse than the previous two Hobbit films. But even more noticeably, the script took a dive to rock bottom. Within the first half hour, such utterly laughable clichés as ""You make me feel alive,"" were spoken in a cheesy love scene that seemed like something straight out of Saturday Night Live, except that the audience was apparently supposed to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Shortly before the battle started, there were a few much-needed moments of comic relief, and I thought the film might possibly turn around. But all my illusions were soon shattered during the ten-minute scene where Thorin walks on top of the ice that Azog is floating under with his eyes open, following the orc and apparently waiting for him to break through it, when—surprise!—he does, and (spoiler for those who have not yet watched the ten-minute scene that made this obvious) kills Thorin. Alas. It might have been sad if I hadn't been waiting around for ten minutes knowing that he would get killed.<br/><br/>Things were looking grim for the dwarfs when who should appear? Our heroes the eagles, of course, who have managed to bail out the protagonists in every single movie of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Although I couldn't stop laughing during the scene where three dwarfs find completely random giant mountain goats with no riders in the middle of the battle and proceed to ride them up a mountain, the worst part of the movie was easily the ending. As if the movie isn't long enough, the audience is not only forced to watch Bilbo go all the way BACK to the Shire, they have to re-watch footage from Fellowship of the Ring! I knew it was a bad sign that Peter Jackson actually made a movie shorter than three hours (although it felt like six)—apparently, he had so little material for this movie that he had to re-use material from his original trilogy.<br/><br/>When Tauriel discusses love with the abominably clichéd line ""Why does it hurt so much?"" I think she described the feelings of most of the audience enduring the latest Hobbit movie."
"knowinglygotebola","2","561","847","27 December 2014"," Unequivocally Terrible
","Peter Jackson, with this new trilogy, which adapts a somewhat long children's fairy tale into a three-part action epic, each movie being three hours long and delving into completely irrelevant stories that are only hinted at in Tolkien's body of work, has really destroyed his reputation as the Tolkien translator. He will always live in the shadow of The Lord of the Rings, which is a sumptuous, beautiful, heartrending, thrilling masterpiece.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened. But Jackson sacrificed tone, realism, characterization, and story when he adapted The Hobbit. It is unrecognizable as work by the same director.<br/><br/>There are so many problems with this trilogy and this movie that is nigh impossible to list them. Nearly every scene is a real travesty, and the whole operation is an affront to the source material and fans of LOTR. The movies make hyper-violent beheadings and mass slaughter into orgies of staged action sequences and dumb gags. The orcs, which are now entirely computer-generated, are no longer compelling or realistic, and they are seemingly significantly more fearsome than in LOTR... It takes what the audience understands about Middle Earth and makes it BIGGER, in a completely childish overextension of the original story, to make things even more epic! Were-worms and enormous bats - these don't exist in the larger and more climactic battle in LOTR, but sure, they existed back then, right? Sure! Jackson also turns characters into absolutely ridiculous flat caricatures. Thranduil, the bourgeois blue-blood riding an elk, Dain, Thorin's cousin, who rests his enormous high- pitched Scottish girth on a wild boar, the she- elf who falls in love with a dwarf... It's stomach churning how Peter Jackson has combined a love for extreme violence and an eye for juvenile gags and unbelievable characters, and in a beloved, classic setting.<br/><br/>This movie, once again, extends Legolas past human bounds, past elven bounds, past the bounds of Newtonian physics, as he sprints, newly cyan eyes shining, on falling bricks and hangs from bats. We get to watch dwarfs behead seiging armies of orcs, who are impotent to the blows of the tiny Olympians. Again, oh no!, Middle Earth is doomed, the age of men is over, (cue slow-motion shots of Gandalf looking stricken, Thorin killing orcs with Sparta kicks)... The feel, the script, the look is all taken from LOTR and rehashed with this cast of cardboard characters, in a badly rendered world of excess and fancy.<br/><br/>I expected mature film-making for thoughtful audiences expecting real characters living in a real world with a compelling story, but obviously that was too much to expect.<br/><br/>If one of the important themes of The Hobbit is the rejection of greed, as we can see personified by Thorin, then is it hypocritical that Hollywood has churned out three abominably shallow and violent films out of The Hobbit for the public's consumption? I think so. I hate what these films represent, and what they could have done."
"rooee","5","384","589","14 December 2014"," The frustration of the 144 minutes
","What a difference an Extended Edition makes. For the first part we got some jolly embellishment. For The Desolation of Smaug we got bags more depth and character. For The Battle of the Five Armies, it may - I hope - be transformative. Because right now this feels like An Unfinished Journey.<br/><br/>It's as if, after all the complaints about splitting a pamphlet of a novel into three parts, Peter Jackson is playing a joke on us: This is what you get when you ask for Middle-earth-lite. Characters we've come to love or loathe arc into nothing; others (e.g. Beorn and Radagast) are given literally seconds of screen time; and for the first time in this prequel trilogy, a whole chapter (The Return Journey) is pretty much elided entirely.<br/><br/>I'd like to be clear on my admiration for what Peter Jackson has done with The Hobbit so far. For all The Lord of the Rings' mythic grandeur and complex world-building, there's a warm geniality and brisk impetus to these lovingly crafted films. And those qualities are married to a thematic depth missing from its bedtime story source. Home and borders are themes that have run through this trilogy, from Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) heartfelt declaration of solidarity at the end of An Unexpected Journey, to Kili's (Aidan Turner) fevered speech to Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) as she heals his wounds in Desolation, when they realise reconciliation is possible. Heck, I even like the addition of Tauriel - though her unsatisfying conclusion is perhaps typical of a final chapter that too often fails to tie up its loose ends.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off from precisely where the second ended, with the dread dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) descending upon Laketown. The citizens flee but nothing can stop the cataclysm - until a certain someone finds an ingenious way to pierce the beast. Then there's nemesis #2: Sauron (also Cumberbatch). We get to see some familiar faces face-off with this faceless monstrosity.<br/><br/>The story then enters its most intriguing phase: a kind of psychodrama involving Thorin (Richard Armitage) and his sickening relationship with gold and power. It's the one time we really glimpse that signature Jackson oddness, in a wonderful hallucinatory sequence where Thorin imagines he's sinking in a lake of gold.<br/><br/>The narrative follows the book fairly closely. This was, after all, the stage of the story where Professor Tolkien finally foregrounded politics and ethics and the machinations of characters ahead of adventure. The film is at its most successful in the quieter moments, as Thranduil (a subtle Lee Pace) ponders the duty of the elves; as Bard (a brooding Luke Evans) comes to the gate of the mountain to plead for peace; and as Thorin struggles with his ""dragon-sickness"" (i.e. greed), while Bilbo wrestles with the dilemma of what to do with a certain stolen gemstone.<br/><br/>Thorin was presented at first as this trilogy's Aragorn. But over time we've learned of the dangerous pride that ruined his grandfather. Thorin's hubris and arrogance is in stark contrast to Bilbo's very relatable and achievable traits of decency and humility. The gulf between them is intriguing and wisely plundered for drama. Armitage and Bilbo provide the best performances of the film - mostly internal; mostly in the eyes - and their farewell is one of the more moving moments in a trilogy that has largely prioritised humour over pathos.<br/><br/>The battle itself is undoubtedly impressive - great roaring hordes punctuated with spectacular giants - but in a sense it compounds the problem of the relatively truncated runtime. What was already the shortest Middle-earth film is rendered artificially even shorter by the fact that there's 45 minutes of virtually wordless fighting. By now we should all be braced for Super Legolas and his physics-defying fighting style. That reaches new heights here; as he sprints up a crumbling bridge like he's on the wrong escalator, it's like some sort of visual satire on the weightlessness of CGI.<br/><br/>With its last bastion and swarming armies, the titular battle resembles The Return of the King's Pelennor finale - yet that movie took breath between its showdowns. Galadriel vs. Sauron; Legolas vs. Bolg; Thorin vs. Azog... it's like we're watching someone finish off a video game but we're powerless to stop them skipping the tension- or character-building cutscenes. Moreover, the dubious editing decisions create some strange and jolting juxtapositions and tonal lurches, and negate the sense of time passing or of great distances being crossed.<br/><br/>The result is a film that really earns its status of ""theatrical cut"", insofar as it resembles many a boisterous blockbuster. This is fairly damning criticism for a Middle-earth movie, usually so luxurious and layered in its sense of a unique world. There's plenty of meat here - but where are the bones that hold it all together? 11 months away, perhaps."

","I was distinctly underwhelmed by the first two Hobbit movies, I thought they were good but just that ""Good"". They live in the shadow of the Lord Of The Rings movies and simply paled in comparison and so going into The Battle Of The Five Armies I expected more of the same.<br/><br/>According to both IMDb and the profit margin this was the most poorly received of the franchise, clearly people did not like the film by comparison. But as usual, I have to be different.<br/><br/>I consider this to not only be the best of the Hobbit franchise but also hot on the heels in quality as the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>The story culminates beautifully and if you can get past the many changes that were made you'll see the finale of a wondrous tale and a battle on screen that blew me away.<br/><br/>Once again the fantastic cast, stunning score, mind blowing effects and sheer beauty envelope you into the world of Middle Earth and I was gripped.<br/><br/>Yes its not flawless, but it is pretty damn close.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Amazing opening<br/><br/>Action scenes are brutal<br/><br/>James Nesbitt<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Still a lot of changes<br/><br/>Fili's death was poorly done"

","Well, I have to say that I'm glad that's over. The final movie was well worth the price of admission, which in my case was a free ticket to a preview screening.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be a stretch and as the final movie in a trilogy that was getting less interesting the further you went into the series, I left feeling extremely disappointed, and glad I didn't pay for the premium experience (3D, Imax, etc).<br/><br/>There was a little too much CG this time around, and it wasn't even all that great. Case in point two close scenes with a rider approaching and leaving were clearly CG...they couldn't even afford to use a real horse and rider? Come on...<br/><br/>The battle scenes went on way too long and in parts were even more ridiculous than the ""riding the broken wooden bridges all the way down to the bottom of the cavern..."" scene in the earlier edition of this series, and since the battle scenes were pretty much all that carried this movie, well...<br/><br/>Yes, this movie does have to be seen and it should be viewed on a big screen. However, in the opinion of this reviewer, waiting until it appears in a second run theatre will provide better value for money.<br/><br/>It's a movie that wraps up a series, but when compared to Peter Jackson's original LOTR work it pales and is as pale as an orc who has been working in the basement of Orthanc. At night. With the lights out."
"phil-walch","1","320","520","11 December 2014"," A horrible failure
","As a fan of the books first and the movies second I have willingly celebrated the achievement of Peter Jackson and his team for bringing this wonderful world to the screens.<br/><br/>Sadly on this occasion I cant feel quite so enthusiastic. Without a shadow of a doubt this is the worst blockbuster movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The excitement of waking up to the day having finally arrived to have one last cinema experience in Middle-Earth was soon turning into cinema nightmares.<br/><br/>A direction less mess from start to finish that only got worse as this movie went on, from the opening sequences of Smaug having his revenge on Lake-Town and Bard using his son as a make shift aim for his bow this simply descended into a ridiculous aimless shambles. <br/><br/>Our beloved Mr Bilbo Baggin's reduced to a secondary character of no weight or meaning was soon a small quibble compared to the elf- centric nonsense which ensued. Riding bats was bad enough before the ultimate insult of Legolas using a sword as a sort of remote control to crash a troll type enemy into a tower which becomes the setting for quite simply the worst piece of cinema ever used.<br/><br/>I could go on for ever, this films redeeming feature is that it ended. Christopher Tolkien was quoted saying that these movies had reduced the beauty and aesthetic of his fathers work to nothing and it had been absorbed into the absurdity of our time, and I believed he was wrong as he was talking about Lord of the Rings but his words are fitting for this monstrosity of overblown Hollywood Esq movie making.<br/><br/>I am certain that action fans think this is a fitting end to this adventure but as a fan of the books and the previous films I for one am offended by what was put in front of me. The beauty, emotion and heart of this wonderful story of a Hobbit that had an adventure was taken and ripped to pieces by terrible movie making.<br/><br/>A sad end for all the wrong reasons."
"arthur-goemans","5","248","401","10 December 2014"," An ambitious project, with a sad result
","In Jackson's defense: the project was ambitious to begin with. Turn 310 pages of children's literature into an epic Hollywood trilogy. Many debates go on about which movie was the best: the fairy tale, the one in-between, or the die hard-alike final. The sad truth is, that to a pure fan, they are, one by one, in their own unique ways, an abomination. <br/><br/>What can one expect, from a battle that starts in the third-to-last chapter in the book, but that goes on for 144 minutes in the film adaption? Granted, some of the battle scenes were innovative. In fact, the beginning, the cooperation between the elves and dwarfs, who had been ridiculing each other like Tom and Jerry at first, was most entertaining. For a few minutes, at most. But not for two hours. <br/><br/>Of course, the writers realized this. Therefore, these bombastic large- scale battles were altered with individual scenes. And this is where all touch with Tolkien faded. Not only were the action scenes needlessly absurd, (I think of Legolas jumping from one falling stone to another, of Azog opening his eyes in an o-so-melodramatic fashion we've seen way too many times, and of Brad's ridiculous carriage scene) but the individual stories weren't nearly as grasping as they should have been. <br/><br/>And this can be forgiven for Thranduil and his son, in an unsuccessful ending scene, that was empty of any convincing emotions, in an attempt to make a bridge to the Lord of The Rings series. This can even be forgiven for Thorin, the classic anti-hero who goes mad after barely a few days of being around his treasure, but realizes his true destiny just in time, only to die an honorable death, in order to obtain forgiveness for his 20-minute-earlier sins. But this can't be forgiven for the Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins is a supernumerary in his own movie. And that is inexcusable.<br/><br/>All fans of Tolkien will probably watch this. The feeling I'm left with, is gratefulness for the untouchable Lord of the Rings series. They can never be taken away. ""The Hobbit"" falls short right there where the Lord of the Rings is most powerful: loyalty to Tolkien. The trilogy did not fail because it grasped for Hollywood-greatness, it failed because Tolkien would watch it and say ""What a fine movie! Where'd you get the idea?"""
"probably-nope","2","121","195","19 December 2014"," A Lazy, Cynical Retread of LOTR
","I first experienced The Hobbit at the age of 4, when my mother read it to me, and I have been a Tolkien fan ever since. And I have been generally disappointed with Peter Jackson's take on The Hobbit since the beginning. Jackson abused the mythos, struck out trying to turn a lighthearted children's book into a trio of Serious Epics, and created bloated, endless action scenes that did nothing to legitimately advance the plot (before this film, the barrel-battle and the golden dragon-dip were the most egregious). I honestly could not think of a single scene which was not addressed more effectively in the cheap 1970s cartoon. And I found it painfully obvious that Jackson was trying to cheat his way to success by hitting all of the same notes as he did in the Lord of the Rings films, whether or not they made sense in this context (the character Tauriel exists solely to be Arwen; the character Alfrid exists solely to be Wormtongue).<br/><br/>That last point is far and away my greatest complaint about the final effort. I almost didn't believe what I was seeing: the ridiculous, eternal Battle of Five Armies wasn't just reminiscent of Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith, it WAS those battles, shot for shot. Jackson literally plopped the same choreography from his good trilogy into this film and called it done. It's bad film-making, it's lazy, and it's just an inexcusable, cynical cash-grab. For instance:<br/><br/>-In the lead-up to Helm's Deep, a scared, desperate people streamed (left to right) over barren countryside into the fortress. In BOFA, a scared, desperate people streamed (left to right) over barren countryside into the ruins of Dale. <br/><br/>-Characters hidden on a rocky outcropping witness the gates of a great enemy fortress open. A massive army streams out, while its general urges them onward from above. Is that Frodo and Sam at Minas Morgul or Legolas and Tauriel at Gundabad? <br/><br/>-We had a sweeping shot of ranks of spear-bearing Uruk Hai before the walls, who part to allow a mounted leader to advance menacingly through their ranks. Now we have a sweeping shot of spear-baring ELVES before the walls, who part to allow a mounted elf-king to advance menacingly through their ranks. In both cases, we have shots up at the outnumbered defenders peering down from their hastily rebuilt fortress. In both cases, a prematurely fired arrow opens the hostilities. <br/><br/>-A berserker carrying a bomb ran urgently towards the culvert, leaping headfirst to bring down the wall. Now we have a troll with a ram on his head, who runs urgently and leaps headfirst to bring down a wall. The Uruk Hai/orcs following stream together through the narrow hole, then fan out.<br/><br/>-Gandalf rides (right to left) up the steep, winding streets of both Minas Tirith and Dale to warn and rally the citizens.<br/><br/>-Characters say ""Send forth the legions"", ""Kill them all,"" ""The Age of the Orc has begun"". In both trilogies.<br/><br/>-Before, Legolas slid on a shield (left to right) down a staircase to save Gimli, using the shield to impale an Uruk. Now, Bard rides a wagon (left to right) down a hill to save his children, using the cart to bowl over a troll. <br/><br/>-When All is Lost at Helm's Deep, a heroic younger character confronts the aging king, urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king agrees, and the small band charges out in one final desperate effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The burly character shouts ""To the King!"" The attacking Uruks are taken aback by the blinding sun and bowled aside. When All is Lost at Erebor, a heroic younger character confronts the aging king, urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king agrees, and the small band charges out in one final desperate effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The burly character shouts ""To the King!"" The attacking trolls are taken aback by... well, nothing, apparently... and bowled aside. Yeah, this one is EXACTLY the same, without even an effort to hide it. <br/><br/>-In ROTK, Legolas makes his way to the head of a Mumak and brings it down by piercing its brain from above, causing it to crash into another Mumak, resulting in an earth-shaking collapse. In BOFA, Legolas makes his way to the head of a troll (which seems to have morning-stars for feet) and brings it down by piercing its brain from above, causing it to crash into a town, resulting in an earth-shaking collapse. <br/><br/>-In a one-on-one showdown outside Minas Tirith, Eowyn faces the Witch-King, who is armed with a sword and an improbable mace. In a one-on-one showdown above Dale, Thorin faces Azog, who is armed with a sword-arm and an improbable mace.<br/><br/>I could cite more examples, but I'm bumping up against the word limit. <br/><br/>The acting in The Hobbit is generally solid -- Martin Freeman in particular is excellent. But Peter Jackson either ran out of ideas or didn't bother trying. This film is a bloated, self-plagiarizing mess, and the only worthwhile moments are those pulled unaltered from the book."

The Hobbit trilogy is crap.<br/><br/>It's little more than a long list of invented battles and love stories to attract a widest possible audience, as well as loads of idiotic storyline to make the story slide into the Lord of the Rings movies as smooth as an Elven ass. <br/><br/>I understand that some adaption is required from book to screen, but when dealing with a book more or less only surpassed by the Bible and the IKEA catalogue, one should tread carefully.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.

","I have read the Hobbit twice. I love the LOTR trilogy of films, they're my favorite films ever. I was initially disappointed with the first Hobbit film because my expectations were set so incredibly high from the first three. Having watched it again recently, I can see that it's a great film. A lot of people are upset with this film because it isn't the book. All I have to say is that books and films are entirely different art forms. If you cut and paste the hobbit onto a movie, you get a very bad film. Anyone can be a critic, not anyone can bring one of the most beloved stories of all-time to life on the big-screen. What Peter Jackson has done, along with all of the very talented people who spent years and years of their lives making these film, is nothing short of brilliant. We should be thanking this man for what he has done, not criticizing every little thing we didn't like about the films. You can't please everyone. Also worth noting...The Hobbit was written for kids and it's pretty silly a lot of the time. The trilogy wasn't written for another 20 YEARS and the whole idea of Middle Earth as we know it today didn't exist. So had Tolkien known he was going to make this little kids book into an epic saga, it's not a stretch to think that he would have made some changes to it. In short, the movies HAD to be different from the books to make them entertaining, cinematically compelling and to keep them true to the spirit of what MIddle Earth and the LOTR trilogy are today. Jackson, and all of the people working on these films are the most passionate fans of Tolkien you could ever meet, heck, they spent the better part of 2 decades making 6 films for us to enjoy. So I am going to say, BRAVO!! Peter Jackson!! Okay, but seriously...I like Tauriel but the whole deal with her and Kili was very awkward. The whole romance is smothered on pretty thick. But I'm not going to let that ruin a fantastic film and a fantastic trilogy for me, and I hope you don't either!! Don't expect the book, don't expect anything and you will have your mind blown. :)"

","* This Review contains a few spoilers*<br/><br/>The Battle of Five Armies... The last part of a poor trilogy, it made me exited and gave me hope, because maybe it could be like the Return of The king... but no.<br/><br/>This movie was an embarrassment for Peter Jackson, the man who just got himself a star on the street of Hollywood. This man turns out to be just like all the other Hollywood directors, a money wolf. This trilogy was made for nothing more than money, why 3 parts, why?! And half of the book isn't even concluded in the movies.<br/><br/>A 260 page book spread in 9 hours in movie could be something awesome, but it didn't. it became horrible. Something that annoyed me : Added characters, no character development, no emotional moments, to many ''you got to be kidding me'' moments, no Dwarfs, Elve or men die in the battle. Where is there brutality of the LOTR? Where in the most epic battles of movie history everything took place : grief, death, epicness, sadness, moments of smiling while having a hard time trying not to let go of some tears, and above all, the fact that you don't know how many of the good people will survive. Well in TBOFA nobody died, expect orcs (CGI monsters). <br/><br/>And than some other things that made no sense, and are left out. What happens with the Arkenstone, who becomes king under the mountain, where does Tauriel go, what happens to the dwarve, what happens to the lake people, and what about the gems of the Elves?! Isn't that what this movie was all about?? How hard was it to include 15 minutes more and tell this. And why did Peter Jackson change the story about the death of Fili and Kili? Where was the love of brother ship? that's what I liked about the book, it was about love for your brothers, not about the love of a stupid made up elve girl. Oh and above all, Middle- Earth looked life an awful ugly world, while it's supposed to be an amazing wonderful world. Peter Jackson messed up big time<br/><br/>I think this is enough for you guys to get why this movie was horrible compared to what it could've became, a story rank worthy to the LOTR movies.<br/><br/>2/10, 1 star because it was Middle-Earth, and 1 star because Bilbo played an amazing role (oh yeah speaking of Bilbo, he looked like a side character, isn't he the main character?)"
"FeatherlessBiped","3","255","454","21 December 2014"," One word: travesty
","Before seeing _The Battle of the Five Armies_ today, I told people, ""The first two films lacked fidelity to the book, but this one should be better."" I figured Jackson wouldn't have to add lots of extraneous invented action scenes because the final third of the book contained plenty of action.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Unnecessary invented characters from the previous films continued to take up screen time in this one, and many new ones were added. Tolkien wouldn't recognize a bunch of grand-scale evildoers or various ""good guys"" whose relationships were supposed to tug at our hearts, though they turned my stomach instead.<br/><br/>The additions included plenty of trite dialogue. When one invented character, in a scene made from whole cloth, was shown weeping over a loved one and asking ""Why does it hurt so much?"", I just about tossed my Junior Mints.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a character largely responsible for turning the tide in the book's Battle of Five Armies (note the lack of a ""the"" before ""Five"") was shown in the film, without explanation, for about three seconds. Blink and you might miss it.<br/><br/>When one baddie was apparently killed, I thought, ""If he suddenly jumps up and starts fighting again, I'm leaving."" Too bad I didn't follow through on my threat after that excruciatingly predictable plot twist.<br/><br/>Did I mention that Dain, confronting the elf warriors, came across as some nightmare parody of John Cleese performing ""The Lord of the Fawlty Towers""?<br/><br/>I could go on, but ""travesty"" is about the kindest word I can use for this mass of claptrap. I now fear that Jackson will film _The Silmarillion_, turning it into yet another tawdry, over-the-top CGI fest."
"lightningnbreeze99","10","57","93","19 September 2015"," Movie ratings are so subjective...
","Although I really enjoyed the first and second one, I didn't want to watch the third one because pretty much everyone I knew said it was disappointing. Well I watched it today and was so disappointed in myself for giving too much credit to what other people think over what Peter Jackson presented through the film's two predecessors. The film was really fast paced and didn't have any dragging lagging boring scenes. There was always something going on that had my full attention, not to mention very emotional and memorable ones that were hard to find in films that I've watched over the past 2 years. Everyone comes from different backgrounds so obviously not everyone's going to like or dislike the same movie, but I thought this one really had depth and I regret not seeing it in theaters. Peter Jackson's films only get better and better IMO."
"luke-a-mcgowan","1","94","160","27 December 2014"," Never should have been made
","I despise Desolation of Smaug, so I can assure you I went in with minuscule expectations. Even those were shattered. I have disregarded the book in this review, because the book was ruined back in Desolation of Smaug. I watched this as a movie, ignoring everything I knew about how it was meant to go. <br/><br/>Picking up exactly where Desolation left off, Smaug comes to his fiery end within ten minutes of the film's beginning, which only serves to highlight the terrible decision to split the film into three and to make the cuts where they did. We then spend roughly forty minutes waiting for the infamous 45 minute battle scene to begin, and then plead for it to end. Unlike the gripping, tense and endlessly entertaining battle sequences in LOTR, these CGI-heavy storms contained no sense of danger or drama. The laws of physics are suspended to the point where most people in the audience were laughing, and the hideous and unexplained fan service gives the impression that the film was directed by a 11 year old boy with some magic markers. <br/><br/>Once again the screenwriters run out of Tolkein to fill 2 and a half hours, so invent their own, and the result is cringe-worthy dialogue about love. At the film's conclusion, barely any character is given any resolution save for Legolas (who doesn't appear in the book at all) and to a degree Bilbo himself. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman performs well as Bilbo, nailing nearly every scene he is in. However, nearly every big name actor in the film collects around 2 minutes of screen time (everyone from Blanchett to Connelly) and most of them feel as if they are going through the motions. Blanchett in particular is given a particularly cringe-worthy part and I hope she was paid well. An unrecognisable and CGI-heavy Billy Connelly gives probably the least inspired performance in the film as Dain, whose role is so heavily reduced that it probably doesn't matter. Ryan Gage's Alfrid is so painfully unnecessary and uninspired that he brings down the movie in every scene he appears. <br/><br/>Each of the film's deaths is anti-climactic and changed for the worse. The Lord of the Rings trilogy features some of the best cinematic deaths ever - Boromir, Theoden, The Witch-King, the Cave Troll, the Balrog/Gandalf. None of these fare even close.<br/><br/>Most unforgivingly, the film pathetically pretends to be Lord of the Rings. We first see hints of it when Saruman, Galadriel and Elrond storm into Dol Goldur and Galadriel reprises her role as Green Witch from Fellowship, but it becomes far more blatant later on. BOFA blatantly steals the LOTR Oscar-winning score, it recreates key scenes from Two Towers but replaces the terrifying Uruk-hai with generic CGI white orcs, it sends Legolas off to find Aragorn (which makes no sense) and the final scene is literally taken word for word from the Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, please AVOID this film if you have an appreciation for film, Tolkein books, the laws of physics or practical effects. Watch only if you want a demonstration of CGI excess, a Martin Freeman performance (which you can find elsewhere) or are a prisoner whose only escape is by watching this film. Otherwise, please just watch the Lord of the Rings instead."

"hanna-pirfano","5","140","246","11 December 2014"," A disappointing mess of a film, only made bearable because of a very few scenes.
","When I went to the theater, I was filled with hope, excitement and joy. I'm the biggest Hobbit fan I know(I adore the movies, the book, and collect all the trinkets and art books I can.), and since the Desolation of Smaug had been a quite good movie, and I had heard Peter Jackson claim this film was going to be even more serious and thriller-y, I naturally assumed it was going to be a dark, thrilling movie that had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>This was not the case.<br/><br/>The movie started with an extremely anticlimactic scene that killed suspension of disbelief, and continued on the same track. Smaug, while a masterpiece of animation, was disappointing, as was most of the movie. The film continued, and I was more and more confused- this is not the movie I had expected. It lacked a good plot, was confusing even to me(who has read the book and the production books five times over), and COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT IT WANTED TO BE.<br/><br/>One second, it was comedy, and while some scenes were amusing enough, some were just cringe-worthy(Peter Jackson's horrendous comic timing making itself known), but these scenes completely ruined the atmosphere of the film, making it dull and bland instead of tense and exciting. <br/><br/>The only saving grace this piece of badly directed trash had were the scenes with the King of the Dwarfs, Thorin, succumbing to madness, and his relationship dynamic with Bilbo(who had very little screen time for a film about him) These scenes were brilliant, mostly because of the heartfelt and excellent acting of Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman.<br/><br/>Sadly, even though one feels these scenes should be in center, the movie chooses to focus on dull battle sequences. The scenes that are truly good are hastily skipped over, and we move to classic bad PJ comedy and awful battle scenes. While in Lord of The Rings there were some goofy battle scenes, this movie almost seems like it's trying to make a parody of itself. I did not find many problems with Legolas's gravity defying skills in Desolation of Smaug, but here, it makes you wonder if Middle Earth is actually the moon in regards to the gravity-free atmosphere.<br/><br/>Other than the terrible battle scenes, we have the focus on a romance plot so bad it almost makes me blush of second-hand embarrassment. It's like the movie is trying to emulate elements from Titanic, but fails miserably. The romance was so forced it might as well be a spoof, and was a complete waste of a female character. I am in favor of female characters being added to the story. In fact, I love it. But here? It is so blatantly clear Tauriel was only added to be Kili's love interest, and it hurts my heart to see female character's butchered in this way.<br/><br/>(And that's not even mentioning the atrocity that was making Galadriel, who is the strongest person in middle-earth, laying on the floor sobbing and waiting for her strong male wizard companions to help her.) <br/><br/>The death scenes of some of the characters were underwhelming, except for one, which was emotional enough to make me give this movie my almost-approval, but it is just as many of us feared: This movie gives no screen time or attention to dwarfs who are not Thorin Oakenshield and Kili(we don't even see them fight in this movie. They just stand in the background.)<br/><br/>So, to sum it up, if you expect a thrilling experience, you're out of luck. The movie was generally poorly paced, poorly directed, with really awful CGI, conflicts that were created, solved and sometimes forgotten in the blink of an eye, and an excess of Legolas.(WHO IS LITERALLY JUST THERE TO LOOK PRETTY AND DO STUNTS.). It is a worth watch if you're a fan, but only for a couple of scenes that the director seemed to have deemed unimportant despite them being the only reason this movie was even worth the name. Tasteless jokes, awful fight scenes, terrible cheesy romance that puts the notebook to shame, and more questions than answers in the end. Peter Jackson truly did not deliver, even though it's clear he tried. <br/><br/>He simply tried too much."

","Watching Lord of the Rings I cared about the hobbits and the companions. Here I never cared about the dozen guys in Halloween costumes or the dwarf who looked like a human leading man but lacked the charisma of Aragorn or the hobbit who looked like a human and lacked the charisma of Frodo.<br/><br/>The movie was actually better than I remembered though I did fast forward through some of the worst of the CGI. Bard was almost interesting and the first hour felt like a movie generally. At some point it became a montage of video game cuts scenes until say the last 20 minutes. When compared to Lord of the Rings, it is amazing to think that the same creative team was behind it. I get the sense that much like Lucas, Jackson got lucky once and never will be able to come close to his masterwork."
"CptMacAwesome","5","344","644","10 December 2014"," A well-done send-off to a decent film series
","So... That was The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The final film in Peter Jackson's six-film Middle-Earth saga.<br/><br/>This may just be Jackson's most ambitious film yet. It has to work as a standalone film, it has to be the final part of a trilogy, and it has to be the bridge between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings films. Ambitious?<br/><br/>Let me state for the record that I'm an enormous fan of the Lord of the Rings films. I consider them to be the best trilogy of all time. However, I didn't really have that same vibe with the Hobbit films. I admit, when I heard they would begin making more Middle-Earth films, I was excited. The thought of returning to Middle-Earth was exhilarating.<br/><br/>Then, in December 2012, the first Hobbit film has its release. I was disappointed. It may have been because I didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't what I had hoped it would be. There was too much goofy humor, and it was close to putting me to sleep at times.<br/><br/>Come December 2013, The Desolation of Smaug is released. Looking back, I think that this film was intended to split audiences. This film deviated so much from its source material that, at times, I forgot what I was watching. Suddenly, there was a Dwarf-Elf love story, suddenly Thorin's company of Dwarfs split up, suddenly they're fighting Smaug, and then the film ends.<br/><br/>Now, here we are in 2014, with the conclusion to the Hobbit films, The Battle of the Five Armies. This film literally starts off where Desolation left off, with Smaug destroying Lake- Town. A breathtaking sequence. Beautiful visuals remind us that Thorin's actions will bring some devastating consequences. <br/><br/>However, the sequence loses me a bit by cutting away to the Master of Lake-Town and Alfrid, who I guess were meant to be comic relief, but I ended up wishing they'd die. Not because I didn't like their characters, but because I thought they were so annoying and distracting from the overall experience.<br/><br/>After a very Lord of the Rings-esque recovery scene, we meet Bilbo and Thorin's half company of Dwarfs at Erebor, and you can tell Thorin has changed. He's become sick with the aptly named Dragon Sickness, and Bilbo can tell that something isn't quite right about him. Little do they know that Azog (Who is, like, the evilest thing ever.) is marching towards Erebor, as well as the Elvenking 'Mr. Fabulous' Thranduil, is also moving towards Erebor, resulting in a literal clash of the titans.<br/><br/>What we end up with is an enormous battle, so large in fact, that it shares title with the film. And now is also when Peter Jackson displays his qualities and faults as a film director. He manages to makes his battles very intimate, despite the chaos that you see on the screen. However, he has shown a particular love for goofy stuff, and after three films, he finally almost got it. There still is goofiness for people who crave that, but for the rest of us it comes off as dumb excuses for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>But damn, this film has a lot of CGI. And some of it doesn't even look finished! Some sequences looked like video game cutscenes at best, and at points I had to take off my 3D glasses because I had no idea what was happening. Note to self: Never see a 3D film again.<br/><br/>However, all things must come to an end, and in this film, there are so many cases that are left unsolved, almost to the point where it baffled me. We're introduced to Thorin's cousin, Daín Ironfoot, who I'm pretty sure is a CGI version of Billy Connolly. Suddenly, he's gone, and we're left wondering where he went, and we never see what happens to them again. Same thing happens to Beorn, Tauriel, Bard, and *sigh* Alfrid, just to mention a few.<br/><br/>That's this film's main problem; It opened too many doors without shutting them. Does that analogy make sense? There's almost no resolution to any of the characters except for Bilbo, masterfully portrayed by Martin Freeman, by the way. For a film series called The Hobbit, he doesn't appear nearly enough. I'm looking at you, Tauriel! Get out of the frame!<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a worthy final installment in The Hobbit Trilogy, and a film I consider to be the best of the three.<br/><br/>Pros: Great acting, well-directed battle sequences, Howard Shore (Need I say more?), good visuals.<br/><br/>Cons: Lack of resolutions, obnoxious characters, too much CGI, some cheesy moments.<br/><br/>All in all a fine holiday film. If you enjoyed the previous Hobbits, you'll like this one."

","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is my favourite movie of all time. But my passion for middle earth doesn't stop there, I am obsessed with this world and in love with the vastness and complexity of its characters and stories. So, did I like the movie? Yes, a lot. Was the movie actually good? That would be more debatable. Before I go into the thick of this review, I just want to remind that I really like the movie, but if it seems that I am highlighting only the negative points it is because they are so frustrating.<br/><br/>Everything that is wrong with this and the other two Hobbit movies are basic filmaking decisions that are wrongly taken. This is to say that Peter Jackson's brilliance remains, he gave proof in all of these movies that he knows how to direct his films. There is nobody in the world that knows how to stage a battle like him. He takes us through amazing visual choices and complex staging flawlessly. The fluency of everything is magnificent, thanks to an amazing pace. Despite me thinking about the wrongs of it, I could not help but be flattered by the sheer epicness of this. I was genuinely on the edge of my seat, I felt amazing tension at times, I really loved the experience and was attached to the very end to the characters. Every one of them. The duels were fantastic, it was all riveting. But there were simply decisions that were made early on that took away from it.<br/><br/>Why are these movies shot digitally! Other than looking very bad it does not make sense. The whole 48fps, 3D, digital shooting was a mistake to being with. These films shot have been shot on film, just like the Lord of the Rings, it would have given them a thousand points more. The whole CGI is just too much. There isn't any of the practicality from the first movies and it shows so bad. Digital masses of everything that have no weight and look way too bad for a 500million$ production. I am convinced that by shooting on film and loosing half of the CGi in favour of practicality would make these three movies ten times better. To this point by removing half of the CGI we could also remove all the extravagant madness that comes from it. There are scenes or monsters in this film that would have never even passed first draft back in the Lord of the Rings, because they are so weird and out of the moment (talking for example about that Legolas moment in this one, those of you who have seen the movie understand me). Other than this you do not waste time on characters we don-t give the F***K about! I am really OK with making three movies out of the Hobbit, you know if it's the last time we visit Middle Earth we might as well throw in everything that Tolkien wrote that could fit in. But lets not waste time on Alfrid or the Governor! You know three two/hour movies could have really made it! Anyways, I don't want to indulge in my frustration too much because it would be a waste of time. Go see the movie if you-re a fan like me, you won-t be disappointed more than you were with the other movies. They are really good, but they could have so easily been f****g great!"

","The Hobbit Trilogy will forever be one of those classic polarizing film trilogies where you either love em' or you hate em'. Were they as good as The Lord of the Rings? Hell NO (and it was unfair for anybody to judge them based on a different trilogy based on better books). Were any of the Hobbit movies unwatchable or boring, though? Definitely not. The first one may have been a little slow in the first 40-50 minutes, but after that it turned into a really good story. The fact that all 3 of them are positive on Rotten Tomatoes proves that they were under-appreciated by many Middle-Earth fans. Some people acted like we should be outside Peter Jackson's house with torches and pitchforks. They weren't THAT bad, and they also weren't Lord of the Rings-award winning-ridiculously awesome either.. They were good, not great. B+ work from Peter & Company. <br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies was set up to be the best in the trilogy, but it did fall slightly short of what it could have been. I only had 3 problems with the film (and all 3 are forgivable because what I saw was still epic and satisfying). 1) One of the 5 armies from the book is completely missing from the battle. The orcs fight alongside a large army of wolves in the book, but they chose to just have 2 armies of orcs fighting alongside a handful of trolls, some bats, and maybe a few wolves. I assume the blu-ray extended version might include a lot more wolves/wolf-riders wreaking havoc. 2) Beorn played a HUGE part in turning the tide of battle in the book, but in the movie we only saw like 10 seconds of him fighting. I was hoping to see AT LEAST a minute of him slaying orcs/wolves left and right. 3) Most of the trolls were as large and fearsome as we would expect, but 3 trolls appear at different times in the film and looked about as stupid/cartoonish as they could be. Maybe those trolls were just supposed to be realistically deformed, but they were still distracting to me. <br/><br/>Those 3 minor problems aside, I still think it was a really good film. It started out with one of my favorite chapters from the book (""Fire and Water"") and we've been looking forward to that ever since Desolation of Smaug ended with the dragon flying straight to Lake Town. Then we got to see the White Council battling Sauron and his ringwraiths. After that there was some good character development, drama, and lots of action. The actors did a very fine job with their roles (especially Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman), and the visual effects were stunning. Overall, I enjoyed this return to Middle- Earth and I thank Peter & Company for what they've done with the entire Middle-Earth Saga."
"devanshsharma50","10","166","322","1 December 2014"," Peter Jackson has done it......A fitting finale to a legendary saga
","I must admit that when I saw ""An Unexpected Journey"" I was disappointed. It is probably one of my least favourite movies. It was then that I thought that Peter Jackson had lost his touch. But I realised how awfully wrong I was when I saw ""The Desolation of Smaug"". It was an incredibly enjoyable movie and became one of my favourites in the middle-earth saga. The Desolation of Smaug ended on a cliffhanger when Smaug flies to lake town to destroy everything. So, when the movie ended, I thought whether I would be able to wait another year for the finale or not.<br/><br/>When I entered the theatre, it was with high-expectations though I was a little put down due to the fact that the running time of the movie is 144 Mins. The movie started where the previous installment had ended. Scenes of epic destruction and fire in the lake-town are brilliantly shot. I must say that 3D is somehow a hindrance, though there are some moments where 3D adds magic to the movie, but also at some places it fails to be effective.So here we are, Bard kills Smaug with the Black Arrow but lake-town is completely destroyed. Thorin takes shelter in Erebor and refuses to pay any heed to the troubles of the men of lake- town. Also, Gandalf is rescued not by giant eagles, but surprisingly by Lady Galadriel, Saruman and Lord Elrond. On the other hand, Bilbo smuggles the Arkenstone out of Erebor and gives to Bard. He asks him to use the stone to negotiate with Thorin. Then there is a small surprise, I don't want to disclose it at the moment and we move into the 35-40 min long battle which is surprisingly good. I think that if Peter Jackson wasn't the director, this battle would not work because only he can shoot the war in such a way that is both effective and jumpy. Also some imp main characters die and this adds an emotional depth to the movie.<br/><br/>The battle leaves us on the corner of our seats and finally the movie ends with Bilbo arriving back in Shire, also with a few shots of Ejiah Wood. So, the ques arises "" Is the movie good?"" You bet it is. It is one of the best blockbusters of the year and in the winter category might stand second only to Interstellar.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman has done excellent work as Bilbo Baggins and shown us that his acting talents are not limited only to Sherlock. Ian Mckellen is refreshingly good as Gandalf but Evangeline Lilly and Benedict cumberbatch's voice-over steals the movie. Though it is the shortest movie in the series, it is enough, satisfactory and not remotely boring. I am looking forward to watch the movie once again. Believe me folks this is worth your bucks. It is not just a movie, it is a cinematic experience even non-hobbit fans will enjoy. Highly Recommended.....don't miss this one."

","Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy has been pretty troubled so far. And though Desolation of Smaug was a HUGE improvement from An Unexpected Journey, it still lacked the magic and excellence of The Lord of the Rings. However, after seeing Battle of the Five Armies, I can say that PJ definitely upped his game. It was a brilliant, fitting way to end the Middle-Earth saga, and is easily the best in the trilogy. It seemed much more thought out than the previous too and had great emotional depth throughout. As for the battle itself? It may be long, but let me tell you, it is EPIC. After Helm's Deep, I didn't think Peter Jackson would be able to get any better. I was pleasantly surprised. Though a lot of it is CGI, the battle is carried out perfectly. The fighting, effects and acting are brilliant and everyone who worked on the film deserves a big pat on the back. BOFA is also very emotional, and had me biting back tears (Those who have read the book will understand why). Peter Jackson and his team really did themselves proud with this one, and deserve all the praise they are getting. It is a beautiful, touching and completely EPIC way to end the series. Goodbye, Middle-Earth."

","I love the first 5 movies by Peter Jackson and this completely disappointed me...The battle could have been much more epic but the problem lies with all of the extra plot lines Peter Jackson decided to throw in (that weren't in the book). Because of those, the movie was forced to focus on tying up any loose ends dealing with those added characters and plots. So, the movie didn't do justice to just how important of a battle this was in Middle Earth history.<br/><br/>Also, what happened to the elves half way through the battle? In the book, there are supposed to be over 1000 of them. And they don't retreat in the middle of battle.<br/><br/>And why did Jackson leave out Beorn?? So Thorin could get all of the glory? Dumb..."

","Movie is so bad it made me write a review!!!<br/><br/>There is only one strong moment in this movie and it is the White council fight in Dol Guldur. This is epic and somehow similar as the books.<br/><br/>Otherwise the movie is complete failure and it rapes Tolkien's book. 1. Tauriel and Fili subplot is so out of place that people in cinema exchanged stares. 2. Whole script is written by a five year old. It just doesn't make any sense, many things needed for plot appeared out of nowhere - bell, chamois, Orc command post and so on. How armies from around 100 miles got to the mountain in one day... 3. fight sequences are like from matrix combined with really bad computer game. choreography and lucky accidents are extremely unrealistic. Ninja Legolas made some people in cinema burst into laughter (and me to tears of desperation) 4. The movie isn't based on book. It isn't even loosely based on it. It is like World War Z - only the title and few scenes are the same.<br/><br/>Sorry for my English, I just had to get my frustration out..."
"ChrEberle","1","169","334","4 January 2015"," A work, worthy of Sauron!
","This ""movie"" is definitely worthy of being thrown into the fire! My in-laws gave us the tickets (to be fair - we would have been so stupid and payed for it ourselves... so... there you go: We FINANCED further abominations like this!) Whatever happened to good, decent filmmaking? This was a terrible, over-the-top, soulless WAR MOVIE!!! It feels as numb and un-emotional as a general anesthetic. There were main-characters dying? Oh, true... well, who cares? Remember anyone the death scene of Sean Bean in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (yes, he always dies - but he died really well in that one) Oh, or who the F cares about some CGI-Mega-Orc fighting a dwarf on ice Flash Gordon Style? And also: Did he touch the ground of that frozen lake before he jumped back to ruin some more or less decent CGI-Death-Scene? - or did he do the Legolas ""I don't care about gravity"" thing? Questions above questions - yet now answers! I'd like to ask Peter Jackson what the hell happened! Was he forced with a gun to his head to make this? Or did he just direct it from a smart-phone, while sitting on his couch at home and counting his money? Yes, I'm aware that the TRUE EVIL, the true Morgoths are the Studios and the endlessly greedy film industry! If young people like Playstation graphics and action, shaky-cam and *beep* 3D - let them have it! Who cares about nice cinematography when the highest grossing movie are made in absurd-looking 3D and with completely over-the-top everything! In the last 14 years since the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING came out, I was telling my nerdy friends (and everybody else) how amazing the Lord of the Rings movies are, how muche love and effort went into them.<br/><br/>I was amazed about the fact, that Peter Jackson said NO to too much CGI, that he used real sets, models, amazingly detailed costumes and beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>ALL of that went down the drain with this one... this boring, crappy looking CGI-disaster, this Mexican Standoff in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>What was the ""story"" again? Some greedy dwarf does not want to come out of his cave - and suddenly all kinds of armies show up... to fight each other in a ridiculous way...<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes then felt like some different move... somehow like the original Trilogy... BECAUSE THERE WERE REAL LANDSCAPES.<br/><br/>It felt like something really beautuful standing next to something really ugly. But this short moment of ""how to make a nice, decent, GOOD movie"" did not save and also not redeem this perversion of cinematic history! This could as well be titled: WORLD OF WARCRAFT - THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>Other titles: Legolas, Dwarfes, CGI-ORCS and other stupid stuff in: TO HELL WITH GRAVITY! Watching THE FELLOSHIP OF THE RING makes you believe in the good things in this world: Friendsip, beauty, decency, good filmmaking... everything that is right and just and good. Everything a guy like Aragorn would put into an epic speech before a battle that mattered.<br/><br/>The battlescenes of the CGI-Creatures did not matter. And having too many trolls with too many artificial limbs - or an Orcs with a Klingon Bathleth-Prosthesis (and I usually like STAR TREK references... maybe just not in a Middle Earth Movie) I am not just disappinted. I am shocked by this mess. How can the SAME director that made the BEST TRILOGY EVER do this? Well, the same question has been asked countless times about George Lucas.<br/><br/>Good Job, Peter - you killed filmmaking. I am also not sure if you are honest about promoting this disgusting gimmick called 3D or you just have to do it because the industry wants you to do so! Damn it - this is the time of bad movies gone too far, the age of darkness... J.R.R. Tolkien could write some words of truth about this - but he's dead (lucky him... so he does not have to bear what they did to his beautiful vision!) This is the age of darkness indeed. The age of greed! I tend to believe that it is not completely Peter Jackson's fault - it is the perverted, greedy film-industry. They do not think in art or beauty or decency - they think and care only about profit! They exploit everything.<br/><br/>The sad part is the people defending all that because the wrongly connect it to something that is good and beautiful. But the connection is wrong! Just because it has partly the same actors, the same director and is supposed to play in the same universe as the good trilogy does not make it the same.<br/><br/>George Lucas tried (and failed) in doing the same. Overkilling something with CGI and bad writing is not filmmaking - it's a shame! Personally, I do the same here that I do with this terrible STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY: I never watch it again. I imagine the events of Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfes from the visual and artistic perspective of Ian Holm in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS - there could still be something great being made - but please by another director.<br/><br/>Somebody young and hungry and talented. Some person like the Peter Jackson of the 1990s. Somebody who LOVES the source-material and has a vision of it - but not a financial one! What also works - and it's totally for free: Imagination. Having a good actor talking about something rather than showing it invokes a million times more beautiful images than cramming it down your throat with a CGI funnel! Anyway - whatever. This needed to be said! And somebody like RED LETTER MEDIA should really make a review similar to the STAR WARS PREQUEL reviews! May the Force be with you - Gandalf"
"jgarbett-510-54203","8","97","185","12 December 2014"," A fitting send off to the greatest fantasy film series ever.
","Now I personally enjoyed the first two hobbit instalments as much as each movie of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, though without a shadow of a doubt the original trilogy is far superior (probably due to the fact the book it is based on, is far stronger) I still find each of them incredible films and after the agonising and excruciating cliff- hanger of the Desolation Of Smaug, I was highly anticipating the third concluding chapter: The Battle of the Five Armies.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies forsakes the tradition of prologues that would often go back in time from the main narrative and instead thrusts us into the action, sending us with a flurry of excitement into Smaug's attack on Laketown, it is truly a spectacle to watch, building up the suspense and then being the perfect pulse racing build up and is one of the standout set pieces of the year as we finally see Smaug the terrible lay wake to the town, and as the title card appears over the ruined Erebor, the film continues to be the ultimate goodbye to Middle Earth, high on energy, whizzing through scenes at a breakneck pace until the credits roll.<br/><br/>In an attempt not to reveal any spoilers about the film, I will not delve into anymore of the plot events, needless to say this movie has countless scenes that Jackson is known for. He masterfully strings together the best elements of his Middle Earth films into one package. Amazing characters with brilliant performances, standout and beautiful settings and design of Middle Earth, a beautiful epic yet emotional soundtrack and of course: incredible action set pieces to make one visual masterpiece. Jackson who has had two films worth of build up really tests the characters to their limits. Thorin has more to do than ever before and Armitage plays the part perfectly, not to forget Martin Freeman, who has a stunning emotional moment which had the audience blubbering with tears. Whilst the previous cast all fulfill their roles masterfully, Evangeline Lilly and Aidan Turner both continue this slightly cliché romantic subplot but one that is given far more weight in this movie and really contributes to the plot this time and does not feel tacked on which did seem to occur with Desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>The action as well is the best of the whole middle earth saga, the battle of the Five armies feels like Jackson looked at Minas Tirith, saw everything that worked and decided to turn it up a notch. Full of epic moments, awesome fights, giant armies clashing and the final showdown with the long awaited Thorin vs Azog does everything right with brilliant performances all around and the best one on one action scene in the series between Legolas and Bolg is a pure delight to watch. <br/><br/>The film for me embodied what I loved about: The lord of the rings. Whilst the action is marvellous and the best of the series, it's the emotional tone that ends the last ten minutes that makes The Battle of the Five armies such a brilliant goodbye as it is the end to the Hobbit tale, whilst still being a set up for the Lord of the rings and being one last farewell to the series that has touched so many viewers across the globe as Billy Boyd ends the series with a nostalgic note with his song.<br/><br/>My only few complaints is that much like in the Desolation of Smaug, the lonely mountain theme from An Unexpected journey does not appear, instead the 'house of durin theme' seems to be the most prominent, though I have understood it could be a copyright issue which in that case cannot be helped. Also though the film went by in a blur, I wish it could of been longer, most of the dwarfs don't get as much screen time as they should of and the ending feels like such a flash but perhaps that may be because I was desperate not to leave Jackson's middle earth vision for the last time, there was a lot of questions that were left unanswered admittedly and it does feel like they took the climax of the second movie, when the Hobbit was only two films and then extended it for as long as they could without overstaying their welcome, but these are all very minor gripes in what is a magnificent experience to see on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the ultimate send off for the Middle Earth saga. In a trilogy where the quality of films has got progressively better, the Hobbit which easily could of been a supplement to the Lord of the rings, feels like a significant half of the Middle Earth saga. It's crammed with nolstagia, especially when Shore reuses some classic themes. There's some minor gripes but I frankly don't care, this is Middle Earth at it's finest and it ticked all the boxes of what I wanted to see and what I wanted it to do. It was an emotionally powerful, spectacle filled ending to the greatest fantasy cinematic series of all time."
"MennoMan","9","108","208","17 December 2014"," Nice finish to an Over Extended Film
","It is without question The Hobbit did not need to be made into a three part film series... After all, given the book size of the Hobbit Compared to The Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit Should have been workable into one extended Movie or two at the most. If Jackson would have sun the story of The Lord of the Rings like he did the Hobbit, We would still be waiting for the last two movies in his twelve part series...<br/><br/>So with that off my chest.. <br/><br/>This still is a TRUE CLASSIC FILM to be placed in the same titles as The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. The Cinematography was excellent. The special effects pretty much flawless and acting excellent. The Story was intriguing if not a bit over-told with characters and plots a bit beyond the book. However, even these over embellishings are happily accepted. In fact, now that the series is over, I wish Jackson would have made a longer Lord of the Rings. Is simply can not get enough.. It is over! Soon to be delegated to Blue Ray, then sweep to the DVD bin at WalMart along with the rest of our favorites. Enjoy the series now...

"crovlak","4","91","178","10 December 2014"," Carelessly generic Imitation of what
","Let me start this certainly biased review with a big confession: I absolutely loved the 3 LORD OF THE RINGS movies back at the time, they looked fantastic, sounded fantastic both in dialogue and music, they also felt great. For films set in a fantasy world, they felt very real somehow. Even if they seem more cheesy after after time has passed, I have a very fond memory of how good a movie each of them was. Well, count the final Hobbit movie under ""gone are the days"". Based on a much thinner children's book the first 2 Hobbit movies seemed to be lacking too much in comparison, however Part 2 was a hope-inducing improvement. After having seen the very first screening of The Battle of the Five Armies today I leave the Hobbit trilogy disappointed and frankly, I will give away spoilers here, since I'm as careless as the film-making seems to me. In keeping with the over-simplicity of the movie (CGI uber alles, family is great), I just split the review into BAD (too much) an GOOD (too few).<br/><br/>BAD: The biggest problem of the movie is certainly its careless reliance on computer generated images. The viewer gets reminded every minute that he/she is constantly watching CGI armies, since the filmmakers did not care much to put any lifelike or individual characteristics on the armies' apparels or movements. Most creatures look very copy and paste. Except for the shire-based ending you never get the feeling that you saw much of the beauty of New Zealand. Instead most of the locations seem to be cgi made with mediocre textures, like the battlefield or the blurry gold floor Thorin imagines himself sucked in. The later is also an example of how the movie mostly goes the simplest ways. Because of the cgi the camera has to stay too far away from the happenings many times, and sadly the movie does not get close to most characters storywise too. Gone are the beloved moments of the LOTR movies, where you rooted for even cameo soldiers who where in the moment and put you in the same.<br/><br/>The few real dialogue is also constantly simplistic and most characters scream ""exposition only"" while the LOTR had so many memorable lines from Aragorn, Gandalf, the hobbits. Here, even the most beloved characters are reduced to namedropping and stating the obvious. For a movie that seems rushed in graphics and solving the story lines, it spends too much time on unimportant plot like the useless storyline about Alfrid, the majors laketown weasel, or the hobbit auction, which does neither fit the mood nor remind the audience how nice the hobbit once were portrayed. Also, middle earth fans will now have life-long eagle-fatigue. Gone is the extremely memorable music of the Ring saga, only the credit song really registered to me.<br/><br/>In keeping with the cgi reliance the physics in the movie go way below any normal suspension of disbelief, which is so noticeable that it takes you put of the movie even more. The Ork/pre-Uruk armor seems to implode on impact, how else do they die so easily. The tower where one end fight takes place would have collapsed instantly. And and and...<br/><br/>So whats GOOD about it? Luckily enough strange ideas made it into the cut, like Galadriel going full meta-elf bitch again or some animal moments. Orlando Bloom inhabits Legolas to the max. Maybe some other things, but again, why care when the film result of the certainly good spirited filmmakers does not reflect care."

A small rock thrown by dwarfs easily made them fell, and in other scenes they are immortal and can breath under water. The movie felt like it was made in a rush and I could even see the glue in Dwalin's face which was suppose to hold the fake beard, I usually never pay attention to so small details but this was awful! Was the make up artist even sober?<br/><br/>I didn't like the acting of the major cast in this movie, the elves felt like vampires, stiff and dull. And the mayors assistant came out as a total Monty python joke, which did not fit in.

"LeDentalPlaque","10","29","51","24 December 2014"," Great Ending to the Middle-Earth Saga
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy was one of the best film series ever to be made in terms of its epic proportions, grandiose score, intricate weaving of stories, and CGI. Peter Jackson did a great job interpreting the three Tolkien novels and putting them up on the big screen, a great feat done with great success.<br/><br/>When I heard that the Hobbit, originally one Tolkien book, was going to be split into three films just like the Lord of the Rings, I was surprised and worried about how they could expand one novel into 3 full-length feature films. So going in to the movies, I did not expect them to follow the book 100% - I expected changes to be made and additions inserted here and there to provide more excitement or emotion to the story.<br/><br/>I have heard a lot of people write and complain about how bad the last Hobbit was, but given the framework of its development and that it was supposed to be much longer than anyone expected, people should not be going into this moving expecting it to be a great nod to Tolkien, but rather one for Peter Jackson. He wanted it to be longer, he wanted to add his own creative flare to it, and he did. <br/><br/>I found that the last Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies, was a great film. Obviously, it doesn't stick to Tolkien's Hobbit in its entirety and makes links to the original Lord of the Ring trilogy, but overall, given what Peter Jackson was trying to accomplish, he did a wonderful job. Hobbit 3 had a lot of epic battle scenes, mixed in with a variety of moving, elegant pieces of music done by Howard Shore. It had a mixture of drama, action, adventure, romance, and magic - all of them parts that can make up a great film. <br/><br/>If you've been following along with the Hobbit trilogy and enjoyed it, you'll find this to be a great ending to the story and well worth your money at the cinema. If you were already doubting the first two movies and didn't find them particularly enjoyable, then this may not be for you. <br/><br/>However, as a stand-alone film, the story and the score are enough to earn it a 10/10 for me. Overall, it's a highly enjoyable movie with lots of action and adventure, and it has a memorable score."

"Franco_Strydom","4","96","193","12 December 2014"," It feels rushed, specifically in Post-Production.
","It's generally difficult to comment on story when it comes to something like The Hobbit seeing as its usually an incredible well written story adapted by strong screen writers. Unfortunately that's not the case with The Battle of the Five Armies. <br/><br/>Some of the heavier emotional moments were milked for all their worth while some of the potentially epic moments came and went with minimal attention, which is disappointing. A lot of the film felt cluttered with story elements, too many characters needing screen time and too many stories wanting to be told. At one point I found myself more interested in one of the secondary stories than the main plot – there's only so much brooding and call to bravery one can watch before it become predictable and boring. The chaos of war came across nicely but I'm not convinced it was deliberate where the 'sad' ending is definitely deliberate and quite effective. Another plot element that really draws attention to itself in a bad way is the sense of time. Jackson and his team usually excel at taking Tolkien's extended timeline and compressing it into a flowing film where everything seems to happen in close proximity while holding onto the greater integrity of the plot. The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't excel at this at all. There are references in the film that makes the viewer aware that more time has passed than what was presented which makes me cringe – the act of announcing a detail out loud to make sure the audience understands the full reach of the happenings is something you'd expect from unseasoned film makers. To throw wood on the fire the opposite time effect also occurs where the film effectively compounds time into making the audience believe that less time has passed (to keep pace) but then, the viewer is presented with the results of what should have been weeks or months and I find myself wondering about the validity of the narrative concept – which is something that shouldn't be anywhere near this immaculately written Fiction. In short, the film feels rushed, like it wasn't enjoying the full attention of its highly talented crew.<br/><br/>Some of the acting performances were disappointing. The characters are difficult to get your head around and there are some obvious traits and mannerisms that are required of the actors, which lead to some of the performances getting lost in character. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield was great. The brooding again became a bit much but such is the requirements of the role and he did a splendid job at it. Lots of the fighting was weird to watch and more than once I felt Middle-Earth's physics fail. The fighting doesn't feel authentic neither does it sound it. A lot of the physical action reads like performers running through choreography which destroys the believably of the actions and characters in those moments. Again, this brings up that underlying feeling that somehow, the project was rushed. <br/><br/>Greater than my deflated expectations for The Return of the King (Jackson 2003) level grandeur and epic was the confusion I experienced with regards to the style and edit of the film. I remember The Hobbit parts I and II having a different style in terms of the edit, lighting and cinematography. Immediately after the credits rolled I checked to see if any of the key crew members had changed but no, the team is the same as Parts I and II, so maybe it's just me, but the style feels different. Post-Production also feels rushed. Some of the cuts in the edit are abrupt, the shots different to the style I've gotten used to and some of the effects seemed 'cheap', like Post didn't have enough time to give everything the attention it needed so they rushed to get everything done. Even the opening and closing credits felt alien to the other films in the series.<br/><br/>I love Fantasy film which usually means I take care not to coddle films in this genre and maybe in the case of The Battle of the Five Armies this has made me overly critical. That being said, I enjoyed it, but I definitely have some disappointment to this, the final installment of The Hobbit."

","First, I would like to say that I love all the books from Tolkien, Lord of the Rings movies and I think that the first two Hobbit movies were not that bad.<br/><br/>The third one, however, was horrible, full of pointless violence, cheap CGI with no real story = typical Hollywood action movie with no meaning. They should have ended with 2 movies instead. More so that the original book is not big enough for 3 movies.

All throughout the movie I was waiting for something exciting to happen, and I waited....and waited...and waited.... <br/><br/>The movie drags after the first 30 minutes (first 30 minutes is OK). They was no good drama, no suspense, no overwhelming feeling that you get when seeing LOTR. When the main story finished at around 2 hours or so and there was still 25 minutes more of the movie to make, they dragged the end by showing showing each character, their emotions and stuff in detail when it wasn't needed.<br/><br/>And as many people have already said - this is what happens when you convert a 300 page book to 3 long movies."

"Ed_D17","8","39","73","17 December 2014"," A fitting adieu to Middle Earth, but one that lacks that special something
","I should have loved this film. One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.<br/><br/>It's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.<br/><br/>The ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.<br/><br/>So, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.<br/><br/><ul><li>Ed</li></ul>"
"interestingfunstuff","1","49","95","28 December 2014"," Why Do Moviegoers Support Bad Films By Paying For Them?
","If you watched the first two Hobbit films directed by Jackson, then you know the story arc is on a steep, downward spiral. For example, the previous film was so bad I was actually rooting for the dragon Smaug! I despised the film that much! <br/><br/>But let's talk economics. If you pay to see junk then you, yes you, are encouraging Hollywood to make more junk. It's Economics 101. If you don't spend money on bad films then Hollywood will do a better job. It's that simple. Since the movie-going audience pays the bills, when the movie-going audience stops paying the bills, Hollywood will have a financial incentive to stop making junk!<br/><br/>The movie has little to do with the book except the names are all the same. If you changed every name you would not realize your watching The Hobbit. The film is nothing more than war porn, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The original Lord Of The Rings film trilogy were masterpieces. But can you imagine what the films would have been like if each book in the trilogy was split up into three films each - for a total of 9 films? Well, that's exactly what Director Jackson did. He took one skinny book and instead of turning it into one or possibly two films, he essentially made-up a different story - from the book - and made three films.<br/><br/>Now if Jackson could have done a better job than Tolkien himself, then Great! But he's not a fantasy writing genius, he's a money grubbing moron who wants to maximize profits by using his formerly good name to lure fans of Tolkien to watch his crap. In other words, Jackson does not care one bit that he ruining one of the greatest pieces of literature in the English language. He's making himself and his buddies rich because of you and me! <br/><br/>Every time you spend a dime on something you are voting for that product or service, just like when you vote for a politician at the polls. If you want quality then don't pay for junk! It's that simple!"

","The movie really aggravated me. Enough to make me write my first review on IMDb.<br/><br/>For a frame of reference, let me start by saying that I did enjoy LOTR.<br/><br/>Have you not yet seen The Hobbit 3, just don't !!!!! I simply cannot find a redeeming feature of the film. It's just an unnecessary abundance of establishing shots, excessive CGI and long slow motion close-ups. The close-ups makes everyone understand that the character is thoughtful, very hero-like or the situation is very dangerous. While the accompanying music is good and effective, it is somehow overused, which makes everything even more sickeningly nauseating.<br/><br/>Technically it is not possible write a spoilers for this movie as the plot is virtually non-existent. However, the film is peppered with really bad slapstick goofs, which made me cringe so bad.<br/><br/>The characters are not very likable, which makes the whole outcome unimportant. You feel indifferent about the 7 dwarfs. Bilbo has pretty much been written out of the movie, even though the movie is about him. Legolas is annoying and portrayed as a supernatural matrix-ninja-elf, and it is hard to sit through the movie without wishing him dead. Gandalf is actually likable but the time spent on slow motion closing close-ups is way too much.<br/><br/>I get that the film is not an attempt on documentary, but the special effects in the film are made completely without anything resembling laws of physics. With the Hobbit Peter Jackson suffers from the same disease as George Lucas and Michael Bay, he does not know when to stop with the CGI.<br/><br/>I have seen many bad movies both on television and in the movies, but it's rare that I want to leave the theater. It is also rare that I leave the cinema with a feeling of having wasted my time. Wasting my time is exactly what I did, and even 144 minutes of it. Time that I will never ever get back.<br/><br/>If you are thinking : ""I may just catch it on DVD or TV"", just don't.<br/><br/>I give it two stars because even though the shots are overwhelmingly cluttered with CGI, some are still quite impressive. Peter Jackson could easily have gotten extra stars had he just included more beautiful shots of landscape without any CGI. He did that well in LOTR.<br/><br/>I can keep on ranting but let this be my last comment: This movie sucks!"
"haataja-lari","7","47","92","9 December 2014"," Extremely enjoyable, with a few minor gripes!
","I thought the movie was entertaining as hell! Being a huge fan of the book, seeing this was the moment I had been waiting for years! Was it worth it? Well... yeah!<br/><br/>I think the movie had great visuals and incredibly believable character progressions! I think stretching the story to three films was a great choice and people who compare the amount of films involving the LotR-saga to the amount of films involving The Hobbit are pretty ignorant. Squeezing LotR into three films did the book a disservice, and a lot of the book isn't there! With this one, you pretty much get what you read as a kid plus some exciting references to the Tolkien lore!<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think this film is perfect. SPOILER ALERT, here come the gripes!<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The film was pretty much a huge war scene. That's not one of the gripes, I actually enjoyed it (although I'm not the biggest fan of movie fights). The choreographs were well thought out and it was great to see some good old wizard combat! The gripes actually come in with some of the stuff NOT containing the fighting!<br/><br/>Mostly the none fighting was enjoyable. You really relate to the characters and it all makes sense. What bothers me is the fan service end. It's the little things... I loved to see the Shire one more time! I loved how they tied it up to the LotR movies, and I loved that Pulla was actually in a minor role (finally)! The stuff that bothered me were the unnecessary reference to Aragorn and the weird ""please cry"" scenes. Mostly I'm talking about the dying dwarfs!<br/><br/>It wasn't as bad as it could have been, but there were some icky moments. Like when Tauriel was crying at Kili's body. I'm glad they didn't do the whole ""elven tears resurrected him"" thing, but jeez... it was still pretty cheesy. I get that Tauriel would grief Kili's death but the whole ""If this is love, take it away from me"" part was a bit much.<br/><br/>The last gripe I have is Alfrid. You know, the guy with the unibrow! I sincerely hate that character! I mean in the second movie he had a purpose! He was like the the bastard that was keeping the curse on Theoden in The Return of the King! I can't remember his name by any stretch of imagination, but you know the one! Well, in this movie Alfrid is more of a goof. You just start to hate that character so much that it's not fun anymore! Anytime you see him you just go ""DIE ALREADY"" and not in the good way! He's just unnecessary, in my opinion. I get what they were trying to do, but I can't stand behind it. The joke got old after the first hour or so, get on with it!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that's it! I'm not a professional critic. All I am is just an ordinary Tolkien fan, so don't take my words to heart or let them ruin this great movie for you! All things considered I still really enjoyed this movie! It was a satisfying ending to something great. Do go check it out if you haven't already!<br/><br/>Ps: Peter Jackson, please do something with Silmarillion!"
"Arctor84","6","6","8","22 January 2016"," Entertaining, yet ultimately disappointing, denouement to the trilogy
","I am a Tolkien fan boy and a nerd when it comes to Middle Earth lore, so The Hobbit trilogy as a whole has presented problems for me with its non-canon characters and story lines but I attempted to take this film on its merits. <br/><br/>It is impossible to discuss this film without first addressing the way the film looks. There are, as we have come to expect from Jackson's interpretation of Middle Earth, beautifully rendered scenic views and incredible battle scenes but these are spoiled by far, far too much CGI which lacks the requisite heft and physicality to make you truly suspend your disbelief. Some of the scenes end up looking more like a video game than a motion picture, which can only take away from the kind of immersive experience one wants from a fantasy adventure. Billy Connolly's character of Dain was entirely CGI, why not get an actor in? Even the costumes and make-up felt 'pantomimey', and it's always a bad sign when you find yourself noticing wigs and beards rather than paying attention to the story.<br/><br/>I was impressed, however, with some of the performances, particularly and obviously Martin Freeman, who should have been given far more screen time owing to his charm and general likability. Luke Evans also gave a strong showing as the stoic Bard the Bowman.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the inclusion of some of the 'history' (don't worry, I know it's not real) of Middle Earth. The assault by the White Council (Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman and Gandalf in the movie version) on Sauron' fortress at Dol Guldur was fantastic to see and the foreshadowing of Saruman's betrayal was well done.<br/><br/>Although it would seem foolish to criticise a film entitled, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" for containing too much fighting, this was also one of my main sticking points with the film. The battle scenes and individual fight scenes go on and on and on, and in the end the law of diminishing returns takes hold (as it did in the Battle of Helm's Deep at times in LOTR: The Two Towers). I became desensitized to seeing droves of elves/orcs/dwarfs crashing into one another after a while and craved some meaningful dialogue or simply a change of pace.<br/><br/>tl;dr = Visually stunning with distracting CGI, overly-long battle sequences and some decent performances. 6/10."

Right there, Jackson's mastery of visual spectacle is already screaming, but as the events unfold, the script starts losing track. In the wake of its phenomenal visual achievement, 'The Battle of Five Armies' fails to deliver its narrative as powerfullly as it should be. There are more than enough moments when weak dialogues and one liners fall beneath the overwhelming action-packed CGI-rendered sequences.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's soaring vision of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle Earth remains unfazed by time, if anything it only exceeds past any cinematic triumph measured by ambitious visualizations. While its true ""Battle of Five Armies"" has almost nothing new to deliver, there are quite enough heart-stirring sequences to boast, particularly the death scenes of Kili and Thorin. Amidst of narrative shortcoming, Martin Freeman's exceptional Bilbo Baggins shines, there are moments when he seems to be playing a supporting character, but on his owned sequences, he dominates, along with the dwarfs that share their deserved spotlight. It is during in those little moments that the film is saved from being drowned in its own grand visual ambitions, filled by terrifying creatures and jaw dropping sequences ""The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies"" is a visual extravaganza beyond measure. It is not devoid of shortcomings, but in general, this film can never be placed below exceptional, a fitting closing tribute to one of the greatest stories ever told. This movie deserves 9 of my 10 stars."

It was nice to know who was going to die in advance so I didn't become too attached to them, but could have easily done so with the awesome cast.

I love it. <br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>The show starts right where it left off with no recap. Smaug is about to destroy Laketown. There is chaos and much destruction... The scenes were short, but to the point. I didn't feel that anything was cut short. There are a lot of loose ends going into this movie and this movie does a good job of completing things. There are a lot of hints into the LOTR story. Legolas does some of the same moves we saw in the trilogy. It was kind of like getting extra doses of ""Hey, did you see that...."" geekiness. I felt like the battle between Thorin and the Azog could have been done differently, but it's mostly artistic license as Tolkien himself did not elaborate on it. Several people have complained that Thorin has taken over as the main character where it should be Bilbo. I think they forget that this story is Bilbo's retelling of things as he saw them. He isn't going to focus on himself for the entire thing or it would have been quite boring. Not to mention that he gets knocked unconscious for a long while in the book and when he comes to everything has ended. Had Peter Jackson taken that route we would have seen nothing. The scenes were beautiful and haunting and once again the music was amazing. I loved this movie and will probably see it again in theaters. I saw it in IMAX 3D and thoroughly enjoyed every minute."

One of the most awesome characters of the movies and superb villain, voiced by a perfect Cumberbatch, who really carried the latter part of the second movie, ending it with an unforgettable ""I am fire. I am...DEATH."" gets killed without practically no screen time whatsoever. And when the final battle is starting and you think it's gonna be epic, like the one from LOTR: return of the king, you're in for a disappointment. Against an overwhelming orc army (powered by lots of trolls which are being oneshotted throughout the fight and a handful of giant worms that magically disappear after being introduced at the beginning of the scene) that butchers both elven and dwarven armies and a couple dozen untrained humans, 13 dwarfs and a flight of eagles turn the tides as if the orc army has suddenly changed in straw men. And at the end, when the whole Durin family line get's suddenly slaughtered out of nowhere, there is not a speck of emotion in sight. O, and the most irritating man from the trilogy, which seems to have the function of comic release (Laketown mayor's right hand man), refuses to die.

It is not as good as the Lord of the Rings even remotely, but that's because it's a children's book. Even though Peter Jackson has made some controversial decisions, he has still pulled off what no other directed could do. He brought Middle Earth to life once again. I urge you to watch it.

","It's sad to see Hobbiton go out like this but I never really had high hopes for the movie of this beloved children's, and I emphasis children's, story. Why? Because Jackson apparently didn't understand the difference between the Hobbit and the LOTR's trilogy. The Hobbit is a lighter book, a grand adventure of a little man going out into the world for the first time. It is also the story of a King trapped in the mistakes of his ancestors. The LOTR was a massive tale of friendship, loyalty, royalty, failure and triumph which needed to be told over a series of books. The Hobbit was not that kind of story and so the movie just seems overstuffed, fabricated from multiple other sources, long and boring. Too much fighting, not enough about characters that we're supposed to care about, bad writing overall and even worse score. Beside the song from the first movie there is no decent music at all. I was just amazed at how awful the score really was even compared to other movies. I gave it 2/10 and those two stars are for Freeman's performance as Bilbo and the Ian McKellen who is always good. They were the only two who tried their darn est to rise above this grotesque material."

","Last thirty years i am great fun of J.R.R. Tolkien. I begun with the books, than one great but underestimated cartoon from Ralph Bakshi and finally, Lord of the Rings! For me, the best trilogy ever made.<br/><br/>But, what was in P.J.-s mind when he decides to make The Hobbit trilogy, only the God knows.<br/><br/>First movie, The Unexpected Journey (2012.), was OK. In moments it was very good, but all in all, nothing special. But i saw it like an intro to the story so i could live with it. For the most people i know, movie was too boring. I spent lots of time in defending P.J., trying to explain that this is just first movie and it will be much better in part II, especially in part III, the last movie about Middle Earth, Hobbits and all of those nice and the other not so nice creatures that entertained us for so many years.<br/><br/>But how wrong was i....<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug (2013.) has some (somebody could say: a lot, and will say nothing wrong) flaws, has some inconsistency in script, but i have forgiven P.J. because i was too sure that The Battle of Five Armies (2014.) will be a spectacle, one great finish of Middle Earth saga.<br/><br/>But P.J. has laughed and spat in the face to all of Tolkien and LOTHR fans.<br/><br/>I have watched movie last night and for the first time in my life i wanted to get out of the cinema in the last third of the movie! So clumsy and unhandy directing, flaws in script, bad CGI, mockery and absolutely NO emotions. What happened to P.J.?? Satiation? <br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien is cursing P.J. from above, for sure.<br/><br/>I don't know when am i going to watch another P.J.-s movie again.<br/><br/>Hopefully, in next five-six years Nolan is going to make a remake of The Hobbit (just one movie!!!), with title ""The Hobbit"" and this is going to be a masterpiece.. (my wish, please, please Nolan, please do this).<br/><br/>At the end i can say only one: SHAME ON YOU PETER JACKSON!!!!"

","""In a hole, in the ground, there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""<br/><br/>In 1937, the world was greeted with these words for the first time by author J.R.R Tolkien, when The Hobbit was first published. Now, 77 years later, the final installment of this epic journey has made it to the big screen.<br/><br/>14 Years ago we saw the first journey to Middle Earth on the big screen in the form of The Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson (director) definitely did not disappoint the fans of the books, and gave us the best possible visualization of Tolkien's world, using the most recent technologies and wonderful actors and actresses. Now, 14 years after the release of The Lord of the Rings on screen, Jackson takes us back to Middle Earth one last time to finish The Hobbit series.<br/><br/>Smaug (voiced by Benidict Cumberpatch), after being defeated in Erebor by the Company of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), exacts his revenge by attacking Laketown, giving the Dwarfs a chance to reclaim their home. However, Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennette) has his own plans and puts them into motion to destroy the line of Durin once and for all and claim Erebor for evil.<br/><br/>Dwarfs, Elves, Men and Orcs all fight for their own claim on the Lonely Mountain in the greatest battle that Middle Earth has seen since the fall of Sauron. There are, however, two other creatures that help in this epic battle: The Wizard, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). Gandalf set the company of Dwarfs and the hobbit on the quest to reclaiming Erebor and played a vital role in its ending. But who shall win this epic battle? Can just 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit really complete their task and defeat the armies of evil? Or will evil prevail?<br/><br/>In The Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies we see some characters from The Lord of the Rings return for this breath taking prequel. Orlando Bloom reprises his role as Legolas and brings a new side to the ever loved Elven Prince. In the Lord of the Rings, he started off as nothing more than a simple elf with a dislike to dwarfs. As the second Battle for Middle Earth begins, Legolas ends up having the best of friendship with a Dwarf and we see that relationship grow and grow. In the Battle of the Five Armies we see a Legolas who is a proud Elf and seems to want things to happen in an Elven way. Bloom does a fantastic job in playing the role, now that he has gained a lot more experience than he had on the Lord of the Rings and has grown into one very fine, and handsome actor.<br/><br/>Even Billy Boyd, who portrayed Pipin in The Lord of the Rings, manages to make the credits memorable with his very own vocal talent, giving us the song The Last Goodbye for the end credits.<br/><br/>But for me there is one actor that stands out the most in the final installment of this movie and that is the Hobbit himself. When I first saw Martin Freeman as Bilbo in the Unexpected Journey, I thought he was a very poor choice for the role of a younger Bilbo. From the first movie there was very little acting skill there and not much energy. However as the first film came to an end and in the next two films, Freeman has definitely proved himself worthy of the role. It is difficult to fill the shoes of an incredible actor such as Ian Holm but gradually we see that he does it magnificently, showing the courage and energy that Holm himself showed us in the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>If ever there was an award for scariest moment in the film then this would definitely be given to Galadriel as she, along with Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Saruman (Christopher Lee), faces an old Enemy. The sheer power of this Elven woman is terrifying and is fantastically portrayed by Cate Blanchett. She definitely holds nothing back in this amazing fight, one that will leave you on the edge of your seat and leave you stunned and amazed.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has created what I can only describe as the best of century films. Sure others will try and top The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but they won't come close to this Masterpiece. This is truly one in a million. Thank you Peter for giving us this wonderful and emotional visualization of the life work that came from Tolkien."
"peadargrogan1995","4","56","115","13 December 2014"," Big Dissappoinment
","After the desolation of smaug had somewhat redeemed the trilogy from the dreadful first movie, it was down to this one to seal the deal. As a lover of the books and all things Tolkein, i came into to the movie with great expectations, but the movie i saw absolutely terrible. I have to ask if all the high rating for this movie are by people who have read the book. The needless love triangle, bad CGI and terrible character performances left the movie feeling thin and drawn out. The best part of the movie is in the first 30 minutes or so when samug comes to destroy lake town, but it almost seems like he is killed too easily and it's over in a flash. In my opinion the only reason for the love triangle is so that Legolas could be brought into the movie for the people who have only ever seen the movies. The characters are given no depth, and i found it impossible to connect with any of them, so when pretty big characters were brought to an end, i felt no remorse. Amongst all this there are scene of incredibly bad CGI. Whether it's tat stupid elk that thraundil rides, the over simulated armies or the fact that legolas can seem to jump on thin air, it made the movie seem like it was running on a low budget as opposed to the monster 250 million they had. From a man who created a masterpiece from the work of a magnificent writer, i expected much more. Any other true fans of the books will agree with me when i say i feel as if we have been cheated."
"drjones0","5","41","82","10 December 2014"," Once more unto the breach
","SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to get a seat at the premiere of the final entry in The Hobbit trilogy last night. Jackson's final journey into the fantastical Middle Earth has left me with a bitter aftertaste; I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad it's over.<br/><br/>Jackson's liberal use of computer generated imagery (CGI) coupled with his tired direction create an ugly eyesore reminiscent of some lost relic from the Playstation 2 era. The human eye easily picks out the jarring effects work with ease, creatures and environments look horribly waxy, especially Legolas who looks like he has escaped from Madame Tussauds. I do not buy that this is the same stunning and fantastical Middle Earth audiences ventured into during the Lord of the Rings epic. Though set 60 years(?) prior to the Rings trilogy, Middle Earth has become contrived and ugly. Sporting a muted colour palette, The Hobbit gives off a grim and edgy feeling (though not as bad as the green tint on the extended Fellowship of the Ring Bluray), there is only just doom and gloom, which seems to be in direct conflict with the more light-hearted tone of the material, and dry humour of the previous installations.<br/><br/>I can't exactly quite pinpoint what feels off about the film, but the fact that there is blatantly little passion to be felt is a huge issue. It's as if the film is limping to the finish line. Jackson's direction seems lazy or uninspired and bland; time stops during heated battles as characters take stock, (luckily the characters have plot armor, otherwise they'd be dead), or sweeping aerial shots of characters traversing the ugly environment; Swords clang, characters show up in time to save the day and characters are attacked by waves of creatures. This all seems like the perfect ingredients for an epic outing from Jackson, but the spectacle tires quickly. We've have seen it all before in the Rings trilogy, a vastly superior set of films.<br/><br/>There are a few laughably bad moments in the film which should absolutely not have been included. Jackson's decision to turn Legolas into a CGI-eyed wax figurine is not enough, he ends up with the ability to defy physics (think Legolas mounting the battle elephants in The Return of the King, but cranked up to eleven). It happens on multiple occasions here and it's laughably bad. The audience during my screening guffawed and gasped during the almost criminal scene (you'll know when it happens). There will certainly be no awards or Oscars for Jackson here. The most baffling was the epilepsy inducing scene where Galadriel confronts and banishes Sauron to the east. The dialogue is nauseating, but the quick cuts and flashes play out like a bad drug trip from Fear and Loathing or something left over from the 90s.<br/><br/>One thing that has always been consistent in Jackson's films is the unbelievable sound design and scoring. The Battle of the Five Armies holds some of the best work yet, the audience is pulled right into the battles, we hear leaves rustling, the clang of steel on steel, battle cries, horns blowing etc. It's like sunshine for my ears. But this isn't going to redeem the film.<br/><br/>Billy Boyd's melancholic ballad during the credits marks the end of our journey through Middle Earth, though unlike Bilbo Baggins, I don't think the trip was worth the price. It's probably best to view these films as three separate acts in a single film, and watching that back to back will probably make for better viewing than waiting three years for a flaccid climax that under delivers. As Paul Thomas Anderson said, In the end we don't remember plots, but rather how a film makes us feel. This film made me feel nothing, I just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews here:<br/><br/>www.justathought.co"

","Seriously. it was 99% fighting! battles that should take seconds took so long that you was wondering to yourself ""when will this boring battle end and the next one start?"". And why was there only one bit of magic throughout the whole film? Gandalf! stop hitting things with your staff! cast a spell! Bilbo used more magic than Gandalf!!!! they split one book into three films and still managed to miss half of the book! This whole thing felt more like watching someone else play a World of Warcraft raid than anything Tolkien would ever write. The entire film made it obnoxiously obvious that they only wanted to do three films for money. there was an entire two parts that made me giggle and the rest of the time i wanted to turn my phone on and read my facebook newsfeed. What a waste of a trilogy!"
"rampantpolanski","2","29","56","21 December 2014"," The Best Thing About This Film Is That It's Over
","The Hobbit thing has been quite a mystery to me - they all have a very high user rating on IMDb, just as the original Lord Of The Rings films, but if you go look at the first few pages of reviews of each of them here, you will see page after page of only negative reviews, whereas the LOTR films contain only glowing recommendations - almost a mirror image. Why is this? It seems to make no sense. Is the film studio mass-planting votes here? There seems to be no other sensible explanation, because all the Hobbit films are inexcusably awful - everything that was good about the Lord Of The Rings films is what is bad here: the writing, the fight scenes, the CGI, the bits added and cut... Everything that could go wrong with the workings of a film here goes wrong. You would have to go rewatch Sin City to see more obvious use of green-screen. The dwarfs are characterless and annoying. In fact EVERYONE here is characterless and annoying, even the characters you loved in the earlier films, even fair Galadriel. Even Gandalf! You don't and CAN'T care for any of them the whole 9 hours, because there simply IS nothing there to care for. None of their actions seem driven by anything that makes any sense, they are just invisibly dragged from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>On top of that, the new, higher frame-rate literally hurt my eyes - something I've never had happen in a cinema before. What is the use of pointless innovation if all it does is worsen the experience? Empty, meaningless and a terrible tarnishing of the memory of the original trilogy, the very best thing about this film is that it's over."
"ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502","8","40","81","13 December 2014"," Keep LoTR Out of the Mind and Go For This Movie
","While reviewing the movie it is difficult to compare it (or the whole Hobbit series) with the book and the previous franchise 'The Lord of the Rings.' The movie has too many deviations from the book unlike LoTR. But that is acceptable. On one hand, LoTR, the book, had all the material available for the movie thus giving very less chance to deviate from the story. On the other hand, you have to add up a lot of creative imagination to make three movies out of a little over 300 pages book. So you have to deviate from the original story and twist some of the original facts. For example, Azog was killed by Dain's father long before the Hobbit journey began. He was never part of the book but is the main villain in the movie.<br/><br/>Hence it is not befitting to inspect if the movie justifies the book or not. Of course, the question remains – then why was there a need to create three movies? Personally, I think there was no need. And if there was too much craving to create three movies, there could have been another option – make one for Hobbit, one for Gandalf, then for Aragon, and perhaps one for the Elves. Wow, now that is four movies. I am not sure if this is a good or bad celluloid idea but I would love watch complete films about especially Gandalf and Aragon. <br/><br/>Having said that, I have to point out that this movie doesn't feel like stretching too much or boring. From the beginning it stays interesting and keeps you clung to the seats. Or on the edge of the seat like my friend was sitting through out. That is only possible if you do not go to this movie with the idea of LoTR in mind. It does not have a grandeur of LoTR but it does deliver what one can expect from Hobbit. The movie ends with an emotional touch of familiar Hobbit, down-to- earth, expressions.<br/><br/>In a small scale though, but Peter Jackson's touch is quiet alive in the movie. The 45 minutes war scene is very well carried through by keeping focus on individual interests. Thorin and Azog, Legolas style of fighting with Bolg, secret caring between Kili and Tauriel, etc. etc. The formation of the armies carries the same signature of the last series which is worth watching. Thranduil looks spectacular sitting on the elk. <br/><br/>On the downside, besides Bilbo reaching back home safely, there is nothing shown of what happened to the other characters. Bard and Dain simply disappeared at the end. It wasn't clear who throned the Lonely Mountain after Thorin died. Beorn had a very little role of rather few seconds. And it is understandable that Dwarfs are warriors and can kill enemies almost double their size but children killing orcs and goblins is bit too much of bravery show. If this is the last of the Middle-Earth saga, the link between the end of the Hobbit series and LoTR beginning was rather weak. <br/><br/>I will still wait for the extended version which is supposed to be 30 minutes more. Hopefully, that will have some answers. Needless to say, if you are a Tolkien and Peter Jackson fan, or even like classic war movies, this movie will not disappoint you."
"phd_travel","1","32","63","19 December 2014"," Good riddance to bad rubbish - excruciatingly drawn out
","The fiery dragon wreaking havoc is good. But then things start to get sleep inducing again. Whenever Bilbo comes on it just gets so boring. As for the fighting I gave up figuring out who is fighting whom for what. The story isn't enough for 2 and a half hours. There is less impact due to the split into 2 parts. Don't feel for any of the characters. The greed of the dwarfs, the love affair. Big mistake. The large scale battles were excessive in their CGI and uninvolving. The individual battles were better. Legolas fight on the bridge thing was good. However it was so irritating having Evangeline Lily's character distract her dwarf boyfriend and kind of causing his death. Luke Evans as the concerned father is a good plot to have developed but then it kind of loses it's thread.<br/><br/>Watch this if you have to but it's just good riddance to bad rubbish"

I can't understand why he did that, it would have been very easy to follow the original storyline of the book, and it would have been million times better. I am shocked and I can't believe that my favorite middle earth series ended with that terrible movie. All fans of Tolkien will probably watch this. The feeling I'm left with, is gratefulness for the untouchable Lord of the Rings series. They can never be taken away. The Hobbit falls short right there where the Lord of the Rings is most powerful: loyalty to Tolkien."

With prolonged scenes of misery, not doing it any favors to connect with the audience as it was so common by the end of it all I had no interest in the characters what so ever.<br/><br/>The CGI and special effects gave the impression of a video game, taking away any realism that may have been left from those teary eyed characters.<br/><br/>In previous franchise for example Lord of The Rings the close up shots showed lots of detail in the hordes descending upon Middle Earth,fangs and mean looking faces no one would want to wake up to! However, this seems to have been completely forgotten, and one was left with a nauseating feeling as cameras glided through the ""epic"" scaled scenes. <br/><br/>So I am left with the conclusion Peter should have made it into a two part film, as The Hobbit has a natural divide in the book.

","This was obvious: converting a child book to a Hollywood movie would bring a disaster. <br/><br/>When I went to the theaters today, I had this excitement and eagerness to go back to the Middle-Earth once again. It appeared to be the only bright side of the movie. Here is a little list of questions and comments: <br/><br/>-What made Peter Jackson think that he would alter Tolkien's work and get away with it? The whole movie suffers from unnecessary additions (Tauriel? Kili dies to save her? What?) and things left unexplained.<br/><br/>-What happened to those giant worms? They got bored and went back underground? Getting on surface and screaming is just their daily ritual?<br/><br/>-At least show the result of the thing you based the movie on. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOLD?<br/><br/>-Why is everything so perfect? I mean the CGI is so perfect that it hurt my eyes. Everything is so smooth and elegant. Every battle is based on amazing swings and blocks and rolls. I felt like playing a hack & slash video game. I could actually see buttons popping up on the screen for me to press while Legolas was climbing his way up on the collapsing bridge.<br/><br/>-The whole movie is like a freakin' l'oreal commercial. I mean everybody's skin is just drop-dead gorgeous. Even the orcs! You could even say that the orcs were handsome if your eyes get used to it.<br/><br/>-In LOTR, there was a constant dark ambiance and the emotions were brilliantly shifted with smart, deep jokes; bringing a short grin on your face and a short mental relief out of those worrying events. In the Hobbit, it seems like it is the other way around. It is like a sit-com with silly jokes (I admit that they were funny, but come on, Jackson!) which take all of the dark thoughts and emotions away (If there were any.) <br/><br/>-What about those slow-mo near-death moments with last second saves? Everybody saved everybody's lives in the movie. The orc always has to say a last word or hold his sword above for a while (where's all the fun if you don't give a little chance to the savior? Have a heart, orc!).<br/><br/>This list goes so long that I could make a trilogy out of it.<br/><br/>This whole trilogy is a failure and they are a huge disrespect to the work of Tolkien. Shame."

This doesn't change until near the end of the film, where the last 30 minutes kind of make up a decent ending. Honestly. Wait until the DVD comes out, save yourself some money. Then, while watching the DVD, skip to the end when you near the filler mark. You won't have missed a thing. Movies like this are responsible for making Tolkien roll over in his grave. Seriously.

","The long anticipated conclusion to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy has finally arrived! Starring Ian Mckellen (Gandalf) and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies was far from impressive. Full of cheap animation and useless plot points this final piece of the Lord of the Rings collection was a poor excuse for a film, and strayed so far from the book that Tolkien rolled over in his grave.<br/><br/>This film picks up directly where The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug left off. Smaug is in the midst of destroying the village of Lake Town while Bilbo Baggins and his Dwarf friends watch from the Misty Mountain. Once Smaug has began destroying Lake Town the vigilante Bard manages to escape from jail, and slay the dragon in an unrealistically fast amount of time. Taking refuge on the shores of the lake the people of Lake Town then flee to the Misty Mountain to claim their portion of the Mountain's treasure to rebuild their town. Meanwhile, Thorin and his fellow dwarfs have confined themselves inside the mountain, determined to keep the wealth to themselves. Upon the arrival of the elves who are also looking for their claim to the treasure, the dwarfs declare war on men and elves. The orcs then immediately arrive starting the legendary battle of the five armies.<br/><br/>Although the work of actors such as Martin Freeman (Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (Thorin) within the film was incredibly well done, it was quickly ruined by Peter Jackson's sloppy editing, special effects and dreadfully long fight scenes. Fans already knew going in that in order to make a film with so many short characters, doubles would have to be used in place of the original actors. Unfortunately though there was very little done to conceal the use of the doubles resulting in awkward blurs over faces and in Gandalf's case his hat would drop over his face. In many scenes actors were also replaced with entirely animated versions of themselves. This would not have been a problem if a higher degree of detail was put into these CGI characters, but unfortunately they were unfinished and consisted of a quality no more than your average video game. The there is the fight scenes, or fight scene. I say scene because that's really all the film is. One big long drawn out fight scene that leaves you wishing for the film's end two thirds of the way through the movie. Then, every time the film seems like it is going to end, it doesn't. Instead, Peter Jackson draws out the film even longer by adding scene upon scene of content that was originally never in the book.<br/><br/>All in all this movie could have been a lot better had it stayed to the original story and put more effort into the filming and special effects. The only compliment I could give to Jackson's work is his courage to re-innovate the industry with his use of high frame rate filming. It gave a unique feel to the film, but at times it resembled quality of old British television and highlighted his production flaws even more. The only reason one should consider watching this movie is to bring closure to the previous two films. Otherwise stay away from the entire trilogy and read the book instead."
"zkonedog","5","4","5","4 March 2017"," A Rather Middling Ending To Middle Earth On The Big Screen
","As a fan of all things Middle Earth, I was pumped up to see the conclusion of the film forays into Tolkien's universe. I absolutely loved the LOTR trilogy, as well as the first two Hobbit installments. Though I did not like the decision to split the small-ish book into three long films, a selfish part of me was kind of glad that I would have three more opportunities to see this franchise in theaters. Unfortunately, ""Battle of the Five Armies"" ran out of really good material to cover, and it showed.<br/><br/>In this film, we see the dragon Smaug descending upon Lake-town in a fury, having discovered that his hoard of gold has been infiltrated by Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). Bard (Luke Evans), the protector of Lake-town, discovers the ""chink in Smaug's armor"" and puts an end to the dragon's reign. With a pile of treasure now ripe for the taking, the Battle of the Five Armies begins, primarily egged on by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who has a sort of ""dragon treasure fever"" take hold of him.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that Tolkien's ""Battle of the Five Armies"" isn't enough to make an entire movie out of. Going by the text itself, I believe it only constitutes about 50 or so pages! It seems as if director Peter Jackson got a little battle-happy, as posturing for battles and the battles themselves constitute a great portion of the film. Perhaps, however, that was almost required because of the trilogy of films (what else could you have the characters do?).<br/><br/>I think what really got exposed here is that ""The Hobbit"" isn't (and never was meant to be) a story about battles. The LOTR book trilogy is an epic, to be sure, but ""Hobbit"" is much more of a children's tale, full of fun and frivolity. It has its serious, canon moments to be sure, but it is a very simple tale compared to LOTR. The first two Hobbit films actually do a really good job of re- creating that levity while still maintain an LOTR-esque sense of gravitas. In ""Five Armies"", though, the subject material left over is all about posturing, speeches, and battles. What was meant (and rightly so) as a somewhat speedy (yet logical) completion of the book cannot sustain a two and a half hour film.<br/><br/>There are subplots involving Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Tauriel (Evangeline Lily), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), but I found that material to be quite lackluster as well. It tries to set up the events of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" in a prequel-esque sort of way, but I never really felt that sense of ""oh, that's cool!"" at all. Again, probably because such scenes are not in the Hobbit novel and thus don't feel quite right.<br/><br/>All that being said, this isn't a terrible movie. Jackson still has his directing touch, the battles are visually impressive, and the music/atmosphere is always so distinctly Middle Earth that one cannot help but be transported into that universe, if you will. Howard Shore's incredible music helps too.<br/><br/>Overall, though, after about 20 minutes into the film when Smaug breathes his last, it becomes unnecessarily (though necessary to sustain an entire third part) bloated and overplayed. It's too bad that one of the greatest book-to-film translations of all-time has to go out on just an ""okay"" note."
"Westeire","3","44","93","13 December 2014"," The hobbit a disappointing trilogy.
","If Jackson had followed the same logic with LOTR we would have 12 movies for those 3 books. I am a big fan of LOTR three movies. They were well made. I think i was a cheap shot with the Hobbit. Acting not great (of course Ian Mckellen is fantastic, so is Kate B..) Its practically a flat semi comedy with the elves. Not the worst movie of all time, but when you set expectations high with LOTR then you expect something similar with the hobbit.. and it never came. I could never see myself sitting down to watch these 3 movies again. He could have have made at most 2 movies. The first hobbit movie was good. I think the last 2 just don't do justice."
"therocksbarneyreviews","5","35","72","11 December 2014"," A very disappointing conclusion to a trilogy that could have been on par with that of the Lord of the Rings.
","""The Battle of the Five Armies"" unfortunately lets down the films that come before it in the trilogy that is ""The Hobbit"". The film's director/Peter Jackson's failure to find the right balance between battle and plot content, which could be attributed to a laziness of sorts, is the reason for that. It's probably also fair to state that it could be attributed to how coming out of the film, I felt that I was the semi-victim of what has now become relatively common in Hollywood, the tactic that is turning a film into 2 or 3, and often labelled as a money-grabbing one. In regards to how Jackson fails to find the balance between the battle and plot content in ""The Battle of the Five Armies"", contrasting with something he had done so well in ""Return of the King"", it is almost as if he was hoping that the audience wouldn't notice how little plot the film actually has, by instead packing it with a battle. This really is the films downfall. Even where there is opportunity for Jackson to pack in some plot, I'm referring to the ending in particular here, he doesn't take it. Instead we are left with a film whose second half is mindless, whose violence can be described as that too and just there as a means of filling a third film. Where Jackson does insert plot content, it comes not from the original Tolkien book, which for me was what made the first two films of the trilogy so good, but from God knows where. (To be fair to Jackson a lot of what was in those first two films was not from the book. Yet at least they seemed like they could have been compared to rubbish like the relationship between Tauriel the elf and Fili the dwarf in this film for example!) I suppose it could be argued that I just preferred the quest format of the first two films. The lack of plot content also manages to have had an effect on the relationships audience members had been developing with characters since the start of the trilogy. I found that, by the end of ""The Battle of the Five Armies"", I did not care nearly as much about the Dwarfs as I previously had. The film's ending again doesn't help here. The battle scenes also do well to bore the audience and detach from not only the film, but also from the relationships that they had been developing. What is the saving grace of the film though, is its first half, up to where the battle begins, the turning-point from which the film begins to go downhill for me. Whilst watching the first half of the film I began to wonder whether I would be walking out of this cinema by the end of the film thinking that ""The Hobbit"" trilogy was on par with, or perhaps even better than that of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. There were several moments in the first half where I found myself quietly whispering to my neighbour ""that was awesome"" whilst demanding fist bumps off him. Even when the battle started, I was excited, and deservedly so. Jackson deserves praise for those battle scenes. I'm sure that if I was to tune into the film at random the battle scene at hand would keep me gripped. But an hour and a half or so later and with the same shots as well as the same battles, I found that my enthusiasm had depleted. What I thought could save the film from there was a decent ending, yet unfortunately this never came. In regards to performances, it's always difficult to stand out in an epic like this, but I felt that although Martin Freeman (playing Bilbo Baggins) and Ian McKellen (playing Gandalf) had both put in good performances previously in the trilogy, this was by far their weakest. The only performance really worth praising in regards to ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is Luke Evans' (playing Bard), in what seems to be a coming-of-age story for him. Ultimately, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" first half is its saving grace, yet its battle-filled second half, poor ending, and lack of plot content let it down, making it a very disappointing conclusion to something that could have been, for me, on par with the original Lord of the Rings trilogy."
"oskari-ratinen","3","20","38","5 January 2015"," Peter Jackson is a genius...
","...at milking money out of gullible fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's work, myself included. And that's about it. This final part of The Hobbit ""trilogy"" shows no sign of him having any storytelling talent left. What little redeeming qualities this movie has, I'll go through in the end. Now, a long list of faults and failures:<br/><br/><ul><li>Smaug. He was the main villain in the book. Now we get five minutes of him in the beginning. Unforgivable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The way Bard kills Smaug. Being an archer myself, this scene made me cringe in physical pain. What in the world were you thinking, Jackson? Why didn't you just give him a ballista or at least a very large crossbow? If you know anything about archery at all, you know that you would never be able to shoot an arrow like that with a broken bow at all, let alone that distance at that speed and so accurately.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alfrid. OK, we get it, he's a selfish, greedy, egocentric, cowardly vermin. You don't need to rub it in at every turn. It's obvious that Alfrid was supposed to be some sort of Gríma Wormtongue part two, but whereas Gríma had a motivation to be ""evil"", Alfrid just is all out evil and no good with no humane features whatsoever. Unforgivable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dwarf - Elf love story. Against the lore, no depth, no plausible reason for the characters to be in love, no chemistry between the two actors, no purpose in the greater story. Why?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bilbo's role in the movie. At times I forgot he even existed, and he is supposed to be the main character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The giant worms. So, you have these massive worms that can eat their way straight through a mountain and you use them to...drill a few tunnels for the orcs to walk? Why not have them surface directly below the enemy formation to send them into disarray? Why not send them to weaken the enemy fortifications and bring them down?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dáin riding a pig. Yes, a mighty dwarven king is riding a pig in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The battle of the five armies begins with the dwarfs forming a solid shield wall across the valley floor. The orcs have no missile troops to mention, whereas the elves, now protected by the dwarven shield wall, have rank upon rank of deadly archers, and what do the elves do? Whittle the enemy down with their arrows, as any sensible commander would have them do in such a situation? No. They ninja jump over the dwarfs into close combat with the orcs, throwing the major tactical advantage of the shield wall straight out of the window. It's as if Jackson paid the medieval warfare experts that he used in LOTR trilogy to not take part in the making of this ""trilogy"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Where in Tolkien's lore does it state that dwarfs ride goats? I know that it happens in World of Warcraft, but Middle Earth? And where did the goats suddenly come from?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wait. Azog's supposed plan was to lure Thorin, Fili, Kili and Dwalin into a trap, which they would have been unable to walk into without the goats, so maybe Azog sent them to the dwarfs. Yeah, it suddenly makes sense. Or not.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bard riding a wagon into a troll, Trolls used as battering rams, Legolas riding a bat, Legolas using his sword as a joystick to crash a troll into a tower, the ensuing duel on top of that crumbling tower, Azog's choice of weapon (a huge slab of stone on a long chain) for a duel on a frozen lake, go ahead and have your pick for the silliest moment of the movie from these.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Eagles. Yeah, I know the Eagles were originally used in The Hobbit. Yeah, I know they were supposed to be present in the battle. Then why for the love of all the gods of all possible pantheons do they have the smallest role of any six Tolkien movies that Jackson made in this particular one? We get about 15 seconds of them. And Beorn? Five seconds. I'm not kidding you. Five seconds.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thranduil tells Legolas to go and search for Aragorn. What? Why? They don't know each other when they first meet in LOTR trilogy, and at the time of Battle of the Five Armies Aragorn is in fact a 10 year old boy being raised and guarded in Rivendell, not a ranger known as Strider, so what the hell Jackson?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No closure whatsoever. Seriously. We're not told that Dáin became the King under the Mountain, we're not told that the lake people will begin to rebuild Dale, we're not told what happens to the gold, we're not told what happens to the remaining dwarfs, we're not shown the funeral of Thorin, Fili and Kili, NOTHING. The movie just ends without answering the usual questions raised by a trilogy of movies.</li></ul><br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie was the cast. Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman were both brilliant and others did a fine job as well, but with material and directing so weak, they simply can't do much to prevent the movie being a piece of turd. 3/10, and all the points go to the actors and their work."
"dreamdemon-1","4","24","47","18 December 2014"," Not a proper Middle Earth send-off
","This movie is total injustice done to the Middle Earth universe and I took off points for being so far off an appropriate ending to the Jackson's Middle Earth saga. For a movie that teased via Billy Boyd's beautiful song, the promised battle spends too much time on a character called Alfried whose sole purpose is to annoy and a completely pointless and cheap romance between Tauriel and Kili (of whom book readers know he's destined to die).<br/><br/>Overall the movie reads as a pure comedy.<br/><br/>There are some really funny moments that simply weren't meant to be like: <br/><br/><ul><li>Smaug's death reminded me of Mulan's Mushu the fire lizard: freeze, twitch, dramatically cough and fall flat, just like he got squashed in mid-air. Kind of like my cat when he runs out of energy after playing. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thorin is cheaply vilified (he simply goes crazy for no apparent reason, while in the book he's more ambiguous - unfair to people of Laketown because they seem to associate with elves who have no justification for their demands) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thranduil, majestic as *bleep*, doesn't seem phased by being in a fight (his hair remains perfect, tiara unmoved) - really, now? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tauriel pauses from pursuing the ""love of her life"" in the middle of a battle to spend a moment blasting Thranduil for living a loveless life. In the middle of a battle! With orcs closing in on everyone, Thranduil's soldiers dead literally at their feet and she nags at him because he doesn't understand that she loves one of the dwarfs that made elves lives miserable for centuries. In the middle of a battle where they were protecting said dwarfs' ancient home!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thranduil is portrayed even more mad than Thorin. After all he covets a treasure over which he has no apparent claim. The dwarfs actually worked for that treasure, digging metal from the mountain, minting coin and crafting jewels. Bard was promised a share for helping dwarfs. While Thranduil tried to blackmail his way after shunning the dwarfs away when the dragon took over their home.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Legolas jumps on falling rocks like he's the Prince of Persia. That was hilarious! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Were-worms pop out, roar and never to be seen again. Just like they realized they need to return to Dune! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We get a really looooong shot of dying Kili. He dies, it's dramatic, but after a few seconds of drama he runs out of faces to make. I was expecting The Mask to pop-out of somewhere and demand an Oscar for this performance. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf sighs and poofs with every opportunity, rolling his eyes and pausing for cheap effect. Not at all necessary. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tauriel drops orcs in a stride with two slashes at most, but gets bested out of the blue after poking the last one 5 times? Get real! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alfrid has no point in existing, at all. His comic relief made me think of Seth Rogen or Sascha Baron Cohen ... in a fantasy battle! Why torture the audience like that? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The orcs are cut off cardboard, Defiler included. In the original Trilogy they had some personality, here they're nothing but props.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thorin's group was all armoured, helmets on and whatnot inside the mountain but when finally decided to fight they left all the battle gear behind. Huh?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What happened to the Arkenstone? Bard just kept it? That's what the movie suggests (yeah, I read the book, I know what happens *there*)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What happened with the gold, promises, etc? They spend 3/4 of the movie fighting over it and then just forget it?</li></ul><br/><br/>Otherwise, the FX are nice, most of the battle is entertaining but the move lacks substance through and through. The first Hobbit was far superior and I really wish Jackson hadn't tortured me with this underachieving mutant, that's not how I want to remember his Middle Earth. The drama is artificial, cheap and the attempts at humor (where intentional) are even worse."
"bdchan305","2","19","36","29 December 2014"," Wow. Really?
","Kudos to Martin Freeman who has been excellent throughout the whole trilogy. My low rating is certainly not because of his acting.<br/><br/>I love The Hobbit stories and LOTR. The Hobbit was originally intended by Tolkien as a children's story. The 1st Hobbit movie preserved some of the fun of the book by including the dwarfs helping Bilbo wash up while singing and juggling his precious plates - ""smash the dishes, crash the plates, that's what Bilbo Baggins hates"".<br/><br/>By the 3rd Hobbit movie all sense of fun has been hopelessly and utterly lost. It has become simply one epic battle after another. I don't mind a little extra action, but there was really a lot of gratuitous, pointless action added simply because it will be good for the upcoming games.<br/><br/>And that really is my big complaint, some extra action/adventure, extra romance, updated goblins (Orcs), updated elves - all of this could be fine. But they messed with the STORY too much.<br/><br/>In conclusion - I am deeply disappointed in this movie, and in the entire Hobbit trilogy in general. It really could have been done in 1 movie or at most 2. The ONLY reason for 3 movies was to milk us for yet more money.<br/><br/>Perhaps this weekend I will curl up with the book and enjoy the story the way it was meant to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS, SPECIFIC DETAILS BELOW ** <br/><br/>The part where Legolas climbs up the falling bridge stones? REALLY? It might work in cartoons, and yes this is a fantasy movie, but to me that was utterly ridiculous. The part where Legolas grabs a ride from one of the bats? Totally useless, probably included just so it can be added to the game - just like the water ride in the previous movie.<br/><br/>Everything to do with The Master of Laketown and ""Alfrid"". Ugh. These are not characters, they are caricatures. There is nothing redeeming about them. Their slapstick antics are stupid, add nothing to the story and were not funny.<br/><br/>The whole thing with Bard the Bowman being a criminal/outcast/in jail. Being the Captain of the Guard who stands his ground with a small platoon of archers against the dragon wasn't dramatic enough? Will he get out of jail in time to fight the dragon? Will his son die a fiery death? By that time I didn't care.<br/><br/>And finally - the most egregious change of all. The entire White Council vs. the Necromancer sequences. Gandalf and the Council did not know that the Necromancer was in fact Sauron until well into LOTR. But here in the Hobbit everyone knows that Sauron has returned. So how can they be so surprised in LOTR? Gandalf knows Sauron has returned but waits to the last possible moment to research the ring and confront Saruman? If Gandalf knows Sauron has returned, and he knows Bilbo has a magic ring, then why can't he put 2 and 2 together?"
"alex-matschy","2","23","45","23 December 2014"," Based on a novel by J.R.R. Tolkien? Not really!
","The positive stuff at first: <br/><br/>The beginning scenes were really well done. As in the first two movies and the Lord of the Rings, the scenery is truly amazing throughout the whole film, and 3d effects were really thrilling and fascinating. The dragon was very impressive. <br/><br/>Well, that's everything positive. This movie is definitely one for which I want my money back. Expectations were low (since the first two parts weren't half as good as Lord of the Rings), but I still left the theater in disappointment.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Tolkiens books and loved Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Those were great film adaptations, bringing middle earth to life, taking characters serious, telling great stories, respecting the book. Even many dialogs were directly from the novels.<br/><br/>Is the Hobbit trilogy a good movie adaptation? You bet it's not! Fine, making a movie from a book requires some changes, but that's no excuse for everything. This movie is full of very poor additional scenes that add a dimension of inappropriate / unintended comedy throughout the whole film destroying all the magic. <br/><br/>Did ""The Hobbit"" really need a man dressed as woman permanently adjusting his fake boobs? Legolas killing orcs with Mexican wrestling moves? Troll monsters running their heads against brick walls? In my eyes the film would have been better without all those absurdities.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that this movie fails to be anything similar to the book, it is so far away from being good entertainment.<br/><br/>The action scenes were way over the top, and thanks to this, boring. For a 2 ½ hour movie, the story is very thin. Same as in the first parts, dialogs seem constructed and fake. What is the point about never- ending monologues about friendship, promises and loyalty?<br/><br/>I think if this novel would have been split into two movies, it could have become really good. Kind of makes me sad that it has been destroyed in such way just to make even more money. Unfortunately it worked; I might not be the only one who went into the third part<br/><br/>So, if you love Tolkiens literature, and hope for a good movie adaption, my suggestion to you is to stay at home and save the money."
"zeljko-acimovic","1","32","66","15 December 2014"," Comedy full of awesomeness
","Well, as i was reading user comments, i kinda felt stupid because i haven't done it before i went to cinema. The movie is full of awesomeness and to be honest, i really did have a good laugh :). Well i guess most of the ""awesome"" scenes include super awesome goats, giant bats, gigantic worms that came out from Dina etc. This movie is so close to bollywood low budget series ... lots of dramatic scenes with camera focus from one person to another with mind-blowing dialogs - and i really mean it MIND-BLOWING. The script is by far the worst part of this movie and it also dominates with it's awesomeness. I really think the movie would be at least 30% better if they didn't talk at all - ""I'll be back"" will be sufficient :). I don't know if the writer is insane, or maybe the director who approved such retarded script. This is by far the greatest fail of Peter Jackson and his crew and i will really consider if i should watch any of his next movies. So bad Pete, so bad..."
"bondenblade","3","27","55","12 December 2014"," Poor show
","So just left the cinema after having seen this and yeah a bit disappointed. The previous two films whilst still flawed still gave plenty of positive talking points but this was more negative. In short:<br/><br/>Script: Poor and and overly contrived in places<br/><br/>Billy Connolly: Gash, stick to bad comedy instead of adding bad acting to the list, to be fair he had some terrible lines to give like ""let's get the bastards/lets finish these buggers"" etc, and he can head butt, with his bare head (and impunity), orcs wearing metal armor helmets and kill them. Kind of diminishes the threat rendering it down to a more slapstick comedy level. Yawn.<br/><br/>Tauriel/love interest story line: Pointless, should have never been in the films in the first place. Unless you are covering demographics for short term returns.<br/><br/>Troll/giants?: Don't know what they were (more Hollywood style embellishment from newzealandwood) but they have never existed in Tolkien's world. Anyway they make an appearance for the orc/sauron side in the battle and given there size you would have thought unstoppable, but no, an arrow is enough. Again diminished threat, no scare. Yawn. <br/><br/>CG: Over used, very little organic feel to the films unless your are in bag end of course, but then that was real. Think there is a lesson there. <br/><br/>So that's most of it, there were more bad points, but that's the majority. <br/><br/>Why 3 stars? Well there are some moments, smaug at the start, Gladadriel v sauron + wraiths was interesting and would have liked to have seen more of angmar. But the good points are far and few between. <br/><br/>In sum this film was like what Sam called Gollum in LOTR ""a stinker"".<br/><br/>Yo Pete if you are reading this, try dropping phil boyens, andy serkis + any other toady sycophants that keep telling you stuff is good when it really sucks a*s. Oh and maybe get rid of Frans influence as well. Sorry, got to shoot from the hip. <br/><br/>Redeem yourself with the extended.<br/><br/>Actually while I'm here, make Bad Taste 2, watched Bad Taste the other week for the hundredth or so time, and yeah, its a wee masterpiece. What's Derek up to in space? Come on, your a Jackson...Jackson's don't run! :-)"

Not knowing the story, he still were 15 steps ahead. The VFX are horrible and the 3D makes it look like at 80' attempt on making movies. The dragon dies 5 minutes in... why not kill it in the 2 movie and have it alt least have a ending. This is the crystal skulls of sequels, but Indy alt least had some sort of a plot. Every set looks like cardbroad made in former Russia and the costumes seems like its made for a second grade school play.

"Nino-Vidak","2","19","37","29 December 2014"," Tolkien is turning in his grave
","First of all, I'd like to say that I've read all of Tolken books and I think that he is the best fiction author of all time (for me, anyway). I've never written a comment, but this movie forced me to do something i thought impossible.<br/><br/>I know that movies and books are two different things, people say that all the time, so to be honest, I'll write two comments. <br/><br/>Let's first look on this movie as just that, a movie (disregard the book)<br/><br/>The movie was very boring, I yawned at least ten times. The title of this movie is The Battle of the Five Armies, and I thought that implies there is going to be a battle. You know, epic battle, arrows flying, mayhem, swords clashing, dead bodies everywhere..., a real battle. Sure, you can insert some politics, romantic stories, duels, landscape videos, ... to appease all, but my God, is the real battle to much to ask for. OK, let's ignore the battle. Still, after two previous movies, I didn't (couldn't) connect with any character in this movie. Love story between she-elf and dwarf - the dialogs, the flirting - so beautiful. Next time i would like to see the love story between two male orcs. Or Legolas and the orc. This is an unexplored area. There were many duels in this movie - duels that were so unrealistic, so impossible that made me wonder: does physics exist? Then there is CGI... this is the worst thing that has happened in new movies. Can we please put some extras in a movie. I will do it for free. I liked dragon, armored dwarfs, landscape, ruined town, so... effects. I suppose that is enough for this high movie rating. My God...<br/><br/>Now, for all those that have read the book.<br/><br/>I really wanted this movie to be good. But this movie is a huge disappointment. I think this is the first time ever I wanted my money back. Approximately 90% of the movie has nothing to do with the book, even the title doesn't make sense. This movie is a spit on Tolkens legacy. I really want the producers of this movie to enjoy in all the money that they have earned, I hope it was worth it."
"nikes_kfh","9","19","37","19 December 2014"," About the movie and it's reviews
","I never bother to make a movie review but there are some things I had to say after seeing this website's reviews.<br/><br/>First of all the reviews with 1-4 stars should be auto deleted. Have you seen a 4 out of ten star movie ? I have and I have to tell you it's NOTHING like the hobbit...<br/><br/>People bitching about deviations from the books (Legolas-Tauriel). THE BOOKS ARE WRITTEN AS A CHILDREN STORY. If they did the whole movie line to line, it would be 3 hours long (just 1 movie and not 3) and it would be for 12 year old kids. Even now, they didn't cut anything important.<br/><br/>People now days like to bitch about anything. If lotr1 came out tomorrow it would get 1 out of 10 stars because they cut the whole Tom Bombadil/Barrow downs part. People would get crazy literally. Yet because the internet was not filled with nerdy kids back then, it got the rating/reviews it deserved.<br/><br/>Actual Movie Review:<br/><br/>Acting was excellent from all actors. Especially Bilbo and Thorin parts. Voice acting was also excellent, again especially the parts where thorin was speaking with Smaug's voice.<br/><br/>Some parts were a bit over the top, like Legolas grabbing the bat or Azog manages to flow and break the ice while inside the water. Again though nothing that important to make it bad.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit rushed in my opinion, but again no big deal. They could show a bit more about after battle situation in esgaroth/mountain, or even Mordor/Mirkwood, but then again the Hobbit part is over. If anyone's more interested about what happened afterwords, read the books.<br/><br/>This movie was Awesome just like the other 2 movies, and a perfect finale to the trilogy."

Tauriel doesn't even exist - Peter Jackson created her to create a stupid love triangle so teen girls would come see the movie. Azog is a small reference - a one sentence reference - in the book. He's supposed to be a goblin, and it's his uncle that's after Thorin's family. But it's ONE SENTENCE, not even a plot. Plus, CGI. Peter Jackson did MARVELOUS with the LOTR trilogy! Actual actors, makeup - even Treebeard was a real, animated-built tree! Very frustrated with this film. The Unexpected Journey stuck the closest to the book. Went WAY downhill from there."
"avik-basu1889","7","5","7","17 April 2015"," A reasonably satisfying conclusion to the Middle Earth saga !!!
","I personally love the original Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson, but only as commercial blockbusters. I never viewed them as anything deep or anything which demands too much analysis. However from a technological and visual standpoint, the original trilogy was almost revolutionary. They were epic, visually exhilarating thrill rides. But I do think Jackson should have left Middle Earth after the Return of the King. There was no need to go back to that world and make prequels by breaking one book into 3 movies. I didn't like the first 2 movies of the Hobbit trilogy that much. They were mediocre summer popcorn films with too much melodrama and shiny CGI and green screen. This 3rd and last film, although not being anywhere near as good as the films in the original trilogy, is certainly better than its predecessors.<br/><br/>This film opens with an absolutely mesmerising action set piece which is visually spectacular. From then on it has its ups and downs. The battle scenes and action scenes are very well directed, but the non-action scenes leave you extremely underwhelmed. There are attempts made by Jackson to make extremely dramatic scenes and also to continue a love triangle which started in the 2nd film, but they all look and feel cheesy and not at all convincing. So without a doubt, the fighting scenes are the ones that make this film.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, nothing special or remarkable. To be honest, a film like this is more about the spectacular visuals and action, and less about acting skills. Most of the characters are black and white. There is no grey area. Except a few, every other character is just there to say a few lines and start fighting.<br/><br/>This new trilogy uses a lot of CGI and green screens. One of the most important aspects why I liked the original trilogy was the fact that the orcs in the original films were real people wearing costumes. That's not the case here which negatively affects the convincing factor as far as I am concerned. <br/><br/>So all in all, this last film of the trilogy is flawed. But I will be lying if I say I didn't have fun with it. This is a very watchable summer popcorn flick with great fight scenes, visuals and fantastic action. Just don't expect anything more in terms of character depth and narrative layers, and you will find yourself satisfied."

Even the 10 year old kids in the cinema were laughing to some of the parts of the movie. Maybe Peter Jackson targeted ''under 10'' kids with this movie but to see 13 dwarfs turning out to be the the turning point of the battle in which forces of good were about to loose (remember, in Lord of the ring: Return of the king'' it took a whole army of undead warriors with Aragorn to lead them to turn the course of the battle). Those same dwarfs were running in panic in previous 2 movies from couple of orks and in this final chapter of hobbit saga they single-handedly won the battle of 5 armies!?!?!?!?<br/><br/>Maybe it was me expecting to much but this movie was simply awful!!!"
"shawneofthedead","7","15","28","16 December 2014"," A decent, if problematic, final chapter for the Hobbit trilogy.
","There's simply no denying it: The Hobbit is no The Lord Of The Rings. While cast and production values remain absolutely top-notch, the first two films in the Hobbit trilogy have proved disappointing, especially when assessed against the sublime trio of movies that first transported us to Middle-earth. It's evident that the slim narrative of J.R.R. Tolkien's source novel - even when supplemented with details and backstory from his Appendices - simply doesn't merit an expansion into three unnecessarily protracted movies. Strictly speaking, The Battle Of The Five Armies suffers from many of the same problems as its predecessors. But director Peter Jackson proves once again that he's a dab hand at crafting epic battles underpinned by love, loyalty and sacrifice. As a result, the final Hobbit film is (more or less) the best of the trilogy, although it still pales in comparison to what comes after it.<br/><br/>Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarven company of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) watch in horror as Smaug the dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch) lays waste to Laketown. When Bard (Luke Evans) bravely manages to take the dragon out, Thorin regains the mountain kingdom of Erebor by default. He succumbs swiftly to the 'Dragon Sickness' - a hungering greed to keep the treasures of Erebor all to himself, refusing a claim from elven king Thranduil (Lee Pace) and rewards for Bard and the now-homeless humans. As a battle brews between dwarfs, elves and men, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) returns from Dol Goldur with news that entire battalions of orcs are on the march as well - signs of an incipient evil that might soon sweep Middle-earth again.<br/><br/>Truth be told, The Battle Of The Five Armies doesn't have quite the sense of magic and poetry that so effortlessly infuses the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Indeed, the script is peppered with simplistic dialogue, with many characters forced to navigate entire chunks of exposition or deliver not particularly witty one-liners. Bilbo and Gandalf, for instance, spend a great deal of the raging battle standing still and expounding on what's going on around them. It also seems remarkably odd for a film weighted down with so many characters, including wholly invented ones like lovelorn elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), that so much screen time is devoted to Alfrid (Ryan Gage). The vile right- hand man of Laketown's Master (Stephen Fry) is clearly meant to provide comic relief now that the dwarfs are caught up in emotional turmoil of their own, but winds up annoying rather than entertaining the audience.<br/><br/>And yet, Jackson somehow manages to salvage the film from itself, in no small part because of the engrossing battle scenes and some deft character work from his stellar cast. The climactic battle stretches well over an hour, as the upper hand shifts from orcs to everyone else and back again, but Jackson keeps the action and drama coming thick and fast. Waves of orcs slam into ragged battle lines of men, ranks of elves swell and rise, and Thorin wavers between greed and honour as he decides whether to plunge into war or stay safely sequestered within the impregnable walls of Erebor. Many of the battle sequences may be technically extraneous, but it's hard to care too much when Legolas (Orlando Bloom) - scoring his requisite action-hero moment - dances his way to safety over a collapsing bridge and takes out an orc or two while doing so.<br/><br/>Jackson's cast - actors we've spent so much time with over the past decade - rises remarkably to the occasion. There's stellar support, as always, from fan favourites like McKellen and Cate Blanchett, whose Galadriel goes briefly supernova in a confrontation which foreshadows the darkness that will befall Middle-earth come The Lord Of The Rings. Armitage lends considerable depth and weight to Thorin, who could easily lose a great deal of audience sympathy when he burrows further into himself and starts losing (and banishing) friends. Pace exudes a solemn, almost malevolent dignity as Thranduil, one which he tempers with a surprising amount of heart as well. For a brief, touching moment, the imperious king finds within himself the father he has forgotten how to be. Even Lilly, who is saddled with a made-up character and fledgling, forbidden romance with dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), miraculously mines some genuine emotion from a fairly poorly-conceived and utterly fictitious love story.<br/><br/>The true triumph of the Hobbit franchise, however, remains Freeman. He's playing the same archetype that Elijah Wood did in The Lord Of The Rings - the homebody Hobbit who's small in stature yet casts an enormous shadow - but makes it feel thoroughly fresh. Freeman's Bilbo is equal parts heart, humour and hero, and he makes it easy to see why Gandalf holds hobbits in such high esteem. Freeman's scenes with Armitage, rife with paranoia and tension on Thorin's part, are some of the best in the film, with a huge emotional payoff at the end.<br/><br/>With The Battle Of The Five Armies, the curtain really does fall at last on Jackson's vision of Middle-earth. In the past three years, it's been - frankly - a pretty bumpy journey. In too many ways, the Hobbit trilogy recalls but never quite manages to recapture the indescribable magic of The Lord Of The Rings. That's true of the final film in the franchise as well. But it certainly comes closer than either of its two predecessors to truly making Middle-earth live again. The film's final scenes quite literally bring everything home, and in that final swell of music and emotion, throw open the doors to the epic world that Jackson first invited us into over a decade ago."

"ajs709","5","18","35","13 December 2014"," Ultimately Unfulfilling
","As a huge fan of the literature and the original Rings trilogy, I was eagerly anticipating this film. Ultimately though, I left the cinema feeling...well, nothing really. Is this really the same team that produced such emotionally evocative, at times beautiful, films? One can scarcely believe it. Unfortunately they seem to have developed the ethos that the only way to gratify us, the audience, is by relentlessly pounding us with scenes that are not only ludicrously implausible but which often skirt on the utterly ridiculous. The odd moment of absurdity can be excused (or may even be welcome) but this film is saturated with them to the point of just making the whole thing lack credence. And that just makes me, personally, not care. I cannot be invested in characters or a particular plot with all these nonsensical, slapstick things going on around them. What I liked about the original trilogy was that when someone did something impressive it had impact; now such events happen so frequently I was left thinking - so what? Yet another folly in one long stupidity. I'm sure the film-makers are trying to push the envelope, create ever more interesting and ""never seen that before"" moments but I think in this instance the story (thin to start with) suffers. All the strengths of the original trilogy in regards to clarity of story-line, pacing and script-writing were the weaknesses of this film. It was cut together in a rather haphazard, confusing manner leading to situations like ""oh right, we've got the bad guys up this hill and the good guys on the other side of the valley...but we need them to come together for the final face-off...so..how about...yes, I know...MASSIVE GOAT-THINGS!"". No rhyme, no reason. Massive Goat- things. Sigh. Sometimes just because you can doesn't mean you should. For large segments of the film I was wondering ""what the devil is going on"" and I've read the book a thousand times and seen the first two films. And then when a scene with supposed emotional impact crops up it feels forced and incongruous, which can never be said about the original trilogy (which I still think has some of the most poignant, touching and beautifully delivered scenes ever). And this is not a slur on the actors, who perform well. But they are saying things or acting parts that just don't fit and are at odds with the goofball antics that gaudily dominates the screen-time. And the script has its apparent frailties - Tauriel uttering those trashy lines ""why does it hurt so bad"" or something. I mean come on. That line is 100% Twilight. Lazy. If you can't think of anything for her to say, don't have her say anything. She is an elf, a race so profound and deep and mysterious. And they have her spouting that prescribed, hollow garbage. In fact this whole contrived Tauriel- Kili romance is feeble, perhaps indicative of the ""too much screen- time, not enough material"" thread that seem to runs through this trilogy. This was the opposite problem faced by the original trilogy (too much material, not enough screen time) which was solved with such aplomb. All I can think is that the team are better at adapting existing story-lines than creating story-lines de novo. Or at least in finding a place for them in the film. I wanted to like it so much...but the bits I was waiting to see (death of Smaug, Gandalf entering the fray dramatically just as the good guys were about to cross swords, Beorn laying the smack down, Dol Guldur) either never materialised or were poorly executed. Ultimately Unfulfilling."

"xavi_pal","3","14","26","21 December 2014"," The Hobbit meets Transformers
","**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** As a Tolkien's fan, i was critic of the previous two movies. But at least they were actual movies, with a plot. The same can't be said of this last chapter of an unnecessary trilogy for The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Right at the first scene of the movie i sensed i was in for a bad ride. There was not even an introduction to set the whole film to a start, it began right in the middle of the action, and it remained there for the whole film. There was simply no traditional beginning-plot-ending of any other movie. The whole thing was a mess of bad CGI action that arched from ludicrous to pathetic and cheap. I can say with certainty that I've played video games with a better constructed plot.<br/><br/>As far as the battles that take place, the whole action felt fake beyond any measure. The hordes of Orcs were nothing but identical CGI dummies. Long gone are the days of The Fellowship of the Ring were so much effort were placed in making each orc and goblin unique with real make-up and live actors. The ugly, ragged and deformed Orcs we saw in the LOTR are thus substituted by Fully armored from head to toe hulks that are prone of dying of any head concussion or light breeze. Now that would not be so bad, considering thats how modern Hollywood likes its movies, if there had been thrown something else in the rest of the movie. But we find ourselves completely out of luck.<br/><br/>The other ""subplots"" of the movie are even more annoying and ridiculous:<br/><br/>-The ""love"" story i have a personal issue with, as it goes against any lore in the Tolkien world. Not only it does not take place in any way in the book, but to any person knowledgeable of the lore it is simply put an abomination. An inmortal ancient elf falls in love with a short, dirty and simple dwarf, whose peoples are bitter enemies from time immemorial, for no apparent reason AT ALL. The whole love story is cheesy and badly written.<br/><br/>-Dol Guldur scene: It takes place parallel to the main ""plot"". I had enjoyed the previous 2 movies of this subplot, that don't take place in the book but are referenced indirectly when Gandalfs tells the dwarfs during their trip that he has to part ways for a time. This time though it fell in even more ludicrousness than before. In this small scene we have not one, not two, but three Deus ex machina that come to save the day, one more unlikely than the other. We have Elrond that decides for no reason to abandon his home in Rivendel (something he hasn't done in thousands of years) to appear at the right time to save gandalf. Then there is a Kung Fu master Saruman that would put bruce lee to shame and to top it all Galadriel that decides to abandon too her ancestral home in Lothlorien and take action in middle earth affairs for the first time since the fall of Numenor. Not only that, but apparently she is an ALL Powerful witch that can banish SAURON with a hand gesture. Really a feat out of reach of even Gandalf, a minor GOD with a ring of power. Stupid beyond measure.<br/><br/>We could go on and on of all the minor details of this abomination but i really don't have the time to write it all down. A few honorable mentions are magically appearing war goats, a transvestite, legolas as the Chosen One from The Matrix and giant sized trolls that go down with a stroke of a dagger or a single arrow.<br/><br/>Its also worthy of note that we find don't find such thing as an ending for the story. Nothing gets really resolved, or at least, we are not told. The whole movie was about different factions fighting for the treasure of the mountain. At the end of the battle when all settles down, we are left without knowing what happened to that treasure. No mention of burial rites for Thorin, no mention of who is the new king under the mountain, no mention of the bloody elves and their gems, no mention of the Archstone destiny, no mention of what happens to the humans from the city lake. There is no ending at all.<br/><br/>As a last commentary I would have wished that Orlando Bloom had the same integrity of Viggo Mortensen when he was offered a part in the movie. We can see here the complete lack of artistic integrity and love for the original work, to these people this whole trilogy was nothing more than a milk cow. Amazingly, Viggo was offered to play Aragorn, a character that like Legolas doesn't appear in the book, but not only that, it takes place 60 years before the lord of the rings, so old Viggo would have to had played a young 25 year old. We have to deeply thank Viggo for that, and by doing nothing he has gained much more respect from me than Peter jackson ever will.<br/><br/>Avoid this ""movie"" like ebola."
"dominic0078","6","14","26","18 December 2014"," Why?
","First of all, let me begin by saying that I am not what you would call a Tolkien fan, neither have I read the book (although I have read the LOTR ones). However, I really enjoyed the whole story (incl. the 6 movies) and feel sad that it's probably over.<br/><br/>That said, I must admit that the last part of this second trilogy didn't live up to my expectations, which can't have been that high. It's not because of the acting (on the contrary, I found it rather great). It is mostly because of 3 main things:<br/><br/>a) there were too many ""silly"" jokes, even at very serious moments. OK, I admit that I enjoyed some smiles/laughters every now and then, Martin Freeman's (Bilbo) facial expressions alone were enough for that, but I think they overdid it especially in the BOTFV without any reason.<br/><br/>b) I think the plot leaves some gaps widely unanswered :the mysterious ""worms""; the actions of Bilbo - in general, his involvement in this last movie was quite small, after all the movie is supposed to be about a hobbit!); the size of the 2nd orc army (where did they all disappear during the ambush?); the fate of important characters, like Bard, the successor of Thorin, Thranduil, Sauron and Saruman; the lack of involvement of other important characters (like Galadriel or Elrod) in a battle that seemed to be of absolute importance; and the reason of this importance - was it its location really or the gold? A map during the movie would have been helpful perhaps... I think that if they managed to create 3 long movies out of a single book, they could have used more time to explain things rather than spending it on what appears to be an invented love story (apparently) or Legolas defying the laws of nature.<br/><br/>c) personally I would have liked more and stronger ties to the LOTR plot.<br/><br/>And since I am given public writing space here, let me also add my ever unanswered question: why don't these eagles appear a bit earlier to save the day? They seem to be able to handle pretty much everything, to the extent that it keeps me wondering why they didn't take Frodo to the bloody mountain in the first place!"

","In December 2003, a generation wept, heartbroken from saying goodbye to the beloved realm of Middle-Earth, which had redefined cinematic potential and captured their hearts for three consecutive years. In December 2014, they wept again – this time from the bitter relief that the embarrassing, bloated, fecal cash-cow zombification calling itself The Hobbit was finally putting itself out of their collective misery. But Hobbit III (a sentence retch-worthy in itself) didn't go down quietly. The Battle of the Five Armies is more drunken fart than film – a gaudy, criminally soulless, grossly excessive, abrasively stupid waste of time and space, and a final spit in the face of Jackson's timeless Lord of the Rings legacy. And you thought Morgul blades were painful.<br/><br/>If there's any whiff of sense to be found in this reeking pile of troll dung, it lies in its mid-film tangent involving Dwarf King Thorin's descent into ""dragon sickness."" Wandering the halls of his barren mountain fortress, murmuring dementedly while idly fumbling pieces of gold, and eventually hallucinating being swallowed up by the floor melting into a noxious puddle of golden goo (one of the film's idly engaging sequences), Thorin , intentionally or not, provides a pristine metaphor for Peter Jackson, drowning in his (and New Line's) gluttonous financial folly. In terms of profundity – heck, even quality – that's it, though. And I mean IT. After a jarring opening of Cumberbatch's Smaug torching Lake Town, yet another prospectively cool sequence marred by abominably stupid Benny Hill chase choreography, Jackson settles in for an abominable sludge of ""tension"" (aka: stalling). If, by tension, we mean our universally dull characters repetitively braying inane lines at one another in a facsimile of military strategy filtered through despicable preschool social politics. For a change of pace, ""comedic relief"" is provided by Lake Town's insufferable unibrowed asshat (I refuse to learn his name; it's more attention than he deserves) making not one. Not two. But three crass drag jokes with a Monty Python 'lady voice.' Yes, this is what $250 million went towards.<br/><br/>Another interlude has the stunt doubles of Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and poor Christopher Lee blandly waving at the CGI apparition of a Sauron who looked more credible in 2001 (and if you think this is insultingly blatant LOTR ""universe-building"", just wait until the film's conclusion). Meanwhile, snoring Lee Pace rides a CGI moose in circles as Luke Evans' Bored-sorry-Bard and Thorin frown at each other through a hole in the wall in a sequence undoubtedly meant to be nail-biting, but is instead accidentally hilarious. And then, as if exhausted by all this (in)action, Jackson makes us wait. Again.<br/><br/>But don't worry – you'll get your battle. And therein you'll discover yet another level of disappointment, as the blurry cacophony of CGI blobs crashing into other CGI blobs proves even more boring than the waiting – just with more noise. Thrill, as nearly an hour of intolerable din manages to continually get worse. And worse. And worse. If there's an action cliché Jackson failed to throw in to this pukestew, you probably just missed it taking place in the background somewhere behind the bleating of a terrifyingly plasticine CGI Billy Connolly and the two interchangeable bad orc blobs providing dull play-by-plays like a rubbery Statler and Waldorf. See: Jackson hammer the ""hero whisks in at the last minute to save a comrade from mortal peril"" button roughly 5000 times (that's barely hyperbole). See: gratuitously overused Legolas auditioning for Wicked by defyyyyyyyying gravity, hopping up a crumbling wall like an 8-bit Super Mario ripoff. See: Jackson's Tremors ripoff giant worms be momentarily cool, before, naturally, disappearing with no explanation. See: the one unexpectedly clever and hilarious moment in the thoroughly unanticipated Thorin vs. Azog showdown be entirely marred by yet another ""oh no! he's not dead"" comeback so telegraphed it redefines the word ""insulting."" Meanwhile, as our heroes toddle around bumping into the abominable results of Weta's creature designers getting bored (my favourite: a four-peg-legged behemoth I unaffectionately dubbed ""Pogo Troll""), we cover our ears, grimacing with sheer loathing, as we await the deus-eagles-machina to make the suffering stop.<br/><br/>Oh – did I forget to take a pot-shot at the worst cinematic love story of the century (keeping in mind this is a century that's produced Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey, and ""Brutasha"")? I did? Well, um it's still really, really awful. Sorry. I'd be wittier, but I think Pogo Troll kicked out the last two brain cells I had left.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen try. Oh lord, they try. But they're inexcusably saddled to supporting characters in their own movie, while we instead fret away with dwarfs whose hairstyles we've been leering at for eight and a half hours, but still don't know the names or personalities of (I'd point out that in Lord of the Rings Jackson established characters within 1-2 sentences, but you knew that already). If you needed more reasons to despise this film, just remember that the shoot isolated Ian McKellen amongst so many green screens that he literally broke down and sobbed in despair. That's right – Peter Jackson made Gandalf cry. Let the hate flow through you.<br/><br/>But then: Billy Boyd's gorgeous voice brings us out of the darkness, and reminds us of the beauty that once was Middle-Earth. No, you're crying.<br/><br/>If Jackson intended his third Hobbit as a surreal, scathing piece of performance art, exploring just how bad a film can be while still earning unbelievable amounts of money, he's a perverse genius. Otherwise, there aren't enough negative adjectives in the world to properly describe its filth. You'd think this kind of flagrant, campy mess could find triumph as an ironic cult classic, but it's too abrasively preening to even hate-watch without disdain overruling. Ultimately, Tolkien himself pre-emptively provided the film's perfect epitaph: ""It was called the Battle of the Five Armies, and it was very terrible."" <br/><br/>-2/10"

Was it Peter Jackson caving into the mind-numbing corporate rules? We will probably never know.

Milk, milk, milk until the bucket is full. <br/><br/>Given how spectacularly awful the film is, from beginning to the end (even with the dragon's brief speaking part), Peter Jackson has proved himself to be the hack, trying to exploit JRR Tolkien's simple story to fill with grotesque and violent content for the third film, allegedly citing the appendixes that serve as the major portion of the movie.<br/><br/>In view of the execrable quality of this so-called movie, courtesy of Jackson's insanity with his love of inane and bloated epics that comprise The Hobbit trilogy, there is the good news. <br/><br/>The executioner of the Tolkien estate, Christopher, have flat-out refused to agree to sell the movie rights to any more of his father JRR's work, following the lawsuit filed against the studios and producers over the royalty in box office earnings for The Lord of the Rings trilogy (quickly resolved with the non-disclosure settlement terms with a big reimbursement payment).<br/><br/>Hear that, Jackson and Del Toro? You will never get to adapt The Silmarillion, JRR's novel that precedes The Hobbit with the First Age of the Middle Earth story. <br/><br/>Enough about the exploitation. It is not passion to tell the story, but rather the passion to be massively self-indulgent while milking the cash cow for personal enrichment. This movie adaptation of the Hobbit series is not what JRR envisioned, given how overlong and bloated it is. <br/><br/>Thankful there exist Tolkien Edit version that purport to trim the fat to reflect JRR Tolkien's simple and true book volume. That's what I look forward to, awaiting the finalized alternative edition.<br/><br/>Bloated is bloated and tedium is tedium. All must be obliterated to find the real version that is missing, thanks to Jackson and company's sheer and unapologetic self-indulgence. <br/><br/>Bloated and tedious make for the spectacularly awful movie to save the last for the worst, all for milking the giant cash cow. Disgustingly greedy and repulsive in debasing JRR Tolkien's literacy legacy.<br/><br/>Indeed, the worst movie of the year, for the casual moviegoers with discriminating taste, only to be bored senseless by the insane and pointless two hour filler non-sense.<br/><br/>1/2 star out of 4"
"zampino-2","5","7","11","9 January 2015"," A Bloated Hollywood Characterization of a Charming Book
","I've read The Hobbit several times, and always found the story charming--an adventure in a fantastical world that takes a likable character and throws him into adversity, which he challenges and succeeds at. I first read it as a child before reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy, allowing the story to unfold in its depth as the author himself became more captivated with his world, and to which he added detail in wonderful ways.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy takes that original wonder of the story and throws into the Hollywood shredder. Replete with never-ending battle scenes and unbelievable behavior from a cast of super-hero characters, I found myself scratching my head as to what book Jackson was representing. Surely not the beloved book of my childhood, which balanced light and dark without the dramatic romances, bludgeoning action, or animated ridiculousness of this film. In the end I was actually glad that Jackson removed the trip back to The Shire, despite my enjoying that section of the book, only because I was so fatigued from watching the endless battles. What a shame."
"TheConfounder","7","7","11","18 December 2014"," A good, though loosely adapted, movie
","""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" gets seven out of ten stars from me. A good film, although a few of the scenes early on seemed a little thrown together. For instance, in the scene of the people of Lake-Town gathering after the death of Smaug, a lot of information is thrown in by an unnamed character and just rushed over in order to move the story along. There is a totally unnecessary scene near the end of the film between Legolas and his father to make an obvious tie-in to the Lord of the Rings. Since the end of the movie ties it in perfectly, why the one between the two elves had to be there I just don't get. And, the entire film could have just written out the Alfrid character and I wouldn't have cared at all. I know his cowardice was supposed to be comical relief, but he ended up just being annoying.<br/><br/>But, other than that, the battle scenes lived up to the hype and the death of Smaug at the beginning is done very well with his face the main focus and the fire ""going out."" I will definitely be seeing this again while it is in theaters."
"fresammis","1","17","33","15 January 2015"," Too much
","Between the previous episodes and the previews I decided I've had ENOUGH of the Peter Jackson interpretations of this story. Drawn out, irrelevant, and totally devoid of real character development, these three movies have proved to be nothing but glorified action pictures, on par with the Transformer's franchise (ewwwwwwwwww). How could you do this to us, Peter? How could you do this to JRR? LOTR was a spectacle to be seen, this is a debauchery to be avoided. So disappointing. You should have stayed with the original story and enhanced with bits of back-history. Instead this became a Legolas HERO epic. Legolas is not even in the original story, but in your version he over-shadows Bilbo, the real star. I'll be looking at Peter Jackson productions with increased skepticism in the future."
"teresaph-984-872671","1","17","33","10 January 2015"," What did I just watch
","No no no no no. Peter, WHY. What the hell happened? Man, what a painful 144 minutes to sit through.<br/><br/>To be fair, I hated the first two Hobbit films, so if you liked those you'll most likely like this last one too. I only ended up watching this after Into the Woods was sold out of good seats (a film I already watched but enjoyed). Where do I even begin? These Hobbit films are inferior to the LOTR films in every single way. I'm not exactly a Tolkien fanatic in regards to the books, but I loved the LOTR trilogy, which makes the disappointment all the greater. It makes me sad because Peter Jackson seems like a nice enough guy and I know he and everyone else involved exerted a lot of hard work and probably sweat, blood, and tears to make these films. Throughout the entire movie, however, I kept finding myself asking how this could be the same man who directed the excellent, deservingly award-winning LOTR films. First off, Viggo was right when he said Peter got carried away with CG. I guess we were lucky the technology wasn't available yet when the LOTR films were made or we might have ended up with something like The Hobbit. So fake and unrealistic, I never felt transported to Middle Earth like I was always was with LOTR. The sets, the characters, the action. Everything screams fake. Secondly, the script reads like a bad soap opera set in a fantasy world. Eyerollingly melodramatic. Of course, the plot is a dramatic one, but everything comes off so scripted and over-dramatic. Each line slowly and painfully killed me. <br/><br/>While he's not terrible and far from the worst thing in the films, somehow Martin Freeman never sells it as Bilbo for me. He just never naturally embodied the character to me throughout the series, and I felt like all his sputtering and muttering screamed I'M ACTING. However, we have bigger concerns. For instance, WHY is Thorin their leader again? He's never shown throughout the three movies any good reason for being entrusted as one, only showing over and over (and over) again that he's unreasonable, stupidly and irrationally pig-headed, and just plain unlikeable. Even by the end, I couldn't see anything honorable about him. In fact, I just wanted someone to whack him off a cliff. His ""conversion of heart""/realization felt fake and again, painfully melodramatic. All he does is brood and say no to, well, everything. I never read the book, so I'm wondering if he was as unlikeable, underdeveloped, annoying, and 2D as the film portrays him. I never came to care about him unlike another infamous anti-hero character, Boromir, who truly seemed to redeem himself honorably (and successfully got me teary instead of rolling my eyes). <br/><br/>And don't even get me started with the Tauriel/Legolas/Kili love triangle. Dumb, unnecessary, and cheap. Again, bad soap opera. It was a mistake to ever create Tauriel's character. But hey, I guess films with no ""romance"" (although this hardly felt romantic) are hard to sell these days. In fact I feel Peter's direction with the dwarfs overall comes off campy and plain silly. Next to the elves, they come off goofy when I feel, if done right, they could've been made into an equally badass race. And remind me why again they're following Thorin? The rest of them just come off as silly, sheep-like cronies. While not as bad or annoying as Thorin, Thranduil comes off laughingly overdramatic and silly. I can't tell if it's the script or Lee Pace or both, but instead of coming off as the intimidating, powerful elf lord he is supposed to, I can't help but want to kick him off his damn moose (what?) and be like son please, get over yourself and take that stick out of your ass. At least Galadriel and Elrond made an appearance. Probably my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>How this has a 7.7 is beyond me. Well, not really since I'm sure a big chunk of that is from a dedicated fan-base. I, for one however, am left being beyond disappointed even though I knew I would, and wishing these movies were never made to be honest. I guess if there's one good thing to this trilogy, it's that it makes me appreciate the caliber of the LOTR films even more. Now I'm questioning if Peter was a one (three?) trick pony somehow, and it makes me sad to think. I really hope he can prove himself as a director again with future films, but for now I've been left with a bad taste in my mouth from The Hobbit trilogy. I think I'll do myself a favor and pretend like these never existed."

You know? Silly in other words.<br/><br/>It's a big disappointment and a dribble-out finale for a great series which began on a peak with The Fellowship of the Ring. It's a shame because it's possible to close out a long series with something of breathtaking brilliance: look at the final Harry Potter."
"antagonist117","2","17","33","30 December 2014"," The saddest casualty of ""Battle"" is what remained of Peter Jackson's reputation
","In his final chance to get it right, Peter Jackson doubles down on all the problems that marred his first two ""Hobbit"" palimpsests. Although he changed this installment's name from the gentle and reflective ""There and Back Again"" to the ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" to better reflect the overstuffed, bludgeoning nature of its content, the title is still a misnomer. The courageous, sympathetic, lovable, surprising Mr. Bilbo Baggins, played by an uninspired Martin Freeman, is too absent and inconsequential to justify being named in the title of Jackson's adaptation. ""Thorin: The Battle of the Pixel Armies"" would have been closer to the mark. The reliance on animation, always a weak point in Jackson's movies, is more smothering than ever before. An entire character voiced by Billy Connolly, not a dragon or a troll but a human-ish good guy like all the other good guys, is not acted but generated with the putty-skinned, dead-eyed falsity of a video game sprite. Although Weta's computer experts no doubt do the best possible work with existing technology, the digital characters and action and backdrops look as wretched as they always do. When New Zealand's famed landscapes, so expertly employed for ""Lord of the Rings,"" finally appear for a few brief seconds at the end of the film, it is as if they have been imported not only from another movie but from another art form altogether.<br/><br/>So the story is even more non-germane, the characters even more underwritten, and the visuals even further removed from recognizable cinema in the third film than in the first and second. Those are disappointments, but they are not surprises. What is a surprise is the number of inexplicable errors about basic Middle Earth facts. It is one thing to depart from Tolkien's texts; that's a filmmaker's prerogative. Jackson, though, also departs from facts established in his own movies. That's simply bad filmmaking. The first ""Hobbit"" movie made a major chronological blunder regarding the Witch King, one with profound and irreconcilable implications for the history of Gondor and its rulers, but this could be shrugged off because the relevant events are buried fairly deep in the lore. By contrast, the geographical and chronological mistakes in ""Battle of the Five Armies"" pertain to the topmost layer of the tale. A citizen of Lake Town says of their Master that he is ""halfway down the Anduin by now."" The Anduin is the locus of a rather dramatic sequence in Jackson's first Tolkien movie. Because the progress of the questing party is so clearly conveyed in the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, the river's position just past the Misty Mountains is obvious even without a map. Lake Town lies on an entirely different river on the opposite side of an enormous forest. This is clear even in Jackson's muddy ""Hobbit"" films not only because the passing of the Misty Mountains and the forest is a core fact of the narrative but because the map from the published text is shown on screen. Thus the line of dialogue, uttered in passing but so specific in content that it stands out from the bulk of the bland script, is contradicted by story as well as visual.<br/><br/>But if an error of geography seems too obscure to warrant heavy censure, consider a chronological error. This comes near the end, when Legolas is told to seek out a Ranger named Strider. During the events of the Hobbit, Strider was not yet so-called; he was a child not yet 10, and he lived in Rivendell. This is known from the books, of course, but even if we allow that Jackson's films exist in an alternate reality, the problem remains intractable. Strider (Aragorn) specifies his age in Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" script, and Bilbo specifies his as well. Unless we assume that Aragorn became Strider at a much, much younger age, the simple math applies equally to the movies as to the books. Jackson's team knows the lore well—for ""Five Armies"" they dig up a minor Orc stronghold from the bowels of Tolkien's appendices in order to give Legolas an unnecessary side plot and an even more unnecessary backstory—so how did it come to pass that ""The Hobbit"" movies make such egregious mistakes that undermine the shared universe of Jackson's acclaimed ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy?<br/><br/>Clearly there was an unsteady hand at the tiller. The goodwill that Jackson won with his stellar Tolkien adaptation in the early 2000s is the saddest casualty of his ""Battle of the Five Armies."""

"abisio","8","17","33","17 December 2014"," Very good but not LOTR The Return of the King
","The third part of the Hobbit (The Battle of the Five Armies) it just takes a few pages of the Hobbit book. When you consider that the full book is about 150 pages and you can read it in 3 or four hours; it is difficult to understand how can Jackson made 7.5 hours trilogy (about 9 on the extended cut). Well basically adding characters and secondary events to the main story. Was that good ? It was not bad; but a little less could have been better.<br/><br/>As a book; The Hobbit is really a kids tale. There is no much character development; the message is quite simple and the end is somewhat sad. There is some mention of the ring but it is not a prequel to Lord of the Ring (or at least it was not originally conceived that way).<br/><br/>The in itself covers three situations/action settings; the attach and killing Smaug; the battle of the five armies and the end which is basically a farewell.<br/><br/>I was surprised the first set was so contained. It is spectacular but not that impressive.<br/><br/>The second set; the battle is more spectacular but still not impressive; until the end; Two man to man (or man to Orc and Elf to Orc) fights (not part of the book) are far more suspenseful and touching than the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I believe Jackson got tired (or out of ideas) on those massive battles. He kept them for the public; but he was far more interested in the love triangle between Dwarf, Elf and Elf.<br/><br/>In brief; it is not boring at all and worth the price of the ticket; besides these two sagas took too many years to be made right."

","Cheap CGI with numerous plot holes make this movie a great cash grab, based on high standards which superior and outstanding LOTR trilogy made, but NOTHING more than that. As a true LOTR fan, I am greatly disappointed. First two parts of the Hobbit are OK, but this third part made me regret watching the first two. Everything you've been waiting for in the first two movies was done in the first 20 minutes of part three. After that they tried to fulfill the plot with some outstanding clichés, which made the overall picture look so bad. They didn't try to explain anything to you, if you haven't read the book, like i didn't, you wont understand a lot of things, and it will confuse you. We all have to except the fact that Hollywood ruins old good movies, wrecking the honest, true emotion that the original gave you, to make a cash grab flick which will leave you sad and a bit angry that they didn't give their best, and the only thing they strive'd for is taking your money based on an old masterpiece. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money, rent it in couple of months. The best advice I can give you.<br/><br/>P.S. I respect Viggo Mortensen even more after this because he refused to act in Hobbit, because he believes that LOTR ended with ""Returning of the King"", and that this will only spoil a great memory."

","I praised the first hobbit because of the differencing factor from the first trilogy that perpetrated it.<br/><br/>The second was a much dark and cumbersome affair, but I thought it good for a ""middle"" movie.<br/><br/>The fact is, Jackson should have stopped with the second movie by putting the first fifteen minutes of the third in the second, the killing of the dragon, which is all you really need to see from the third movie (yes, 15 minutes out of approximately 130 minutes!).<br/><br/>The rest of The Battle Of Five Armies is a mess, following multiple story lines at one time without ever developing one enough for our entertainment.<br/><br/>Also the actors seem so much not to care, it is horrible. One of the challenge of this new trilogy was to make actors appearing in the first trilogy looks younger. But most appears just the 10 years older that they are. McKellen is poor, Orlando Bloom is unbelievably serious and thigh ass, compared to the free spirit jumping from beast to beast arrow shooter we loved to watch in the first trilogy.<br/><br/>The only actor who seems to care is The Hobbit. Unfortunately he is alone in this new trilogy, and differently to the first two, his voice is not often heard here.....<br/><br/>Even the awesome CGI effect seems force (love that dragon though, but it dies during those fifteen minutes I was talking above)....<br/><br/>Not sure what Jackson would do after this (tintin, bof bof big BOF).

The makers of this last film, or someone else, anyone else, are demanded to correct this awful mistake of a movie urgently. Please bring back Lord of the rings. The fans are sad and disappointed.<br/><br/>The beginning was promising, smaug burning the city and the white counsel battle but then, everything started to become more and more disappointing and silly. The death of smaug took 3 seconds. The annoying mayor and his helper, too much screen time! A child killing a few orcs?!What kind of orc army is this?What a waste of steel in their armor and weapons. Giants that fall by a single shot? The humans are a disgrace,angry fishermen,why no human warriors?The love story?R u serious?Not only that,the movie had Too much Dwarf king drama,too little hobbit time, and seriously he magically self heals from the dragon sickness?!!? A bunch of dwarfs to save the day? Then the eagles saving the day with two sweeps fighting the bats who have no role(even though they were breed for WAR)are only annoying. Battle scenes like a bad pc game,I was like,now level 99 monster. Almost Everyone dies but i feel nothing. The hobbit wears the ring and moves thru the battlefield without a scratch.Things pop up in the movie (the goats...) and most of the issues that come up in the movie are unresolved like who became king,where is the king's stone, the starlight elf gems. The only thing I liked in this movie is the beginning 10 minutes and 1 minute when the battle started and the elves jumped to start the fight before the iroclan.That's it. <br/><br/>To conclude, Movie lovers,experts have the duty to do something to correct this for the sake of the LOTR fans and cinema lovers.And Peter JAckson please watch and review the movie before releasing it to the audience. This movie sucked so bad that i am still sad and disappointed and it may take some time for me to recover."

They worked perfectly well for me on all battle scenes and on major character interactions. <br/><br/>Missing Story Plots/Incomplete- I don't know what movie some are telling about, but the film I saw last night had all the closures I was looking for. (Loved the scenes where Tauriel, Thranduil and Legolas were confronting each other, and finally when Thranduil's shows his soft spot, not only for his son, but also for the captain of his army)<br/><br/>There are lots more but these are the ones I find myself resolved. <br/><br/>When I watched Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings some years back, I knew the series will be epic. Every movie I saw was always an improvement of the previous. <br/><br/>The Hobbit series was no exception. Although I took time realizing that this was not going to be the same with the LOTR trilogy, it should start on its own. And it did, when I have accepted that this preceded the first 3 movies, I understood a different story telling. One cannot compare movies or series that are entirely different from the other, much less, one which would tell the history of the first.<br/><br/>There are many scenes that I just can't get over with that keeps replaying in my head. Bard using his son to kill Smaug, Thorin's bout with gold sickness, Galadriel's outrage, the nine and Saruman's fighting sequence (Saruman was really bad a$$ here), Thranduil asking Bilbo to confess about stealing the keys to his dungeon, Elven King's smirk that signaled his archers to position (yes a simple smirk- everyone in the theater said 'ohh' here)... and the elk's heroic charge (not mentioning a spoiler here).<br/><br/>There are lot's more.

The story created by Tolkien is masterfully put together (with snippets from other books in the writers library) and magically filmed by Peter Jackson.

","I created an account simply because this movie is too bad not to warn people. <br/><br/>Firstly, I must say I have not read the books.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me first is the fact that I didn't feel a connection to any of the characters (maybe Bilbo a bit). There was simply almost no character development, which left the movie feeling void of life and you didn't care if somebody died.<br/><br/>Secondly, many of the scenes felt rushed and the same with the music. There was no built up to many ""dramatic"" scenes which underlined the feeling of not really caring about the characters (they were just some random people crying or whining for some reason). <br/><br/>Thirdly, I just had no idea that those big muscular ""bred for war!"" orcs were really just the extremely handicapped portion of the orc army which were most likely accidentally taken along instead of the ones with a fully functional brain. I say this because it seemed like all they were good at was not fighting back, not defending themselves and dying to every single blow that any person in a 10 meter radius even imagined.<br/><br/>Side notes: where did those goats come from? Why didn't the big orc commander use his powers of levitation before, as he did when he flew out of the water through thick ice? Why didn't everyone just hole up and wait for the eagles?

","When Lord of the Rings came into the theaters i was full of praise for how well the key parts of the book were translated into a movie.

Especially the centerpiece of the last part, the actual battle, was just so different from the tale that it was not more than a very generic battle - been there, done that.<br/><br/>The book has a certain atmosphere about the clashing of the armies that the movie failed to catch. The more important part - the struggle of the characters does not come across, the dialog feels very flat.<br/><br/>For example - in the book - it is very well explained why the company of dwarfs supports Thorin even when he sinks deeper into madness - in the movie however they become ""background"" - none of the dwarfs really has a significant personality - they are interchangeable at best - and irrelevant at worst. <br/><br/>Oddly - even the visuals felt not even the same as the old Lord of the Rings movies - but worse.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","12","22","24 December 2014"," It's still not ""Lord of the Rings,"" but this is a fitting conclusion for a perfectly good fantasy trilogy
","Did Peter Jackson really just conclude his second Middle Earth trilogy? His take on J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a completely exhausting adventure that in many ways feels like seven films, not three, while ""The Hobbit"" trilogy feels exactly like it is on paper: one straightforward adventure broken into three parts. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" proves a fitting, exciting conclusion to this particular trilogy, but compared to the conclusion of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" quite frankly and pun intended – it gets dwarfed.<br/><br/>As with ""The Unexpected Journey"" and ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is another beautiful achievement in fantasy filmmaking, with stunning production value and an outstanding director in Jackson. It is creative, humorous, action-packed, brimming with talent and gravitas and so many of the things that made ""The Lord of the Rings"" the achievement it was. So why was this trilogy less acclaimed and somewhat anti-climactic? Part of this undoubtedly has to do with novelty. We've been to Middle Earth before, we've seen the makeup and the elaborate sets, we know how Jackson navigates a battle sequence. Although ""The Hobbit"" has new locales and new characters and was the first film series screened with a higher frame rate, it's not as groundbreaking an achievement. Also, that accomplishment set the bar high for ""The Hobbit"" given how many people have returned from ""Lord of the Rings"" on camera and off.<br/><br/>Yet the real culprit is story. ""The Hobbit"" is a children's book, so splitting it into three parts is merely dragging out a streamlined plot of ""company seeks treasure and justice, company faces challenges along the way culminating in a mighty dragon, company overcomes odds."" The added subplots put more meat on the bones of the three films, especially ""Desolation,"" but did not necessarily add complexity or maturity to it.<br/><br/>""Five Armies"" at least does not waste any time. The first act is entirely buildup to the titular battle with plenty of suspense as sides try to negotiate in order to prevent an unnecessary war when a much greater evil is growing in Middle Earth. After Smaug torches Lake-town, Thranduil (Lee Pace) and the Wood-elves march upon Erebor, where Thorin (Richard Armitage) has reclaimed his rightful throne. Thorin, however, is corrupted by his greed, and rather than help the displaced people of Lake-town, grows restless because his treasure's focal point, the Arkenstone, has yet to be found. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who has been hiding the Arkenstone, sees Thorin's madness could cause a senseless war, which of course it does, only the battle takes a different shape when Azog the Defiler and his orc army arrives.<br/><br/>So corruption and selfishness become dominant themes of the film until the final battle, which doesn't disappoint in scale, entertainment, or visual effects. What it doesn't do, however, is command a vested interest from the audience. And when the larger battle halts entirely in order to follow the main characters, it hurts the larger overall narrative, or rather, calls attention to the fact that there really isn't one at this point in the story other than ""kill the orcs."" Yes, the fate of Middle Earth is at stake, but we already know how things will ultimately play out.<br/><br/>Someone who has never seen the films watching all six in order could be something special, though. ""Five Armies"" does make ""The Hobbit"" trilogy a rather strong bridge to ""Lord of the Rings,"" even in its last shot. In a way, Jackson acknowledges that that tale is the bigger story, the one that matters most. The parting message is kind of like ""we hope you enjoyed these three fun movies, but 'The Lord of the Rings,' that's where it's really at."" As moviegoers who witnessed ""Lord of the Rings,"" this doesn't quite work for us, because we wanted to go back to Middle Earth for something more, to build on the experience of ""Lord of the Rings."" ""The Hobbit,"" however, like any good prequel, is the foundation, not the next step, and because the story is so simplistic, it doesn't quite do enough for us on its own.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" is a fun, small adventure filled with courage, danger, evil and love set in the world of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and ""Five Armies"" is that big scene at the end of the story where everything comes to boil. That's the gist of it. The rest is Jackson and his extraordinary cast and crew bringing that elaborate world back to life for us to enjoy one more time.<br/><br/>~Steven C <br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Finally it comes to an end. No matter how hard Peter Jackson tries to emulate the magic of Lord Of The Rings trilogy, he is going to fail miserably. The story that is already stretched out in the first two instalments hangs by a thread in this edition. The characters may be high on loyalty, love, sacrifice and honour, but none of them really manages to make this movie emotionally resonant. The only saving grace of the movie is the opening scene where Benedict Cumberbatch de spite playing a CGI dragon manages to impress in mere minutes, a feat that the entire movie couldn't in its running time. If you love your Middle Earth, or love the visual panache of Jackson that mixes his dance like choreography of huge action set pieces with some old fashioned fantasy tale about good and evil, then you are good to go. Watch and savour it. But if you seek bit more than the emotional bankruptcy that it serves, then avoid. It is elongated, dull and empty."

","The first post-production buzz concerning the third HOBBIT was that it had another name. No longer THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which is what Bilbo Baggins called his adventurous autobiography, the new title, BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, is pretty self-explanatory. And on the visual end, the 3D is so clean and clear, losing the essential celluloid grain, the picture resembles a BBC Miniseries shot on video...<br/><br/>But names and technology aside, there's a good and a bad to this final installment of Peter Jackson's nine-hour epic based on a relatively short novel, which at times felt like ""butter stretched onto too much bread.""<br/><br/>At the conclusion of THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the vengeful flying beast, after being awakened and thoroughly ticked off, was ready to paint the town flamethrower red. But the full-on dragon attack isn't much. And followed by an hour of ponderous melodrama, the movie should have been retitled DAYS OF OUR Dwarfs<br/><br/>Nothing beats Tolkien Art Either suffering along with Thorin Oakenshield and his greedy lust for gold, hearing tempting voices much like Bilbo and Frodo would for The Ring... or as bowman Bard incessantly whines about how his people are the Nots to Thorin's Have and the pointless romance between dashing Kili and love interest Tauriel: It's both a blessing and a curse when the movie starts living up to the shiny new moniker:<br/><br/>For the Elves and humans are ready to fight Thorin, while those grotesque Orcs have it in for everyone, including a last minute dwarf army. But how can we spend two long hours on a battlefield?<br/><br/>Veering off the rowdy front lines to take part in several personal bouts between key rivals are not only the best scenes, we finally get connected to the action and the characters – and the characters through their actions instead of endless expository dialogue (tying into LORD OF THE RINGS). Ironically enough, the most important player isn't Bilbo, who seems peripheral at the end of his very own trilogy.<br/><br/>Initially hired by Dwarfs as a burglar to steal the dragon's gold, other than his stint with Smaug we never get to know him the way we did Frodo or Sam. Which doesn't mean Martin Freeman didn't do a good job in the role. But if this ambitiously flawed saga were called OAKENSHIELD, it would have been literary blasphemy against creator J.R.R. Tolkien, sure, but Thorin's the one Peter Jackson chose to dwell on throughout. Bilbo was merely an employee."

Although the beginning of the film with Smaug was short, but still sweet, the effects of the film were amazing during the whole sequence. The Armour designs for all of the armies were just outstanding as well, especially the orcs. The white council scene although quite short as well, was well worth the 10 minutes spent watching it , Galadriel finally released her full power and used it against evil, and even beat Sauron in the process, which was actually really unexpected considering i though Sauron was a lot more powerful than Galadriel. In the end battle, the final charge of the Dwarfs with all of the companions of Thorins company, charging in a triangle formation against the orc forces, which around the cinema caused complete shock and awesomeness of what went into this film."

","12 December 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester this afternoon - The Hobbit - The Battle of The Five Armies. This is the long awaited conclusion of the Hobbit Trilogy, and very welcome it was too. Epic battles, beautiful scenery, and one last chance to see the excellent Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. Not as long as the other two this was nevertheless a fitting end to our journeys in Middle Earth. The film gathers in all the loose ends and sets you up nicely to re watch Lord of The Rings. Richard Armitage brings real passion to Thorin, a character wrestling with himself, and railing against the world. Ian McKellen has some great facial expressions which only enhance the mystique that surrounds Gandalf, and it was sad to say goodbye to the band of dwarfs we have been following for so long. Legolas was leaping around as only Legolas can and If I had to go into battle on a mountain......I'd like to be riding a goat. I only saw 2D today, this going to be awesome in 3D."

Bilbo was 1 of 14 members of this group. Now.. before you all jump on the title..Hobbit...I can't help but with the ending I've just seen, feeling a bit robbed. Like seeing the prequels to Star Wars... they didn't tell us the whole story. We already knew that Bilbo found the ""precious"" ring in a cave with Golem. That was shown in an odd 15 minute still confusing game of riddles. Yet after 9 hours of catastrophe and trials to get to the mountain, we lose the king, the Arkenstone was never mentioned again after they offered it in trade, and Bilbo says bye in 15 seconds and walked home. I feel seriously cheated out of an ending that should have been different. Also... the Five Armies? Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Humans.... and??? A Hobbit?

","Unfortunately, The Hobbit did not know what it wanted to be. It jumped between being the fun adventure that the book is to being a dark brooding setup for the LOTR trilogy. Far too many extraneous side stories found their way into this overly long and bloated children's story. The film should have been cut down to one 3 hour or, at the most, two 2 hour movies. Filling up some extra minutes with some Middle Earth backround information was ok, but a lot of extra junk that was unnecessary was thrown into this trilogy and especially into the Desolation of Snaug. In all honestly the best parts of these films were the stuff that was taken directly out of the book."

","The battle scenes. as a huge trophy of a film in which CGI is the basic ingredient. and all is spectacular. but not convincing. first, because it is a fake option to transform ""The Hobbit"" in a trilogy. second, because, contrary to ""Lord of the Ring"", the new serie has not...magic. like new ""Stae Wars"" serie, all was said, and the only real problem is than ""The Hobbit"" has its personality. to transform it in another LOTR is not the most inspired idea.but, the end saves the appearences. and this could be a good poiny."
"siderite","6","2","2","25 December 2017"," A clumsy ending
","The Battle of the Five Armies title is a great exaggeration of what an army entails. The movie is about more or less a skirmish with some rather imaginative weaponry. The plot goes sideways and after two three hours long previous films we get a two hours and a half mess that is half completely over the top battle scenes and the other half people talking out of their asses. It is pure chaos, where orcs are either mighty unbeatable beasts bred for war or cardboard armor wearing morons easily defeated by fishermen's wives and children, as the action demands. Things start to remind of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only because it's the same actor doing kind of the same stuff.<br/><br/> There is even a prolonged ending with Bilbo Baggings returning to the Shire, almost as if wanting to undo the good idea in the Lord of the Rings movies in which they removed the boring book ending with Saruman taking refuge in the Shire, and that portrays hobbits as petty bureaucratic creatures, rather than kind and resilient and courageous as declared everywhere else in the films. If I enjoyed the first two movies and wanted to see how it will all end, the third was a ridiculous failure, trying to do too much with too little: making a country brawl look like an epic battle, keeping the lighter more children oriented tone while killing characters and trying to express deeper heroic emotions, trying to somehow raise on the same level three organized military groups and a bunch of fishermen and animals and tying up lose ends that were there only to make this a trilogy rather than a pair of decent movies.<br/><br/> It is now when all the jokes about the eagles made in good fun in the first two movies (and in Lord of the Rings as well) turn smirky, when the only logic to the plot and action seems to be the panic of production companies trying to achieve their financial goals rather than tell a good story. It is here where the disappointment that everyone talks about when referring to The Hobbit movies raises its ugly head and grows on the small mistakes of the previous two movies. So in order to enjoy the trilogy, one must somehow detach themselves from the ending and see it as an imperfect finish to an otherwise fun movie, maybe imagine their own."
"sir_brettley","6","2","2","4 November 2017"," Not that great...and it doesn't age well
","The conclusion of the book is pretty satisfying. The movie, not so much. One of the things I hate about ""modern"" movies is the way that game scenes are built into the movie. It's obvious which ones will be part of games and it detracts from the film.<br/><br/>The invented characters and scenes do not add to the story in this movie. In fact, they take away from the main plot: absolute wealth corrupts as much as absolute power does.<br/><br/>In the book the battle is well-written. The ""armies"" are actually more like large companies and the battle takes place in front of the mountain. In the movie, the armies are vast (especially the Orcs, who somehow have tens of thousands of soldiers and move them across vast tracts easily...during daylight no less) and spread out into the ruined town of Dale and the surrounding mountains.<br/><br/>The result is a haphazard mess that Jackson admits he just ""winged"". He should have spent more time making two well-written movies instead of three rushed ones.<br/><br/>One of the most unfortunate outcomes is that it's highly unlikely that the estate will green light a series of movies based on the Silmarillion. Well, at least not with Jackson."

","Am I the only one who grew up with the Hobbit and LOTR, and loved the first films, but now hates the series with a passion? I mean, I can still watch these movies, but the sequel explosion is just getting ridiculous. <br/><br/>I find myself numbed to the CGI panorama of wacky stuff going on. Every one of these movies now looks the same, and they have done so many creatures, battles, and scenes with CGI on a monster scale, with unrealistic physics, that I am no longer intrigued by them. It is like watching one long video game sequence, trying to outdo the last Transformers or latest Fast and Furious or Michael Bay disaster movie.<br/><br/>The story-telling component and acting have been replaced by a homogenous visual tapestry of confusing(yet spectacular) effects. Don't get me wrong, Jackson makes great films, but this whole series is getting redundant, and every new release of the Hobbit movies looks and feels the same to me. It is like a fairy tale video world on acid, lacking in emotional or plot-driven depth or character development and real-world charisma. <br/><br/>I find myself bored with this overdone pile of visual antics.<br/><br/>Also, Sam and Frodo in the first 3 films were practically dying to french kiss or something. Are they secretly lovers? I liked the stories and read some of them as a kid, but the movies with Photo Saggins and Sam hamming it up really killed an otherwise great story, while we are on the subject of goofy LOTR junk. <br/><br/>Overall, I like LOTR, but these sequels and prequels are getting as bad as Disney taking the helm for Star Wars and doing it to death."
"nilen-51573","5","2","2","22 September 2017"," Something is missing
","When I see these movies I feel something is missing that where present in the Lord of the Rings movies which made those movies, even though they also had their faults, so much better. The films feel very stressed, like they are rushing through without any pause. There are very few scenes whore the character just sit and talk or walk and talk without anything really happening, where you can learn more about the character and the world. Lord of the rings had a lot of those scenes which I liked. There are instead a lot of extra action scenes thrown in which could work, but I feel it is a bit to much. The atmospheric slower scenes are removed for more action. Then some scenes which could have been really good are just cut short. Like when they are with Beorg or lost in the forest.<br/><br/>I think its OK to trow in more characters an focus on Legolas more. I think the best character in the whole movie is the Elf king. I love him so much. But one thing that I strongly dislike is that many of the Dwarfs have very few lines and you don't really get to know them during all 3 movies. I remember the scene towards the end where you say goodbye to all the remaining 10 Dawrfs and I remember thinking: ""who are some of these characters?"" I hardly remember who some of them look like or who they where. In that sense I think its to much focus on other aspects around the Dwarfs quest that the quest itself which makes the story feel like its all around the place. But I think there are some really good and strong scenes in this movie, but the movies all and all is missing something."

","The Hobbit Trilogy ends here, with The Battle of the Five Armies. And really, it's the battle of the audience's patience for a satisfying conclusion. The Five Armies (I'm going to call it) is the obligatory conclusion to one of the most overstretched film trilogies in recent memory. The battle itself feels like it never ends, and it's an absolute bore to realize that there is VERY little plot outside the title fight.<br/><br/>The Five Armies is one of the most self-indulgent films to cost $200 million+ and the story is basically dried up leftovers from the last two Hobbit films. You...just...want it...to end. Okay, Smaug is dead, now Thorin is corrupted by his family's gold, and now... The Five Armies are battling it out. Aaaaaaaand... the fight itself feels so tedious in that it's one of the most unnecessarily elongated fights ever. It's not something that just happens; you get stuck in it for longer than you were expecting. There's almost a complete lack of 'beats' here, and for those that ARE present basically are there to say this: 'The Lord of the Rings is going to happen! Remember that!' What a letdown. It gets so tedious that when the dwarfs start dying you don't care like you would if the story was progressing at a timely pace.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson should have trimmed this WHOLE thing into the conclusion of The Desolation of Smaug instead of stretching ten-thirty minutes worth of content into a two hour plus movie. Big mistake. Peter Jackson may or may not have had the final say in turning The Hobbit films into a trilogy, but this film definitely got the short end of the stick in that department. It's a shame because the films ALL deserved better treatment overall.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film; it's a criminal bore to watch. JRR Tolkien would have disowned this if he were still alive."

The stupid love story between an Elf and a Dwarf. The conflict between just about everyone. (Thranduil was a proud elf but this film made him out to be an all time bastard. He and Bard joined forces willingly not grudgingly and no Elf King would banish someone just for having feelings.) Thorin accusing his kin of betraying him. It was as if Jackson had taken a two minute pop song and made a full blown symphony out of it. So, to the fantasy film aspect. What a let down. The cgi (and there was far too much of it) was slapdash and not at all convincing. The battle scenes looked like fan fiction copies of the Two Towers battles, the final confrontation of Thorin and Azog was predictable, the worm things were preposterous and of course we have the daft sliding down rooftops, mudslides and whatever ludicrous ninja moves Jackson could throw at us. Also, for two people who weren't even in the book, there was an awful lot of Tauriel and Legolas. The most annoying character, however, was Alfrid. What was Jackson thinking, did he think we wanted a Jar Jar Binks? There is no doubt that Jackson did a marvellous job with the Lord Of The Rings but he should hang his head in shame for this mess, it's an insult to every true Tolkien fan."

And too all those trolls and haters.....get a life and try to gain an understanding of the movie industry before you batter and bruise a movie on such small tidbits.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely fantastic, and is actually the most faithful adaptation since ROTK. Most elements from this installment is either directly from the novel, or improved upon. The pacing is a bit odd, and it does flatten out a tad on the 3rd act, but then again that's what the extended edition is for! <br/><br/>Now onto the ""spoilers"" section, don't read if you want to be completely left in the unknown...<br/><br/>Still here, good!<br/><br/>1: Dain Ironfoot IS NOT CGI, I repeat NOT cgi!!!!<br/><br/>Ignore everybody who stated that Dain Ironfoot (Billy Connoly) is a cgi character is wrong! The scenes that he is in are great and so cool! He is in something called HEAVY MAKEUP! Yes for some of his action scenes he is cgi, but that's because the actor is in his 70's, understood?<br/><br/>2: Tolkein would respect this adaptation<br/><br/>As Gandalf said in AUJ ""all good tales deserve embellishment"" and this movie is no exception, yet it is true in the retelling. So accurate that many Tolkeinites watching will be able to speak the dialogue, one particular scene is when Bilbo reveals to Thorin that he had the arkenstone, and Thorin goes Ape over it! It was eerily spooky how true it was to the scene in the book. The battle is told a bit differently The Elves and Dwarfs fight upon the plains of Erebor, while the men of esgaroth fight a brutal fight in Dale, you can tell PJ has missed directing battle scenes. Top 6 battles best to worst:<br/><br/>Helm's Deep (come on) Battle of 5 Armies Battle of Moria Osgiliath Minas Tirith Black Gate<br/><br/>3: yes some scenes are OTT (Elves) <br/><br/>The 3rd act does go a bit crazy, especially when it comes to the Thorin Azog fight, but don't forget that this is someone's vision of the book, everyone's is different.<br/><br/>So yeah, definitely watch it....WATCH it!

","After Smaug the dragon goes mental, assorted groups of orcs, elves, men, dwarfs and a hobbit battle endlessly with each other for reasons which are far from obvious.<br/><br/>With the shortest film in the set, Peter Jackson's lengthy love affair with Middle earth draws to a close, so how do I feel about it? I feel pretty much as I did about The Hobbit parts 1 and 2, actually: whereas The Lord Of The Rings married epic with intimate in both the books and, fittingly, the film adaptations, the relatively small story of The Hobbit, feels bloated by the gargantuan epic Jackson has made of it. I enjoyed it, but I looked at my watch, often, during the extensive battle sequences which fill the bulk of the latter part of this movie. As Jackson's King Kong demonstrated, he isn't always able to tell that More does not necessarily equal Better. This trilogy has been crafted with care and skill and with a complete inability to apply the editor's red pencil when necessary. The story, such as it is, takes a remote second place to the eye candy on offer.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that it doesn't have its moments - it does. The opening sequence of Smaug exacting revenge is quite wonderful, there are highlights among the action, the individual performances from Freeman, McKellen, Pace and some of the others are excellent, and the closing sequence in the Shire is quite good fun, especially the reappearance of familiar LotR music cues.<br/><br/>But against that, we have CGI which is sometimes shockingly unconvincing (Smaug is magnificent, whereas the ballista trolls and Thranduil's elk and Billy Connolly's mount, for instance, aren't), a mixed-race romance which seems entirely out of place, an orc villain who doesn't seem important enough for the emphasis he is given, a batch of featured dwarfs who continue to be indistinguishable and unmemorable (apart from the Irish one, the Scottish one and the handsome one) and, worst of all, an omnipresent and hideously unfunny ""comic relief"" slimebag who never gets the comeuppance he has been asking for throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I also fear that future generations, watching these three overblown films as a lead in to Lord Of The Rings, simply won't bother with the (chronologically) second, and far superior, trilogy.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed it, and I shall no doubt watch it again, more than once, but I shall do so without the passion with which I still watch the LotR films because, if I am honest, these films have been something of a disappointment."
"mariotasic1994","6","14","27","11 December 2014"," Honestly - PJ what happened??
","I have waited for this movie for a whole year. I liked the first 2 movies, but i didn't love them. I am a Tolkien fan and I read most of his books. So of course I was excited about the movies.<br/><br/>Let's go back a bit. Remember the LOTR trilogy? I loved it. It had everything. Good story, plot, cast..everything. I grew up watching it, and I still watch those movies over and over. I can feel the love and the effort that was present during their making. Sure, some things were also changed. But it was done in a very good way. <br/><br/>And then this. The best thing about the Hobbit is Martin Freeman as Bilbo. And of course Ian as Gandalf. And that is it for me. The CGI is over the top. And not in a good way. The actors have so much make up that I can't take them seriously. The dwarfs are too..good looking? ordinary? I don't know. <br/><br/>**SPOILER!!!!**<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw BOFA last night and I was disappointed. I mean did they even have actors for that or was that also CGI? Don't get me wrong, the CGI looked great..but it was too much of it. And the love story? Come on. WHY?!?! Money. That is why. Giant bats? Oh, and where are the Wargs and the goblins?? And Alfrid? Who is that guy?! I wanted to say farewell to Middle-earth and enjoy it one last time. I just couldn't. I did not hate this movie. But I definitely didn't love it. The audience laughed during some scenes that were so obviously CGI. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>But the movie had some good parts. The inner struggle of Thorin was interesting. And I loved the White Council and the reference for Aragorn at the end. The last scene was great. <br/><br/>All in all, It is a disappointment. But it's Middle-Earth. That's why I'm giving 7 stars."
"kdatz","10","19","39","12 December 2014"," I'm a fan of J.R.R Tolkein. The lord of the rings movies are awesome the hobbit movies are epic, this is the best movie ever.
","(REALLY Pulp Fiction gets an 8.9 and this work of art gets a 7.8!! I'm not really surprised considering the fact the majority of this world is filled with ignorant, stupid, predictable, hypercritical sheep).This movie is a very fast paced unpredictable exotic roller coaster ride from start to finish. It's worth your time and money. Okay to clear things up I love J.R.R Tolkien's lord of the rings books,I've read them all countless times I've seen all the lord of the rings movies and the hobbit movies countless times I can't get enough. The books are really good but I feel there a bit childish, I see Peter Jackson's take on this classic a dark, funny, interesting And more grown up version of Tolkien's work, this take gives me and I believe many viewers the violent exotic view of an epic adventure I think the books where originally lacking now to the movie itself. From smaug the dragon in the begging to the credits at the end not one second was I bored, it keeps you on the edge of your seat with the action packed incredible, intense fighting scenes. Once again all characters get there own moment in the spotlight, once again this movie and this saga no matter how many times I watch it gives me goosebumps. The acting is believable and the CGI is gorgeous. I love the emotional parts in the movie it brings the story to life. I guess there's only one thing left to ask How shall this day end ? Answer:With an epic unforgettable cinematic masterpiece.This movie alone completes this saga and personally it's a little better then the lord of the rings trilogy. Watch this movie before you die! Metascore and all these (Movie critics) are completely stupid. I'm about mother trucking tired of all the dang sheep in this world, that the problem with people now a days the petty much do whatever the news, media, critics, and celebrities tell them to do screw what's trending create your own dang trend for once people, I guess what I'm trying to say is there's way to me sheep in the world and there's not enough Wolves."
"Itoc","8","21","44","10 December 2014"," Pacing was a key thing I liked about this film
","The saga has come full circle, and my worst fears of a stumbling ending has been alleviated. What I found striking is the film's striking pacing which is strangely very true to the book (note, pacing). I was never truly bored, and Hobbit/Lord of the Rings have a tendency to drag on. Sure there are some of these annoying ""this sets up for LOTR"", but it's more to find a way to conclude characters in the film. <br/><br/>Overall it was an ""expected"" experience, but I wasn't raging out of the cinema. The trilogy is definitely a warmer welcome than the Episode 1-3 of Star Wars, and I can see myself watch all 6 films of what I presume now is called ""The Middle-Earth Saga"" back-to-back."
"kiwibutterfly","4","10","18","15 February 2015"," The Hobbit 3: A Not Very Serious Summary
","Right, so Smaug is destroying Laketown. Wait a minute, is this really the start of the movie? Because it looks rather like the end. Do we really have to see another 2.5 hours of this? Anyway, Fili, Kili, Tauriel and a bunch of kids are trying to escape while Bard is locked up in a cell. Never mind how he got there, he escapes in a most improbable sequence of events and goes after Smaug. This really does look like the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Dwarfs mournfully looking into the distance. Lots of dramatic mumbling. Bard shoots an arrow at Smaug. Hey, he actually hits him! Wait a minute. So we're not even 10 minutes into the movie and Smaug is already dead? What's the point of the remaining 2 hours and 15 minutes?<br/><br/>More dramatic mumbling and a pathetic attempt at interspecies romance when Kili and Tauriel need to part ways because Because I don't know, but it builds tension, okay? Apparently ""winter is coming"" - I wasn't aware this was Game of Thrones. Meanwhile, Thorin has found the dragon's gold and it's time for a group hug, but not for long because the Arkenstone still hasn't been found. Flashback where we learn that Bilbo has the Arkenstone (he stole it in the prequel, apparently).<br/><br/>Well, this scene is most definitely not in the book. Galadriel rescues a dying Gandalf from something, and promptly fondles him while ringwraiths attack them, and Saruman and Elrond defend them. There's also something going on with the wizard who likes to consume vast quantities of mushrooms, but I'm not quite sure what - maybe the whole scene is him hallucinating (which would make sense), or he's having a vision, or he's just there for some reason. Sauron's eye appears and rehashes dialogue from LOTR. Galadriel dispatches him by going all Dark Elf of Evil on him and Sauron has an epileptic fit then disappears.<br/><br/>Some nice shots of Aoraki and Ruapehu as we switch back to the dwarfs and Thorin's little Arkenstone problem. Nice guilty face, Bilbo. We learn that things would get worse if Thorin had the Arkenstone, though I'm not quite sure why. I think it's got something to do with greed. The refugees from Laketown seek refuge in the mountain, but the dwarfs don't really want to share. During the night, Legolas's father arrives on his elk with an army so he can attack the mountain and get a share of the gold too. Meanwhile, Thorin walls himself inside because he's greedy and doesn't care that there's about 12 dwarfs inside, with no food apart from a massive pile of gold (which mustn't taste very good) and a couple of thousand people and elves outside.<br/><br/>Oh. Apparently Thorin is expecting help from other dwarfs. Meanwhile, Legolas's father plans to attack at dawn. Gandalf is back and says orcs want to attack the mountain too. Must be the most coveted mountain in New Zealand. I wouldn't be surprised if the fifth army turned out to be Asian tourists.<br/><br/>Bilbo gives the Arkenstone to Legolas's father so he can bargain with Thorin. Thorin refuses because his army of dwarfs has arrived, aaaand it looks like they just started a war. The leader of the dwarfs is riding a hog because why not. Just as the dwarfs and elves are about to fight, these tower-sized worms sprout out of the ground and start eating them. I'm. Not. Kidding. This movie gets weirder by the minute. Anyway, the orcs have now arrived, and the battle begins for real. I'm still waiting for the army of Asian tourists though.<br/><br/>Dramatic and sad music plays while Thranduil rides across the battlefield with orcs speared onto his elk's antlers. Thorin jumps onto the back of a goat which just happened to be wandering across the battlefield, and goes off with Fili and Kili to challenge Bad Guy Azog. Legolas and Tauriel return (I didn't miss them, did you?) and announce the arrival of the fifth army, who are not Asian tourists but more orcs. Thranduil finally realises that wars have casualties and decides to just, well, go home.<br/><br/>Fili dies, Kili is in danger, Tauriel runs to join him. Legolas latches onto the legs of a giant bat and flies away because Because, okay? He joins Tauriel, Kili and the others in the fight. Kili saves Tauriel's life and dies in the process. By dies, I mean reeeeeeaaaaaaallllllllyyyyyy slowly dies, with lots of slow-motion gazes into Tauriel's eyes. Legolas runs to save the Tauriel.<br/><br/>The mushroom wizard joins the battle on the Eagles of Deus Ex Machina. Thorin finally kills Bad Guy Azog by, um, throwing him under the ice of a frozen lake. Oh, wait! In a ""surprising"" twist, Azog jumps back through the ice and puts a sword through Thorin's chest. Apparently Thorin suffers from Boromir Syndrome because that doesn't kill him and with the last of his strength, he kills Azog. Yay! Bilbo reaches Thorin and they have a deathbed chat, which I'm sure is meaningful and emotional and all, but unfortunately, I don't speak mumble. 3 minutes and 42 seconds after getting stabbed in the chest, Thorin finally dies and everyone has a good cry about it.<br/><br/>Tauriel, after a small bout of interspecies necrophilia (i.e. she kisses Kili's corpse), goes home. The war appears to be over, though I'm not quite sure who won it - clearly not the orcs, but was it the humans? The dwarfs? The elves? Anyway, time for a New Zealand tourism ad as Bilbo walks home. Is this the end? No, there's still 20 minutes to go. Those 20 minutes prove to be quite useless as Bilbo gets back to the Shire, and maliciously fingers the Ring before the movie cuts to a scene from LOTR. The End.<br/><br/>Well, that's three hours of my life I'm not getting back."
"djcal123","3","10","18","8 January 2015"," Awful what a shame as well.
","You know I really loved the Lord of the rings and thought it brought the fantasy genre to light and the CGI back then was just coming into light, so effectively the Lord of the rings was the first movie to really use the CGI. What's disappointing and what I still can't figure out is how is it that a movie made in 2014 has worse CGI than a film made with half the budget 13 years ago!! It's a disgrace frankly that it was even released. I feel Jackson got fed up with making things as epic, huge scale, and beautiful as the Lord of the rings film as he was lazy and couldn't be bothered so he just lets use green screen and let's use below average CGI. Acting wasn't great Apart from freeman who I've always liked. Not much war, didn't explore the Eagles and beorn enough and the comedy is out of place and only there as a way to cover the rubbish movie you are watching. I have thought all the hobbit movies are awful but this movie really is the nail in the hobbits coffin."
"erinward1991","4","10","18","28 December 2014"," wait for the DVD so you can be disappointed in peace
","I have been a fan of Tolkins work for many years and was thrilled when the Lord Of The Rings were being made into films. When they were done I consoled myself by saying surly Mr Jackson will make The Hobbit, and indeed he did. The first two movies were great, nothing superb but a good watch. However. This last one was all over the place...<br/><br/>-There was sooo much CGI that it became more video game than film. Bilbo was very inconsistent in height throughout the film.<br/><br/>-There were no funerals for Thorin, Fili or Kili. Which is a semi plot hole as Thorin is buried in the mountain with the Arkenstone on his chest (which seemed to have vanished!) - What the hell happened in the end? I have read the books but the end was lest far open. Who is now king under the mountain? what happened the Bard and Dale? Thorin's cousin? What did the rest of the company do? -Don't get me started on Tauirel and Kili, it was stupid and unnecessary.<br/><br/>-Legolas ran out of arrows? Elves have magical arrows that replenish themselves.<br/><br/>-Thorin and his cousin were able to stop and chat in the middle of the battle? really? and those mountains goats were oddly convenient.<br/><br/>The list goes on, but all in all I was very upset, it is as if Peter Jackson was sick of if by the end and just gave up."
"Quinoa1984","6","10","18","21 December 2014"," adequate but dull, punctured by heart and awe
","Peter Jackson loves his excess. The man can't get enough - as not even a storyteller but as a spectacle-producer, a showman, he is like a starving kid at a Thanksgiving day buffet. This series is an indication of that, even if it's not all of his fault (it was originally two movies, maybe too much enough, until the Tolkien estate said it needed to be three movies - the studios, I'm sure, concurred). He and his team take what is essentially a children's book (The Hobbit, that is, which Tolkien wrote for his children initially years before LOTR) and make it into a 474 minute trilogy (credit time included), which means that a character like Bilbo Baggins, the little Hobbit-that-could who finds that he can be courageous and has the 'Right Stuff' as it were on an adventure, is a bit diminished in the epic scope and grandeur of what is really, in this case, about the dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his quest to retake the castle of his father from the dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies picks up as a cliffhanger from the previous film - a rather uber-dramatic one at that - with Smaug getting out of the castle and set to attack a town. He does, people die and try to escape, and one man (Luke Evans, one of the more sturdier heroes of the series) fires an arrow that somehow gets through and kills the beast. One may scoff at how the dragon is so easily destroyed after such a build up at the end of 'Desolation' (and that whole set piece, by the way, was one of the highlights of this trilogy). But this is merely the set up, as it was, up to a point, in the book: armies are converging to get that treasure in the castle/mountain, and Thorin won't give it up. So, thus, we get war. Lots of it. Like, most of the film.<br/><br/>Thorin is an interesting character in that he is mostly defined by one trait here - until the script requires him to suddenly 'grow a pair' and lead his dwarfs out into battle with the rest of them - which is being a stubborn a-hole. Of course this can be chalked up to the 'dragon sickness', which could make him a victim in a sense. But Thorin throws this off so quickly and gets back into 'hero' mode that we're basically made to think that he can be sort of forgiven for being a stubborn a-hole for most of these films, this one most of all. And it's not that characters don't acknowledge it around him or call him out for it, far from it. But being that Thorin is more of the protagonist than Bilbo really is - or, if you must insist, co-protagonists - there isn't much to latch on to there.<br/><br/>Not that Jackson and company don't have other story threads to go on, one of those carried over from the last film involving the romance between a dwarf and an elf (the latter played by Evangeline Lilly, who just has those eyes that make her a good actress, even when she's tasked to play soppy melodrama). I had forgotten how strongly these two felt for each other - or how much of a sandwiched-in sub-plot it was (not in the book, but why carp at this point) - so when they have to face their struggles here in battle, I only felt a modicum of emotion for them to get back together or say 'f-you' to the haters of the other dwarfs and/or the elves (i.e. stone-faced Lee Pace).<br/><br/>Or maybe it was effective and I just didn't feel it, it may just be all on me for not really getting into this one, and certainly not as much as the previous two films (and those weren't much either). In 'Journey' and 'Smaug' at least I had a major set piece to hang on to - and the ones with Gollum and Smaug respectively are some of the great pieces of cinema in this whole Tolkien six-film run, to give Jackson/Cumberbatch/Serkis etc credit here. Is there one here? I'm not sure there is, despite the attack on the opening carrying over from the last film. That's merely the appetizer for the glut of CGI action that takes up MOST of the film here. And that would be fine... if it wasn't monotonous.<br/><br/>And perhaps it's also on me to get in or not get into this action. But at a certain point, how many times can you see an orc trying to kill someone and it doesn't carry the simplistic weight of a video game. And this isn't even to knock video games, except to say that this is a typical, adequate, mostly well-put-together but still kind of soulless video game. Jackson puts in some of the bigger orcs with features that look cool, or a moment like Legolas jumping up stairs that are crumbling under him that are just funny (intentionally or not), and yet it's all just SO much and little of it sticks.<br/><br/>The good news is there's a bit more Bilbo in the film, which gives more time to Martin Freeman who has nailed this character every step of the way and made him a joy to watch. He even makes latter-film scenes with Thorin count, at a point where I thought I didn't have much care for the character (not that Armitage doesn't try, but he's just... okay I guess). Overall, Battle of the Five Armies delivers TONS of effects, TONS of epic, sweeping shots of New Zealand (duh), TONS declarative moments and moments of humor that are hit or miss - and the always dependable likes of McKellan and Blanchett and so on. I just wish it left me with something more than feeling dulled by much of it."

","A great way to put an end on a great trilogy. It was the best piece of the hobbit trilogy and one of the best movies of the year. This movie is going to be a great hit in the box office, it has all the tools needed to reach the 1 billion club. Other than interstellar, there is no movie with better visuals and special effects this year, it also packs a lot of action, great battle scenes and great character development. The only miss may be on the length of the battle, it took a little too long but it was expected. They did a really good job in developing the relations between the characters and bringing a high level of emotion. I loved the way they developed every character and not only Bilbo. The conflicts between the desire for obtaining the gold and the value of friendship was a bright spot on this movie. Like I said before, a perfect ending for s great trilogy."

"r_massey","2","9","16","4 January 2015"," A disappointing conclusion
","While I was very reluctant to hear the news that The Hobbit was being stretched into three films, I was fine with the direction of the first two and fairly confident that the final instalment would be a satisfactory ending to the trilogy. I was proved wrong.<br/><br/>Picking up from exactly where The Desolation of Smaug left off, Smaug is killed off in the first 15 minutes of the film which is disappointing considering how much the character/dragon was built up in the third act of the predecessor. With very little plot to go off (having to use such a small remain of the book), pretty much everything seems to go on for too long, especially the battle.<br/><br/>There seems to be no real justification for the extra plot lines explored in the first two films. What exactly was the point of Gandalf going to Dol Guldur other than to acknowledge that Sauron exists and to just draw that link back to the LOTR trilogy? What exactly happened to Elrond, Radagast, Galadriel and Saruman afterwards? They added nothing interesting to the story at all over these three films, their story arc has been a waste of time and covered what we already know (that Sauron is out there).<br/><br/>I was okay with Legolas' and Tauriel's appearance in the Desolation of Smaug (not originally appearing in the book) but even now, they too are characters that serve no purpose at all to the story and have just been shoehorned in for the purpose of adding unnecessary romance to the trilogy and to rake in some more cash by using Legolas to lure in big fans of the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>The only 'heart' that is actually present from this film is the interaction between Bilbo and the Dwarfs, Thorin in particular. Why wasn't this explored even more? I would have loved to have seen the dwarfs have a bigger role but a lot of them go unspoken and have very little to do.<br/><br/>Characters have very little room for development in this film, most of the focus is on the action and almost every bit of drama is forced, added for the sake of drama e.g., Bard saving his family from the troll, Kili trying to save Tauriel, Tauriel trying to save Kili, taking an entire Age to kill an Orc, all this just comes across as too cheesy, especially Thorin 'drowning' in gold and falling to his death before overcoming his 'dragon sickness', something that could have been handled with a lot more care and respect.<br/><br/>While there is a lot of action, it's never enticing and you can tell that the writers just thought of different ways of characters to pull off some crazy stunts that would look 'cool' on screen but ultimately have no effect whatsoever *cough* Legolas disobeying the laws of physics *cough* riding the bird thing. The stunts executed in the LOTR trilogy worked very well, especially as a lot of them were practical but the CGI and unbelievable situations these characters find themselves in (yes, it's a fantasy film but LOTR still had that little hint of realism) are just ridiculous.<br/><br/>The CGI seems very unfinished, especially Billy Connolly, who plays Thorin's cousin Dáin, who jitters through the world of Middle-Earth, appearing like a very video-gamey character and possibly something out of a Dreamworks movie.<br/><br/>Orcs aren't as terrifying as they were in the LOTR trilogy due to being completely CGI too. Speaking of Orcs, Azog too has had very little purpose in the trilogy. I was okay with him living in the film (when he is actually dead in the book) for him to have an ultimate showdown with Thorin, who I imagine would have been enraged at Azog for having killed his grandfather, but nope, they don't even talk about that, they fight for the sake of having some action in the film, resulting in a very anti-climatic duel between the two.<br/><br/>The only really light and interesting moments to ever occur on screen are those led by Martin Freeman with his performance as Bilbo, the only consistently good thing to come from these films (and the rest of the cast too but mainly Freeman as his character comes through as the most down-to-earth and not so serious). Had the filmmakers drawn their focus more towards 'the hobbit' and not characters who do not even need any screen time at all (Legolas, Tauriel, Saruman etc.) then this series would have turned out a lot better. Bilbo has slowly been swept aside with each sequel and mainly becomes a spectator to most of the events occurring around him. Why have a film about the titular character when you can have ridiculously long and ridiculous battle sequences instead?<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies"" is a very unsatisfying conclusion to Peter Jackson's stretched out and unjustified trilogy, leaving not so subtle nods to its 'follow-up' trilogy, presenting us with 'additional' information to the book that doesn't particularly tell us anything new and leaving some subplots unresolved. The action gets tiresome very quickly and the CGI is much too distracting. Whether you're a big fan of these movies on Middle Earth or not, this film may be nothing more to you than just your standard popcorn flick."

"MattBirk","6","15","30","17 December 2014"," Best of the Three, But Average At Best
","The Battle of the Five Armies marks the end of Peter Jackson's second trilogy in Middle Earth and it could not have come soon enough. This trilogy was average at best average and nothing compared to the original trilogy, Jackson seems to have lost his magic. But getting that out of the way I think Five Armies is the best from this new trilogy, it features some solid action scenes and more emotion than the previous two. Though the action went on for too long, it was still a very welcomed given the previous two films. There is something entertaining about watching a group of diverse people (elves, men, dwarfs etc) all battling it out. And of course Thorins madness and obsession with his mountain and gold was great to watch. <br/><br/>But the movie does have quite a few faults, mainly to overuse of CGI. Too much of the scenery was fake, as well as every single character on the enemy side. There was a reason Sir Ian Mckellen broke down on set, it was because he realized he was merely talking to a green screen. Jackson completely dropped the ball here, the costume and makeup design from the first trilogy was something special and noticeable. Here, the movie comes off as too fake for its own good, even if it is top of the line CGI. As for the story aspect, the movie managed to conclude the journey on a decent note, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing to brag about, but it brought an end to character relationships and multiple story lines, some more than others (Tauriel anyone?). As for the overall experience, as I said, this was my favorite from The Hobbit Trilogy. That being said, I will most likely never watch any of these films from beginning to end, the same cannot be said about The Lord of the Rings trilogy!<br/><br/>www.simplefilmreviews.com"
"CinemaClown","Null","17","35","18 December 2014"," Far From A Fitting Conclusion. Disappointment In Every Sense.
","Here we are at last, at the end of all things! What was originally envisioned as a two-part film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit eventually finishes as another trilogy in the Middle- Earth saga despite the fact that unlike The Lord of the Rings, this novel could've easily worked out as a single feature & certainly wasn't vast enough to warrant three films; a mistake that became pretty evident when the first chapter was criticized by many for its bloated length.<br/><br/>For me however, An Unexpected Journey was still an impressive commencement of The Hobbit film series for it closely followed the events of the book, kept the changes within the realms of Tolkien's spirit & was a largely satisfying cinematic experience despite its obvious flaws. The journey downward began with The Desolation of Smaug which absolutely slaughtered the novel in a manner that was plainly insulting to Tolkien & added even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of cinema's most frustrating cliffhangers.<br/><br/>And so after a wait of another year, we come to the third & final instalment of The Hobbit film series but instead of a satisfying closure, what we get is a terribly written & horribly executed premise inflated to epic proportions which, apart from confirming that expanding this single-film story into three features was indeed a stupid move by the filmmakers, also brings the Middle-Earth franchise to its all-time low for there is nothing in this second sequel that works out in its favour.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies begins with what should've been the ending of The Desolation of Smaug but wraps up the fiery wrath of Smaug even before the film's subtitle appears on the screen. The plot then follows Bilbo Baggins & the Company of Dwarfs who after reclaiming their kingdom prepare for an impending war against elves n men who just want their share of the treasure but when a greater threat arrives at the Lonely Mountain, they all are left with a choice to unite against the common enemy or be destroyed<br/><br/>Helmed by Peter Jackson for one last time, the final chapter in the Middle-Earth saga is also the weakest as the director completely abandons all the core elements of storytelling to rely solely on a series of eye-popping visuals & CGI-laden battles to carry its story forward. The screenplay continues the slaughter of its source material by stuffing the narrative with needless fillers while the remaining contents of the book are either presented in an overly exaggerated fashion or discarded in its entirety.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, it's only Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively, who leave a better impression than the others but then their role is somewhat limited in the finished product. The most unexpected disappointment comes from Richard Armitage who played Thorin Oakenshiled amazingly well in the previous two chapters yet here he seems pretty much clueless for the most part & delivers a laughable performance.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are handled so poorly by the writers that even after three films, which totals over eight hours of runtime, many might still struggle in recalling the correct names of all the dwarfs. The first half of the film also deals with the corrupting power of greed which is pretty ironic considering that the very existence of this third chapter is a result of greed on the part of its creators. The only thing that doesn't disappointment in any manner is Howard Shore's score.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is far from a fitting conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy & is a disappointment in every manner. Poorly directed, terribly written, needlessly bloated, overflowing with excessive CGI, lacking in substance & featuring some cringeworthy performances, there's so much one can complain about this finale but where this film or The Hobbit trilogy as a whole fails is exactly where The Lord of the Rings triumphed gloriously; its faithfulness to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."

"Theo Robertson","7","30","68","17 December 2014"," An Almost Satisfying Conclusion To An Often Unsatisfying Trilogy
","I almost gave this a miss . I fell in love with Jackson's LOTR trilogy and found myself often underwhelmed by large segments of the other Hobbit films which often took a long time to go nowhere . Even the title THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES conjures up what to expect - big overlong battles realised by some dodgy CGI . On top of that I'm not really a great cinema goer down to the fact you have to share an auditorium with other human beings and Hell can indeed be other people . None of this is helped by certain cinema chains allowing food and drink in to the showing . The first trailer was an advert for the Odeon's Croma Pizzeria where patrons can walk in a showing guzzling their ugly fat faces on pizza and I can confirm this temptation was too good for some salad dodgers to pass up . Bad enough cinemas are full of people slurping drinks and munching on crunchy popcorn but now respectful cinema fans have to endure the stench of jalapeños wafting around . We're not allowed to smoke in public places but we're allowed to annoy innocents with junk food . Sorry Odeon cinema you've just lost a patron for life . And this conclusion had better be bloody good in order to distract me from the stench and noise of the present cinema environment <br/><br/>So did it ? Just about . The third part is the strongest part of the trilogy as with the previous two films less would have been much much more and you're aware of the very cynical marketing trick of making three films each lasting on average 2.5 hours when you could have had a superb film lasting three hours . One thing I did notice early on is that I'd forgotten who most of the characters were since I hadn't bothered rewatching the two previous films and if you can't remember who was who and how they fit in to the story this must be seen as a creative failure of sorts , but to be fair the plot isn't exactly taxing and it's easy to pick up what's previously happened . Perhaps even better it's easy to pick up where it's going and several scenes do overlap in to the narrative of the later LOTR trilogy . One thing the LOTR trilogy was very good at was pointing out that greed for money are ultimately self destructive and again we see the same sort of subtext which nothing else means Jackson's stream of six films are very consistent <br/><br/>One wishes that Jackson had kept to subtext but unfortunately he himself becomes greedy for spectacle and so has to introduce overlong battle scenes which soon outlive their welcome . To give the director some credit a few of the fight scenes do contain extras involved in intricate choreography in the fights but there's often a reliance on sweeping shots that don't entirely convince you that they're anything more than something created on computer software . Like so much of this trilogy bigger is not necessarily better <br/><br/>So in summary apart from the unwanted smells and sound effects emitting from the audience I don't really feel I had wasted my time and money visiting the cinema to watch the Hobbit trilogy . This conclusion is darker in tone than its two predecessors but unlike LOTR I wasn't totally blown away and one hopes Hollywood can stop all their cynicism by making a story with two hours plot in to a franchise which unfortunately is becoming more and more common as seen in the TWILIGHT and HUNGER GAMES franchise"

About Kili and Fili's death why did they change like that such an unnecessary things not related with book. And what about Beorn! we just saw him about more or less 10sec? His appearance should be epic and carrying Thorin broken body and back fierce blood-lust none that we saw... There are a lot of things we can say this movie is bad. On the other side the things I loved is : Elrond,Saruman and Lady Galadriels raid. Dwarfs ignorance of elves after goblins appeared quickly reacts and ready to battle formation,still I miss that Thorin's shout Baruk Khazâd!

"stlsprtskid539","4","14","28","19 December 2014"," Even the Eagles couldn't save this movie
","The first ten minutes of 'The Battle of Five Armies' starts off where the 'Desolation of Smaug' should have ended. The movie already feels like the second movie, just extended, which is not a good start at all. Once Smaug is dead, the film loses its best character and dialogue and the horrible messy fighting scenes commence. Other than the terrible CGI and side love story, the battle scenes are nothing special and take up the whole movie. <br/><br/>This movie could have turned the Hobbit trilogy from an OK series to a good, watchable marathon series, but instead has turned into a series I might watch at 2 a.m when nothing else is on TV. I'm so surprised Peter Jackson would allow this movie to go on the way it is because he tried way too hard to change the Hobbits true meaning, to something similar to Lord of the Rings and it simply does not work. It's hard to give this a bad review because I tried really hard to believe this series would end on a good note, but I was disappointed and I believe many others were too."
"beresfordjd","8","8","14","10 May 2015"," Flawed but great.
","I have to say I have reservations about this film, largely to do with casting but overall I thought it was terrific. I think the casting of James Nesbitt and Billy Connolly in particular just took a lot away for me - Connolly is so much himself it brought one back to reality instead of being steeped in the world of MiddleEarth. Luke Evans was great as Bard and I could see him cast as Thorin too. Richard Arming had a difficult task to be a hero and villain at the same time. I loved the battle scenes, inventive as ever and in spite of taking up most of the film I never grew tired of seeing it. Lots of people have been irritated by Legolas' seeming disregard for physics but if you remember the LOTR films he displays an uncanny knack for seemingly impossible physical feats. If you study the elves army's movement you will find that fascinatingly odd too - they are elves for Chrissakes! Peter Jackson has given a suite of films based on Tolkien's work which I do not believe anyone else could have done. I applaud him."
"petra_ste","5","8","14","19 December 2014"," Still dwarfed
","The Battle of the Five Armies hides a decent fantasy blockbuster somewhere inside it, but director Peter Jackson drowns it beneath clunky set-pieces and bloat, tossing in every Middle-earth thing not nailed down by the Tolkien Estate and adding his own romantic fan fiction, to boot. It's a wonder we don't get a scene with a pony-riding Tom Bombadil fighting Morgoth, and the pony is ON FIRE.<br/><br/>The cast is blameless. Freeman is fine as Bilbo and so is Armitage as tragic hero Thorin. Everyone else is at least adequate. Unfortunately, the movie hammers their performances with a noisy score (whatever Jackson developed must be contagious, as the once brilliant Howard Shore got it too) and unnecessary special effects (nuclear Galadriel! dragon-sick Thorin!).<br/><br/>There are some grace notes here and there: a fine prologue with Bard facing the dragon Smaug in a burning Esgaroth had me giddy and quite fooled for a while - although Bilbo doesn't indirectly inform the archer of Smaug's vulnerable point, which was thematically significant in the book.<br/><br/>Sadly, there are plenty of cringe-worthy moments as well; cut every Tauriel, Legolas and Alfrid scene (thankfully, Radagast is barely there) and about 30% of the action (conservative estimate) and the film would improve considerably.<br/><br/>Like George Lucas before him, Jackson succumbs to set-pieces onanism. If the hero fights five enemies on a tower, it's exciting; if he fights fifty and he uses CGI-enhanced ninja moves and the tower is collapsing under a meteor shower, it's numbing: viewers stop feeling tension and mentally check out.<br/><br/>Here, Galadriel banishes Sauron using a garish spell (wasn't that her evil/tempted form? and the one thing from the Fellowship I didn't need to see again); Beorn jumps from an eagle and morphs into a bear in mid-air; Dain headbutts armored orcs and rides a pig...<br/><br/>... and Legolas? It's better not to even MENTION Legolas. He was already an avatar for Jackson's worst instincts in the original trilogy; here, the cheesy stuntman has googled the cheat codes. The one moment of clever, effective restraint - Thorin letting Azog fall in a frozen lake - is spoiled by its horror movie coda.<br/><br/>The Battle of The Five Armies is the cinematic equivalent of ordering a coffee and having it delivered after twenty minutes with avocado marmalade and gummy bears by a hollering clown on a monocycle: you get your coffee, but also an major headache. And you wonder: why?<br/><br/>The lean beauty of The Fellowship of the Ring seems like a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>5/10"

This one is the weak link, simply because too much of the sequels have been made.<br/><br/>Plot is, well is there a plot?

Tolkien gave us his epic universe, the dawn of the fantasy genre as we know it now.<br/><br/>And Peter Jackson has brought this to the big screen.<br/><br/>And therefore I am grateful, I am grateful to see this epic drama unfold and visualize in front of me on the screen, instead of my inner eye. I am grateful for every second I can dive into Tolkien's universe and Peter Jackson's vision of it.<br/><br/>I would gladly see another trilogy, any extended editions, any amount of ""side-quests"" to see actions that remain behind the screen and that happen in between the pages of the books. But it is over and I am sad.<br/><br/>And therefore, if you are a fan of the books and the LotR trilogy, you'll find this a fitting and worthy conclusion for an epic saga. It's action-packed, breath-takingly beautiful, dramatic, comedic and even emotional. How often did you see this description in a single movie?<br/><br/>I say: ""Thank you, Peter Jackson, for bringing one of my favorite books to life. 10/10."""

"twoface08","7","11","21","18 December 2014"," A bloated yet entertaining farewell to Middle Earth.
","Peter Jackson takes us to Middle Earth for one last time (supposedly) in ""The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies"", the third film in the second trilogy of Middle Earth films.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy are among some of the finest films ever made, his ""Hobbit"" trilogy however seems to be lacking. Back in 2012 we started off on ""An Unexpected Journey"" that led us to ""The Desolation Of Smaug"" and now finally we have arrived for ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"", the climactic event that will take us into Jackson's superior trilogy.<br/><br/>The film kicks off all guns blazing with Smaug the stupendous reigning Dragon fire down on the people of Laketown. This opening scene is a nice introduction but it would have felt more at place at the finale of the previous installment rather than at the forefront of a film where its presence feels rushed. This fast paced action scene unfortunately makes the proceeding 30-40 minutes a rather tough ordeal to sit through. Secondary characters and tedious subplots take precedence whilst stories from the last film are tied up in the background.<br/><br/>The film is certainly off to a rocky start, uninteresting subplots and characters distract from the otherwise entertaining and dark main plot involving our company of Dwarfs and Bilbo. Alfrid, the master of Laketown's servant from the last film is given a much bigger role in this film, which may be the worst decision Peter Jackson has ever made. The film spends far too much time focusing on this character and his relationship with Bard, attempting to be the comic relief of the film in a film that does not necessitate any.<br/><br/>After what seems like an eternity, the film starts to pick up. Thorin and his crew scour the halls of Erebor for the Arkenstone, a most precious jewel that Thorin desperately searches for. The stone is driving him insane and he starts to suspect his own kin of thieving it from him, meanwhile Bilbo hides the stone from him. This internal conflict that Thorin has was one of the more gripping aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Our Dwarfs prepare for battle. Our Dwarfs prepare for battle. After a lot of the drama is dealt with, the battle kicks off when the Orcs show up to claim the homeland of the Dwarfs as their stronghold. Jackson shows off his talents in the large scale conflict that eventually takes place. As entertaining as the battle is, it all gets a bit CG heavy and unfortunately begins to look like a cartoon. ""The Lord Of The Rings"" was a trilogy that pioneered the use of practical effects as well as CGI, but ""The Hobbit"" decides to throw all that away in exchange for a green screen. <br/><br/>Azog the Defiler commands his legion of Orcs! Azog the Defiler commands his legion of Orcs! The film climaxes on a powerful note that will leave die hard fans certainly moved. When the film isn't all sword and shield, there are some more somber moments that make this the most emotional of the trilogy, most notably between Bilbo and Thorin, whose rivalry/budding friendship forgoes its roughest patch yet. After the titular battle, ends are tied up and in classic Peter Jackson fashion, multiple endings ensue, the majority of which forcibly tie in to the other trilogy. <br/><br/>The film stumbles its way through constant tonal shifts, from romance to epic scale battles. There is an overlying stench of incoherence in this once simple tale of a band of Dwarfs taking their home back from a Dragon. There are one too many subplots and pointless characters that make this film feel even more bloated then its predecessors.<br/><br/>""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" has its fair share of drawbacks but still has enough to entertain. As a whole ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" is an underwhelming end to a mostly underwhelming trilogy that may have been better off as two films as originally planned.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Ian McKellen deliver yet again in their respective roles as Bilbo, Thorin and Gandalf. But yet again the highlight of the film are Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), two very good looking Elves who know their way around a fight. Character moments are exchanged for grand scale battles which depending on your preference may be a good or bad thing.<br/><br/>The stakes of Orcs taking over Erebor don't feel big enough compared to what we've seen in this world before. In LOTR, a ring of power has to be destroyed or else evil will destroy the world and that deserved grand scale battles. ""The Hobbit"" story feels far too small to require these gigantic fights, so the smaller more intimate battles actually have a lot more impact than the CG heavy battlefield scenes.<br/><br/>The film is a mixed bag, its off to a terrible start but slowly builds up momentum and is a serviceable send off to Jackson's visualization of Tolkien's world."
"torgandwarf","1","13","26","7 January 2015"," Too long trailer for bad video game that will be made
","Except character names, barely could notice any connection to Tolkien's Hobbit. Well at least I can guess how games will look at least. There will be weird mounts, like Radagast's and Tranduils, it will be mostly hack and slash, with cliché story... I only wonder why they did this to Tolkien, there is a lot of lame fantasy games, and books that would not need any change to be so dull.. This trilogy should not exist, at least should not be related to Tolkien, especially last part of it... They missed point, they probably did not spent hour or two to read it before filming, guess that anyone that read book could not miss point so hard, after all it is not something that really need solving puzzles, and push brain limits. Simplicity is one of greatest values of original story, but if they really wanted to make changes, they could use other Tolkien's writings, and put something new(for wide audience), but still Tolkien's in movies , instead of crap from bad video games, that looks all to each other. To do not get me wrong, there are few games with interesting plot, but rare, almost as rare few writers that wrote good fantasy books. Only reason I can think about, for making movies like this, is to earn money, with aggressive advertising, and selling other stuff related to it. Like stickers, video games, video games accounts, replicas used in movies, and toilet paper with images from movie(this will be most popular between real Tolkien's fans, that will try to put movie where it belongs) etc.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, you owe apology to all of us that love Tolkien's works, to all who payed for watching this, and even more to those who liked this movie, because they lost most, and never really experienced real quality of story that you ruined. At least they need explanation, that this is not ""based on novel by J.R.R Tolkien"", like it is stated, if that statement is true, than every movie containing characters John and Mary can be stated as ""based on Bible""..."
"japamo","8","7","12","21 August 2015"," If People Valued Friendship and Loyalty Above Gold and War, What a Pleasant World It Would Be
","The title of this review, of course, paraphrases probably the most important quote of either the ""Hobbit"" novel or movie trilogy. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) regretfully utters the important quote when he finally realizes what devastation his quest for his mountain home of Erebor has wrought. That regret gives the final movie of the Hobbit Trilogy, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (hereafter ""Five Armies"") its sad, emotional weight. ""Five Armies"" delivers the sword/axe/spear wielding and battling excitement of its two predecessors, but this time the mind-spinning, heart-pumping action is tempered by a sobering thought: much of the fighting and devastation was a shameful waste.<br/><br/>Why? Well, with Bard's slaying of the rampaging dragon Smaug (mellifluous voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) with the Black Arrow that finds his Achilles heel (an unprotected opening in his neck), Thorin, the thirteen dwarfs, and Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) have cemented their claim on Erebor and the ocean of gold and other treasures within. However, Smaug's attack on Laketown and his death throes after the arrow pierces him have effectively obliterated the town. All Laketowners, including the devious, pompous Master (Stephen Fry) and his sniveling toady (i.e. brown-noser) Alfrid Lickspittle (Ryan Gage), are now homeless refugees. After the Master's shocking but funny death, Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) becomes de facto town leader. Bard goes to the Erebor stronghold to not only provide food and shelter for his people, but also to claim the town's rightful share of the dwarfs' treasure.<br/><br/>But some insidious sickness has altered Thorin's normally sensible and noble nature. He has contracted the dragon's ailment: acute gold fever. In fact, Thorin's mad thirst and greed for gold surpasses even Smaug's. Despite the pleas of the dwarfs, and especially Bilbo, Thorin refuses to negotiate at all with either the Laketowners or the elven army led by the imperious Thranduil (Lee Pace) who have come for THEIR rightful share. Men, elves, and dwarfs settle in for a long siege. Bilbo attempts to broker a peace with all three forces by offering the priceless dwarf jewel the Arkenstone (which he DID recover from Smaug) as a bargaining chip. Of course, this infuriates Thorin and leads to Bilbo's banishment from the dwarfs. Battle becomes dangerously imminent when Thorin manages to contact the Iron Dwarf Dain (Billy Connolly) and his mighty hordes to even the odds. Before long, though, the squabble over the gold escalates to fighting for sheer survival as the brutal, relentless, Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett), Bolg (John Tui), and his deformed bunch of warriors, giants, and overall freaks catch up to Thorin and company. Needless to say, war breaks out.<br/><br/>As with the previous two movies, and despite purists' groans of protest, ""Five Armies"" largely adheres to the novel's structure. Two deviations, the turbulent confrontation of the wizards Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), and Saruman the White (dearly departed Christopher Lee) against the personification of darkness Sauron (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the still-baffling but tender relationship between female elf warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), continue from the previous movie. There are two others. One, Bard, on his own, discovers Smaug's weakness without Bilbo's help. In the previous movie, Bilbo spotted the dragon's weakness earlier. However, unlike in the novel, there is no thrush or any other messenger, human or animal, to convey that knowledge from Bilbo to Bard. Why the omission? I'm not really sure. It seems to deny Bilbo's instrumental part in getting rid of the dragon. The second deviation is the long-awaited, final showdown between Thorin and his relentless pursuer Azog, who whale on each other over a frozen river. Oh, yes, there is a third; the kryptonian fighting machine elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) defies gravity to mix it up with Bolg. As with the previous two movies, the deviations mostly did not bother me, except, yes, not giving Bilbo credit for finding Smaug's crack in his scaly armor. Come to think of it, why didn't he tell Thorin and the dwarfs in the second movie about the weakness, to give them the chance to kill the dragon before he left for Laketown?<br/><br/>No matter; Bilbo acquits himself in other ways. Although many moviegoers felt Bilbo was marginalized, all three movies, including ""Five Armies"" demonstrate that he made a difference, even though in the novel, Bilbo's participation in the final battle was ""rather unimportant"". As already mentioned, he tried to broker a peace. Second, he does not desert his dwarf companions even after gold-mad Thorin tries to toss him off the ramparts. Third, his rock-throwing abilities, referenced in the novel, come in handy as he beans Azog's orc warriors like David slaying Goliath. Using his invisibility ring, Bilbo accompanies Legolas and Tauriel to warn the dwarfs about Bolg's army. Finally, his loyalty to and friendship with Thorin give him comfort after his recovery from gold fever and battle with Azog.<br/><br/>""Five Armies"" paradoxically shows the cruel uselessness of war, especially for inherently useless gold. Evil beings might be vanquished, but good beings can also lose everything, including relationships and even lives, unnecessarily. However, as in the novel, ""Five Armies"" suggests that the only ""good"" war is one where evil IS vanquished or at least kept at bay. Through Bilbo's mere presence, ""Five Armies"" reveals that the way to a better, happier world is steadfast loyalty, friendship, and a desire for peace. Oh, good food and drink don't hurt either."

","for what it's worth, i like the hobbit trilogy better than the fellowship trilogy. first, i love martin freeman. i love the simplicity of the characters. it doesn't have the bloat, in my opinion, that the fellowship trilogy suffered. there are expansions on the original theme, including of course the obligatory love story, but in this case i felt like Taurien actually added something to the story, which due to the times and culture in which it was written is a little overwhelmingly patriarchal. there were significant other sub-plots to the fellowship trilogy (film version) that to me added nothing to the original plot-line and simply functioned to enable a three-parter rather than a simple sequel. i did not enjoy jackson's depiction of frodo and his weepy comrade Samwise, who i think could have been far better enacted from a directorial interpretation standpoint. the hobbit is cleaner, and simply more appealing. i still enjoy the fellowship trilogy, although i am not so fond of two towers. i thought this trilogy held the pace of action and plot development much better. maybe part 1 of the fellowship trilogy was more engaging than part 1 of the hobbit trilogy, but as a whole i enjoyed the storyline of the hobbit much better, even with the egregious addition of Legolas and the woefully underused talent of Cate Blanchett, who deserves a trilogy of her own!"

","I was really doubting if I should sit down and actually spend time writing about this film, but I realized I am almost obliged to write a proper closure about this trilogy. Unfortunately, as you can already imagine, this film was a great disappointment for me and my Tolkien love. But honestly, I didn't expect anything better. It was actually worse. <br/><br/>We all know how Peter Jackson is famous - or better infamous - about his long, boring shots in his films. He loves stretching generally in his work and he doesn't miss a chance to show it. We have accepted it all these years and when it actually helps the dramatization - like in LOTR - we salute him. But this time it results in excess and exaggeration. <br/><br/>All those long shots and all this overstretched narration doesn't make sense anymore. All those films are made only to satisfy the fans worldwide? I don't think so. Don't let me start over the off- time bad humor and the many awkward moments. No character development except Thorin's, but still it seems it happened very fast and abruptly. Everything just looks out of tune. The only definite thing is that the purpose of these films is completely lost. <br/><br/>The Tolkien literature spirit is completely vandalized by the main story element that struggles to keep up the narration in the film, the fruitless and weak love story of Fili and Tauriel. It doesn't make sense and it will never do in people's eyes and especially the hardcore fans like myself. First huge mistake.<br/><br/>You just can't raise up the standards yourself, winning an Oscar of direction for one of the greatest films ever made and then fall from one mistake to the other. You do not make a movie only for the sake of making it, you need to be good at it, you need to put your soul in it. Second mistake. <br/><br/>And yes we are all tired of the constant show-off of the magnetic special effects. Unfortunately we are sick of all this. It is nice to watch but special effects do not make a movie good. Never. Obviously Jackson acknowledges that and is totally tired of hiding it. This type of negligent behavior. Third and deadly mistake. <br/><br/>However one of the greatest scenes of this trilogy was in this film. The fighting scene with Galandriel and the NazgÃ»l along with Saruman and Elrond was breathtaking and reminded us for some minutes the grandiose LOTR trilogy. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it is very hard for me to accept this film as it it, this trilogy as it was promoted and produced. I don't believe in this kind of cinema anymore and even if I indulge myself to many bad guilty pleasures, this was not even close to one of them. It was boring, unsettling, very long and completely far far away from its initial intentions. The first part definitely carries some of the Tolkien spirit and it is the one I enjoyed the most. <br/><br/>The Lord of The Rings trilogy will always be in my heart for its consistency, its directorial magnificence, its narration, its complexity and of course its story. The Hobbit trilogy just provokes both sadness and disgust in me and I really hope it will be forgotten soon enough. At least we will always have the LOTR trilogy to look up to.<br/><br/>From http://mycinematographies.blogspot.nl"

","No matter what people say, this movie was thrilling and stunning. The problem is - people are comparing it to LOTR. THE HOBBIT IS NOT LOTR!!! If everyone had watched this film before LOTR, every one would love it. Stop thinking of it as not what it is! It has very deep character development, and even characters that you only see for a few minutes are great - like Dain. Peter Jackson really did do a good job. Yes, some of the effects were unrealistic, but the battle itself was amazing - rivalling the Battles in RotK. There are some truly epic moments too - when Thorin pulls himself together and charges forward, Dwarfs behind him. When the Dwarfs lock shields in a formation then the Elves jump over the top. When Thranduil skewers like 6 orks. You really must see this film.<br/><br/>I had to write this review - usually people only write reviews because they are angry with the film - and people that liked it don't bother. That is why there are so many negative reviews."
"BA_Harrison","4","10","19","15 February 2015"," The end. At last.
","Almost fifteen years ago, I was genuinely excited to see The Lord of the Rings brought to life by director Peter Jackson. Now, six Middle Earth films later, with countless hours spent watching extravagant CGI battles, sweeping shots of spectacular scenery and grandiose architecture, happy hobbits, angry orcs, athletic elves, dour dwarfs and wise old wizards, I couldn't be happier. That it's finally all over.<br/><br/>With each successive Tolkien film, I could feel my enthusiasm growing steadily weaker and weaker. As the CGI became more and more elaborate, the action became more and more preposterous, so much so that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. Legolas repeatedly defying all the laws of physics became painful to watch. Although I should have loved The Hobbit movies, the book being my favourite work by Tolkien, I found the whole bloated experience frustratingly tiresome, with The Battle of the Five Armies being the most disappointing of all.<br/><br/>Having already realised the majority of The Hobbit in the first two films, there really is very little story left for Jackson to tell, so he pads out this third chapter with pointless romance, internal conflict and even more CGI-heavy battles, all of which proves relentlessly dull if you've already seen the director's other five Middle Earth movies. Needless to say, I was more than pleased to see Bilbo arrive safely back at Bag End, just so that I could say a very final farewell."
"neahga","3","10","19","12 January 2015"," Full of extraneous BS
","First off, I should say that Peter Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings was a major disappointment to me, but at least in the beginning of that he tried. This makes my review suspect, I know, as I already have a bias, but this being the 6th movie in the larger series, there has been enough time for everyone to acquire their own perfectly valid biases. <br/><br/>The Hobbit movies he seems to have given up, eager to rush them out filled with all sorts of ""extras"" that were never part of the Hobbit story, and cutting out parts that were in the original story.<br/><br/>Mr Jackson is not the story teller (or reimaginer) he believes he is.<br/><br/>I'll need to re-read The Hobbit to get the bad taste of these movies out of my head."
"wesbarry06","3","10","19","12 January 2015"," Kids Movie
","Surely the target audience for this film are those under 25 years old. More specifically, children between 11 and 20 years old. This film is dull, sloppy and lazy. The dialogue is pointless yip-yap and completely unengaging. This films IMDb rating of almost 8 is baffling and concerning. I can only assume its brainwashed army of fanboys and fangirls have inflated the said rating. Given the budget they had on this movie it really was disappointing. The CGI at times was noticeably sloppy, particularly during fast moving and hectic scenes. What I personally found unacceptable was the almost complete lack of fight choreography. I was expecting an epic battle containing some awesome and memorable fight scenes. What a let down! LAZY LAZY! In fact, it got to the stage where I was having a bit of a laugh during the war scenes. What a wasted opportunity. RIP - Hobbit"
"lornloxor","4","10","19","26 December 2014"," An expected disappointment
","I didn't go into this movie expecting much so I was only mildly disappointed. The Desolation of Smaug ended in a pretty awkward cliffhanger and The Battle of Five Armies tries to pick it up from that very spot. All of the buildup with Smaug was in the Desolation of Smaug and quickly disposing of him in the beginning of this movie doesn't work from a story-telling standpoint, simple as that. Clearly there was material here for one, maybe two, great movies as many others have pointed out and chopping up the movie into three pieces and bloating it up really screws up its pacing.<br/><br/>Legolas again defied all laws of physics and essentially became Neo and Super Mario wrapped in one in this film. If a character can do anything with no consequences and doesn't have to follow any kind of internal rules of a movie, there's no tension or drama. Shouldn't Jackson & Co understand this? Legolas wasn't the only on either, pretty much anyone could apparently kill dozens and dozens of these orcs so where's the danger? The decision to implement the antagonists of the trilogy, Azog and Bolg, as CGI characters also really flattened the whole experience because they simply don't have the kind of screen presence a real actor in makeup has. There's really no awe and weight in much of what we see. <br/><br/>Bilbo should've been the absolute focus of this trilogy, not the sideshow he ended up as. When he's on the screen, you're actually interested. No one cares about Bard's family or about Laketown politics. The tacked on romance between Tauriel and Kili never felt organic nor fit the universe. All of it failed to generate pretty much any emotional resonance in me. The stuff works only insofar that it keeps your attention if watched in a cinema but that's as far as it goes. The serious ponderings about greed and so on don't hold much weight because we aren't really invested in the characters. <br/><br/>The visuals were a bit better than in the previous two, it didn't felt as saturated or dipped so wholly in CGI paint, maybe they had more time now that they didn't have to invest as much effort on Smaug? In spite of the improvement, the movie still looked too much like a video game and the way Peter Jackson swirls and twirls the camera around really highlighted the fakeness of it all at times. At times the whole thing completely breaks down in scenes like when Thranduil gets four orcs trapped on his elk's antlers and then does a quad-beheading or when Legolas is running up a set of boulders that are dropping through the air. This is not light-hearted but over the top silly slapstick and well, it just doesn't work for me. The tone wanders too much from serious to utter schlock. The trilogy should've had more more funny and lighthearted moments like the ones in the original trilogy. Moments like Merri and Pippin comparing their heights after drinking the water of Fangorn and Legolas and Gimli's drinking competition and general banter. That stuff worked. Here we have the cowardly Alfrid in a woman's dress stuffing his chest with money and making it look like he has huge boobs. That's just way too much and not funny at all, he's almost like the Jar Jar Binks of this trilogy. <br/><br/>Also, what's up with the alternate Galadriel look in this film (the same that was in the Fellowship)? I thought that was like an evil version of her that would come about if she would get the one ring and succumb under its corruption instead of what she looks like when she does magic things. I'll just keep to that original idea, I think it works better. Galadriel carrying Gandalf really weirded me out also. Does she work out a lot or something? For me the elves are all about skill and graceful finesse and stuff like that. These kind of oddities and inconsistencies are so numerous with these films that I could probably go on for hours about these. <br/><br/>The thing is, pretty much everyone who went to watch these Hobbit movies saw the original trilogy which established what Middle Earth looked and felt like. If you're going to use a similar visual style you pretty much have to adhere to the tone and rules of the original or otherwise everyone's going to be constantly having this jarring feeling that everything's not right. The ring wraiths for example reminded me more of Final Fantasy or something like that and not the original. In the original the magic was more subtle and subdued, not banging around like in this one. It felt like my imagination was completely shut off by this film. The eagles were also really used as a deus ex machina in this, I didn't think they would risk such a dangerous frontal attack? I get it that they took part in the battle in the book but the way they portrayed it in this? I don't know. In the Return of the King I thought they were done really well as they fought the Fellbeasts in their element high up in the air but here they're bashing through army formations like it's no big deal.<br/><br/>Time will not treat these Hobbit movies kindly, no one is going to sit down and watch the extended editions of these at one sitting unlike with the original trilogy. What a shame. It's entertaining at parts in a pop-corn-movie sort of way but again there's too much stuff that continuously keeps chipping at your enjoyment. Not really sure the pop-corn-flick style really fits in well with Middle Earth either. Oh, it would've also been nice to know what actually happened to that gold, I thought it was sort of central in the movie? I guess that's reserved for the director's cut. Anti-greed indeed."
"stopcampingnb","10","10","19","23 December 2014"," 144 minutes of what was right in the past two Hobbit movies
","INTRODUCTION (NO SPOILERS): I'll tell you this first, this movie is different from the previous two in the trilogy. How you may ask? You've got a whole lot of fighting in this movie rather than characters walking tirelessly towards a goal. It's almost as if Peter Jackson took the criticism. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BEGIN HERE: At the start of the movie, well chorea graphed action scenes involving Smaug, the fire breathing dragon, was breathtaking to see. After, the way tensions boiled up between different factions in the movie was something we as viewers haven't seen in the past two Hobbit movies. In the middle of the stalemate, which surprisingly wasn't too long and boring, armies violently clashed. This, is what Lord of the Rings fans wanted to see.<br/><br/>The story was then told through midst of the epic battles. It was told fairly well. Sure it was told mostly by generic dialogue, but that isn't necessarily a bad point. <br/><br/>As one who didn't read the book, the movie ended quite dramatically. It didn't seem expected what exactly was going to happen in the last skirmishes. What was somewhat disappointing though was the outcome of how the battles played out, we only know who won. It didn't seem like either side had the upper hand when we were cut away from it. <br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed with this movie, especially when watching the action scenes. The previous two in the Trilogy I would have given a high seven due to it being slow paced at parts."
"Tyson14","10","18","39","14 December 2014"," a fitting end to an epic saga
","Back in 2001, the year when The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings I just knew this was going to be the most epic franchises ever! Every movie I saw was always an improvement of the previous. While the series ended with the most epic was possible with the Return of the King (2003), 11 years later the stories, characters & battle sequence still live in our minds. <br/><br/>Being a fan, I was glad when Peter Jackson decided to bring back us back to Middle Earth with a prequel series - The Hobbit. A series adapted from mere 320 pages of a children's book, splitting it into three parts was always going to be a task. Although It took time realising that this was not going to have the same effect as the LOTR trilogy, it could build on its own epic ness.<br/><br/>When The Desolation of Smaug ended on a cliffhanger as Smaug flies to lake town to destroy everything, it has been uphill task for a fan like me to wait for a year to see the epic conclusion, and how is the battle? Fantastic obviously! The movie started where the previous installment had ended. Scenes of epic destruction and fire in the lake-town are brilliantly shot. I think that if Peter Jackson wasn't the director, this battle would not work because only he can shoot the war in such a way that is both effective and jumpy. Peter Jackson is king when it comes to battle scenes, having directed what is by far the two best cinematic battles ever, in the battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Pelennor's Field/of Minas Tirith. And even though the battle doesn't really beat those two battles, this one is still one of the all-time best. The wonder of the visual effects and action makes this battle a delight to watch. It may be long, but let me tell you, it is EPIC. After Helm's Deep, I didn't think Peter Jackson would be able to get any better. I was pleasantly surprised. Though a lot of it is CGI, the battle is carried out perfectly. The fighting, effects and acting are brilliant and everyone who worked on the film deserves a big pat on the back. Besides the battle itself and the opening sequence, there's an undeniably magnificent relationship between Thorin and Bilbo in this movie. <br/><br/>The chemistry between the two shines bright, and is one of the strongest aspects of the entire film and the entire trilogy as a whole. Martin Freeman has done excellent work as Bilbo Baggins and shown us that his acting talents are not limited only to Sherlock. While not given the amount of screen time as he was given in the first two Hobbit films, is still perfect as Bilbo - perfect! He really captures the essence and personality of Bilbo beautifully! Richard is amazing as Thorin and every character has performed greatly. Armitage in particular brings the best performance he's given in the trilogy, as Thorin's character-arc is very interesting and quite dark in this film and Armitage pulls that off in spades. You also have Lee Pace as Thranduil, who also performs at the top of his game. Contrary to his performance as the ill-wicked Ronan the Accuser in the last summer's Guardians of the Galaxy, Pace is really given the opportunity to shine here and works really well together with Armitage to form this ill rivalry between the two. Sir Ian McKellen knocks his role as Gandalf the Grey out of the park once again. But that is as obvious as sunrise and sunset. Another standout is Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Most of you people probably already know that Legolas is not in the book. This topic is often a hotly debated one, with some people saying that he has no place being there and that he's just forced into the film, while others, like me, thinks that he does add something to the film. another character who is often hated for being a non-canon character is Tauriel - a character that I also love. Evangeline Lily brings such a great presence to the film. It is often in movies that you don't believe when there's a badass female hero or villain. You can tell that that person couldn't even lift a sword and that the only reason to why she's a badass is because it says so in the script. Well, that's not the case with Tauriel or Lily as Tauriel, she's a force to be reckon with, and challenges often Legolas in terms of who is a bigger badass! Even though I still wasn't completely sold on the whole romance front (still like it though) between Tauriel and Kili - played very well by Aidan Turner, one of my favourite dwarfs of the entire company. Luke Evans as Bard is just as interesting and relevant as in the last one. Evans manages to bring out more depth and charisma & at times manages to steal the thunder from the rest of the cast! Benedict cumberbatch's voice-over of Smaug is delicious! Though it is the shortest movie in the series, it is enough, satisfactory and not remotely boring. Believe me folks this is worth your bucks. It is not just a movie, it is a cinematic experience even non-hobbit fans will enjoy. To sum it all up; The Battle of the Five Armies brings to a spectacular conclusion the legend of Middle-Earth. It is the ending of a 9-hour film and to certain extent, the ending to the full, now, 21-hour saga. In ten years we can look upon these films as six chapters of what is ultimately one story. And in ten years the Middle- Earth films will still live on. Battle Of Five Armies is a brilliant, emotional & fitting way to end the Middle-Earth saga!"
"bert-de-lille","10","30","71","9 December 2014"," Brilliant defining chapter!!!
","After the Desolation of Smaug being a step up from Unexpected Journey, I hoped for this final movie to be the crown of the trilogy (as LOTR ROTK was in 2003). I enjoyed this movie so much. It is the best movie of the hobbit trilogy, very beautiful and emotional also. The movie is also again darker than the previous one and the ending leads beautifully the story into LOTR Fellowship of the Ring. <br/><br/>Howard Shore again delivered strong and beautiful music and Billy Boyd gave us the end credits song ""The Last Goodbye"" , really really good!<br/><br/>Thanks Peter Jackson! I don't think any other director could have made these films so beautiful!<br/><br/>Really a must-have to see!!!"

","This is what happens if you take much money, use your old tricks and base all your ideas on a small kids' book of 300 pages. I like JRR Tolkien's Lore very much and he is my all-time favorite writer. I was OK with LOTR Trilogy. Although there were poor moments and sheer goofs, the old trilogy was not bad. The Hobbit? Very much has been said and written about this trilogy, so I need not add more. I just want to say that this is what happens when you take a small thin book for kids, add much money, add totally unnecessary characters, add some crude CGI, sometimes even laughable ones. Peter, you did a lousy job, served a bad service, and this almost universal unanimous hatred towards Hobbit three parts is a vivid result of bad logistics, bad script and very poor decision of making a short book into a huge lump of a untasty monster of a movie"

","Having enjoyed the last two Hobbit movies, I waited longingly for this third one. After it was released in theaters, I went to see it. It was amazing. Probably just as good as the book, I loved this movie. It expressed a new kind of light on the Hobbit series, and had a storyline which I wasn't expecting. The special effects were very realistic, and it had a few new characters that were enjoyable. It had good acting, and the characters were very explained. The story was just as good. The storyline was fruitful and not quickly paced. It all made good sense, and was very entertaining.<br/><br/>I would totally say this is the best of them all."
"myleshahn","9","6","10","30 August 2015"," great epic movie
","This ties together everything from the Hobbit One and Two. It is inevitable that Heroic Legolas and Bilbo Baggins will fight the evil Orcs led by Azog and others. The key is that Thorin, KIng of the Dwarfs, is seduced by the gold in the Mountain, recovered from Smaug the dragon when he is killed. Thorin does not want to fight. The plot is set so that Thorin regains his inner hero and personally confronts Azog. A literal battle to the death. The final half hour is one long action and battle shot. Thorin's showdown on ice with Azog is epic. Thorin maintaining his balance somehow while fighting it out with someone 4/5 times his size and groomed for battle. Legolas has even better action during the ending sequences. How about jumping from a tower, putting his sword into the brain of a one ton giant (or so), corralling it like a steed, pointing it at the tower, collapsing it, and using it as a bridge to fight the next tough Orc. So the heroes fight to the death. One sees that all 6 films by Peter Jackson fit together. The Hobbit movies show Bilbo visiting the dwarfs. The first attack by Sauron and evil via Orcs. The Lord of the Rings movies take the ring back via Frodo ending up back in Mordor. Yes it is popcorn action but give Peter Jackson credit. He brought the epic story to life."
"deloudelouvain","7","6","10","3 June 2015"," Not the best one out of the trilogy but still okay
","I am not going to say anything about Tolkien or whatever like some other angry reviewers because I don't care. I will never get why people have to compare a book and a movie. We all know a book is almost always better then a movie so why in the hell if you read the book you still want to watch the movie that you know won't be as good? I didn't read the book, so I just watched the movie. It's for sure not the best one out of the trilogy but I was still entertained though and that's what it's all about to me. Okay sometimes I thought things could have been much better, like the battle between a couple of hundred thousand creatures without or almost without a single drop of blood spilled. But saying this movie is a complete disaster is ridiculous. I knew what to expect and that's what I got. Nothing more, nothing less. To me those movies are just too long, and that's about the only critique I'm going to write about. For the rest I enjoyed the fantasy world of the different kind of creatures. If you hate fantasy just don't watch this kind of movie then."

","A fantastic ending to the trilogy, leaving an avid LOTR fan wanting more! The Hobbit finale seems to have a lot of negative energy around it, concerning bad CGI and unnecessary story elements, which is understandable for die hard fans of the book and original stories. I for one, am not. As a watcher of the films and non-reader of the books, I felt like 'The Battle of Five Armies' tied together The Hobbit story perfectly and without a single dull moment. I was so drawn into the fantasy, the 'lack' of effective CGI was not noticed. Would highly recommend to any LOTR/Hobbit fans of course, as well as anyone with any interest in 'epic' adventure fantasy movies."
"mojavelandbaron","1","9","17","5 January 2015"," Movie Was a Waste of My Time and Money
","Hobbit: The Battle of the 5 Armies started out well, but sputtered to a miserable halt by the end. I was hoping to see Beorn, the half-man, half- bear pulverize Bolg (the great orc) during the final part of the battle as takes place in the book. Beorn is one of the most awesome forces of nature in JRR Tolken's book, yet Peter Jackson minimized his role just like he did in Desolation of Smaug, but thought it would be cute to add the bats and giant earthworms that were never in the book to begin with instead.<br/><br/>Jackson kills off at least 3 main characters that never died in the book, including King Thorin of Oakenshield who dies from fighting a Pale Orc that never existed in Tolken's tale either. Then, as if the ending of the movie weren't anti-climactic and depressing enough, Peter Jackson pencils in Bilbo coming home to an empty house because they (his fellow Hobbits in the Shire) thought he was dead and decided to auction off everything he owned. Seriously? <br/><br/>Parts of this movie were enjoyable, but this is a good example of a movie that started out well, but was ruined by an ending horrible enough to bring it down. My advice to Peter Jackson when bringing something like this to the Big Screen: Don't pollute a good story by someone like JRR Tolken with your excessive additions and deletions. Let it stand on its own as it is. That's why he's the author of this classic tale and you're not."
"eelvingarcia","7","9","17","24 December 2014"," Thorin and Bilbo were the best par of this film
","I guess the book worms are still heated over the decision of making it into three films, I wish these people would quit crying and Go away, if you don't like Pete's decision don't see it. Now to the review, I will say that I enjoyed this film, the acting was superb especially with Richard Armitage, he should definitely get some kind of recognition for his performance, it reminded me of Borimir. Martin freeman was outstanding also and the others had great moments. The pacing of the film was much better The individual fight sequences were well put together. The film was almost at quality of LOTR, but it failed in some parts and it was all decision making by Peter Jackson, some characters should've not been part of the film and others should've had more screen time. The movie has it's Jar Jar Binks which I think the intention was to provide comic Relief and it failed. If your going to steer away from the book which I have no problem with, than do it right. The CGI was good in some places and in others parts not so much. I had my issues with the CGI in ROTK and I wish he would of shot it in film instead of 4k video. Overall I give this film 8 and it's because of the acting of the main characters that carry the film."
"RNMorton","10","9","17","20 December 2014"," More appreciated the second time around
","I really like Mr. Winslow's lead comments, they pretty much sum it up for me. In retrospect The Hobbit only had two feature length movies in it (at MOST), fortunately a lot of the meat of the real story was left for this finale. I thought a lot about this - this is the tell: in the Lord of the Rings movies there were extended battle sequences but not extended personal battle sequences, which sort of exposes the attempt to fill the time; I found some of these personal battles tedious. In the LOTR movies the problem was cramming all of the material into the allotted time. Here it's the opposite (less so here than in the earlier Hobbits), so we see too many individual fight sequences which last too damn long. On the plus side the battle at Dol Guldur was excellent even though it wasn't set up very well. Dain of the dwarfs was great and Thranduil as king of the Woodelves very interesting. But the source material just isn't up to the LOTR and Jackson couldn't make up the difference. All that said, this is an impressive production and easily the best of the Hobbits, it's just that I'm such a Tolkein nut I won't live easily with less than perfection. I have to say I liked it considerably more the second time around than the first - in the first viewing I was comparing it to how I would have run the story, in the second I took it more on its terms. The Silmarilion is their last shot with that great author, we'll see if they go there."
"Spectravideo","2","20","45","14 December 2014"," What a let down!
","Let me first say that I thought that the first Hobbit movie (An Unexpected Journey) was great, the second movie (The Desolation of Smaug)a bit too stretched but still good. This third part was bad. Just so very, very bad. Why? Maybe it's because of the 144 minutes of total run time, 140 felt like it was just one long, boring battle. Or maybe it's the total lack of intelligent dialog: It lacks humor completely, it is full of empty words and is downright awful. At times I really cringed at the incredibly overstretched, laughable ""performances"". Or is it the fact that a modern, major (family) movie is without any female contribution of importance? No, I don't count Tauriel's constant, meaningless glaring or Galadriel's tiny, uninspiring part as anything worth mentioning. ""Blaah!"" is a word that sums it up for me. By all means, go and see it if you'd like to see orchs growling and Thorin looking troubled for two and a half hours."
"aharmas","10","13","27","15 December 2014"," Jackson does it again
","Yes, ""The Hobbit"" is a short novel, but Jackson is not a man who makes small movies; luckily for us, he can take an idea and with the help of his wife and the best available team, he allows to see worlds that dazzle and inspire us. Yes, coming up with three films from such a short narrative is a daunting experience, but after a shaky start, he managed to expand the story into a wondrous set of films. His latest is probably as good as any of the original LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>In the latest entry, Smaug is disposed of pretty quickly, and this is a bit disappointing at first because he's after all one of the coolest creations in any movie. Yes this dragon is both hot and cool, and having Cumberbatch voice him is just a joy. Don't worry because what follows is more of the spectacle and drama we expect from Jackson. He has plenty of substance in here, and it is as usual dazzling and magical.<br/><br/>The elves shine, and having Blanchett make an appearance is a stroke of genius. She's embodies the glamor and magic that is at the heart of these films. In this one, she makes quite an entrance, topping anything her character did before. Gandalf, is of course, the soul of the films, connecting most of the worlds and clarifying their ideas once in a while. He's also good at surviving and helping out those in need.<br/><br/>Two actors stand out in this story, Armitage who becomes a more complete character, as he must overcome his sudden descent into the world of greed and power. His scenes where he is fighting madness are some of the best acting of the year, and he has great chemistry with the other actor who has managed to keep this story going, Martin Freeman. Freeman keeps improving with time, as he finds himself in the middle of the political and action nightmare, somehow getting his hands on really important objects, which will either help or destroy those who might get their hands on them.<br/><br/>Of course, like the title indicates, the film is mostly about action, and in all the madness that leads and results from these events, there must be a solid foundation for all of these to have any meaning. There's loyalty, the fight for control, power, greed, animosities going back hundreds of years, fantasy and plenty of magic, and it is all there in glorious 3D, with the best of any production teams designing armors, props, worlds that originated in Tokien's imagination. There are all kinds of emotions with love affairs that might be doomed from the start, family dramas, friends who find themselves at odds, brotherly love, family love, all that will together result in one of the epic events of the year.<br/><br/>I'm noticing the film is not getting much love from critics, and it's not fair because it's one of the biggest achievements of the year, where equal care has gone into working on its heart, its philosophy, and of course, everything else that one can expect in an action movie. Last but not least, its heart beats strong with the support of a superb, brand new score by Shore, and a fantastic tune, sung in the credits by Billy Boyd. Overall, one of the best and most unforgettable films of this and any year."

","Not everything in this world gets what it deserves... but this trilogy, which hooked me with its first installment in 2012, gets the EXACT culmination which it deserved; Grand and Fulfilling.<br/><br/>The first two.episodes in this enchanting adventure of our little friends had very nicely built up the platform for an epic battle and my Word... is the battle EPIC or what. Right from the word go... it grasps your breath and doesn't let u breath or blink even for single moment... such is the pace of this ultimately gripping Finale of this Adventure of a lifetime... frame after frame...scene after scene... the intensity of the experience grows and not a single dull moment to break the trance of this magical journey.<br/><br/>And when the feverish pace of a multi-layered war finally leaves you breathless... thats when the soothing and serene penultimate portions give a velvety escort towards a highly satisfactory climax of all the anticipation and excitement that was built very intelligently over the last three years.<br/><br/>Any glitches?? None for me... i just wish the magical journey had never ended. Some might think that there is so much battle going on ... but this is what was supposed to happen in this episode after all the GRAND build up .. anything lesser than this would've been unfair.<br/><br/>And IMAX format served as a cherry on the cake.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it was a pleasure being a.part.of this adventure along with ever.endearing Bilbo Baggins and all the grumpy yet heroic dwarfs.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","11","22","20 December 2014"," A good if very flawed conclusion to an entertaining if very problematic trilogy
","Sure, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is not going to please die-hard fans of the book (as evident in the reviews here), mainly because of it being the case of three 2 1/2- 3 hour films based on a 300+ book, and it is not a patch on the brilliant Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies has several major problems, mostly similar problems to the previous two films An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug but more serious for some, but it also like the previous two have a lot of good even great elements too. Judging the trilogy on its own terms without comparison, I still see as a majorly flawed but entertaining trilogy of films.<br/><br/>As said, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a long way from flawless for similar reasons as before and they have been mentioned a number of times already. There is too much Alfrid and Tauriel and not enough Bilbo, rather criminal as he is the main character or is supposed to be. Unfortunately, neither Alfrid or Tauriel are particularly interesting. Especially Alfrid, who was incredibly obnoxious, not funny in the slightest and wasn't necessary to the story at all, for me his character is the worst thing about the entire trilogy. Tauriel is a little more tolerable, she is at least alluring and brings some heart in places, but like Desolation of Smaug but even worse the romance between her and Kili felt forced and shoe-horned in with some awkward writing. The script is also very messy and the most tonally imbalanced of all three films, there was a real sense one too many times that it didn't know what to do with itself.<br/><br/>There are some thoughtful parts but some parts were in need of more explanation, the romantic parts were sappily written and the corny humour returns and often is so juvenile particularly with Alfrid that it made the humour in An Unexpected Journey more sophisticated in comparison. It also doesn't do very well developing the characters, the only interesting characters were Thorin, Thranduil and to a lesser extent Bilbo. The dwarfs' roles are so insignificant here that you even forget who they are once the film's over, Beorn is wasted (again!), Azog didn't add a whole lot and still looks dodgy, Legolas does a lot of nice fighting skills and has a great scene with Thranduil but little else and the less said about Alfrid the better. The ending did feel abrupt and left more questions than answers. Despite the overlong and bloated consensus, actually if there was one film from the trilogy that could have benefited from being longer to tie up these loose ends it's this one.<br/><br/>However, like the previous two films The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies looks great. It's well shot, maintaining the softer but darker story-book look of Desolation of Smaug, the scenery and sets as always look amazing, the special effects while overused in places have an awe-inspiring effect (Smaug still looks magnificent, best designed dragon on film since Dragonslayer in my opinion) and the make-up is good. Howard Shore's music for Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit has never been less than good, the Lord of the Rings's music actually is incredible and one of the best film scores in recent years, and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is no exception. It isn't perfect, it's too bombastic at times in places that needed the opposite approach and one does miss the Misty Mountains theme from An Unexpected Journey, but it's still very ethereal and haunting. Billy Boyd's The Last Goodbye finishes the film beautifully and provides a strong emotional core.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's direction is decent but has been much better before, story direction wasn't a strong suit here and some scenes could have benefited from a less is more approach but he still shows mastery of visual style and detail and that he can create mood well. Story-wise The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the least involving, largely because most of the story of the book was covered in the previous two films. But it does move fairly briskly and has several fine moments(if not as much as the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum and Bilbo and Smaug previously), such as Dol Guldur, the scene between Legolas and Thranduil, the thrilling last battle, Galadriel vs. Sauron the fight on top of the frozen waterfall but especially great were the whole brilliantly played dynamic between Bilbo and Thorin, the excitingly tense Laketown sequence and the emotionally beautiful and clever ending scene.<br/><br/>Other than the look of the film, the best thing about The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the acting, which is the area where it is difficult to find fault. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is heartfelt, filled with curmudgeonly charm and grabs your attention every minute he's on screen while Richard Armitage plays Thorin's descending madness and angst with brooding intensity and raw emotion. Lee Pace elevates his material to a higher level and fleshes out Thranduil's moral ambiguity in a way that makes him one of the more memorable supporting actors, Ian McKellen is also perfectly cast as Gandalf and Benedict Cumberbatch is splendidly sinister as the Necromancer and especially Smaug. Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett are great value, Ian Holm makes a lovely appearance, Luke Evans is great and charismatic as Bard and Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly do play reliably though their characters could have been written better. Billy Connolly is a pleasant surprise and is entertaining and Sylvester McCoy isn't a liability either.<br/><br/>On the whole, possibly the weakest of the three(but the three Hobbit films are very close together in rating) but, while with a lot wrong, enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","10","11","22","15 December 2014"," What an end!
","Tears were falling from my eyes as the end credits rolled. The theater was in full delight and sorrow, both because of a grand movie and the fact that the Middle-Earth saga is over. The battle of the five armies is in fact the best Hobbit, it is an end that stands, by it's quality, far beyond all of the other Hobbit movies, but is still far from the masterpiece of LOTR. This movie showed us that Peter Jackson still knows how to make a grand epic movie that will shatter our nerves and make us laugh and cry, fill us with adrenaline and emotions. From the very start, and the true desolation, to the very end credits we are presented with, I dare say, the most complete hobbit movie. The characters were well placed, the actors did a great job (especially Luke Evans and Lee Pace), the story was nicely told and the ending was as spectacular as the title suggests. The pace of the movie is, in comparison to the last two movies, an absolute win. Just as the audience starts to be impatient and wants to scream at the screen for the battle, the battle begins. Just as one wants something to happen, it happens. It really is Christmass time, and Jackson fulfills all wishes of the audience. But, the thing that makes this movie so great is the fact that Jackson created an epic scale battle lasting over two hours that went parallel with the minimalistic duels of the main protagonists and antagonists. The comparison of the two, shows us that the magnitude of the grand battle is in the numbers fighting, and the magnitude of the duels is in the emotions the characters feel, but the feeling of grandeur while watching both is the same. This is, by far, the best element of The battle of the five armies. Do not get me wrong, this movie has it's flaws (as do all the hobbit movies) but in this movie they sort of seize to matter. One really doesn't care that Azog or Bolg are so CGI that one feels as if watching a video game, because the battle of Thorin and Legolas with the two is so fierce and tense that one really doesn't care. One of the most interesting parts are the roles of Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman. The fight at Dol Guldur made the theater shiver in fear. The voice of Sauron (brilliantly done by Cumberbatch) whose words echo in the darkness resemble demons in horror movies. But that fear is (as usual) remedied by light and good - just in time to give the audience a break from the darkness (and the battle itself is impressive).<br/><br/>Looking back, the hobbit trilogy never really stood a chance against the LOTR trilogy. The complexity of the book is far less than the LOTR books, and that is why these movies never really could be as grand and epic as LOTR. Still, I believe more could have been done, less CGI should have been used and the outcome would have been better. But, it all starts and ends with what Jackson had as a literary background. The trilogy is enjoyable, entertaining, truly grand and beautiful, and a really perfect way to introduce us into the LOTR. I fear that this might be the last Jackson makes of Middle-Earth, the end credit song does go in that direction, but do not lose hope. Whenever one feels the need to slip away into this land, all you have to do is play the movies. Jackson changed the world and made history, and even though there are bad things that could be said about these movies, in the end it really doesn't matter - they are as grand as the tales they were based on."

"ericrnolan","9","5","8","29 September 2015"," A very short review of ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014)
","I think that ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014) is the best of Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy, and not only because of its predictably terrific climactic battle. I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>First, it's less cartoonish and far more adult than its predecessors, in everything from its themes to its fight choreography. (Compare the beautifully staged final melees here, for example, with that Warner Brothers-esque sequence in the second film, in which the dwarfs dance across barrels and river rapids to repel their orc pursuers.)<br/><br/>It also seems like a better peek at a larger fantasy universe, with different races, armies and cultures working at cross purposes before needing to align, and with more than one protagonist's real failings factoring in to that.<br/><br/>And  HOT DAMN! That's GOTTA be the greatest depiction of a dragon I've ever seen. One small quibble I've had throughout all of Jackson' Tolkien films was that the stories' antagonists sometimes seemed too silly and clownish to be truly menacing. (The orcs, trolls and goblins seemed cartoonish and are too easily defeated by beings sometimes half their height; only the Nazguls and the Uruk- Hai hybrids managed to impress.) Jackson's depiction of Smaug ravaging Laketown makes dragons look like Middle Earth's equivalent of a goddam nuclear device."
"CMTiago","7","5","8","23 May 2015"," An effects spectacle
","I decided from the very start to take this film for what it was gonna be and that was a finale with the most epic of battles. As far as story and characters go, the movie does resonate with me on a couple of things. First and foremost, Thorin's transition from a man obsessed with power to a fighting warrior that is willing to die for his brothers is one of the good things this movie brings. Bilbo is also another character that gets good closure, and let's be honest, it would be a travesty if he didn't since he is in the movie's title. Regardless of how you felt about their objective, the battle scenes were terrificly shot and added to the overall scope of the film.<br/><br/>Still not all is well with this final chapter in the saga, such as the misguided way to highlight all stories in the movie. It straight up continues on from the end of DOS, as it takes care of that in the first 20 minutes, making it only the official end of the previous movie. With Desolation Of Smaug we still had a meet up between Gandalf and Thorin prior to the mission, something I felt was a good way to start an individual chapter. Once again, criticism of how the book was divided is reasonable. I think with some good editing, these three movies could have easily become one 3-hour single film with each of the three movies made taking one hour. Instead we got what we got and it ended up only having some good moments when compared to the ultimate journey that was The Lord Of The Rings. <br/><br/>So to close this review, I say that The Hobbit trilogy had its ups and downs. I found the first one nothing more than a set-up with some dullness behind it. The second one upped the ante and is my favorite of the trilogy and the last one tried its best to wrap up everything in a pleasing fashion. Having come after the LOTR movies, the comparison was always gonna be unfair and given that a trilogy was drawn out of one book, the adaptation was always going to be difficult. Despite this, I appreciated the efforts and actually found the last 2 movies to be quite entertaining if slightly muddled in their overall cuts.<br/><br/>Rating: 7,5-8/10"
"bigjackfilms","9","5","8","24 January 2015"," Perfect Way To Wrap A Six Part Epic.
","I've already seen this final Hobbit film way more than I should of. Why? Well two reasons. One is because the title itself promises a giant battle which I'm a big sucker for, but also the fact that its the last movie. Lord Of The Rings was a big game changer in my life and the reason I go back to this one, like I did with Return Of The King some 10 years ago, is because I denied that it would end. I felt this film, while it has a few major flaws (that will probably be explained in the Extended Cut) I can't deny it was a fun ride. All the characters, especially Thorin and Bilbo are great together. Gandalf and that whole battle with Sauron was bad-ass and a great piece of Fan Service, which is one thing this movie has allot of but I don't mind. And that battle. WOW! What a blast! While it's overuse of CGI was noticeable, it was still great to see the five armies duke it out, as well the sound mix was great. I did really like the Taruiel/Kili story the next few times going in and while not in the book its still pretty heartbreaking. Plus, I'll admit the ending got me a little choked up, but hey that's Jackson for you. But there are some major flaws with this theatrical film. I found Alfred annoying and took allot of the time in this movie that did not need to be there. Some of the ending with allot of major characters didn't feel wrapped up and the ""Legolas Mario Jump"" scene, that really threw me off, and I called complete bulls*it. But overall, this film and the entire Hobbit trilogy as a whole was a fun ride. Does it match to Lord Of The Rings? No. But take it for what its worth, some good characters, great action scenes, allot of fan service and good tie ins to the Epic Trilogy we've known and love. 9/10."
"bob the moo","Null","5","8","18 January 2015"," Fairly consistent action carries it along, even if there is little to it and even impacting moments are lessened by the relentlessness
","Perhaps it is me getting older but I do wonder if I was too kind on the original Lord of the Rings films in light of how disappointed I had been with the Hobbit films. Maybe because it was all new and different, or maybe they were genuinely better films than these. Anyway, as the Company continues their mission, so too did I return for the conclusion of this trilogy; although it must be said that I did not rush to it or have a great deal of excitement. The cliff- hanger from the previous film did win me over though, plus I wanted to see it through.<br/><br/>The opening sequence picking up on Smaug's attack on the town turned out to be pretty impressive; okay we still have people surviving impossible special effects, but Smaug was a strong part of the previous film and remained so here. There is a feeling of anti- climax after this sequence finishes, but the story continues and builds reasonably well as we see the various armies position themselves (albeit many seem to be able to appear by magic at the drop of a hat). With various action sequences this leads us into many fight sequences with lots of movements and CGI. All of this is reasonably okay but it never seems to stop, and gradually I found myself sort of numbed by it. I think it was the ongoing lack of consequence and depth to it all that did it, because technically it all does look impressive but yet it feels very much like a video game too many times.<br/><br/>The feeling of lack of consequence was a surprise to me though, particularly since we had major characters dying – so in theory that should be a surprise and an impact. Unfortunately for me and the film, most of these are hurt by me frankly not being that engaged with some of these characters and their specific stories, while the delivery of these moments tended to be overly done, so they didn't have a genuine impact so much as a melodramatic one. With the battles I also found that the film didn't seem to convey the sense of scale it should have done. It produces plenty of crowd shots and sweeping cameras, but most fights seem very small and disconnected from the bigger picture; they still work for what they are, but they felt like the film was smaller by virtue of them.<br/><br/>The cast are mixed but mainly everyone does what they do behind heavy costume and make-up, and with lots of green-screen work. The problem is more that the most interesting characters generally don't get the most time – in particular it was a shame that Freeman did not get enough to do considering how good he was throughout. Armitage is good as Thorin, but mostly people were a blur of ears and facial hair (depending on their race). Lilly and Bloom were the ones that stuck in the mind for the wrong reasons – I found them dull.<br/><br/>So the trilogy ends and being honest I am not too sad to see it go. As a film there is probably enough action and dramatics to carry it through the time, but at the same time this is the issue with it. The relentless CGI-heavy action wore me down somewhat, and as I didn't really engage with the story due to the previous films, it was hard to do much here even if some of the specifics offered hope. It is solidly good enough for fans to feel they finished out the story with a bang, but for me it was another very expensive and technologically impressive so-so film in the trilogy."
"GipsyDanger84","4","5","8","8 January 2015"," So much wasted potential for this trilogy
","To start, I rarely write reviews for films anymore. I see them, I feel what I feel for them and then I move on. However, after seeing this film last night, I had the urge to write this. I don't even know where to begin. Perhaps that I would say this is far and away the worst movie to take place in Middle Earth by PJ. So many baffling decisions that I can't understand where they could come from. In no particular order<br/><br/>1) The Dragon Sickness: The first time we see Thorin, we can see that something is wrong. He looks dazed, he's overly irritable. He's got...dragon sickness! What? The gold is cursed? Since when? Yes, his grandfather went mad with greed and an obsession for gold, but that was shown to happen over a long period of time, and not until after the Arkenstone was found. Why does it happen RIGHT AWAY to Thorin? Also, as soon as he uttered the word ""false"" I lost it. So you're telling me the gold has the same effects of the one ring? Give me a break<br/><br/>2) Dain and the dwarf army: So you cast a great, very recognizable actor in Billy Connolly to play Dain, a dwarf lord. Great! That sounds awesome! I can't wait to see what they...wait, is he cgi? They had to cgi a dwarf lord ala Robert Zemeckis? WHAT THE*#*#! Are you serious? Could you not get him on location? THEN CAST ANOTHER ACTOR! That may have been the worst abuse of cgi in a trilogy already over run with unnecessary cgi. And let's make the entire dwarf army look like we just hit copy followed by paste. Wow.<br/><br/>3) Randomness: Thorin, Kili, Fili, and Dwalin need to get to the top of that mountain to stop Azog, The Generic. Good thing these rams that have never been seen before in the entirety of the trilogy just happen to be right in front of us in the middle of a battlefield. Bilbo and Balin are talking as Bilbo says goodbye to all of his remaining dwarf friends (like Dwalin (who he hasn't actually spoken to since the first film), Bofur, Gloin, and...umm...who knows and who cares really?) and he shares a laugh with them. All of a sudden, we have a close up of a laughing Gandalf, who until that time I had no idea he was even in the scene! MAGIC! The Were-Worms (Were actually means ""man"" so...man worms?). Hey, check out this awesome tunneling worms! What's that, you've never heard of/seen them before? Well...SHUTUP! Hey guys, remember that half man, half bear guy that we introduced in the beginning of DOS and has a total of 2 minutes of screen time? The eagles are going to air drop him in! You guys should totally cheer, because he's a character we all love right? RIGHT?! Don't worry about his fate, we won't show him ever again after that.<br/><br/>4) Legolas: Do I even need to point out how stupid his character is in this film? Woof<br/><br/>There are more than this (like the monsters that look like Abe Vigoda in that snickers commercial), but I'll run out of space. The worst part about this film, and trilogy in general, is that I can see the potential for this being absolutely stunning. There are scenes where Jackson reminds you how amazing these films could have been, but they are far outnumbered by this Lucas version of Middle Earth. Just a sad, disappointing film and trilogy."
"nick-gall4","8","5","8","4 January 2015"," Superb - Warning - Spoiler Alert
","Having seen and enjoyed the three Lord of the Rings films, I was,keen to see this trilogy but somewhat dubious of it being a credible adaptation of the book in question; and that has to be remembered, it as based on the book and does not claim to be an exact copy. Despite my initial doubts,it was shaping up to be an enjoyable trilogy Myself and my 12 year old son had watched the first two parts, and for us,this topped them both.<br/><br/>The beginning, with the death of a certain Dragon, catapults you into the film headfirst, and works beautifully. <br/><br/>The battle scenes are all they should be - and more - and Thorins battle with himself is handled well. <br/><br/>There are odd moments of levity, some real sadness and the film never feels overlong.

","I have just watched the new video game ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the five armies"" at the theater and tried to stop myself from writing about it, because this video game does not deserve this attention, but I still am going to do this in memory of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the rings"" which was truly the reason why I gave the new trilogy a chance.<br/><br/>""Frodo: I can't do this, Sam.<br/><br/>Sam: I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.<br/><br/>Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?<br/><br/>Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.""<br/><br/>And this quote says it all...<br/><br/>But let me rephrase that. I have just witnessed how Peter Jackson (due to his own meanings or pushed by the new studio bossing around) has beheaded the little faith I had in him. The third Hobbit installment brought me to laughter, anger and almost to tears because of its outright stupidity and insipidness. And to stop generalizing, I'm going to put some points in front. First of all Peter Jackson has indeed committed crimes against the true story and characters from the children's book ""The Hobbit, or There and Back Again"". Too many people have seen this coming since we saw the first movie (which by the way was the least miserable from the three pieces). The imaginative character of Tauriel and the ludicrous relationship between the elf and the dwarf Kili is such a ""gem"" in this set of tragic mistakes that I must not say more. Mr. Jackson thoughtfully incorporated made-up parts in the story which didn't only made these movies look silly, but they destroyed his own credibility as a director loyal to Tolkien and to the fans. Yes indeed, three films will make much more money than one film. But this will never bring Jackson to the high place which he held in the hearts of the fans and in the minds of the critics. ""The Return of the King"" took all 11 Oscars for which it was nominated namely BECAUSE it was true to the books. J.R.R. Tokien's writings are true mirrors of the human nature and history and are indeed beautiful examples of how a person can relay humanity. None such occurred in at least the second and the third Hobbit films. I think that we saw a fantasy equivalent to the Avengers' stupidity. Still ""The Avengers"" was mostly true to its origins. Which is why ""The Battle of the Five armies"" cannot win the audience only with perfect character design, major battles, wonderful music and brief winks towards ""The Lord of the Rings"". The intended soul of the new trilogy - the friendship, the loyalty to comrades and keeping the given promise - were vaguely affecting the viewers back at the theater. Not only because the director and the actors did not meant what they were showing us, but also because it was NOT true. There is no such big emphasis in the book on these highlighted moments. Thus there is such a logical fiasco in front of us.<br/><br/>Maybe I am too harsh on this movie and on Peter Jackson. Maybe I am just a fan of Tolkien who feels hurt, because the book material of J.R.R. Tolkien was treated like a source of money. But I think that as Sam said before in The Two Towers - ""Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why."" And Jackson just had to do one movie true to the book. Nothing else. Maybe it would have been less successful than the previous trilogy. I think that it would have not earned any awards at all. But it would have been still an interesting piece to be seen and the true fans of Tolkien's work would have liked it. As a matter of fact I think that most of the people would have liked compared to the situation now. The true story is always emotionally overwhelming and mindfully compelling.

","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the final part of Peter Jackson's trilogy split adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book. Compared to the last two, this installment consists more action, trying to give the explosive payoff that many of the fans were waiting for, for like two years. And as an action blockbuster, The Battle of the Five Armies does succeed, but it still feels like a fragment. A part of the story that shouldn't be treated as a singular experience, that the story and character development from the past films should be fresh in the mind to be compelled with this particular experience. The movie itself is pretty dazzling on its own, but that is probably just it. This is just one epic climax extended into a two hour or so feature film.<br/><br/>Just like The Desolation of Smaug, this installment feels really dependent on the other films for the viewers to appreciate the feature as a whole. The first Hobbit movie already has a standalone arc to leave the audience satisfied, but the following two are really reliant to each other that only seeing one of them at the same day won't really be enough of an experience, in spite of already having the largest spectacles of the franchise. The Battle of the Five Armies offers more epic warfare than anything else: the tone is darker, there's a lot of impressive set pieces and remarkable (and even emotional) thrills here and there. There is also some character moments that needed to be challenged, but they are only scattered around and resolved a little too easily. Still, the real conflict here is the war and the film does a great job for that, but it also gets exhausting until it becomes dramatic near the end of the fights.<br/><br/>The amount of battles is probably ultimate, but you could point out some memorable bits. This is not one of those blockbusters that just throw away some random CGI flare, though it's sometimes getting there, but director Peter Jackson still chooses to be creative at many turns of the warfare. Even though there's too much special effects on screen, it still doesn't let it be just a grandeur design, there is tension containing in those digital images. While the majority of the film is all fighting, the cast still manages to shine in their characters. With Martin Freeman sticking to the same charm and earnestness his performance has always been as Bilbo Baggins. The rest of them, while more serious, does compellingly in their important moments of the movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is fun, once you get used to it, but it really feels like just a missing ending of the last one, been found for a whole year. There is a reason why this should have been a single movie or at least a double split. Stretching an entire climax for nearly two hours is probably too much of an experience. Even with the filmmakers handling each action scene well, it still doesn't make for a good replacement of a better narrative. What the fans should be thankful is it didn't become some The Matrix Revolutions fiasco or a lazy special effects show that distracts the viewers out of nothing. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is still a good conclusion of the saga, leaving us its last good thrills and emotions."

","The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is an iconic storyline about the struggle between good and evil, complete with all of the drama and pageantry surrounding the attacks by Smaug and the final Battle. Good clearly defined against evil, just as Tolkien wrote it. While the film was somewhat ""heavy-handed"" with the use of CGI, there is no doubt that it was a required necessity. For those who would dispute the need, I challenge you to show me an orc army ready for filming which would not require hours daily in make-up for hundreds. Even though this has been done for many films, and it is possible to expand the number of people ""seen"" with electronic technology, it inevitably comes out looking like computer expansion.

","The entire Hobbit Trilogy has left me feeling like a mug. I wouldn't have watched the last two movies at all if I hadn't caved to peer pressure and I'm annoyed at myself for condoning this tripe by handing New Line my money. My objections are the same as many others. The hobbit is a children's story its about 365 pages long. the first movie covers about the first 56 pages! then we have Legolas and other elves popping up. bizarre love stories between elves and a weirdly handsome dwarf who doesn't actually look like any other dwarf in any of the other movies. If you are going to pad out the movie then surely the white council's attack on Dol Guildor could have been developed in a far more interesting way. There were moments in this film when I thought Jackson had just accepted the franchise had gone to hell and he was mooning the audience and trying to wind hobbit fans up. Billy Coloney and Dune, I'll say no more save, ""To hell with you too matey."" The hobbit isn't about the book, its about money. its a Hollywood hatchet job on a good book. They are not the first studio to wreck a book, they won't be the last, but the scale of the sting and the amount of money they raked in can't make movie goers feel very clever right now. Like I said I feel like a right mug. After being dragged to the last Transformers movie and being dragged to three of these expensive wastes of my life, enough's enough. There are a few movies I fancy catching this year but I sorry dudes if I don't fancy a movie my mates want to watch then I'm not going. I'm not this big an idiot so I'm not going to go!"

","I've spent many words on my reviews of the first two Hobbit movies, but I will keep it short for this one, since 'The Battle of the Five Armies' hardly deserves to be called a movie, even performing worse than his two predecessors.<br/><br/>The awful mistake of cutting the book in three movies is most painfully apparent in this final chapter: there is no proper beginning (the lack of the traditional prologue being symptomatic), middle or ending, just a mess of random moments lumped together, without any sense of tension, logic, emotion or narrative flow. All effort has been put in creating pointless and extremely unrealistic action sequences instead of developing a transparent and moving story line. Also, while AUJ (Riddles in the Dark) and DOS (Bilbo meeting Smaug) at least had one great scene, such a (single) highlight was disappointingly missing in BOFTA; instead, we got Alfrid receiving an inexplicably large amount of screen time to act annoyingly over-the-top (failing miserably to add the intended comic relief). To make things even worse, everything after the battle is extremely rushed: we can only guess what happened with Bard, Tauriel, the treasure, the different armies, etc., whereas 'The Return of the King' rightly took its time for proper closures.<br/><br/>I guess there was room for two good movies or maybe even one; now, there is actually no getting around that Jackson single-handedly created a parody of his own, infinitely superior LOTR trilogy."

","Bilbo and his company of dwarfs finally reach the Lonely Mountain, but Thorin's homecoming is not as joyous an occasion as everyone would have thought.<br/><br/>This review is as spoiler-free as I could possibly make it despite how badly I want to talk about every little thing that happened in this movie Picking up where The Desolation of Smaug Ended, The Battle of the Five Armies begins with Smaug havocking Lake-town and the dwarfs searching Erebor. Thorin, falling under the same curse of his predecessors, grapples with what is real and what is imaginary amidst the rest of the world preparing for war. The story concludes with an epic battle worthy of the standards we have all come to expect from Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>My Thoughts If you have read my other Hobbit reviews, you know that I look at the books and movies separately, as the movies have added, subtracted, and rearranged characters, lines, and scenes. That being said, I feel as though this trilogy could not have ended more perfectly and appropriately. Jackson went into this movie with the paramount intention of tying The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and he exceeded my expectations for doing so. The added scenes helped this movie reach its conclusion instead of—what I felt were—filler scenes to make certain battles seem longer or different meetings seem more foreboding; and quite frankly, some of the added pieces were badass. One of my favorite ""extra"" scenes is how Gandalf escapes captivity; it's a fight scene worthy of the characters in it and the actors who play them.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books, I'm sure you can assume that there are some pretty intense deaths in this movie (there are five armies fighting, after all). Even though I knew they were coming, they were heart-wrenchingly intense.<br/><br/>In closing, I think this was an excellent conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy and the tie-ins to The Lord of the Rings trilogy could not have been any better. There is a great transition involving Legolas (I geeked out in the theater), and there was a cliché but perfect transition to The Fellowship of the Ring at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>My only criticism was even though PJ sold me on Tauriel, I'm sort of confused how she left the story; I'm hoping that it'll be addressed in the extended edition.<br/><br/>If you see this movie, I don't think you'll be disappointed; and if you're anything like me, you'll be kind of sad when you leave the theater knowing that this is the last trip to Middle Earth."

Editing was atrocious and there was no link between scenes. Beorn had 15 secs of screen time and then he just disappeared.<br/><br/>The final battle was a joke. Most of the scene was focused on duels featuring Thorin vs Azog and Legolas vs Bolg, with some orcs being killed in the process.<br/><br/>Trolls were retarded, by killing themselves, when they were hitting walls. Gandalf does nothing in the whole movie.<br/><br/>The plot holes were here and much worse this time. Yes, the eagles are back! Guess what? They save the day yet again! That's funny, because they were nowhere to be seen in Desolation of Smaug. So, are you telling me that the eagles couldn't take the characters to the mountain, after saving them in the first Hobbit? That's some BS right there.<br/><br/>The orcs now have worms. So, what happened to the worms? Why didn't they appear in Lord of The Rings? Yeah, no explanation.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to focus on a character that nobody likes. Guess what, he steals money and he freaking survives in that flick. <br/><br/>Don't give money to them! This movie is insanely flawed and clearly cut. The carriage scene from the trailer is NOT in the movie. You're paying to watch something incomplete.

Sure, it's not as good as Return of the King but it did conclude the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves in their quest to free the dwarves' ancestral home. There was action and thrills plus battle scenes that could make everything else look tame. The Hobbit trilogy may not be as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's still better than the Star Wars prequel trilogy. If you don't care for the Hobbit trilogy's theatrical cuts, at least give the extended editions a chance. You can find a boxed set of the extended cuts at any movie store. I watched them and enjoyed all of them, especially the third one. They're a little long but they're worth it. Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here. There are some creative liberties taken, but don't let that throw you off. It's a decent conclusion and don't be too judgmental or expect a lot. Just expect to be entertained, all right?"

","Less is more, and there was plenty of that in the tightly made first two Hobbit movies, as good as any of the well planned Lord of the rings series. I realized within the first half hour that the series should have concluded with the end of Smaug, moving this third series into outlandish and convoluted messiness after the second film's fist wrenching cliff hanger was resolved within 20 minutes of this film. Suddenly, there's a bunch of new threats to keep Thorin from taking back his mountain as humans, elves, dwarfs and Smaug's evil ogres fight. In the meantime, I began fighting a huge headache, and I blame the over ambition for this entry for giving it to me.<br/><br/>Certainly, the idea of the end of one battle leading to others is promising drama, having been evidenced in real history. But none of what transpires here is in ""The Hobbit"" in my memory of having read it at least three times. This shows as much desperation in the desire to continue the franchise that has turned ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series into an abysmal joke.<br/><br/>Characters that you rooted for in the first two films are pretty much destroyed here, and the voice of Smaug continues to pop up, not only to haunt Bilbo Baggins but to voice villainous characters as well. The lack of loyalty to the original novel is very apparent, turning this into an obnoxious cliché of different levels of magic represented for both good and evil. Films like this take away my confidence in the modern Hollywood method of making movies, and reminds me why I avoid movie theaters now for the most part. They say that too much of a good thing can damage a final product, and this is evidence of how true that is."

","An Unexpected Journey was decent but during the Desolation of Smaug, I could notice a sharp decline in quality and things began to really drag out. The Battle of Five Armies continues that trend. The CGI that is used in the battle scenes are absolutely terrible, which I'm sure you noticed in the first two films. However, there is a battle scene that is absurdly long. There is no sense of danger whatsoever. It's almost like they are fighting on the moon, weightless. The orcs pose no threat at all! And that Azog character, what a joke! Not only does he look like a cartoon character, his role is so stupid! There's also so many new devices that the orcs use in battle that we don't see in the LOTR Trilogy... they really catered to the kids in this trilogy.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this trilogy is that it pretty much forces you to go and watch the LOTR Trilogy again just to make up for this."

I'll just list my least favourite aspects: Tauriel, Legolas, the fight scenes, Thorin, the clichés, the trailer, the war, the ridiculously impossible stunts done by the elves, the whole movie to be honest. So, let me get this right, Legolas struggled to kill 50 Urukai in LoTR, but took out at least 500 orcs on screen in this movie??? What happened between the Hobbit and LoTR? Did he just get old and lost his ability to take out 500 victims in one fight? That can't be it, because let's assume he's better than average in fighting for an elf, wouldn't like 10 average elves be able to take out an entire army on their own? Just imagine what that army at Helm's Deep could've done. They would've obliterated the Urukai long before the Rohirim arrive. Sorry guys, but this was a poorly-conceived movie even if you like epic fight sequences. Boooooring."

Around 90% of the time, there's some kind of battle going on, this made me unfocused and disappointed. It's always nice to get a break after a long lasting fight to clear your mind and wait for another unexpected thing to come into the picture, but it just never occurs which will even make you annoyed during a few moments! If you've read the storyline, then please don't expect there will be more of it to see, it even made me question Peter Jackson's skills of directing. The main character, Bilbo Baggers won't be seen as often as he should, it's too much focus on just Thoril, I felt the missing pieces while this happened, I even forgot he had the main character in some parts.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to inform you this, but it's not like the LOTR trilogy, were the third film is incredibly long while it's still very watchable and entertaining, ""The Hobbit"" films will get worse and worse, and that's in my opinion clear facts.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey: 8/10 The Desolation of Smaug: 7/10 The Battle of the Five Armies: 5/10"

","So, not only did Jackson somehow find the way to dilute what basically amounts to 30-40 pages at most in the original book into a 2.5-hour film filled with confused fights, ninja-elves and inconsistent acting: in the end, after more than 8 hours of trilogy, he realized he needed to actually have an ending, so he cooked up a quick one and left a troll-load of unanswered questions behind. Who will rule the dwarven city now that the king is dead? What will happen to the fine folks of Laketown? Who exactly beat the orc army near the town when the king was elsewhere fighting Azog? What happened to that oily character Alfrid - did he manage to escape? On what terms did dwarfs, men and elves leave each other? Beorn came to the rescue with the eagles, kicked some serious orc butt and then.... what? Plus a dozen more subplots left dangling.<br/><br/>If the first movie had left me disappointed and the second one had left me bored, this third and final piece of the puzzle left me just deeply annoyed. A complete waste of resources and beautiful source material. Whatever goodwill Peter Jackson had rightfully gained with the first wonderful trilogy is now forever squandered. And please, let us never see another installment of Legolas again: the elves are immortal, but Orlando Bloom is not, and no CGI in the world can remove the years his face has accumulated."
"filipemanuelneto","3","4","6","20 December 2016"," The awaited end of the trilogy (for the worst reasons).
","This film ends ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, which is a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"". Its not a trilogy that has reached to the third film in the best shape, since all the magic that LOTR had to spare is totally absent from the first two films. In this film, Thorin Oakenshield's company conquers the lonely mountain and the dragon is defeated, but the fate of the dwarven treasure is uncertain as it is disputed by many interested parties.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on how Peter Jackson and his team adapt the original material of J.R.R. Tolkien because I never read it. As far as the actors' work is concerned, I think the film has sinned by scattering too much attention in a wide range of eminently secondary characters, stealing the scene from the main actors in the trilogy such as Richard Armitage (Thorin) or Martin Freeman (Bilbo). The latter was particularly affected: Bilbo was almost relegated to the supporting cast. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), who are largely secondary characters, have more time on the screen than the little hobbit who tells us everything. This was very bad for the film and the trilogy, and unfair to the good work developed by Freeman. Despite this, most actors have risen to the challenge with solid, credible and consistent interpretations. The rhythm of the film seems strange: the first half-hour is an endless CGI action show, followed by an hour of slow battle preparations, where the audience almost falls asleep. Then, suddenly, we are again thrown into the middle of the action and the incessant CGI, which bombards us with sound and images to the point that everything seems pointless and meaningless. The incompetent and unfortunate cinematography we criticized in the early films continues to victimize key action sequences, just as brutal CGI abuse, who makes them increasingly unrealistic and boring. The soundtrack, by Howard Shore, is at the level of expectations, as in the whole trilogy.<br/><br/>With ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" comes to an end one of the biggest disappointments I've had, as far as cinema is concerned. I confess that I expected much more from this trilogy. There was enough quality material for an trilogy equal (if not better) as ""Lord of the Rings"". The actors did their best, and I have no doubt they would have done better if they could. The script failed because it was too deconcentrated (mostly in this movie). The director, Peter Jackson, has failed and will surely join George Lucas in the list of absurdly addicted to redundant and meaningless special effects. It's a good thing that there will not be a fourth movie.Certain things have a time to end, and LOTR has has exceeded this time thanks to this unfortunate trilogy. So, let ""Lord of The Rings"" rest in peace."
"brando647","6","4","6","18 June 2016"," Peter Jackson's Epic Six-Movie Tolkien Series Ends with a Disinterested Shrug
","Finally, Bilbo Baggins returns to the Shire. After three bloated movies originating from around 300 pages of content, we've reached the end and I'm so glad to be done with it all. After a total of six movies set in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, I'm totally fine with never hearing the word Hobbit again. His HOBBIT series concludes with the grand finale, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES. When we last saw Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and their company of dwarven companions, they had been left to gape helplessly as the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) got tired of chasing them through the mountain kingdom of Erebor and took to the skies to burn neighboring Laketown to cinders. This movie rejoins the action at that very moment, abandoning the dwarfs to focus on Smaug and local hero Bard (Luke Evans), who chooses to engage the dragon. Ten or so minutes later, the whole dragon plot that kept us trudging to the theater for these movies is resolved and we spend the next three hours on the titular battle. You see, Thorin immediately begins to succumb to what the dwarfs call ""dragon-sickness"" and what us normal folk would call ""greed"". He's got his rightful kingdom back with more gold than he could ever need, and now he refuses to share it with anyone. The men of Laketown, led by Bard, come knocking in hopes of at least getting some gold for their dwarven-caused dragon troubles (i.e. the incineration of their entire town) and Thorin refuses. Even the woodland elves of Mirkwood Forest come stomping in with an army to demand a share. And, of course, the orc commander Azog has unfinished business with Thorin, having devoted two full previous movies to hunting the would-be dwarven king in hope of ending his bloodline. So all of these armies converge on the front lawn of Erebor forwait for itthe battle of the five armies.<br/><br/>Six movies deep into this franchise and I can safely say THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is my least favorite of the bunch. I was so burned out on Middle Earth by the time this movie came around that I refused to see it in the theater. It's the only Peter Jackson/Tolkien movie that I never saw in the theater. I didn't bother watching it until the extended editions were released. In a movie that already feels like 90% filler, I can only imagine what had been added after the theatrical release. Sadly, most of this movie is utterly forgettable. The visual effects are impressive and the 45 minute final battle sequence certainly looks good, but did we need any of this? I don't think so. And, come on, 45 minutes is just too much. That's 45 minutes of CGI swarms of dwarfs, elves, orcs, and men hacking and slashing at each other and the occasional diversion to see what our heroes are doing so the story can keep pushing on. This means that every so often we'll break way so we can seeI don't knowLegolas (Orlando Bloom) hanging upside down from a giant bat monster while swinging his arms wildly to slice and dice a bunch of cartoon monsters that aren't really there. If I sound biased against this movie, it's because I believe its existence to be completely unnecessary and the whole exercise of creating it a gratuitous waste of time for Jackson and his crew. Tolkien's tale could've been handled in two better-paced films. I've been against the heavy use of CGI in these movies since AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY was released and this film just shoves it in my face with unmercifully long sequences of those same hated CG effects bouncing off each other. Would it have killed them to use some of those amazing practical costume/makeup effects for orcs in the foreground to give it an added sense of realism?<br/><br/>THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is only really interesting for the first act and the final act. Everything in the middle could've been trimmed generously. Unfortunately, when the big tragic moments begin to happen in the final act of the battle, I'm so worn out from the battle itself that they hold no weight. By that point, I'm just wishing we could skip to the end. THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't a horrible film but I can't imagine it rising to the top and becoming anyone's favorite Jackson/Tolkien movie. It's got some nice stuff in there. Martin Freeman is still perfect for the role of Bilbo, even if he has nothing to do here. I loved the addition of Billy Connolly to the cast as Thorin's cousin Dain and I loved his behind-the-scenes interviews even more, where he admits that he never cared for Tolkien's work and freely mocked anyone who did. Smaug is still awesome for what little time we're given with him, and Jackson even found a way to shoehorn Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee into the series one last time. If I remember the novel correctly, Tolkien spares us the full details of the battle, choosing to knock Bilbo out when the action starts and filling him in later. In my ideal cut of Jackson's HOBBIT series, we'd get the same treatment. Bilbo is knocked unconscious and the movie would fade out; we fade in, the battle is over, the surviving characters fill us in on what happened in the form of a flashback montage. Keeps the movie a pleasant length and spares us from battle fatigue. In retrospect, I still enjoy Jackson's HOBBIT movies. The first one is enjoyable enough and was actually pretty solid. This third one thoughouch. An epic six movie series and it ends with a shrug. That's the real disappointment."

","Whenever I saw the Hobbit films for the first time, they seemed amazing. It probably helped that before Desolation of Smaug came out I hadn't read the book in years. Even after I re-read it, though, I still found them fun, and not as devoid of emotion as everyone says they are. But when you wait a while and you let what you saw turn over in your mind for a bit, the flaws start to appear. That's exactly what happened with each Hobbit movie, including this one. And this time the flaws are more obvious.<br/><br/>This movie continues with what the previous two did right. This includes excellent acting and casting. I never felt that anybody was miscast and they all did a very good job. Like in the previous films, Martin Freeman shone as Bilbo Baggins; I believe that he was perfect for the role, which is why it's a shame he felt more like a major character instead of the main character. <br/><br/>The Dol Guldur subplot was something I enjoyed, and it helped tie the Hobbit in with Lord of the Rings, as well. It could be considered padding since it doesn't have much bearing on the dwarfs and Bilbo's story, but it's a good story to connect the two series. <br/><br/>The movie also gives Thorin, Kili, Bard, and Thranduil more of a personality, like the last one did. However, while they built up some personality for some of the characters, they just didn't grab me the way the LotR characters did, except for Gandalf and Bilbo. Thorin's death was sad, but I didn't feel too upset, the same goes for Kili and Fili's deaths. In contrast, I still get sad every time I see Boromir die, but I don't really feel anything for the trio of dwarfs.<br/><br/>Much of the third movie felt like soulless fighting. It took up the majority of the story (unsurprising considering the title), but it didn't have much feeling in it aside from the deaths, which was still rather minimal. Return of the King, in contrast, had a very long battle, but it had emotion in it. <br/><br/>Tauriel's character also does nothing for the plot; she only served to be the token female (aside from Galadriel, who actually did something) and a love interest for Kili. Legolas' impossible stunts were also grating and took me out of the story due to how unrealistic they were. <br/><br/>It still has the Middle-Earth spirit in it, but much of Battle of the Five Armies is emotionless padding that has bright areas. To me, it's not as bad as some people who rabidly hate it claim, but it doesn't hold a candle to LotR, either."

","Here is a summary of this film: Attack and destruction by fierce dragon visiting from Enchanted.<br/><br/>I want gold! Battle.<br/><br/>Little bit of dialogue. (None convincing.) Battle. (Hard to tell who was fighting and why.) Dialogue etc. Enter cross-dresser.<br/><br/>Battle etc.<br/><br/>Poorly developed characters were presented without context. Once they spoke their paltry and wooden dialogue, we quickly learned there would never be a context, at least not in this film.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were incomprehensible. Beings and things appeared out of nowhere then disappeared. Absurd antics during battle done with obvious CGI (that must have been on sale). The elf latching onto a giant flying bird had the visual credibility of 1939's Dorothy doll (with robotic moving legs) being carried away by the flying monkey.<br/><br/>An awful film. No heart. No soul. An affront to Tolkien."
"badajoz-1","2","10","20","24 December 2014"," Peter Jackson's CGI boreathons tumbled at last
","At last THE END of Peter Jackson's mind and bum numbing CGI so-called epic spectacles. They have become increasingly repetitive, dull, uninteresting and smugly self- satisfied at their own success. Scripts are shallow and full of plot holes, as they vainly struggle to catch the fine timbre of say 'Ben Hur' or 'El CID'. That the director and his writers fall short is due to elongation, greed and a belief in their own legendary status. It is called hubris. The plot is simple -dragon killed, orcs are on the rampage, and King Dwarf goes mad a la 'Sierra Madre.' Cue overlong battle between five armies for the treasure! Since when do Stephen Fry's miserable plebs constitute a fighting force? Yes, you guessed it - the Orcs almost win hands down until a drawn out fight sees their barbarian leader downed and a Dr Who arrives with the Eagles - Roman Legions - to sweep all before them (just like the ghost army in LOTR! Oh dear, this really is a fresh film! Various lines are tied up to lead onto the main book/film, except what happens to all the treasure? Terribly unsatisfactory, only illuminated by the odd bit of acting from messes Freeman and Armitage, who deserved better from this lazy, long drawn out, over hyped children's serial."

","From the first movie onwards, I am a big Hobbit fan.I have been waiting for this movie desperately and I was not disappointed. What a movie, that was!! There couldn't be any better end of this.

It was action full movie and very good except one part, where Legolas almost flew climbing the stairs, that became dramatic. Thranduil was very good and justified the role.

"piratejack007","5","13","28","12 December 2014"," complete waste of ""could have been possible"" epic movie.
","DISAPPOINTMENT One word is fits right for this movie. Fan boys of the series may not get happy after reading this but believe me there is literally nothing at all to watch in this movie. After promising SMAUG's destruction sequence there's nothing which may even catch your attention or keep you engaged. Many time you will find that there is so much nonsense filled with crap, I just couldn't control to laugh at many scenes. there is lot to curse like after every 2 minutes you see something nonsense. I don't know why peter Jackson wanted it in 48 FPS, it takes half of credit to spoil film. It just feels like watching a TV show and takes audience away from film. <br/><br/>Lets begin from start. After building up such a stupendous image of SMAUG it is killed by a single arrow , the same SMAUG who destroyed whole dwarf empire. I mean wtf ??? that arrow so old even might got corroded. Then somehow I made me believe "" oh okay SMAUG may got killed due to infection by corrosion"" .... bullshit. whatever one argue in favor of this , beast was not at all possible to be killed in one shot.<br/><br/>Another part is NECROMANCER.I was very hopeful that he will bring something good touch to movie like SAURON did. but within 2-3 minutes GALADRIEL beats him along with his slave un-dead kings and he flees away. If u r going to end it like this then why make such a hype.<br/><br/>Movie gives complete disregards to title "" Battle of five armies"". firstly u will not even notice that there are five armies. If you hoping that there will be great battle then believe me all trailers in combine contains almost entire battle in film. Peter Jackson concentrated least on battle of armies. battle gets started and after some time it seems that peter Jackson got distracted from battle and gets concentrated on personal rivalry like AZOG vs THORIN and so on. after moving out from short battle scene it seems directly forgotten that battle is going on and when we return back then we find that battle is over. I mean whatever hopes you have from movie, it will disappoint you 100% in each of it.<br/><br/>talking about characters ""very lame"". there is no single character to which u get attached. every one failed to impress. LEGOLAS try to do unnecessary stunt and try to be hero and fails miserably. my reaction was like ""hmm good, but seen this before dude try something different"". Guys we are not here to see action scenes , we have seen enough. Talking about dwarfs i don't know what they were doing. The great THORIN turns bad due to greed of gold and ARKINSTONE and decide to defend fort by help of 13 dwarfs against gigantic armies. He suddenly get help from dwarfs army and we don't know where they came from ?. If he had that much of assistance why he didn't seek it until now. Bilbo BAGINS was satisfactory. Rest of the characters not even needed to discuss.<br/><br/>Most irritating part was love triangle between KILI, TAURIAL and LEGOLAS. TAURIAL was there in movie only due to her love KILI. Love was quiet unusual and unnecessary. <br/><br/>talking about technical areas. script was very poor dialogues was so lame like they were written by a kid. cinematography,art direction, makeup.... just like previous, nothing new. About music, Howard Shore did not do job well it feels he was tired of giving music to this franchisee, background score never catch your attention. Direction is very lame , very poor it don't feels like peter Jackson,it looks like somebody forced him to make movie at gunpoint. <br/><br/>Verdict is Movie contains all that we can call unnecessary,unwanted and nonsense. It failed miserably in each area. I did not able to find single reason yet that why on should watch this sh*t. If you have seen all previous parts and have money to waste then watch it for formality.I give scores as<br/><br/>Story: 5 visuals: 6 dialogues and script: 4 music:6 Direction: 4 Acting:5"

"MoviesAreLife93","5","7","13","12 January 2015"," Pathetically disappointing
","Peter Jackson's final installment of The Hobbit trilogy is a weak, dull, and remorseless disappointment. The Battle of the Five Armies features a plot of minimal substance, wasted scenes, and poor development on every level. Aside from being the final installment of a fourteen-year production, this film has nothing to boast whatsoever. The directing, writing, cinematography, and visual effects are painfully lazy - still failing to capture the essence of adventure, morality, fellowship, adversity, and character development. Peter Jackson does Tolkien no justice here.<br/><br/>Since The Lord of the Rings trilogy collectively earned 17 Oscars, is highly acclaimed both critically and publicly, and is regarded as one of the most ambitions and successful film productions ever undertaken, it's a wonder that anyone watch this film and restrain themselves from asking what Peter Jackson was thinking. The Hobbit trilogy, while already somewhat lacking based on the first two installments, is now irrevocably inferior to the Middle Earth saga.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could have been a magnificent film production, but crumbled upon its own reckless, lazy, and greedy foundations."
"holloway-sarahjane","6","7","13","18 December 2014"," Peter Jackson's Ego
","I attended all three Hobbit movies, despite the knowledge that three long movies for a short book couldn't reflect Tolkien's vision. This was Peter Jackson's vision using The Hobbit as a jumping off point. Peter Jackson focused on what he thought mattered in terms of making visual entertainment. You can agree or not, it's not a religion even though many fans of the book find the movie too different from the original and are frustrated. Smaug was well done, I would have liked more of him and less of the battle. The battles were well done too but the Orcs in general fell dead with a punch in the nose. That being said lots of dead bodies were included in the battle field. I personally liked the ""Battle Hog"" ridden by the Dwarf General, probably not in the original story, but nice touch. I could have done without romance between the dwarf and the elf. I wondered if it was something entirely personal that Jackson was communicating, perhaps symbolic of his love for all things Tolkien and the end of his life work. All the actors really put their very best into this movie, and if the screen play hadn't conflicted so much with the book it would be perfect on many levels. Unlike the LOTR trilogy, I don't feel inclined to revisit the movies, but I would say there are memorable moments. One is Galadriel's saving of Gandalf, and her temporary pushing back of Saron. That scene was amazing."
"NateFromLincoln","3","9","18","5 January 2015"," A bombastic bore
","If I had to describe the book The Hobbit in one word, it would be ""charming."" Bilbo Baggins embarks on an epic adventure, but we are charmed all the way—because we feel as though we take the journey with Bilbo. Despite the grand scale of the world of Middle Earth, the story is immensely personal.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies, on the other hand, is anything but charming. The narrative revolves around armies combatting other armies—all mechanistically conveyed through large-scale digital action scenes. This is not a personal, relatable journey. It is a broad, bombastic, disjointed spectacle—one that fails to engage precisely because of its scope.<br/><br/>By contrast, another series of films adapted from books—the Harry Potter films—have been enormously successful in building a large world and telling a fantastic story while maintaining its focus on its title character, which Harry Potter producer David Heyman stated in interviews was his intention from the beginning. With The Battle of the Five Armies, it is clear just how underwhelming the results can be when the story is unfocused.<br/><br/>Perhaps future directors and producers of ambitious franchise films will take heed of the criticism of this movie and focus more on story and character than on special effects. One can only hope."
"jn1356-1","10","9","18","27 December 2014"," I owe Peter Jackson an apology
","My take on Peter Jackson is that he is an adolescent horror film maker, and that he thinks his audience is so stupid that they can't understand the good guys are in trouble unless he puts them in so deep they cannot get out without some kind of deus ex machina. That's why his ""King Kong"" is so bad. I have reconciled myself to his Lord of the Rings trilogy by thinking of it as PETER JACKSON's Lord of the Rings, and after all he put into it, he has the right to rewrite as he pleases.<br/><br/>The second installment of The Hobbit is painful, 'WAY too long, with many, many more contrived battle scenes than anybody needs, especially since the only battle in the book is with the spiders. The rest never happened, so to speak.<br/><br/>I did not go to the theater today expecting much. I left with a headache from crying.<br/><br/>I owe Peter Jackson an apology.<br/><br/>Yes, he changed things. Yes, his changes were unnecessary. But some of them are so good, I actually think I prefer his version to Tolkien's in places. I will not go into details, I will include no spoilers. Surely everyone knows he found a way to include Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and he created an elf-maid-warrior Tauriel (the luminous Evangeline Lilly). Furthermore, I believe everyone knows he contrived an unlikely romance between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner, who is almost as pretty as Ms. Lilly). Did you know he made the romance work cinematically? Watch for it. (They who have read the novel knows Kili does not make it out alive. Have a hanky ready) The additions, Gandalf's encounter with The Necromancer, and walk-ons by Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Saruman (Christopher Lee), and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) is no secret either. Tolkien never fleshes out the story, so if Peter Jackson elects to portray it, good on him! He did good.<br/><br/>Oh, and I don't read all the pre-release stuff. When I recognized the voice of Billy Connolly as Dain, I was delighted! He is a wonderful addition! My opinion: this is the best of the trilogy by far. I may prefer it to the any of the original trilogy!"

I actually enjoyed 1st and 2nd part of this trilogy and was looking forward to the finale of the Hobbit, but it was a total letdown for me.<br/><br/>This movie had very little in common with book and the liberties that screen writer and director took didn't add any substance, but only made the hole spectacle ULTRA-cheesy.

I mean this scene with him running on the falling stones it was painful to watch, why not dress him in blue-red tight suit with letter S on a chest and let him fly.<br/><br/>Honestly... if you look at this movie its cheesy scene one after another.

","I saw ""The Hobbit:The Battle of the Five Armies"", starring Martin Freeman-Fargo_tv, Hot Fuzz; Richard Armitage-Into the Storm, Captain America:The First Avenger; Evangeline Lilly-The Hurt Locker, Lost_tv, Luke Evans-Dracula Untold, Fast & Furious 6 and Ian McKellen-Magneto in the X-Men movies, Last Action Hero. <br/><br/>This is the third installment of the Hobbit series-or sixth, if you count the Lord of the Rings trilogy-that involves the legendary land called Middle-earth. It is directed by Peter Jackson, who directed all six movies. It is also the best of the Hobbit trilogy, in my opinion. This one starts right after the second one ends, where Smaug the dragon was attacking the town. After the situation is resolved, everyone heads for Smaug's fortress, where all the gold and treasures are just sitting there, waiting to be plundered. Luke-Bard leads the surviving townsfolk on the trek to the mountains but finds that Richard-Thorin and his fellow dwarfs have beat them to it and have barricaded themselves inside the fortress, and do not plan on giving it up. Martin-Bilbo is with Richard and the dwarfs and sees that Richard has been driven a little crazy with greed-he has even declared himself king of the dwarfs and has forgotten about almost everything else. Ian-Gandalf shows up to warn everybody of an invasion of Orcs, the big, ugly white creatures that like to ride big, scary looking wolf-like creatures. Evangeline- Tauriel and her fellow elves also arrive in time for the big, glorious battle, which lasts about 45 minutes. The battle is pretty brutal, with elves, dwarfs, Orcs and even regular old humans, all slugging it out over the great treasures that Smaug had collected. Even though I remember seeing lots of heads-and other body parts-being cut off during all the carnage, I don't remember seeing much blood-so it was not too gory for the younger viewers. It does end on a satisfying note. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense violence and frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","I've been dreading this event for years, the last of the war of the ring sextet, after this no more, please don't let it be a failure. Then I read the IMDb reviews from the early releases and even though we had tickets for IMAX 3D I didn't want to go and be disappointed. I AM SO GLAD I IGNORED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. Now if you are a Tolkienophile or a hobbit nerd then you will find fault, there are characters in the movie not in the book, Tauriel and Legolas (poetic license?)and yes there is the Kili romance again not in the book. There are cheesy moments that I didn't agree with, Legolas running up the tumbling rocks, and Alfrid OTT but not enough to dent the movie or to knock off a rating star, the film is brilliant and deserves a ten. The acting was so natural. Martin Freeman's Bilbo stole the show, but Thorin's phases from noble to gold diseased back to noble was gut wrenching and so believable. Some have critiqued the CGI, where? it was incredible, Smaug! Azog, Bolg and the actions scenes amazing. Some critique the vulnerability of trolls? These are not meant to have superpowers they are animals that can be dispatched with a rock to the head and arrows. One big criticism is the length of the battle. To be honest Helm's deep and Pellenor field seemed longer. All you ring nuts do yourselves a favour, ignore the negative reviews, try to find an IMAX and/or see it in 3D, I assure you if like me you loved LOTR and the Hobbit movies you will NOT be disappointed. I cannot wait for the extended blue ray to come out. Thank you Peter Jackson for this incredible run of films."
"jbertilsson-1","10","10","21","14 December 2014"," Perfect
","I doubt there are many people out there that have read Tolkien's books more then I have. The Hobbit is perhaps the book that I appreciated the most, through too it's more fairy tale-like style. I have have always considered the movies and the books to be completely separated work of arts, the movies were made inspired by the books and not as a way to adapt the complete story into visual form. Every time I either watch the LOTR or The Hobbit I travel back into this fantastic world of fantasy which I use to visit as a teenager. In my opinion The Hobbit and LOTR have no real competitor in genre of fantasy movies, just like the books always will stand alone at the very top, this I say after over 2000 rated movies and over 500 fantasy books in my bookshelf. Peter Jackson have done it again, a perfect fantasy movie which allow the audience to feel like a part of Middle-earth, an escape from reality that lasts about 2h 30m, completely satisfying, and thats what both fantasy books and movie is all about.<br/><br/>Now I wish that they decide to make movies out of Nick Perumov's continuation trilogy about Middle-earth. The books are not as good the original made by Tolkien but they would inspire to three new and even darker visits to the land of Tolkien. For all Tokien fans who haven't read the book I highly recommend to do, they are called The Ring of Darkness (Mörkrets ring in Swedish)"
"apstylianou","9","6","11","18 May 2015"," A flawed but fitting final chapter to the Middle-earth legend
","Let me just start off by saying that I am a big fan of The Hobbit and of The Lord of the Rings and they are some of my favourite movies of all time. When I saw the first teaser trailer for this film and the Edge of Night used as nostalgia, I nearly teared up with excitement. I remember the thrill of suddenly really looking forward to this final chapter and I didn't know what to expect, but I got what I was expecting: a great day out with my friends, Dad and sister to what was the greatest cinema experience for me. The movie had everything I wanted, the action, the acting, the tension, the drama, the thrilling sense of an apocalypse and the emotion was there too, and for that I give it full marks for that all combined.<br/><br/>However, I have to take down one star for the major problems that I have with this movie that rob it of its masterpiece status. Like Legolas defying gravity and jumping stones like its suddenly a flipping video game in what was one of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen, and lets not forget the dull, badly-done, annoying, purposeless characters of both Tauriel and that love story that didn't have any purpose whatsoever in staying true to the classic source material, the annoying purposeless horrendous character of Alfrid Lickspittle who Peter Jackson thought was too much to kill off finally and was like ""hey I've got a great idea, lets just put in a character named Alfrid and he will always sneak into the movie and make the entire film fade out of its plot, he'll just be there to add in pointless unfunny humour."" I hate to be so negative about this movie, but I cannot help but say that all these things are just too unforgivable and if Peter Jackson could've cut all of those things out of the movie, then it would've been a better film. Also, what exactly was Legolas' purpose in the first place? Is he just there to kill orcs and to make sure that this is the same universe as The Lord of the Rings trilogy? I don't mind him being in there, but he just doesn't really have a lot of purpose to the story and I don't know why they thought that that laughable gravity defying stunt he pulled off was really necessary.<br/><br/>I'm not to bothered about some other loose ends not being tied up, because they will explain that in the Extended Edition, but what really matters is what they put in the cinemas. Like, will we see Dáin become king?Will we see the funeral of Thorin, Fíli and Kíli? Or the reinforcements for the dwarf army coming on those rams and goats that Thorin, Dwalin,Fíli and Kíli use to ride the Ravenhill to kill Azog? Or Bard becoming the king of New Dale and Dáin giving to him what was promised of the treasure to rebuild? Or them placing the arkenstone and Thorin's sword, Orcist within his crypt? Or whether or not Thranduil is going to get those gems of pure starlight back? Or the long awaited death of Alfrid? There are also some scenes that will make you very questionable about the film. Like how after four movies of this never happening did Legolas suddenly run out of arrows? Bard using his own son, Bain, as an arrow, how Dáin and Thorin suddenly decide to hug and talk in the middle of a raging battle, and there's an overuse of a lazy action movie cliché that is last minute rescues. I mean like there's always someone in danger and then, suddenly someone else comes out of nowhere to save them at the last minute. Its very repetitive and you thought Michael Bay had a obsessive use of explosions in his films. It just gets on my nerves a little.<br/><br/>So all of these things I have mentioned is what ruins the reputation of the film and they just need to be removed from the film completely. Still, I love this film, I've seen it four times at the cinema and I now have it on DVD and I couldn't be more happier now that I have one of my favourite franchise finales on DVD (and also with the fact that I can now skip through the love story, Legolas jumping stones and Alfrid).<br/><br/>I know that the Dol Guldur scenes weren't in the book, but I don't really mind it being put in the film because it explains what Gandalf left the company for in the book (which wasn't entirely explained) and because it also ties the franchise up with TLOTR trilogy perfectly and it was awesome to see Sauron and Galadriel go face to face with each other. That was one of the best scenes in the film. I also liked the addition of Sir Christopher Lee's Saruman, seeing as the actor who played him recently passed away and it was good to see him retake his role of one his greatest villains ever.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage dominate every scene of the film in their perfectly acted Oscar worthy performances as Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield. Oh, and The Last Goodbye song at the end is a perfect way to end it. The song still moves me today.<br/><br/>Even though this film is flawed, everything else was what we all wanted, the acting, the action, the amazing visuals and the conclusion was all exactly all I could've asked for in this film and its a triumphant send-off to Middle-earth."
"Dave-No8","2","6","11","10 May 2015"," What a shambles
","There are many things wrong with The Battle of the Five Armies, but most of them come down to the screenplay. Right from the first scene and the Master of Laketown (""Faster now, I'm trying to evacuate myself here!""), the dialogue is clunkier than anything I've seen in a big-budget movie in years.<br/><br/>There's an occasional moment (Thorin and Bard parlaying at the gate of the Lonely Mountain) when something of the source material shines through, but there's precious little of Tolkien remaining in this.<br/><br/>The problem is not that a relatively small children's book has been spun out to three long movies. Jackson and Co. have left out a lot of the original story to make way for their many additions; this was most obvious in The Desolation of Smaug, but also applies here. In the book, Beorn's arrival was a pivotal moment in the battle, but he is barely glimpsed in the film, there is no funeral for Thorin (my edition of The Hobbit has a magnificent illustration of this by Alan Lee and it would have been wonderful to see it brought to life), and no final reckoning over what happened to the treasure.<br/><br/>The sub-plot involving the efforts to drive Sauron from Dol Guldur almost works – nice to see Christopher Lee still kicking ass at 92 – but it's not explained why the orc army in the previous film had entirely departed when there were still such powerful adversaries (Gandalf and friends) to be defeated. Much more could have been done with this story, which Tolkien had only sketched lightly. But the real problems are with the main plot. First there's Bard's ludicrous escape from his prison, then his dispatching of Smaug; this should have been a highlight, but was too silly for words.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back on the mountain, Thorin is going mad. The refugees from Laketown descend on Dale, and an army of elves turns up. Much pre-battle jockeying for position ensues. An army of dwarfs arrives, led by Billy Connolly (playing himself) on a pig. Then almost immediately an army of orcs appears over the hill as well. Everyone starts fighting. Some giant worms who seem to have arrived from Planet Arrakis emerge from the ground, chew on some boulders, and are then never seen again. Things are looking really bad, but then Thorin has a psychotic (or possibly psychedelic) episode and suddenly is not crazy any more. He leads his band of 13 dwarfs out of the mountain, and this makes all the difference to the progress of the battle. He then decides to scale a distant peak, where the orc leader, Azog, is directing the battle with flag signals – just the sort of thing orcs would do – and kill said leader. He and some of the dwarfs climb on some big-horned mountain goats (where did they come from?) and charge up the hill.<br/><br/>About this point, Legolas and Tauriel turn up and announce that another army of orcs is heading this way. They'll be arriving from the north, which means that they'll first encounter the peak with the orc command post! Legolas and Tauriel immediately charge up the peak to assist Thorin and Kili, Tauriel's love interest, who's up there too. Oddly, the orc army never arrives; perhaps the worms ate them.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of the action takes place on the peak, which has lots of picturesque ruins with bridges and staircases, plus a frozen lake. Azog kills Kili's brother Fili, then tries to kill Kili, who is rescued by Tauriel, who is then almost killed by Azog, but is rescued by Kili, who this time really does get killed. Or something like that; there are so many fights going on it's hard to keep track.<br/><br/>Legolas is in the fighting as well. At one point he runs up a rock staircase which is in the process of collapsing beneath him. Jackson seems to think that the more outrageous the CG stunts, the more exciting it is for the audience, but many of the sequences are so cartoonish it is obvious they're fake, and there is no danger.<br/><br/>Finally there's the climactic battle on the ice lake between Thorin and Azog. The orc sinks, Leonardo de Caprio-like, through the smashed up lake surface and Thorin watches as a gentle current carries him beneath a solid sheet of ice, apparently dead. But suddenly (who could have foreseen this?) Azog opens his eyes and bursts back through the ice. He stabs Thorin in the chest, but then Thorin stabs Azog, and this time the big orc really is dead. Thorin gets up and wanders around for a bit and finds Bilbo (you remember Bilbo – he's the hobbit – this movie trilogy is called The Hobbit). Thorin apologises to Bilbo for being so mean, before expiring. His death should have been the emotional climax of the film, but ends up as just one more silly episode in a movie full of silly episodes.<br/><br/>We're also supposed to be torn up by the tragic death of the dwarf Kili, and the heartbreak of Tauriel, the elf who loved him, but this relationship is just awkward. In Tolkien's universe, elves and dwarfs are the children of different gods, and fundamentally incompatible.<br/><br/>What else? There's a character called Alfrid, who I think is supposed to be amusing, but is merely irritating. Actually, most of the ""humour"" is forced. The CG is also really disappointing; the orcs are far less scary than the prosthetic-clad actors of the earlier trilogy. <br/><br/>Did I like anything? Well, there was a nice quiet moment near the end with Bilbo and Gandalf sitting down to catch their breath. And some of the landscapes and interiors looked good. But given the remarkable artistic success of the original Lord of the Rings movies, the Hobbit trilogy has been a huge and bitter disappointment."

","I saw this in the movie theatre last January (15th to be exact - I still have my movie ticket) and wasn't really impressed at first. I found it too moody and somber. My opinion changed, however, after buying the DVD a couple of days ago. Peter Jackson once again delivers in the unforgettable battle scenes. It's pleasing how the elves & men are allies and that the dwarfs eventually join them. If that's not a good point of ""multiculturalism"", I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I remember my grade 4 teacher reading our class the book in 1978. I had a big imagination of how it would turn out on the big movie screen and Jackson delivers. Even more so than I imagined.<br/><br/>Gandalf, as always, is the focus of reason and common sense. He was always looked upon as a good source of knowledge in the LOTR trilogy but here, he's treated as a rambling and dirty old man who no one believes. He was, of course, eventually proved right.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Especially the final battle scene. It just disturbed me though seeing the women of Laketown involved in it. If that's a good example of 'women's lib' then it didn't work for me. The battle was fierce and very violent and you can't help, but feel hope that the good side eventually wins. The women shouldn't have been involved at all, but from what I believe, ""protected"".<br/><br/>Martin Freeman, of course, is the best casting of Bilbo ever. His nervous and stuttering performance of the Bilbo from the Tolkien book can't be beat. He has it down pat.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. The downfall of Smaug was especially powerful."
"p-jonsson","9","6","11","30 April 2015"," Great fantasy adventure
","The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needles to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien's but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.<br/><br/>Still, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.<br/><br/>The story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.<br/><br/>I have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid though. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping to the end that he would meet a gruesome end.<br/><br/>On the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a ""Tolkienesque"" atmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers."
"Fessig47","1","6","11","14 April 2015"," Never Again
","I guess I'm just a stickler for faithful adherence to whatever book a movie happens (or claims) to be based upon. Having read The Hobbit numerous times since the late sixties, almost getting to know it by heart, one gets a pretty good idea of what Tolkien envisioned/intended/meant when he originated this tale. It is important (crucial even) to note and remember that in Tolkien's Hobbit, 'The Battle of The Five Armies' (the actual battle) consumes all of about 4 to 5 pages, depending on the size of a particular book. Never mind the totally unnecessary process of ballooning one perfectly simple book into three full-size feature-length movies. The trick, it seems, is to take any parts the book did not provide (in the writers' and director's view) any great amount detail and insert your own story- line/narrative/screen-play. Call it 'airy parts' in the original story. Another kind of 'air' are the quiet stretches, the contemplative sections, visits with friendly hosts, recovery from battle, etc. that Tolkien made great use of to convey the 'feeling' of these fascinating people and life in Middle Earth. Peter Jackson decides to rip all of such moments out and insert more action-for-action's- sake all while gaining width and girth until he has a 3-flick epic. He also seems compelled to drag in more 'hooks' into LOTR that either aren't there all, or were pieces left out of his Rings trilogy. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson seems to think he IS J.R.R. Tolkien, or at worst just a lackey for the marketing people at Warner Bros.<br/><br/>I've seen it and don't care to ever see it again."

","I have mixed feelings about the final installment of the three part film adaptation of the Hobbit novel. I didn't think, it was a wise decision, to make the Hobbit novel into three separate films. 2012's The Hobbit: Unexpected Journey was a slow start, 2013's the Desolation of Smaug was a long drawn movie with lackluster cliffhanger, and this movie, Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was a bit anti-climax. Without spoiling too much, it's still probably the best film of the Hobbit film adaptation. Directed by Peter Jackson, the movie tells the story of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the Company of Dwarfs being forced to engage in a battle against an array of enemies trying to take away their gold. Now the Dwarfs must try keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the wrong hands, while also not losing themselves to selfish greed. Indeed, greed plays a big part of the film and it's kinda the film, downfall. Seeing a lot of armies fight over money, isn't the same as seeing lot of armies fighting for the fate of Middle Earth in 2003's Lord of the Ring: Return of the King. It's somewhat a shallow story about gold. The movie doesn't felt like there is much in stake. I really can't into the long repetitive battle scenes, because there is too little story to support it. It felt so endless and disconnect. It didn't even felt grand in scale, because the director put himself into a dilemma. He didn't want to make the battle seem as good as Lord of the Ring: Return of the King or 2002's Two Towers, because it would make his Lord of the Ring films look weaker to the Hobbit films. While, he did a lot of hard work, it just seems like he really didn't as much of a passion for these films as his Lord of the Ring films. He did these Hobbits films in sense of duty, since director Guillermo Del Toro drop out during pre-production. Somewhere in production; he lost his magic. It became more a call back to old Lord of the Rings films than its own movie. It's a huge problem that the LOTR films were made first, because anything not in that epic scale would look mediocre, compared to it. In many ways, this film looks that way. It's seem very cliché. While, he did add a few new things that kinda help the adaptation. A lots of it was just recycle sub-plots. Example are like King Thorin (Richard Armitage) going crazy AKA 'dragon sickness', over the gold. It's very similar to Gollum (Andy Serkis) downfall in the Lord of the Rings films. Then, you got the unneeded love affair between dwarf, Kíli (Aidan Turner) and elevan, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). It was very similar to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Arwen (Liv Tyler), love story arch. The White Council's role in saving Gandalf at Dol Guldur is also a Jackson invention. Wasn't needed, but it's a great foreshadowing to the Lord of the Rings films. One pointless scene was that of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) & Tauriel visiting Gundabad. It wasn't needed. I kinda wish the 144-minute running time pacing structure of the film was little more solid. The whole opening with Smaug (Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) should had been in the finale of the last movie. It felt odd to have it, here. Second, the battle timeframe. It's seem that it last for hours. How are these people able to do long speeches about fighting during the battles? You would think, all the people would be dead, already. It's also a bit odd, that the hundreds of Dwarfs, human and Elves were losing the battle, before 12 dwarfs came to the rescue. Are they really that weak? Third, the movie doesn't really show anything or anybody after the Battle of the Five Armies like the novel. Who control the Lonely Mountain? Who is the King of the Dwarfs, now? It's never resolved. Fourth- The Hobbit timeframe doesn't match well with Lord of the Rings. It's so confusing. Fifth- for a movie call the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins barely in this film. Most of the time, he just staring into space. He's get very lost in the many sub-plots. There are too many stories with not so memorable characters. The acting for the most part was pretty good, despite that. The special effects is a hit and miss. It gets a little CGI-heavy, with the film at times looking less like live-action and more like animation. The locations are beautiful, but it's lacking compare to the other films. Howard Shore's music is so-so. Not much, noting. Overall: I enjoy the film to a certain extent. I'm went there and back again. As the last Hobbit movie of the series. It kinda works. I enjoyed the film, and you might, too."
"Uriah43","7","6","11","1 January 2015"," A Notch Above Its Predecessor
","This movie picks up at the exact same spot that its predecessor (""The Hobbit-The Desolation of Smaug"") left off with the dragon known as Smaug in the process of destroying Laketown. Likewise as a prequel to ""The Lord of the Rings-The Fellowship of the Ring"" it ends at the same spot where the later film begins. In other words this movie fits right in and ties ""The Hobbit"" trilogy in with the three ""Lord of the Rings"" films quite nicely. That said, I would strongly recommend that a person new to these movies begin with ""The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey"" and then continue on through ""The Hobbit"" series before beginning on ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies if at all possible to gain a better understanding and appreciation for this particular film. Of course if a person has read all of the books in the ""Tolkien series"" then perhaps that might not be necessary. However that's just my opinion and I suppose a person can perhaps still enjoy this movie without any previous knowledge. In any case, I found this movie to be a notch above its predecessor and I believe that fans of this genre will certainly like this movie as much as they did all of the others. Accordingly, I rate this film as above average."

","This movie was the perfect conclusion to the Middle Earth saga. It was jam-packed with edge-of-your-seat action, characters worth investing your emotions in, and an engaging story. Peter Jackson also tied the story back nicely to the Lord of the Rings movies, which I really appreciated. Unless you're a relentless cynic who tries to pick apart the movie at every teeny difference from the book, then you'll love this movie. I will always have a special place in my heart for the original three Lord of the Rings movies, but this one lived up to their standard. J.R.R.

There wasn't a need for this movie and I don't feel the director put his heart this time as he usually did. Also, they went to faraway with Legolas' battle scenes; everybody in the cinema started laughing because of the CGI abuse.

When I left the cinema I was sad as I will never see a Middle-Earth film again (Unless they do actually make The Silmarillion). The film was exciting and I cannot understand the negative reviews.

I felt like watching a cheap low budget soap opera. There is nothing to be learned out of the story and nothing seems to make sense. It is as if all the characters had an unsuccessful brain surgery (or 80% of the brain was cut).<br/><br/>Waste of time, think again before paying a ticket to the cinema.

","So, if you are rushing to Cinema to watch it, take a deep breath and take your time, because mostly your dreams about the movie is more interesting than the movie itself.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie is acceptable, not epic, not great, not amazing, If you compare it to 'The Lord of the rings' trilogy, it's similar to the first part 'The fellowship of the ring' (An introduction part not a final of a trilogy), not as 'The two towers' or the 'Return of the king', Where you get to enjoy a well made epic battles, tying loose ends and make you hope to loose your memory so you can enjoy watching them again for the first time.<br/><br/>The chain of events was more like filling the gaps to connect the past to the future in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, yet it leaves us with loose ends related to the hobbit trilogy.<br/><br/>Good action scenes, but not epic or memorable, a quick scene here and a quick scene there, then it moves you harshly back to the first action scene (Or takes you to a different action scene in the battle) and son on.<br/><br/>A lot of wasted scenes on secondary characters where it should have been used to tie the loose ends for main characters and events, The humor scenes mostly not in the right time and not that laughable.<br/><br/>As for the title 'The battle of the five armies', it should be changed or removed: First, there were no 5 armies, there were 4 armies (If you considered them as an armies in the first place).<br/><br/>Second, when you use the word ""Army"" you expect something horrific like in ""The return of the king"", but here they were more like in ""Gangs of New York"".<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the ride to the Cinema, the sweet salty popcorn, sound effects is good (Though I watched it in IMAX 3D, so I was expecting a breath taking sound effects).<br/><br/>You can read more reviews here - But they mostly have spoilers - that explain what I said above in details."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","11","24","12 December 2014"," A satisfying conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy.
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues with the story of Bilbo Baggins(Martin Freeman). After the events of the previous film, the dragon Smaug(Benedict Cumberbatch) wreaks havoc on Lake Town. Thorin Oakenshield(Richard Armitage) and the rest of the dwarfs reclaim Erebor. There is a lot of gold in Erebor. The people of Lake Town, led by Bard(Luke Evans), demand to get their share of gold as promised to them by Thorin & due to the damage done to Lake Town. The elves led by Thranduil(Lee Pace), also claim some treasure that belongs to them. Now, it is up to Thorin, to either comply with their requests or to wage a war against the humans, the elves & the Orcs led by Azog(Manu Bennett). <br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a mind blowing movie! The opening sequence involving Smaug destroying Lake Town is tense & thrilling & looks even better in 3D. The battle sequences towards the end of the film have been beautifully choreographed & the 3D has also been put to good use during this major war. The locales are beautiful. New Zealand has been portrayed magnificently in the Middle Earth movies. However, I liked The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug(2013) better. I consider that film to be the best of the trilogy. Though The Battle of the Five Armies is a close second, it got slightly dull in the middle. I also didn't like the fact that Martin Freeman's role was substantially reduced in this movie, compared to the previous two movies. Martin Freeman is outstanding as Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Gandalf. Richard Armitage is spectacular as Thorin Oakenshield. Benedict Cumberbatch is terrifying as Smaug/Necromancer. Luke Evans is great as Bard. Evangeline Lilly is amazing as Tauriel. Lee Pace is mind blowing as Thranduil. Orlando Bloom is awesome as Legolas. Aidan Turner & Dean O'Gorman are good as Kili & Fili respectively. Cate Blanchett is impressive as Galadriel. Manu Bennett is menacing as Azog. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a must watch for all The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit fans."
"lisee_lulu","10","9","19","30 December 2014"," Probably the best movie out of the three!
","Firstly let me say this. This movie was AWESOME. Next I'll say this: I've seen a lot of negative reviews and I was shaking my head the entire time. What is it with people? Why is this movie so bad? Yes I have read the book and I loved it. I thought the three movies did well to cover the important bits. Of course, like all movies made from books, certain liberties were taken but to me, the movie wasn't ruined. I will admit the romance between Filly and Tauriel wasn't necessary but it also didn't detract from the movie. It made Filly's death that much more traumatic. There were many things I loved about the movie but what stood out to me most were: 1. I loved was the opening with Smaug attacking Lake Town. Amazing intro, great hook and so graphic. 2. I loved seeing how close Bilbo and Thorin were, even when Thorin was sick. What struck a cord with me is even though Thorin spoke harshly of Bilbo when he confessed about the stone, Bilbo still stayed a loyal friend. Just before Thorin died, I loved that scene they shared. I was bawling my eyes out by that point. It was so well acted and so damn touching. Absolutely amazing. 3. The dwarfs in general were as amazing as the other movies. Overall the movie was fantastic. I love all three Hobbit movies but in my opinion, this was certainly the best. The battle of five armies was well executed and kept you on the edge of your seat. I'm sad the movies have ended but it's nice to have all of Tolkein's middle earth stories on the big screen. As soon as this is out on DVD, I am having a Hobbit / LOTR marathon."

"danielbelcher97","3","9","19","17 December 2014"," The worst of a long drawn out trilogy!!
","This movie is one of the reasons I hate the modern blockbuster. Thin storyline, Little character development, Unrealistic CGI and the ever increasingly common splitting of a minimal story line into more than 1 movie to maximize profits. The Hobbit Battle of the 5 armies ticks all these boxes to become one of the worst blockbusters of all time. <br/><br/>And the audience love it. Storyline isn't important if you've got CGI battles that look like the cut scene from a video game. The whole film was CGI. It seemed like they just used the actors faces on a CGI hobbit body on a CGI horse in a CGI landscape with one shot of a hill in New Zealand. <br/><br/>While I was literally asleep through a fair bit of the movie my friend loved it! And if we asked him about say..<br/><br/>""the 10 different characters we were barely introduced to but were forced to see a 10 minute battle scene of.. Or the ridiculous plot holes and unanswered questions such as why did giant worms appear and then disappear with no explanation at all? Why didn't we see what happened to the gold? And what happened to Bilbo Baggins furniture at the end?"" <br/><br/>he would respond with ""But those graphics were amazing!"". This just shows why all Hollywood blockbusters are investing in CGI rather than a decent plot. This would explain films like The Avengers, Avatar and Guardians of the galaxy. These films are an example of why I've begun to hate blockbusters. If you could only view this film in 360p on your old box TV this would get much much poorer ratings. Blockbusters like the original star-wars trilogy were first watched in those specs and the plot and character development drove those movies. These are just excuses to have long winded battle scenes"
"abouhelier-r","10","9","19","13 December 2014"," The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
","Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth. <br/><br/>After fifteen years, five films and countless hours of on screen magic depending on whether you were hardcore enough to sit through the extended editions and features of each films; Peter Jackson brings this journey to a close and to what now ranks as one of the most monumental work ever completed by a single filmmaker. It's also arguably his biggest challenge. Without wasting time on any kind of flashback or prologue, the film plunges right in where The Desolation of Smaug left off; It's like beginning The Empire Strike Back with Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star. Here opening with Smaug swooping down in a blaze of vengeance, while the panicked Lake Town locals disperse. It's an exciting sequence animated by a real sense of danger and by the nightmare figure of Smaug himself: one of the movie's most special effect, again voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. Plus, we are launched into nearly an hour or arguing and reflecting as various armies get ready for war. This is an effective crescendo to battle and when the things do finally kick off, the fight worth the wait. The battle is endlessly inventive. From all corner of the land, and the frame, they come: dwarfs, elves, men, assorted forest creatures and orcs; all displaying numerous ingenious tactics to sustain pretty much every verse. In fact, Peter Jackson is able to give an intimacy to even the biggest, noisiest battle scenes. This final instalment of The Hobbit trilogy ties very well onto the last two films but also with the beginning of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It does feel like The Return of the King at times, when bodies are just flying everywhere and heads rolling all over the place. It is long and epic. The Battle of the Five Armies is the strongest, boldest film in this trilogy and provides just the send off that this series deserves. Peter Jackson knows when to punctuate the carnage with a gag or a tender moment as it's not focusing on the action and the battle itself. This film is rewarding all the characters built up over two and a bit movies, all f them flawed. With Martin Freeman ever-excellent Bilbo more of a player this time. Indeed some conversation between Bilbo and Thorin create the most interesting moment of the movie, as Bilbo has the Arkenstone and Thorin really wants it. It's starting to drive him mad, almost like Gollum towards the ring. This film feels psychologically weightier than the previous one, largely a credit to Richard Armitage who plays Thorin with the paranoid despotic rage of a Shakespearean King. Yet he never allows him to become a monster. Gandalf: Sir Ian McKellen, of course everybody knows he is awesome and knocks out the part. The Stage is set for other characters to stand out, such as Luke Evans, as Bard, a genuine leader and maybe the most human character ever in Middle-Earth; while Kili (starring Aidan Turner) and Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) romance is undeniably touching. At the end all of the key players are where they need to be. Wrapping things up with a suitably return to the Shire that effectively brings the saga full circle. It's hard not to marvel at Peter Jackson's facility with these characters and this world, which he seems to know as well as John Ford knew his Monument Valley. It's easier to see now that it stops the entire Hobbit project as a labour of love on Jackson's part, rather than a descent into the box-office opportunism. This film is a fitting cap to an extended series that, if nothing else, has transformed Tolkien's place in the wider culture. His books were once strictly for teen nerds (we've all been there), while The Battle of the Five Armies is just as enjoyable as each of the five movies that came before it. I'm part of these nerds and I've always been a huge fan of Tolkien's work. Much of the movie is not like the book at all but I was aware of if that going in: there are a tone of added characters. Purists have to deal with it I guess! The most important point is that Peter Jackson captured perfectly the tone of the source material he has adapted. If a filmmaker is able to capture the feels and tone of the source material then he has succeeded and Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth is as good as we'll ever see.<br/><br/>Find the end HERE http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/"

"IndustriousAngel","7","10","22","10 December 2014"," Entertaining, but a bit breathless
","While a bit more focused than parts 1 and 2 , the third Hobbit film still shows some difficulty in hitting a consistent tone and rhythm. Tragedy is mixed with laugh-out-loud visual gags, large-scale battles with duels ... many script decisions did not enhance the story as known from the books (why did they remove the dwarfs from the battle to kill them?). And the rhythm - I hope for the extended cut; many scenes felt rushed (Sauron's demise? The end of the battle? The journey home?) or too jumpy (where now exactly did those wargoats come from?)<br/><br/>From the Middle-earth experience POV, this is the most boring of PJs 6 Tolkien films, nearly no new region to explore here except a short (and quite unnecessary) trip to Mt. Gundabad. As my lady-friend mentioned when we stumbled out of the theater: There was little of the middle-earth magic in BotFA. On the other hand, those locations on screen are well-defined, we get a good grasp of the geography, and the sets are beautiful.<br/><br/>The plus points:<br/><br/><ul><li>The battle scenes had good choreography, even if everything was a bit over-the-top.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sets and overall artistic and character design</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The actors. Especially Freeman's Bilbo is a joy to behold, from the first moments in the Shire to the desolate ending.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, my overall conclusion for the whole three parts: While I'm glad those movies were realised, and there are many memorable and nice scenes, overall I had hoped for something better. Don't get me wrong - ""The Hobbit"" (the book) is not ""The Lord of the Rings"", so we couldn't expect something on the same level - but there were many missed opportunities. Starting with the decision to shoot in 3D, which led to a different look and the necessity to use CGI in many instances, and the decision to make it more ""grown-up"" than the book but keeping (or even introducing) the childish elements. And you can't simply replace epicness with amusement park rides. I don't think there's a better ""Lord of the Rings"" waiting in the foreseeable future, but I definitely can see a better ""Hobbit""."

The Lord of the rings and the hobbit hits home for its symbolism of real internal human struggles. <br/><br/>In this one, the dwarf king swaying from his core principles and 'losing himself' in greed and mental illness after finding crazy amounts of gold and wealth. Him eventually realizing that he's become lost, and breaking out of his illness was an inspiring moment in the film.<br/><br/>Also bilbo the hobbit whose humility is a light to others who are caught up in the insanity and power struggles of the world."

","I can't believe that I just wrote that this movie is boring but sadly it is the truth. Not a single unexpected thing happens in this installment of a beloved book. Heroes die heroically, villains die like vermin. Or like Germans in Brad Pitt's Fury"". The only exciting scene worth watching is a fight between Sauron and Galadriel, Elrond ans Saruman. Everything that comes after is boring to the extreme. The biggest problem with all this battles of five armies is the lack of a true antagonist. I mean, we all know that the Orcs die like flies, so they are unable to create a true threat for our heroes. The dialogues are shallow an to be honest everything looks like a watered-down version of LOTR. Unfortunately this is a movie not worth a second viewing."
"kerryhill123","9","7","14","4 February 2015"," emotional, breathtaking but still not perfect
","The only thing that detracted me from giving this movie a ten is exactly why I decided to write a review on it. <br/><br/>This film, so far, has been the most negatively received film in the Middle Earth saga, for lack of a better term, and some how I can see why. Lord Of The Rings fans are incredibly dedicated and I think expect more than they will realistically get. These films, to me, are as close to perfection you will ever get. <br/><br/>However, I do take issue with a few things in this movie, one being how incredibly short it is, in comparison to its predecessors. The film seems to lack depth and detail and it left me feeling unfulfilled. This is primarily because I have read the book and know that several scenes have been left out. Of course I am aware that the extended edition will be released at some point and this does excite me because the scenes missed are some of the more crucial details in the book by J.R.R Tolkien. Another issue I have is the acting from certain characters, primarily the dwarfs and Bilbo. The scene in which Thorin Oakenshield is being pushed down with a blade by the Pale Orc was incredibly unconvincing, since Thorin's facial expression seemed somewhat relaxed considering he was moments away from death. I think Richard Armitage is an exceptional actor and Jackson is an exceptional director, which leads me to believe that Jackson wanted Thorin to look this way? The final scene between Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs of Erebor was incredibly cold, considering Bilbo had been on the road with these guys for almost two years, I felt it lacked all emotion. And of course, the return journey was somewhat missed entirely from the film. My hope is that more will be added in the extended edition. <br/><br/>The film didn't lack emotion entirely, the final scene between Thorin and Bilbo was absolutely heartbreaking and I found myself crying A LOT! I also especially enjoyed the scene between Thorin and Bilbo when Bilbo tells him about the acorn from Beorn's garden, in which the acting was sensational. It was incredibly emotional mainly because of Thorin's dragon sickness and the way that Bilbo is the only person he can still feel emotional attachment to. <br/><br/>Again the CGI in this movie was nothing short of stunning and as near to perfect as you will get, but I do think the scene between Legolas and the Orc was rather ridiculous. I realise this is a fantasy movie with dragons and elves, but Middle Earth is meant to be an ancient time period on OUR Earth today, meaning surely the laws of physics still apply? Right? <br/><br/>However, this was just me being picky, all in all, I found the movie to be brilliant, and to top it off, we had the fantastic Billy Boyd performing 'The Last Goodbye' for the credits, which again reduced me to tears. The only reason I couldn't give this movie a 10 was purely due to the fact it wasn't 100% perfect."
"tags_skeewee","3","7","14","23 December 2014"," Well, not sure what else to expect
","I was going to wait until this movie came to redbox but got the urge to go see it in 3d. Oh how I wish I would have saved my $14. I'm not saying anything new. This movie was just 'ok'. It has absolutely no heart. There is no comparison to the LOTR movies. The hobbit movies are a poor, watered down version. What happened to Peter Jackson? It is obvious this was just about money. The crappy cgi characters did not help the movie. Video games have better graphics. The scenes were boring. Due to no character development, you do not give one iota who dies. You can't even remember their names. The ending was terrible. They didn't tie up any lose ends. Instead of wasting LOTS of time on Bilbo going back to the shire, they could have addressed many plot holes. Gandalf looked tired and bored. There were no surprises nor was any suspense. They most definitely overdid the superhuman Legolas defying gravity scenes. ..it was totally unrealistic. The fight scenes were boring...the same looking muscled up monsters, who could be felled with a rock thrown by a hobbit was just laughable. I agree with others, the 'love' triangle was not necessary and was rather boring and made no since...they were deep in love after seeing each a few times...really?! The pacing in the movie was terrible. There was no sense of passing of time. It's like the armies were just around the corner. Too many of the scenes had me thinking,'I've seen this before'. Too many lose ends: What happened to the gold? What happened with the elf jewels? What happened to Bard and his people? What happened to the dwarfs? What happened to the elves? It would have been interesting to see how Sauramon gets turned to the dark side. I could keep going but I'm sleepy now. That's my 2 cents."

","After going too see The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies, excited but uneasy as the latest trailers rolled by on the cinema screen. I was worried, already having seen how misguided the choice of separating a book that is only about 300 pages long into three over two hour long films was. I could only sit and ponder over how they were going to create a well rounded story of the last section of a book and span it over two hours and 20 minutes. Well it certainly didn't live up too any hopes I had. <br/><br/>Immediately you are thrown into the peril of Lake-town as a soaring, extremely angry, ancient dragon looms in the skies above. With the warning bell ringing, I felt my heart start to pump as each bell rang through the ears of the Lake-town folk, and the panic began to spread throughout. This was by far one of actual impressive scenes of the film, you were consumed into the film just as the town was by the whirling firestorms that lit up the cinema screen. <br/><br/>Then you cut back to the gang, the dwarfs are safely high up in one of the lookout towers of Erebor, hold on, weren't you guys just outside on the outskirts watching Smaug sore across the sky in head of Lake- town. This was the moment that started my saddening journey through 'The Battle of Five Armies'. It may only be a minute flaw but there were plenty more, which just exposed how little detail Mr.Jackson had payed too the overall wholeness and realism of the film. And as the film went on it had become clear to me that he had just thought oh well let's just create a CGI Middle-Earth, cause why go out and shoot those beautiful New Zealand landscapes that created the rich and immerse feel of Middle-Earth when we could do it all on computers. Being that it is only towards the end of the film that we see any defining real-world set shots which comforted my now disappointed and bleak view of the film. <br/><br/>Now the middle and majority of the film is where I underwent the sights that lead me to this view. Apart from being cut from different points of battle for nearly most of it, that only left me wishing I had needed the toilet just so I could take a break from the never ending fighting. This is where the films structure fell apart, as for some reason big, over dramatic battles were more important than characters development, except for the exploration of Thorin's inner evil and greed balancing his future of protagonist or antagonist on the edge of a knife until be undergoes a bizarre golden epiphany. And don't even get me started on the dwarf, elf love story that Jackson has said he was sorry for, saying it was for the teenage girls in his audience. Did you want to make your sell-out that more obvious? Five Armies was the end to the hollow, Tolkien shaming, blockbuster trilogy that exploits a beautiful story into a meant to be spectacular and fantastic money making scheme."
"Gordon-11","Null","7","14","19 December 2014"," Over battling makes the plot hollow
","This film continues the story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure, after the fierce dragon Smaug is awakened.<br/><br/>As the final chapter of ""The Hobbit"", I was looking forward to a grand finale that moves mountains. Indeed, there is much action, in fact the whole film is battle after battle. There is very little plot, just lots of killing. The constant over simulation overwhelmed my senses and numbed my responses, preventing me from feeling the poignant ending. In addition, the constant fighting means there's little time to develop an actual plot, making the film rather hollow. I have to say, despite the amazing graphics, I was a bit disappointed by the film."
"scottshak_111","8","7","14","18 December 2014"," Epic finale to one of the most engaging tales ever!
","Peter Jackson returns with his HFR to closely project every daunting intricacies of our beloved franchise and he does it with pizazz. Be it be the dragon's fury on the ill-fated Laketown, the perfect depiction of shadows of Dol Guldur, the epic war formations of Elfin and dwarfs army or the breathtaking fight sequences that followed. Every bit drenched with beauty only Jackson could perfect.<br/><br/>The movie begins where it fled off: with dragon's wrath. Albeit we knew that the slaying of the beast was imminent, the flick takes pace aptly with the Tolkein's tale. We see Bard who wishes a genuine share for his people from the mountain treasure in order to help them rise from ashes. Thranduil is stained with greed and comes with his elfin hoard to rob the mountain for silver and white gems. Thorin holds the fort succumbed by dragon sickness unwilling to budge. Dain, Thorin's cousin, comes to the aid of Thorin to fight his battle. Above it all there is the mighty Orc army led by Azog and another gigantic Orc army that swarm with war bats. The lonely mountain of treasure witnesses it all – the tragedy called war.<br/><br/>Screenplay being limited owing to war depictions, we are still left with pretty amazing conversations like the one between the Bard and Thorin through a crevice in the wall. Bard's urge to Thorin to keep his promise. The aftermath of Kili's fate with Tauriel in sobs ""If this is love, I don't want it."" Without exploring gore, Jackson presents death superbly.<br/><br/>Thorin's inane reasoning with Dwalin, voices in his head, his dream and finally his rad resurrection from the Dragon Sickness have been beautifully portrayed. The fate of Kili and Fili sealed by Azog's perversion meets Thorin's wrath. Their clash powerful! Even more engaging was the fight between Legolas and Bolg.<br/><br/>The story eventually meets where LOTR begins and connecting the stream like that with Baggins and Gandalf in the picture only brings a contented smile.<br/><br/>Want a closure? Plunge in!"

","And that's it. The end of the Middle Earth saga is here. That is until Warner Bros decides they want another billion dollars and end up squeaking out another cash grab. The Battle of the Five Armies was not only the weakest of the Hobbit Trilogy, but most definitely of all the Middle Earth films. I regret to say that this film was not as epic nor as fun as the trailers made it out to be. The film is just one big CGI mess.<br/><br/>The first Hobbit was slow but enjoyable and it got me excited to see where the franchise was going. Smaug was intense but I never felt our heroes were in any sort of danger, which is odd considering the dragon is a hundred times the size of them. And I haven't really been a fan of the new frame rates that Peter Jackson has been using or the fact that basically the entirety of the films are CGI and green screen. It just doesn't feel as real or lively as the LOTR trilogy did. There were a lot of tiny things that this film did to tease that trilogy but it's not as cool when it doesn't really make sense with the timeline. There were some unnecessary cameos but the most disappointing thing was how they handled Smaug. The first ten minutes was my favorite part of the entire film and that's all because of Cumberbatch as Smaug.<br/><br/>Luke Evans gives a solid performance and quite possibly the only character I actually cared about. His not-so-buddy Alfrid may be one of the most annoying characters in film this year, and is absolutely out of sink with the tone of the film. Speaking of shoehorned in characters, Legolas, who is not in the book at all, has one of the most pathetic CGI scenes I have ever seen. You will know it once you see it. But there are things to like about this one. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, although doesn't much to do, is great as always. He shares many of the films best scenes with Bilbo, even if some of them are just to get nerds sweaty about Lord of the Rings. Manu Bennett also plays a very good villain in Azog. Although I will say that the Orcs look scarier when they were humans in makeup in the original trilogy rather than CGI.<br/><br/>So even though the film isn't complete trash, you will walk out pretty disappointed. It's almost all battle scenes and you just get fatigued after awhile. I found myself wanting the film to end several times but it just kept dragging on. You don't really care about the characters or feel much danger for any of them. Even when you are supposed to feel for them, the emotional moments just don't work. It's just a really frustrating film and I cant believe i'm having it near the bottom of my 2014 list.<br/><br/>+Gandalf & Bilbo <br/><br/>+Manu Bennett <br/><br/>+Smaug <br/><br/>-Fatiguing <br/><br/>-Emotional moments don't hit <br/><br/>-Alfrid <br/><br/>-Don't feel much danger for the characters <br/><br/>-Really drags <br/><br/>5.5/10"
"OttoVonB","5","7","14","16 December 2014"," The Desolation of Nostalgia
","Peter Jackson finally caps his nearly 2-decade stint in Middle Earth (not counting the odd hiatus here and there) with his shortest film since the late nineties, two and a half hours of ""pay-off"". I use brackets because the narrative foundations are much less solid than they were in The Return of the King.<br/><br/>In terms of action, Jackson outdoes himself, mostly foregoing the epic sweep of the Rings trilogy for a big messy brawl, though with a sense of geography that helps you keep track of who is where and trying to do what. His inventiveness in these scenes also gives you glimpses of what the Hobbit could have been had it chosen to be a more compact, fun and silly adventure story: dwarf lords riding battle-pigs, war-goats climbing a mountain-fortress, Legolas using a giant bat as a parachute and a demented fight on a collapsed tower (this one is worth the price of admission alone) are all sights to behold, pure entertainment... Jackson certainly has not forgotten how to direct movies. Only how to write them.<br/><br/>Part 1 made a whole fuss about dragons and teased us with shadows and a giant eye, while wasting time in Hobbiton and Rivendel. Part 2 committed the even greater sin of giving us a bit of dragon and denying us his titular desolation, while throwing in a useless love story and more Rings setup intrigue we didn't need - and the less said about Beorn, the better. Along comes part 3, swiftly dispatching the great Smaug before titles even appear on screen to focus on a battle right out of the book's footnotes. Even the title is disingenuous - again! - as of the five armies, two are of orcs and count as the same, and another isn't an army but a crowd of refugees.<br/><br/>The spectacle might be near faultless, but the structure is fatally flawed, cramming in more Lord of the Rings setup and more minor characters devoid of payoff. Now that it is all said and done, making two films out of the Hobbit could have worked, and produced tight and fun experiences. Stretching it to three has resulted in a completely indulgent narrative mess, which allows itself to lose sight of its strongest assets. It's mind-boggling how little of Martin Freeman's Bilbo you actually see in films named after him...<br/><br/>More and more, I hear people compare these films to the Star Wars prequels. While the Hobbit installments are nowhere near the complete artistic disaster that those films where, it does underline the utter pointlessness of prequels. We might want more of the same, especially if it moves the story forward and shows us new things, but we don't need setup for things we've already seen, and perhaps this was inevitable with Jackson at the helm: an irrepressible, natural desire to ""tie it all together"". Every little thing that turned the Hobbit into a prequel saga to Lord of the Rings made it suffer, and you can't help but imagine what Guillermo Del Toro and a fresh perspective might have done."

"madisondeclare","9","5","9","24 April 2016"," MOST of these reviewers are seeing what this film ISN'T, not what it IS. Oh, and watch the extended version
","Well, technically ALL the Hobbit movies go with the title of this review, but I'm reviewing only this movie right now...<br/><br/>I have read many reviews on here, and have seen an insane amount of 1 out of 10 star reviews, and I notice that MOST of these reviewers seem to be hating on this film for what it ISN'T, not what it is IS. Most of the complaints of what it ISN'T is naturally based on the Hobbit book itself with many added things that were not stated in the book or even some changes of certain deaths or aspects. Let me just say, that I too am a Tolkien fanatic. I have read all of his Middle-Earth books and even study them as if they were a subject in school, and I still love these films (as well as the Lotr trilogy). But I'm going to talk about this film on it's own without comparing it to the source material, because I personally think that these should be looked at as movies first, and adaptations second. <br/><br/>So, to me, this is what this movie IS: ---Amazing acting. Every actor -- whether CG or not--genuinely play their roles so well. The actors in this film that stand out to me the most would have to be Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, and Evangeline Lilly. <br/><br/>---The CGI is not at all bad. Yes there is a lot of it used in this movie, but there is wayyy worse CGI out there. Besides, the orcs and troll designs look great. They look like intimating and different proportioned creatures and not just people in make up (not saying that's at all bad.) <br/><br/>---The relationship between Thorin and Bilbo was done in a believable and very emotional way.<br/><br/>---The romance--though not entirely necessary--was a very touching addition. It shows the beauty of it, as well as the pain. <br/><br/>---The drama. This is a movie that is based around one big battle and lots of deaths, so they have to be emotional. That's exactly what this movie is. The emotion may seem different from lotr because of certain ways the characters react, but the emotion of this film is based on subtly from the actor's expressions (another point to the actors.)<br/><br/>---The battle scenes are exciting but of course dramatic. <br/><br/>---The score is beautiful, intense and intense. It simply sounds amazing thanks to Howard Shore. <br/><br/>I loved this film. Sure it is not the best of the three, but it's a very exciting and dramatic film, like it's supposed to be! The only problem I have with the film itself is some of the comedy (Most of Alfrid's scenes) is not really that funny and seems kind of forced. And there are many things I really would have loved to see, but that is part of the whole ""what it is IS and what it isn't"" subject, so that doesn't count for my rating! <br/><br/>Oh, but like I said, check out the extended edition! It has much that the theatrical version was lacking. <br/><br/>Overall, Theatrical version: 8/10 Extended version: 9/10!"

If you like CGI, lots of dreadful action, a meaningless love story and a predictable outcome, than this is your movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the dwarfs were stubborn, and yes, the same goes for the elves. Legolas saves the day once or twice, Gandalf knows everything better, Bilbo is once again a very good friend, that gigantic dwarf army could never have won without those 13 dwarfs and at the end, the death.. eh.. PETA wizard saves the day dropping some animals, who could have seen that one coming?<br/><br/>I just felt myself rooting for the Orcs, killing all those peasant in 'Stone Street' (really?). I do not understand how this movie averages a 7.5. Of course there are worse movies, but this just felt as a waste of my time.

All these things were evident in the first two, but were turned up to 11 in this one. <br/><br/>It starts off with Smaug being killed in the must unbelievable way possible, making Bard king for the idiots of lake town, and the dwarfs get the mountain back. 16 minutes in, and I was asleep. Thorin is going insane, which the rest of the dwarfs should be doing if it's the gold causing it, and is being a complete dick to his friends, while the greedy elves and men are asking for their share of the treasure. And meanwhile, the Orcs want revenge. This is all being filmed on a green screen, mind you, and conjured up in a computer, and it looks like a 2nd grader did it. <br/><br/>Not much happens between then and the climax.

We've got potty mouthed dwarfs, CG soldiers who all look the same, magic Rams that appear out of nowhere, a really stupid death for Thorin, Gandalf making stupid noises with his pipe, giant worms that appear out of nowhere and are never seen again, gravity and physics defying CG stunts, fart jokes, boob jokes, a stupid Monty Python reference...

You would be dead wrong. I defy you to care about a single character on screen, from the deeply irritating original invention Alfrid, to the utterly wasted and ill-defined Bilbo, to the very tired Ian McKellen (I refuse to call him Gandalf, because entirely gone is the mischievous spark that defined the character in LOTR). It is abundantly clear that LOTR was good in spite of Peter Jackson, and every moment of distracting ridiculousness and over the top, mind-numbing excess betrayed his true impulse as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>If you must see this movie, watch the Extended Edition with the fast-forward button handy - there's about 10-minutes of delightfully ludicrous and gruesome action in there that was cut from the Theatrical Edition and ranks among Jackson's most entertaining spectacle.

Character consistency and development are absent. What slight story there is makes no sense. Much of the acting is not terribly good. A lot of the CGI is not terribly good either. The forces of physics and gravity do not exist. The humour fails completely. After a devastating battle which has killed a quarter of his people, a leader takes the sick and shocked survivors away from what resources still remain for a week-long journey through a desolate wilderness, which would surely have killed the rest. This is after he has shot from a bow a ridiculous iron bolt which wouldn't even travel well from a ballista. Then he immediately puts his trust in a man who is patently dishonest, self-serving and cowardly. After inviting his kin Dain, who behaves like a football hooligan not a king, from the Iron Hills, putting the lives of he and his people at risk for Thorin, this great dwarf leader skulks in his basement. Despite Gimli's love for Galadriel in LOTR being the only time a dwarf has ever loved an elf, here it happens first. Thranduil is motivated by desire for a necklace. The three owners of the Elven-rings, who have tried for a thousand years to conceal these from Sauron, show up on his doorstep wearing them. This gives us an opportunity to see a ninety-year old man whirling and jumping around like a thing possessed, evidently because Jackson believes that you can't be worthwhile unless you can kick arse. As everywhere in the whole two trilogies, Jackson shows no comprehension of the times, of the morals, of the motivations. And this is only to mention the most obvious and foolish faults. Everything is conceived of in terms that would embarrass the writers of Days Of Our Lives. Important elements of the book - and elements that would have greatly improved the movie, such as the entry of Beorn into the battle - are thrown out or thrown away. As usual Jackson,a man who conveys neither humility nor respect for his source material, somehow conceives that he is a better writer than Tolkein - as well as a director who conveys total contempt for the intelligence of his audience. Certainly the character thread of losing all values to the lust for money makes complete sense here.<br/><br/>Trash, and a candidate for worst blockbuster ever. Cats & Dogs 2: The Revenge Of Kitty Galore was a better film. Perhaps one day someone with sense may something with at least some reference to Tolkein or, at least, less embarrassing."

This is no ordinary squat however, and the strategic importance of the mountain leads to hoards of elves and orcs, together with the refugees of Laketown, converging on the stronghold in an epic struggle for power. Throw into the mix a forbidden inter-racial love story between the dwarf Kili (Aiden Turner) and the elf princess Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the struggles of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) against the emerging darkness of Sauron and you end up with an eventful and entertaining ending to the saga.<br/><br/>The film is, as you would expect, a tour de force of special effects from beginning to end, although Jackson sometimes over-eggs the pudding: a slow-motion bridge collapse under a leaping Legolas (a strangely CGI'd Orlando Bloom) being a particular case in point – the sequence feels like having been sponsored by the spin-off video game company! The movie is also extremely 'battle-heavy' (or ""a bit fighty"" as my wife succinctly puts it) – the last two thirds of the film is pretty much an ongoing pitched battle with very little let up. If unrelenting sword-play and decapitations are not your bag, then this is probably not a film you will enjoy that much.<br/><br/>It has to be said though that all of the performances are top notch, with Richard Armitage being particularly effective as Thorin, alternately fighting and then succumbing to the gold-induced 'Dragon-fever'. Billy Connolly also adds some much needed humour to the story in his role as a dwarf warlord, and the nation's beloved Stephen Fry entertains as the greedy and superior Master of Laketown, destined (obviously) to get his comeuppance.<br/><br/>If this film was a one-off, I would be reviewing it as a ""Wow, that was amazing!"" film. As it is the LOTR equivalent of ""Police Academy 6″, my opinion is rather tarnished and whilst the film is workmanlike and entertaining, there is a feeling of 'same old, same old' about it. Another problem I found with this being a prequel to the original series is that the addition of 'new' creatures and tactics often doesn't ring true. For example, the orc armies take full advantage of some very useful giant worms and their mounted rides include enormous and very effective troll creatures. This unfortunately begs the question as to why these significant battle assets were not deployed in the ""The Return of the King"" – surely they were better than those lumbering elephant things? (I realise, of course, the unreasonableness of in turns criticising a film for being samey and then criticising it for adding new stuff: hey, I'm a film critic – bite me!) So, in summary, Jackson pulls the finale off with aplomb, and the final title song ""The Last Goodbye"" (sung by Billy Boyd, Pippin in the LOTR series) probably neatly expressed the sorrow felt by the director in coming to the end of his saga."

","Have you ever watched a movie intro to a PC game?<br/><br/>Well imagine if it lasted over two hours. If you can't imagine that then see this movie. Because that's all you get.<br/><br/>Actually it feel like you get the same scene over and over and over again. A role gets introduced, some men yell through their teeth, then there is a ridiculous fight scene. All accompanied by a sound track which mostly consists of 'rumbles'.<br/><br/>The actors could swap roles at any time as there is sod-all difference between the acting or the portrayals and zero character development.<br/><br/>But technically it is excellent. It looks like an awful lot of care an attention has been put in to costumes, set designs and the computer animation (well except for the ram running up the castle wall; that was really cheap and cheesy). And that brings us back to why it is basically a computer game intro.<br/><br/>Take the kids to see it by all means; but go when you are tired so that you can have a long snooze."

"samuel-burmeister","5","5","9","26 December 2014"," Overall, highly disappointing...
","At an early age I received The Hobbit for Christmas. I have read The Hobbit numerous times and know it well, the book is jam packed with action and interesting characters and twists. The movies altogether lack luster and drag on endlessly revolving around plots not related to the actual storyline in the novel! <br/><br/>The third movie was almost unbearable for a reader of the novel as there were so many poorly executed links to Sauron and LOTR that it made me cringe. The Hobbit was a riveting read from start to finish, the movies are patchy. The best scenes included animals that didn't feature in the book."

","When it comes to any franchising crowning film, usually the director, cast, and screenwriters try to give it their all to make it the best entry yet to go out with a bang (i.e. LOTR, Harry Potter, etc.) However, in The Hobbit: The Final Entry Into The Ridiculously Drawn Out Franchise, it seems as though everyone involved in the film threw together about two weeks before it was released. I have never seen a film with such esteemed reputation be so lazily made in my entire life. Everything in this movie just seemed half-a**ed. The battle scenes, including other characters/set pieces, are so heavily loaded with some of the worst CGI I have ever seen that I thought I was watching a poorly made video game. You would think that a movie with such a huge budget would look more real than an animated movie itself. Speaking of the battle scenes, there are so many fights in the film that seem to do absolutely everything in their power to defy the laws of physics, each scene making me laugh harder at the ridiculousness of the action taking place (guys, I'm serious, the action was almost as bad as Transformers). These scenes also try so hard to attempt to build tension, but around the tenth scene of a protagonist in a fight with a cartoon orc attempting to seem so climatic when we obviously know the outcome, the movie starts to get boring, proving itself to just be filler for Warner Brothers to get another $300 million in their pockets. But what is probably the worst thing about the movie is that the plot is driven by offensively stupid decisions made my brainless, underdeveloped characters. Half of the battles were not even necessary, because they were solely caused by idiotic characters with petty desires. Yes, I understand that greed is a big overall theme, but when we are repeatedly blatantly beaten over the head with it, it becomes very tiring, and the characters just start to seem one dimensioned and predictable. Overall, The Hobbit TBOTFA is just a huge disappointment, and we deserved much more for the final entry in one of the best franchises of all time. Grade: D+"
"XweAponX","10","8","17","24 January 2015"," Thorin becomes Smaug vs. Galadriel, the Action Hero
","This entry of the Jackson Tolkien Films is the most difficult to get a handle on. Mostly because the events depicted only filled a few chapters in ""The Hobbit"". But what most people forget, is that these events are meticulously revisited in the Appendices of ""Lord of the Rings"" and there are more to these events than in JRR's first Middle Earth novel.<br/><br/>For one thing, Gandalf joins a ""Council of White Wizards"" mentioned in the last chapters of The Hobbit, which confronted ""The Necromancer"" and drove him out of Dol Guldur. Saruman is not named as one of these, but those events are also in the Appendices of Lord of The Rings. Which is where it speaks of Saruman telling Gandalf the lie that The One Ring had rolled down the River Anduin into the Ocean, Saruman in fact had been looking for it for a while, but Bilbo's unexpected possession of it put a kink in his plans for it.<br/><br/>This ""Council of White Wizards"" is shown early on in the Film, and in this treatment, includes Gandalf, Radagast, Galadriel, Elron and Saruman- Who had all come to the aid of Gandalf. This is where Galadriel ""Adamanty"" drives ""The Necromancer"" from Mirkwood- At first I thought using only ""Nenya"", the ""Ring of Adamant"", but after repeated viewings, she is definitely also holding the Light of Earendil, which as you remember, she gave to Frodo in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Here, she is shown with all of the potential dark power needed to perform an ejection of Sauron, protected by that light just as Frodo and Sam were in Shelob's Lair. I wonder if Galadriel's Wrath can be viewed as the same as Burt Lancaster, armed with a Machine Gun, shooting down Japanese planes in ""From Here to Eterenity""? Both show each character digging into their inner selves, pulling out power from deep within. Whether this power comes from a Machine Gun or ""Nenya"", one of the Three Elven Rings, is inconsequential. Both have the power, but it is the person who must choose to use these as weapons. Both scenes show each character differently than they normally are.<br/><br/>In the extended version of ""Desolation of Smaug"" it is shown that Gandalf has found Thorin's Father Thrain in Dol Guldur. This also is recollected in The Appendices, with the fact that he had the last Dwarf Ring.<br/><br/>So the question is, how do you tell a good story out of the few remaining chapters of the book? You do it by mining all of the facts out of the Lord of the Rings Appendices that relate to this time and side-load them into your story. The actual ""Battle of the Five Armies"" is not experienced from the reader's POV in The Hobbit, it is told after the fact. But here, all of the things that led up to it can be shown.<br/><br/>The only real added thing was Jackson's Addition of the She-Elf ""Tauriel"" (Evangeline Lilly), who I had already said was pleasant to look at, especially when she lights up like Arwen while healing Fili, the whole thing with the added character and a kind of romantic thing with Fili does not deter me from enjoying this one bit. We know that Legolas and Gimli found an unbreakable connexion, not just in the Lord of the Rings Films but in the books as well, in fact they take the very last Ship into the West. Would JRR Roll in his grave? Maybe, maybe not, if he understood how movies are made. I have to question, would a treatment of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, done page by page and scene by scene from the books, be any better? Consider that in Lord of The Rings, one story is told, then it backs up and tells another story that happened at the same time. In a book, that might make those events easier to follow, but in a film, to show them all happening at once is better.<br/><br/>So Legolas and Tauriel take a side trip to Gundabag? Maybe the book does not have those characters doing that, but we do know that Gundabag and Angmar were part of this story and with Lord of the Rings years later.<br/><br/>But the part of this film I love is the depiction of The Madness of Thorin, who, after Smaug is killed, takes on his personality, even repeating phrases Smaug used. What will it take to break through that madness? Thorin has to do it himself, but he has always had the Loyalty of the other 12 Dwarfs and Bilbo.<br/><br/>The Highlight of course is Billy Connolly as Dain, asking very politely if a an army of Men and Elves would Sod Off, Before being attacked by Creatures that seemed to have come from ""Arrakis"" in Frank Herbert's Universe.<br/><br/>The Blending of CGI with Live Action and Miniatures is mind boggling. THIS is where Jackson Excels.<br/><br/>If ""The Silmarillon"" could be made into a film or set of films, would Jackson do it? Moreover should he do it? I think so, if only to create a continuity of look and feel of Middle earth. New Zealand really is Middle Earth on Earth. Of course, I may add more when the Extended cut comes out. This film was in fact much too short. Finally, I want to add a hearty middle earth ""finger"" to all of the trolls who are downvoting every positive review."
"gianlucamarzano16","9","8","17","16 December 2014"," One last time
","The hobbit: The battle of the five armies is the last film in the hobbit series. This film takes place right were the second one left off. The movie is about bilbo and the dwarfs take their homeland back but different armies are ready to fight for it,so now they have to defend it. I will first say this one is very different from the other two because they made it dark and took out the kid feel. The whole battle itself was very impressive but not as good as ""the return of the king"". There was a lot of character development in Thorin(Richard armitage) which was good because he played a big role in this one. The acting was great by everyone. Another great thing the movie did was lead it into the lord of the rings. The only downside of the movie was Alfrid(Ryan Gage). His character tried to be funny but it just didn't work for the movie. So overall if you enjoy the other Hobbit movies,you will enjoy this one. A farewell to middle-earth."

","I personally really enjoyed this film. The story itself was lacking, to say the least with the romance and drama element failing miserably,but Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Richard Armitage all trying to make the conclusion to the Middle-Earth Saga as epic as possible was a plus. But I knew this was going to be more underdeveloped than the others with it being predominantly about the Battle of the five armies, and this is honestly a good popcorn flick with the battle being enjoyable to say the least.On the whole, this movie was quite a good send off to the middle-earth saga, despite it being one of the weaker films along with An Unexpected Journey, but Peter Jackson has made a better prequel trilogy than George Lucas and I was impressed by the action and Freeman's performance. 8/10."
"trevorwong905","1","9","20","23 December 2014"," The Hobbit 3: An Unexplained Journey that Will Addle the Brain.
","Everything about how this movie was made annoyed me. This review will unpack some of my thoughts on the experience by analyzing the films structural composition, issues with the plot and script writing, and the aesthetics of the film itself.<br/><br/>Looking at some of the aspects of the composition, to begin with, there was absolutely no down time or character development in the film. It was just like being run over by a train at 100% speed for two and a half hours. I felt like the film lacked a coherent intro which summarized the previous events from the last instalment. Moreover, The film desperately needed more serious dialogue to build up the battle/ make it seem more important. For instance, I really felt like they didn't give enough information to contextualize WHY exactly Sauron chose to reveal himself and wage war at that exact time. They did give explanations but honestly they seemed way too simplistic for me (i.e. 'Erabor is a good strategic battle place'). I felt like the lack of a developed narrative was probably a product of them over indulging in battle scenes in the second film. Considering the total run time of the trilogy, they simply ate up available time to strengthen the characters and plot and instead used it on explosions and fight scenes. <br/><br/>Additionally, the movie had all sorts of issues with the plot which mostly stemmed from numerous unexplained situations. For instance, they never sorted out the dispute over the treasure between the races (i'm pretty sure that was the whole point of the war in the first place), secondly they completely abandoned any information on the Dol-Goldur scene post Saruman's departure. Was Saruman supposed to be evil from that point onwards or was he evil prior to that? If he was evil, why didn't he chose to just aid Sauron in that initial battle and backstab Galadriel, Elrond, and Gandalf. Two of the three we're severely weakened. They easily could of been overpowered. Also, why was there no funeral for Thorin or the two dwarf brothers? i'm pretty sure they were supposed to be important characters. The film completely failed to synthesize any of the events that happened at the end into a comprehensive and satisfying conclusion. Once the war ended - the movie ended. Why on earth should I care about these characters again? obviously the film makers didn't so I guess I don't either.<br/><br/>In terms of the battle itself, I find it absolutely absurd and implausible that they were able to turn the tide in the fight with the minimal information the audience was given in regards to their newly added reinforcements during the battle. I clearly remember that, at the mid way point of the film (before the 12 dwarfs had left the stone city), they were terribly out numbered. How on (middle) earth am I supposed to believe that the addition of 12 dwarfs into the battle could completely change the fortunes of a severely out numbered and depleted allied contingency? Also, those giant worms at the beginning of the battle. Did they even use those? i'm pretty sure those things could of probably wiped out the planet if the felt like it. finally, that nonsense with the eagles, they were supposedly strong enough to negate an ENTIRE other army? what? <br/><br/>The overall look and feel of this film annoyed me. The lighting and visual experience of this film felt awfully similar to a day-time soap opera. The visuals were overly saturated. Everything was way to bright and soft at the same time. I think it would have been better if they had just avoided that. The softening and saturation effect reduced the rawness and overall harshness of armed conflict and ultimately seemed to desensitize me to the horrific events the were actually going on. I don't care if its fantasy or real life, war isn't something to be taken lightly and the way they approached definitely detracted from that. The mood itself was also way to light-hearted. That dofus character, Alfred, he surely did not need to be in the film and he was nothing more than a 'Jar-Jar Blinks' type device for comic relief. This film did not need any additional comic relief with all of the implausible 'gravity defying' (i.e Legolas on the stairs) battle sequences. Also, the love story between the Dwarf and the Elf was undeveloped and probably unnecessary. It detracts from the importance of Legolas and Gimlis' friendship in the future films because obviously its not the weird that elves and dwarfs can be friends. Additionally, I really disliked the franchises multiple attempts to reference the 'Lord of the Ring's' films. I know they're from the same universe and related to each other, i'm not an idiot and I don't care. That scene where Legolas' father suggests to him to visit Aragon up north. That did not need to be there. Am I supposed to believe that over the next 40 something years, Legolas decides that 'oh yeah, I hear that Aragon dude has a good start up project up north' 'i'll just go up there since I have ABSOLUTELY nothing better to do'. Also, he knows absolutely nothing about him other than maybe one or two words of positive recommendation from his father. That is not convincing or, in any sense, a realistic motivator for anyone. If they wanted to bring up this subject in the first place, they should of expanded on it to increase both, the credibility, and the backstory behind Aragon and Legolas' history. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the 'Battle of the Five Armies' is a pretty flawed movie. It mostly will just be popular based on an established brand name and series. All of that unfortunately overshadows the fact that this movie has numerous holes due to composition/limited character development, plot holes, and poor aesthetic film making choices."

From the opening scene, I was completely enchanted and mesmerized. I was taken into the story and laughed and cried along the way. Some of the scenes in TBoTFA are the best I've ever seen.

"Middle-earthfan84","9","12","29","11 December 2014"," Review from a true LOTR fan.
","First of all, let me just say, when I first heard that Guillermo Del Toro had left The Hobbit and that Peter Jackson was going to direct it himself, I couldn't hold my excitement. As of 2011, I started watching every video blog from the set, countless times, and reading every article containing every bit of information about the films. Lord of the Rings was a milestone in my adolescence and remains a vital part of my being to this day. ( as will continue to be for as long as I live)So, naturally, I was expecting The Hobbit films to be on par with Rings, I was expecting them to be cinematic masterpieces, however when I first saw An Unexpected Journey, I realized that was not the case, but still, as a true fan I absolutely loved it, I have a strong emotional connection with that first film in the trilogy, there are moments in it that makes me tear up ( like the second prologue with Ian Holm's Bilbo and Frodo, a scene between Galadriel and Gandalf when we hear a small segment of The Breaking of the Fellowship playing and a moment between Thorin and Bilbo at the end).<br/><br/>That being said, I was fairly disappointed with the second installment, The Desolation of Smaug, although very entertaining and with great spectacle ( and good pacing), I felt it lacked the heart and character driven moments from the first film. ( not to mention the bad CGI and the absurd over the top finale at Erebor)So, after that film, I was worried that the third film would also be something of a let down, well, after having seen it last night I can happily say this is far from the truth. The heart and emotion from the first film are heightened in The Battle of the Five Armies, while watching the film I felt that Jackson was channeling, well, himself, in the LOTR days, creating a huge battle with the focus on the characters personal dramas, in a way, I think he was aiming for this film to be this trilogy's Return of the King, with is both a bad and a good thing, it's bad because this trilogy doesn't have the same caliber as LOTR, and will always exist on its shadow, but at the same time is good, because it brought up the best that Jackson has to offer as director this time around, which makes this the best film of this trilogy.<br/><br/>The passing of some of the main characters is done beautifully, in an extremely emotional way, each character has it's moment in the film, but it's Bilbo and Thorin's relationship that is the emotional core of the film, but there are also some very emotionally charged character arcs, like Tauriel and Kili's, let me just say that their ""romance"" is treated in a much more profound way this time around, there are also some touching moments with Bard and his children. I also thought that the visual effects in this film were the best of trilogy, I always disliked Jackson's decision to not use those beautiful miniature models like in LOTR, and instead creating some of the locations digitally, strangely I felt that the locations, especially Erebor and Dale, didn't look as artificial as in the first films, from some angles, Dale in this film reminded me a little of Minas Tirith. There is also a scene when Legolas and Tauriel arrive at Gundabad, an evil fortress, just in time to see a large army of orcs march from inside the fortress towards Erebor, accompanied by a huge flock of giant monstrous bats, that scene reminded me of when Frodo, Sam and Gollum arrive at Minas Morgul in ROTK, and witness the Witch king of Angmar leading an army towards Gondor. Speaking of the Witch King, die hard fans such as myself will have a major geek moment in the first hour of the film, when Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman face off against the Nine, the Ringwraiths, and Galadriel single handedly faces off against Sauron himself, I had goosebumps.<br/><br/>There is much to love in this film, especially if you are a fan, the final framing device with old Bilbo in the Shire felt wonderfully nostalgic, it makes one want to watch Fellowship of the Ring right afterwards. I believe Jackson has achieved what he was aiming at, creating a trilogy that is a worthy prelude to LOTR and at the same time a compelling story on its own."

"matthewssilverhammer","4","6","12","26 December 2014"," Worst Middle Earth Movie
","Jackson's a good filmmaker, able to handle big emotional stories with style and care like a renowned chef (Heavenly Creatures, LOTR trilogy). However, if LOTR was a luxurious entree, The Hobbit is a cheap, fast-food dessertit's tasty at times, but it won't sustain and definitely isn't needed. The trilogy completely loses what little bit of identity it had in this, its final installment. In what isn't really a stand-alone film as much as a filler section of a bad miniseries, Battle is a couple cool moments in an otherwise weak narrative. We find our crew reunited back in their mountain-home, suddenly realizing they must defend it against those who want the mountain themselves.but wait a minute. Where did all this new conflict come from? Weren't we just trying to get the mountain back from Smaug? Even Bilbo himself says, ""Your quest is fulfilled, is that not enough?"" Yes, it is. Too bad no one told Jackson. Now we're forced into a third chapter full of contrivances, coincidences, and a really bad romance. Maybe its biggest downfall is not utilizing its strength, Martin Freeman; given criminally little to do, he does his best to bring naturalism and personality to the proceedings, but gets lost in the hubbub. There ARE positives: Jackson's eye for cinematography, unique fights, and horror-like visuals help when front-and-center. If only they weren't covered in atrocious cgi. Desolation of Smaug had me hopeful that we were returning to the glory days of LOTR. Sadly, Battle lost that spark and instead feels just plain tedious."
"estebangonzalez10","6","6","12","20 December 2014"," Will you follow Jackson one last time into Middle Earth?
","""Will you follow me, one last time?""<br/><br/>Not only is Thorin asking his dwarfs to follow him one last time into battle, but Peter Jackson is also asking us to join him one last time in experiencing his vision of Middle Earth. We all know The Hobbit was one short book (about 300 pages), but Jackson decided to adapt it into three full length movies so there is going to be a lot of characters and elements included that aren't in the book. J.R.R Tolkien fans might be upset and most audiences agree that Jackson made a mistake in stretching the material because this trilogy hasn't had the same emotional impact as the Lord of the Rings trilogy had. However, Jackson is still asking us to accompany him one last time into Middle Earth in order to tie everything together. He and the producers may have experienced their share of dragon fever by getting greedy and wanting to bank on the success of their first trilogy (it is kind of ironic when you take into account that the underlying message of the novels is that greed destroys the soul), but they are asking us to join them for one last time, and they deserve it. If you are a fan of the franchise this will be an emotional moment for you, but if you don't care much for this world then you will find the film annoying. It does tie in the first two films of The Hobbit trilogy very well with The Lord of the Rings so it serves as a sort of closure for these epic films. At 144 minutes, this is the shortest film of the franchise and you sort of get the feeling that Jackson doesn't know how to sum things up in less than 3 hours because this film feels rushed and overstuffed with characters and subplots. It also happens to be action packed with a battle scene lasting for almost an hour. It may be a bit too much, but there is no denying that Peter Jackson cares deeply for the material here and is devoted to it. Despite not being nearly as engaging as The Lord of the Ring trilogy, The Hobbit has its emotional moments with strong action sequences and some solid performances. Jackson is asking us to follow him for the last time, but it is up to us to decide if his passion and dedication is worth the journey. I joined him and was mildly entertained although I found several flaws. Despite not being as entertaining as The Desolation of Smaug, this is still an improvement over The Unexpected Journey. <br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies picks up right where The Desolation of Smaug left us, giving me the feeling that I had paused the film and waited a whole year before hitting the play button once again. It took me a while to recall everything that had been going on, but with the opening action sequence I had to rush those memories in order to understand everything that was going on. The Hobbit is actually one film divided into three parts which makes it difficult to analyze apart from each other. There is a sense of cohesion among these films and we finally get the concluding chapter after an agonizing and extended fist part which felt completely stretched out and an entertaining second chapter where we were introduced to new and familiar characters and an impressive dragon voiced by the great Benedict Cumberbatch. This third chapter picks up with that very dragon destroying the nearby village where Bard (Luke Evans) and his children are. The film begins with an impressive action sequence and then the next hour is dedicated to build up what will be the ultimate battle scene with five different armies preparing for battle. This is where the movie begins to feel convoluted and overstuffed with subplots that feel too rushed. But at times the film does succeed when it centers on the relationship between Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Thorin (Richard Armitage). We know that Jackson knows how to deliver spectacular visuals and action sequences, but what was missing from The Lord of the Rings trilogy was that character development we finally got to see here with these two characters. Unfortunately there are other elements included that don't work too well (like the love triangle between Kili, Legolas, and Tauriel that feels misplaced). The build up and the action scenes might be a bit too much for audiences, and ultimately the film fails to stand out from other epics. It is an average film that has its ups and downs, but still manages to bring closure. Unfortunately this trilogy never lives up to the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings."
"tmartin1438","6","6","12","16 December 2014"," Did Jackson Make This Cut to Deliberately Make us Buy the Extended Edition?
","Saw it last night as part of a 3- movie marathon the theater had. And I gotta say the ending disappointed me. Overall, the film felt like a video game with CGI- effects pointlessly muddling what could have been a good story. It was not bad, just not to the standard Jackson set for himself.<br/><br/>The film starts with a great setup with the confrontation of Smaug in Laketown, showing the utter destruction of the city and Bard heroically killing the beast. It gave a satisfying ending to Smaug, kills off Stephen Fry's Master spectacularly, and sadly spares his Russell Brand lookalike crony, who comes close to being the Jar Jar of the film. The film then resolves the Necromancer plot. Galadriel had a weird moment where she looked like the girl from the Ring (horror film) and smashes up Dol Goldur, chasing away Sauron. Some setup to Saurman being corrupted with a Palantir could have been beneficial. I mean they already milked the One Ring setup to death. <br/><br/>On to the conflict between the elves, men, and dwarfs. Thorin succumbs to dragonsickness and refuses to help anyone, including his kin from the Iron Hills. These scenes are great, especially the interaction between him and Bilbo. You felt Bilbo's guilt as well as Thorin's paranoia. Balin and Dwalin get some good screen time, but that's it for the Company. Bombur still has no lines at all, and some lovable dwarfs like Gloin and Bofur are forgotten. Instead we pointless scenes of Legolas and Tauriel. The scene with them going to Gundabad to confirm what everyone finds out anyway had no real purpose, and they pointlessly add back-story to Legolas' mother.<br/><br/>Tauriel did not bother me. She didn't ruin the film, it just felt like it took more time out of other characters' stories, ESPECIALLY Bard, Beorn, and Dain. The love story goes nowhere, but again doesn't end up being really detrimental. I was happy they left out a dramatic kiss scene, or any delusions (at least on Tauriel's part) that it could possibly ever work out. <br/><br/>The titular battle hampered the movie greatly. It completely lacked the emotional payoff present in Helms Deep or Minas Tirith that had lots of CGI, but enough practical effects to ground it. One issue was the orcs not being real people in makeup. I liked the beginning of it where the elves leap over the dwarf phalanx to begin the battle, but that was kind of it. There were giant worms thatdisappeared for some reason. The bats were OK, but added pretty much nothing except yet another stupid CGI Legolas scene. <br/><br/>This leads to the final ""epic"" duels of CGI. There was no moment where you felt this was real stunt-work. Counter that with Fellowship where a knife chucked at Aragorn in one scene was in fact a real knife that was chucked at the actor. Legolas' duel with Bolg should have been a lot shorter, and without Legolas. Legolas was not that important to the story. A much better, more emotional ending would have been Thranduil avenging the Line of Durin after Fili and Kili are killed. <br/><br/>Azog is a bit underwhelming as the Final Boss of the film after Smaug and Sauron. Really anybody could have been fighting Thorin, his death should have been with the main mêlée along with Fili and Kili like it was in the books. If they wanted the nice waterfall scene they could have had the army move there to confront the reinforcements (a sixth army technically?). It just felt strange that only a few characters went to face an obviously dangerous foe whose death could turn the tide while the characters in the other part of the battle were largely forgotten about. Thorin and Bilbo's final scene together was well done, despite not being that true to the books. Freeman and Armitage did great in their roles, and their scenes together were the redeeming factors of the film. <br/><br/>The ending's abruptness was the worst part of the film. The heart and emotional payoff that was in LOTR just was not there. It seems like it was all cut in favor of the over the top battle. Major questions are flat out ignored:<br/><br/>What became of the Arkenstone? Or the gold? Or the Elvish Jewels? Again, these questions and themes are touched upon but never really get any emotional payoff. There's never a scene where Dain and Thranduil at least come to terms on giving back the jewels he wanted, or the share of gold to the Men.There sorely needed to be that ""Hey you fought honorably, you're not so bad"" scene that shows the three races learned something at the end. What happens to Bard? In the books he becomes King of Dale and rebuilds with a share of the treasure. They sorely needed a Return of the King- like scene with everything rebuilt. If you make the first film almost three hours before even seeing Erebor you need to spend just as much time touching on the characters' story arcs! Actually showing Thorin's funeral could have rectified all this. Instead we get Legolas as the only character with closure besides Bilbo. Similar to ROTK where they cut out Saruman, I'm hoping some good character moments and unanswered questions will be addressed in the Extended Edition. Its almost like Jackson or the studio purposefully left things out to make us have to get the DVD's. <br/><br/>They thankfully kept in the auction scene when Bilbo comes home. The scene gave a glimpse of life in the Shire, which needed to be emphasized more. It was crucial to show the simple idyllic life of Hobbits in a larger world, and it's set up perfectly in LOTR. Jackson tried so hard to focus on the big elements that the small get lost in it. And that misses the point of Tolkien's works entirely."

","Peter Jackson's self-aggrandizing attempt to bloat a simple children's story to an epic fantasy tale in three parts culminates in an overlong battle scene only to puff out in mediocrity and stereotypes.<br/><br/>If the director chose to stay truth to the source material and left out all this fillers, he could have made an unique movie that consists only of two parts at the utmost and more importantly stands on its own instead of having this ""spin-off""-character of LOTR: why trying to copy and even surpass a legendary trilogy that was designed as such from the very beginning by inventing a kind of ""prequel"" based on a thin bedtime story that doesn't come even close to LOTR in every respect? Is Peter Jackson paying homage to Tolkien or just to himself as the master of battle choreography? <br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" was written first, so it's per definition not a prequel, it just happens to play before the events of LOTR, all this references in the movie are simply redundant and serve no other purpose than to satisfy a vain fan nostalgia, it has nothing to do with any real artistic ambitions. it's the pure exploitation of a franchise that comes along with the latest CGI technology. ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is worth seeing from a technical point of view since the visuals are topnotch, the little, poor rest of the plot that wasn't managed to be finished in the previous parts is somehow pressed in between the fights.<br/><br/>Let's face it, LOTR is far better."
"craig-hopton","8","4","7","19 October 2015"," Epic battles in Middle Earth
","I thought I might be a little bored of the franchise but no - this is yet another excellent and enjoyable Tolkein adaptation. Sadly it's likely to be the last.<br/><br/>Barring a slightly rushed start (surely the dragon could have been allotted a bit more air time?), this movie develops well into an epic clash of warring armies, setting the scene nicely for the battles for Middle Earth that come in the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The battles are extremely well done, from the large-scale army engagements, to an enthralling individual fight between Thorin and the Orc leader. (The Orcs by the way are surely one of the most expertly-crafted monsters in movie history.)<br/><br/>There is also a nice little dramatic scene midway through featuring Saruman, Elrond and Galadriel.<br/><br/>Superb stuff."
"reuben-hawkeye","10","4","7","12 September 2015"," Amazing movie overall
","Yes this movie did not live up to the expectations of many people,but this movie must not be compared to the lord of the rings.It is a movie of its own and a completely different storyline.It was a well crafted movie with great acting and amazing special effects and sound editing.The Hobbit brings its own tale and adventure of action and Peter Jackson presented it brilliantly on screen.Yes it has some flaws but Peter Jackson has brought another masterpiece to the film industry.So those people who are comparing every little detail you are wrong.Watch the hobbit in a whole new perspective and in a different mind set because it brings action,great battle scenes,great characters and an incredible end to the journey."

","Depending on whether you're thinking Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. Whatever the case, you can't fault the movie for its technical side. It looks beautiful, but that was to be expected. Having only read a quarter of the Hobbit novel (which was the first movie more or less, with some additions), I can't comment on the differences in this, though people have stated that some characters weren't in the books and are seen here (it shouldn't matter though).<br/><br/>I didn't like the fact that Jackson went for the ""1 girl, two lovers"" teen romance thing, but I guess you have to deal with some of those things and incorporate them into your movie. It's a good conclusion and it was a nice watch, which didn't feel like it was almost two and a half hours. You'll either love it or be bored by it"
"Spondonman","8","7","15","9 February 2015"," The best of the bunch but I'm looking forward to the next instalment
","Possibly perversely I enjoyed this instalment - but is that only because it's probably the last? I've more or less enjoyed all of Peter Jackson's extremely condensed Tolkien heavily-edited interpretations, usually less and none of them have inspired me to read the books. All of the films kept a lot of people in work, creative people and the banks happy and audiences mesmerised so in a sense it's a shame it has to end – couldn't they squeeze a quadrilogy of The Simarillion to keep the gravy train rolling?<br/><br/>It opens with a fiery flying monster getting his violent come-uppance amidst relentless carnage above Lake-town; then the title. I thought Smaug the magic dragon was a fantastic character, gone too soon. Then began the main carnage with a mix of rumbustious racism and feeble posturing from a motley assemblage of concrete stereotypes (the most glaring still being that perceived Ugliness equals Evil and so-called Betters have Brains). But if War Is Hell no one in here was to blame - the hundreds of men women and children who got themselves slaughtered in this film may have been consoled by that thought but I wasn't. I tend to mentally switch off during modern cgi cartoonery battle sequences but I would've missed most of this film if I had; and apparently it took up only one chapter of the original book. As with the five other films I wondered idly about the ancient hordes of workers, peasants and slaves that would have been required to build such mammoth cities and buildings – no one in the current Middle Earth seemed to be involved in creating anything, even food or clothes. As politicians and terrorists have always found it's easier to destroy than create, so film-makers always find viewers are more entranced by destruction (as a form of creation) than construction. It was nice to see oldë Christopher Lee kicking such violent ass, strange to glimpse giant worms used merely as plot-device escapees from Dune, weird to wonder of the true significance of the Arkenstone in the book as there was none in the film. However, it's a film of tremendous imagination and scope, small plot holes and non sequiturs are entirely understandable and forgivable.<br/><br/>Too many damn people died in here for me to care about any of the important characters who croaked, although even I would have been surprised if the littlest hobo hero had met his doom too. Overall, I'm still determined to never read the books but all being well I'll spend a week on a LOTR&H Fest sometime, with Part 7 being a night of silence - it might just make more sense to me if seen with the others in context, and before I've a chance to forget all that went before. We shall not see its like again, hopefully: the poignant end credit marathon sings it all."

"jpachar82","10","7","15","31 December 2014"," The End of the Beginning
","We may have seen one end of the story, but the story is far from over. For most of us Middle Earth fans, it's quite an adventure to see things from the eyes of a hobbit, but what does it look like from the eyes of the villain? Now that we have seen through one hobbit, it's time that we see from the rest of the story. These three movies set up for what is to come. We are told of ONE RING. We are told of the All-Seeing Eye that looks over Middle Earth ready to devour it. But there is something hidden in the darkness that is ready to pounce on its prey.<br/><br/>On September 21, 1937, J.R.R. Tolkien penned the great novel that we see today portrayed in movie form. His intentions were of faith, belief, values and the Cross. Tolkien was a Roman Catholic – he believed in right from wrong, death and life, good and evil. That is what he based his writings on. And that is what these movies portray. Not only was Tolkien a Christian but he converted his best friend, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, C.S. Lewis. But that has nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>At the helm of these great movies, the magic of Peter Jackson comes to life. Mr. Jackson has brought countless tales of hobbits, orcs, wizards and all creatures alike and also he brought a deity so terrible that even we crinch when we say his name, Sauron, better known to us as Satan. Every bit of these movies, every bit of the books has something to do with the Christian faith. But it doesn't stop there. Like the title says, the end of the beginning. Jesus said in Revelation 22:13, ""I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."" So you see this movie, this story may have something to do with movie cinematography, production, and makeup, but ultimately The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings will stand the test of time, not only throughout the literature, but ultimately throughout our lives until we finally meet our Mithrandir, Jesus Christ."

The actors all do incredible job, it proves to be more than just a fantasy adventure film, it's also about sinking into greed, and almost losing yourself, and what friends will go through for you.

"Johan-smedjebacka","7","7","15","18 December 2014"," Good action movie, bad Tolkien movie.
","Battle of five armies is by no means a bad movie, but making a battle over hour long based on few pages does not work perfect. The movie is called The Hobbit, but our dear Bilbo does not get enough screen time in this final installment, Legolas who was not even in the book gets even more. Of course it shows how Bilbo tries to prevent the war, but during the war Bilbo is not seen much.<br/><br/>The beginning is nearly perfectly done with Smaug attacking lake town, even if the scene with Bard shooting him is a bit stupid. Thranduil's arrival to Erebor is beautiful made and Thorins sickness of gold shows good but is maybe a bit dragged on. It is the battle itself which drags the points down a bit for me. Yes it was awesome to see Thorins cousin arrive with dwarfs into battle, but the orcs made with special effects was not that frighting and the battle got never the same feeling as for example the battle of Minas Tirith.<br/><br/>In this great battle where thousands fought we will see many scenes focused just on Thorin or Legolas fighting hundreds of orcs alone, why are these elite warrior orcs so bad in fighting? I don't get it and where are other dwarfs who could have helped Thorin and Legolas?<br/><br/>Last too some strange parts in the movie: Thranduil to Legolas go and seek Aragorn, wait what? Aragorn is not even born yet. The whoule part with Sauron is so unnecessary. His return in Lord of the Rings was meant to be a big surprise and does not need any preparing story. Only good thing with this extra from Jackson was that we got too see Saruman one more time. For me the love between Tauriel and Kili is not so big problem, even if the movie had done fine without it.<br/><br/>After all the movie includes some beautiful scenes with landscape and interesting battle scenes, but focuses too much time on 3-4 characters. Is it faithful to Tolkien? No. Is it a good action movie? Yes."
"alindsay-al","9","7","15","17 December 2014"," A fantastic film that marks the end of Middle Earth in the right way
","Now the original Lord of the Rings trilogy is easily one of my favourite trilogy's of all time and even though the Hobbit trilogy is a step down I have thoroughly enjoyed it and this film is a fantastic conclusion to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films. The premise of this film sees the Five armies of Middle Earth amassing on Erebor for their own reasons that creates an epic middle earth war. Now Martin Freeman is once again fantastic as young Bilbo Baggins with his performance being really likable and the most relatable protagonist in these films and his character is so likable it is unreal. The supporting cast is all fantastic with Ian Mckellen reprising his role as Gandalf The Grey and once again he is awesome and such a wise character that I love seeing him in action in all these films. The performance of the film though is definitely Richard Armitage as Thoran and his character really has great character development and his character arc is probably the most interesting of any character in this film and helps drive this film to another level. Another superb performance was Luke Evans as Bard and he really steps up in this film and his character becomes more important even though I thought he was forgotten about towards the end. There are also some other great cameos from past characters such as Legolas, Elrond and especially Saruman. The story involving Thoran's transformation is really interesting and seeing the different races fight is interesting. However, I do think this film has a lot of action and a bit less story to it that didn't help in this film. I also thought this film could have taken some different directions with some of the characters that would have helped the overall feel of the film. The script is great with all the dialogue feeling real and the emotion helping make this film feel more epic then it would have been. The style is just like the other middle Earth films and is just epic with the great visuals and also the great scores for the film. Overall this is a fantastic send off for this franchise and I really think if you have seen the others then go see this film."

","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Phenomenal! Sensational! Loved it! I was exhausted by the end due to painstaking details, non-stop death, and loss of beloved characters, but I loved it! Kudos to Peter Jackson, for his brilliant mind, creativity, and nigh to supernatural capacity to select actors who fit the bill for their respective roles. Shame on you people, who dislike this film because your life has no honor, no integrity, no moral values and you see these values and principles contained in this movie and it ticks you off. America the nation of shifting values, and shame on those who have mentally slammed the movie, well before watching it, your reviews mean nothing, just bias and hogwash. Shame on Hollywood for snubbing this film, this prequel, that's insanity, even with the number of quality films this year. It's like this...LeBron has won so many MVP's, voters start looking for another less qualified candidate, it's human nature to ignore talent, after a while. I mean how many of you are excited for three more of the Star Wars films, people get bored regardless of how well made the film is. And those of you who think Peter Jackson didn't give this Trilogy, as much effort as his previous Trilogy are delusional. At the end of this last movie in interviews, PJ looked so tired, I was afraid he was going to have a heart attack. The man is loaded with cash, more than he could ever spend, so this was about legacy, his legacy, the last thing he ever wanted was for this trilogy to damage the perception of his original LOTR trilogy. He was so afraid of this, he was rather reluctant to do the Hobbit and was the back-up, but everything happens for a reason, and know one else on earth could have done the Hobbit series justice. Another tidbit of psychology, I'm not saying Hobbit is better than Lord of the Rings, because it fell JUST short, taken as a three film set in my opinion, but in fairness, by Lord of the Rings obtaining LEGENDARY STATUS, globally and nationally, and having stewed in that glory for more than a decade, before the Hobbit came around, gave LOTR unrealistic and untruthful advantages. Just swap the places of Hobbit and LOTR, and see what would've happened in chronology. Did I hear the word, UNDERRATED, (for whichever trilogy came last), yes I did. However, I believe these biased perceptions, will erode with time, and true north will be discovered and each trilogy will have a fair and just perception, time levels the playing field for many under-appreciated things, including scientific discovery. I predict this gap will close over the next 5 years or so in viewers minds, but that even so, the Hobbit as splendid as it is will still fall a bit short, in my mind. <br/><br/>Having said that how much stronger is LOTR now that it has it has the Hobbit series, MUCH STRONGER, due in large part to Peter Jackson masterfully blending these stories together, mimicking one another in some respects, similar musical themes, similar characters etc. Oh you are thinking CGI! In ten years you'll love it, and consider the graphics in LOTR as inferior, my how time brings the truth forth, mark my words. <br/><br/>I want to share with you, some memories that for me personally, MOVED me emotionally. Scene with Smaug, Bard and Bain, With Bard slaying Smaug, and watching Smaug fly off in utter horror, at the realization he was going to die at the hands of those he was mocking. In some twisted way I was sad to see Smaug die, because he was so utterly charismatic in his agenda, which is miraculous considering he's a CGI character. Legolas deftly finishing off Azog's spawn (son), in a stage of both horror and rage, in a state of great personal danger to himself and those whom he loved. Kili's rage! Thorin's rage, and the manner in which he slew Azog, and the manner of both their deaths. The helplessness of Tauriel (yes I dare mention her) as she watched her ""crush"" die in front of her helpless eyes. Tranduil's brief conversation with Tauriel following the death of Kili. Bilbo's reaction and Thorin's final words as he passed away. Thorin and Kili's forehead to forehead moment, as they showed pride in the line of Durin. The torment of Thorin that lead up to him admitting to himself that he was ""losing it"" and his decision to help Dain fight Sauron's hoards outside the walls of Erebor, with Dain's warriors dropping like flies. I could go on and on and on. <br/><br/>I was drained by the end of the movie, due to all the emotion and violence, but after a night's sleep I realized why...the movie is insanely good! This is the final thing I'd like to say, which was better the Star Wars prequel, or the Lord of the Rings prequel? Which prequel made the ORIGINAL Trilogy stronger? I rest my case."

","This is without a doubt the best of the hobbit movies, and while its still not as good as any of the LOTR movies, its not far behind. The criticism against these movies are mainly from people expecting a new LOTR trilogy, which is unreasonable considering the hobbit being a much smaller and child-friendly book. Peter Jackson has really made the best out of the material from the book, and having read the book i cant really see how it could have been done any better. There's probably more happening in this third movie than in the two previous combined, and the dragon and war scenes are some of the highlights of the movie. Its also the funniest of all the middle-earth movies, with the obnoxious character Alfrid providing a lot of funny moments throughout the movie."

Lack of a scenic change (battle ground throughout)is another low note in this finale. 6. I am not in for spoilers. So,here's the thing. It's a pity that something like this should happen to someone so big, so soon (Go figure).<br/><br/>Where the battle was won: 1. CGI stands apart, be it when Smaug ravages Dale, or when elves gather outside Erebor in their shining golden armor, or when Galadriel and co fight shadow monsters it's CGI that makes the 3D glasses worth its while. 2. Unlike its predecessors this one goes easy on the viewers with a runtime of just 131 minutes(excluding the credits). 3. Legolas' duel stands apart for its choreography while Thorin's physical balance act with Azoc is another memorable moment. 4. Most impressive of all is how the Hobbit was placed in the middle of all this mess. He is, after all that he has been through, still a hobbit and not a hero. Peter Jackson could have just given him a blade (not the letter opener that he already has) and made him fight orcs. But rather the Hobbit is moving between camps, using the ring to the fullest and playing a vital part in the battle without actually fighting and thus justifying the title.<br/><br/>Having presented the pros and cons of the battle, I leave it to your better judgment to decide whether or not this battle is worth fighting (watching). <br/><br/>PS: People die, People with a capital P (duh it's a battle, what do you expect?)."

","The Battle of the five armies is more than just another blockbuster it delivers us the purpose and the heart of the story finally , this is the Hobbit movie we have been hoping for . It's bloody , dark & utterly excellent . This is a War story & the movie does not hang around the film opens exactly where part 2 ends with Smaug swooping down over Lake-town & laying waste to it with an incredible sequence . Up in the mountains the dwarfs look on racked with guilt as they have helped cause this horror . Even with the unbelievable battle going on you did not once loose track or concern of the various plot threads going on . Where the first film takes to long to get anywhere & the second film sagged between set pieces this film roars into life from the first frame & doesn't let up for a moment & ends quickly , satisfyingly , and on one perfectly well judged note . The special effects are spectacular and beautifully integrated . The acting particularly Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins is just extraordinary ! . The Battle of the Five Armies feels like the reason this trilogy exists , it is complete & exactly as it needed to be ."

","Peter Jackson leaves Middle Earth not with a bang, but with a dull thud. The first Hobbit movie was a disappointment to say the least but Desolation of Smaug definitely picked it back up again; it left me quite excited for Battle of Five Armies. Unfortunately, Smaug's rampage in this movie is nothing but a small blip and really should have been left in the second film. What follows is a very dull plot, dull characters (Thorin is one of the most annoying characters ever), dull acting and boring battle scenes that nearly had me falling asleep. This film was an absolute cash in and nothing more. They should never have stretched the Hobbit into three films. If only del Toro had directed the two part version he was originally lined up for... This was very disappointing."
"abhinav-s","3","8","18","29 December 2014"," Terrible end of the trilogy
","The only part I liked about this movie was the scene at Dol Guldur with Galadriel and Sauron and the reference to Sauron as the ""Servant of Morgoth"".<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie is a joke. The romantic story was tedious. The CGI was very obvious, ruining the fight scenes. The most painful scene to watch was the battle between Legolas and the Orc. Is Legolas invincible or something? He took hit after hit and came out unscathed. Again, the CGI ruined that fight.<br/><br/>So Kili, Fili, and Thorin die, yet no one seems to notice or care that they are dead? What happens to Tauriel? She just disappears, never to be heard from again.<br/><br/>Did the men and the elves get what they came for? They came for the gold and the jewels, yet nothing is explained.<br/><br/>Lastly, the Orcs are supposed to be proficient at fighting, yet they are killed easily by teenage boys who have never held a sword in their life and who are not wearing any armour.<br/><br/>It's still Middle-Earth, so it gets 3/10."
"SeamusMacDuff","3","8","18","29 December 2014"," Jackson and The Acorn
","The other reviews here are totally on point about how Jackson deviated from Tolkien's beautiful, charming story of a hobbit in creating a bloviated trilogy epic to mirror Lord of the Rings. (Where Jackson was superb.) In doing so, he created and brought in unnecessary characters, added banal dialog, inserted a stilted love story, and kept the CGI battles - single and mass - going on so long that viewer fatigue sets in. He forgot that Bilbo is the main character. And even with all the filler, many questions and elements of the ending in the book went unresolved.<br/><br/>There is a touching scene (in a movie with few) where Bilbo shows Thorin an acorn he brought from Beorn's garden to plant in his own in the Shire. At the end, Thorin tells Bilbo that the simple, warm things like home and hearth are worth more than all the gold in the world.<br/><br/>Would that Jackson had remembered this in directing The Hobbit."

","I'm always been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings Saga and then of The Hobbit, but this time, I must admit, I'm really disappointed! I know that there are commercial aspects to be considered, but why Peter, why? There was no value added with this movie to the story: just one big fat battle! After all the great movies that you, your fantastic team and cast brought to us, this is really how you want to end your amazing journey in the Middle-earth? Two movies for the Hobbit would be more than enough with a just normal sized battle! Now what can we expect with the extended version of the final chapter of The Hobbit? Let me guess .... more battle????"

","I have just recently watched The Hobbit The Incredible Journey and decided to jump straight in and watch The Battle of Five Armies and I wasn't disappointed. This film has everything for me, Adventure....Action....Despair....Humour and Jaw Dropping Special Effects. It would be easy for me to give Peter Jackson a big pat on the back for this movie. After all, he was also responsible for the Lord of the Ring movies. But I think he would be the first to acknowledge that movies of this magnitude can not be credited to one man. This is a well made movie with some big performances, none more so than Martin Freeman in the title role, who I don't mind saying had a lump in my throat on more than one occasion. If you look hard enough, you can probably find faults with any movie. As for me on this occasion, I just sat back enjoyed the ride."

","This was awful. The overuse of CGI made the whole movie seem fake, especially Legolas which looked like a drained-out meth addict throughout the whole flick. Did I mention Dain? No? WELL HE WAS ALSO HORRIBLE.<br/><br/>The movie moves at a pace which is hard to follow and jumps from story to story at the speed of light. Once the battle starts it feels as though the animators was in such a rush they just threw CGI on a wall, shaped it into a somewhat dwarf/orc/elvish form and smashed their heads on the keyboard hoping it would come out good. It didn't.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the LOTR movies and the books do NOT watch these movies. I honestly feel like an idiot having wasted my time and hoping this would be better than the previous flicks. Peter Jackson completely destroyed this story and should be suspended from ever having anything to do with CGI or the Tolkien universe again which sucks since he did such a good job with the LOTR movies.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot dedicate more than this time of my life to writing about it. Please Mr.Jackson..go back to the void from which you came and DO NOT attempt Silmarillion. Please..I beg you."
"GusF","Null","5","10","19 January 2015"," An excellent conclusion to the Middle-earth saga
","Considering how disappointed that I was with ""The Desolation of Smaug"", I was more than a little apprehensive about watching this film. I needn't have worried as it was a hugely engrossing, excellent film, the best of the trilogy which ends the Middle-earth saga on a high. While it's certainly not on the same level as any of the films in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, that's true of 99% of the films that I've seen. <br/><br/>My only real problem with the film was that Kíli and Tauriel were built up as being star crossed lovers for the ages when they spent about five minutes in each other's company over the course of two films. It seemed more like they fancied each other as opposed to being truly, madly, deeply in love, to be honest. That said, their scenes are lovely and Evangeline Lilly - who was far less annoying than she was in the few ""Lost"" episodes that I've seen - and Aidan Turner have great chemistry.<br/><br/>The action scenes look wonderful and the acting was generally of a very high standard. Aside from the film series' veterans such as Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Cate Blanchett (the only actor other than McKellen to appear in all six films), I was particularly impressed by Ryan Gage as Alfrid, Luke Evans as Bard and Aidan Turner as Kíli. I loved the cameos from Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving, both of whom were absent from the previous film after appearing in all of the first four (or at least the extended versions thereof), as well as Stephen Fry and Billy Connolly. I was also far more impressed with Smaug in this film since he actually spent more time doing what dragons do and spent less time yakking. A major part of the reason that Smaug worked better in this film was that he had less screen time. Less is more as far as dragons are concerned."
"aligokhanozyildiz","9","5","10","18 January 2015"," an appropriate end
","This will be a short commentary to make it simple for you; no matter what other says, it'd be 'hard' to make it from the story of a film that is so simple; and P.J. was managed it adroitly. 'Hobbit' was totally a shortly written book for children, but scenario from the book was not 'exaggerated' in any episodes. Before criticizing, think about it; there is no more movie that could be compared with P.J. series.<br/><br/>But of course, to be honestly, there are two negative elements in my mind about the series; 1. not meeting the great expectations (this comment is for 'Desolation of Smaug' only) 2. end of the middle earth (end of epic fantasy). If we're talking for last episode only, without doubt, it would be unfair to pass the praise of fight scenes - especially Elrond and Saruman's vs nine kings - it was totally an upgrade, even for P.J. As in the first film - i can not say it for the second one - the soul of middle earth could be felt all throughout the film.<br/><br/>Finally without comprising with LOTR, this movie end all this series were undoubtedly have taken its place in the history of cinema.."
"iceflyier","4","5","10","12 January 2015"," Really not worth it.
","It's the first time I've ever reviewed here, and I can quite honestly say that reading the reviews on IMDb is much more entertaining than watching the movie itself. And that's all I really want to say on the subject.<br/><br/>...but since there's a minimum of 10 lines, I will attempt to condense my annoyance at the movie into these sentences. I couldn't even get angry at how poorly the movie was executed and how it wasted nearly three hours of my life that I'll never get back. Mild annoyance bordering on ridicule is really all I can manage. Although I've been a die-hard fan of the books ever since I was 5, I'm not one of those people who quibbles about book-movie discrepancies. I respect and enjoy movie adaptations as works unto their own right. So here it it: BOTFA was just one huge steaming mess of a film, and (this is a huge understatement) a terrible, terrible grand finale. The first one was horrendous, the second one I enjoyed immensely (I'm going to admit that I really enjoyed Tauriel's character in the second movie to be honest), so I didn't really know what to expect for this one. I think most of the other reviewers here have covered the numerous things that irked me, but my biggest pet peeve is that there just wasn't any closure. All the main characters and plots we'd been obliged to invest emotionally in (although this too is debatable) just disappeared in the end. The gold that everyone had been fighting for was unresolved, the deaths were unmourned, Dain and Bard were not crowned kings, Tauriel's last scene was her cradling Kili's dead body and crying, we never saw what happened to weaselly and entirely unnecessary Alfrid...the list just goes on and on. 4 stars are for Richard Armitage, Martin Freeman and Sir Ian McKellan, who despite their best efforts were unable to save this train wreck, and also the fact that I enjoyed the eye candy in this film (Yes, I'm a woman in her early twenties). <br/><br/>Again, reading the IMDb reviews here trashing the movie provides much more entertainment value than the movie itself. I'm even tempted to do a ""Choice Reviews"" compilation and post it here."
"caseynicholson","8","5","10","2 January 2015"," Perhaps the Best of the Trilogy
","""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is the final chapter of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, and this particular film tells the last three or so chapters of J.R.R. Tolkien's book of the same name.<br/><br/>For those who are fans of the book, one thing that will quickly stand out is that the movie takes great liberty with the book, inasmuch as Peter Jackson has made an entire feature length film out of a story that was told in a relatively succinct fashion by Tolkien. Jackson's work expounds on the story that Tolkien left us with, going into much more detail with character development and the story of the battle of the armies itself in this film.<br/><br/>That being said, though, the movie does all of this in a way that is true to the original source material. I didn't feel as though I was watching something that was untrue to Tolkien, but instead a movie that was made to put meat on the skeleton of a story that Tolkien had left us with in the final chapters of ""The Hobbit"".<br/><br/>The question does arise as to whether the movie is good overall. It's an especially poignant question to ask given that this film is actually getting more scrutiny from reviews and ratings than its two predecessors. I personally would strongly disagree with those assessments. I found ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" to be on par with, if not better than, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", both of which are much more enjoyable movies than the initial film in the series, ""An Unexpected Journey"". ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is arguably still the best of the three films, but ""Five Armies"" tells an engaging tale that caps off the series nicely and left me feeling very pleased with the trilogy overall.<br/><br/>Perhaps the weakest part of the film, I felt, was the foreshadowing of Jackson's other Tolkien-inspired trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings"" from a decade ago. ""Five Armies"" tries to set up that separate tale (of which ""The Hobbit"" movies are prequels) by showing a battle between Sauron vs. Gandalf and others. This battle (a brief scene that diverges from the rest of the movie) suffers from a poor special effects technique that culminates in an odd light show on the screen for a few moments. Still, this doesn't ruin the overall film.<br/><br/>Again, for me this movie may be the best of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. It certainly is worth watching, and certainly deserves to be rated more favorably than its ""Unexpected Journey"" prequel. I'd give it 8 out of 10 stars."

"SebastianT-L","9","5","10","29 December 2014"," A great ending to and amazing trilogy
","The first Hobbit film was good, a little bit slow. The second Hobbit film was amazing with great adventure and action. The defining chapter was a great and deserving ending to the prequel of LOTR. <br/><br/>When the film starts off with Smaug destroying Laketown, most people thought that those first ten minutes of Smaugs final moments should have been in the 2nd film. Well I thought that as well, even having just the 2 films as originally planned, but at the ending of the 2nd film it leaves you in suspense, wanting to see whats happens next, causing you to want to see the next one. And as thought out, thats what Peter Jackson wants. So I thought it was a great start to the film, even though Smaug is only in it for the first ten minutes. The 45 min battle sequence was great with some minor gripes such as the CGI. CGI was used way too much and would have been much better with using real people like LOTR. Gandalf for once wasn't rescued by eagles, but by the White Council, which was good for a change. The battle between Elrond and Saruman vs the nazgul was one of my favorite scenes in the entire film. Again many changes from the book, but I'm not a book purist so the changes I didn't mind. <br/><br/>Overall a great ending to the final middle earth trilogy directed by Peter Jackson (or at least I think so?)."

","I remember the days when I was just a kid in my brother's room, watching LoTR on VCR and boy was it amazing! The whole reason I love Middle Earth were because of the movies that Peter Jackson made. Now, when news spread out about Peter Jackson making a Hobbit movie, i was very excited! I was excited about the moments between Bilbo and the many main Characters (Smaug, Smeagol, Thorin etc) but most of all the Battle of Five Armies.<br/><br/>Now, in some ways these expectations were met throughout the trilogy. However, the added fillers and the cutting of important roles really affected the movie(s) overall. <br/><br/>The last movie of the Hobbit Trilogy doesn't improve on any of this at all. Furthermore, the movie is trying to be too many things at once, it cant decide to be either a light hearted fantasy movie or a serious (LoTR) style movie and the movie(s) suffer because of that.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Lets get to the positives of this movie because there are some.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>The relationship between Bilbo and Thorin is done amazingly well. The chemistry between the characters and the ""feels"" you get are great! You really feel Thorin change as a character and how he is in many ways similar to heroes in Shakespeare where they do have weakness and evil in them. However, there isn't enough of this in the movie and I wish there was more as these moments were my favorite in the movie.<br/><br/>Smaug destroying Laketown was a spectacle to behold, it really was a beautifully made action scene. The massive size of Smaug, with the assistance of Bennedict Cumberbatch with his voice really made the scene that much better. However, the scene was a bit short, especially since we had to wait 2 full Hobbit movies to actually get to it, it really just felt anticlimactic due to all the suspense that the other Hobbit movies put on this one sequence.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Dwarf and Elf as a relationship DOESN'T WORK!!! There were so many moments where I would just cringe (not because of the acting) but because of how poorly written the romance was.<br/><br/>Is this a movie that is supposed to be taken seriously like LoTR or is it supposed to be more ""fun"" because obviously the movie cant decide between the two. At moments the movie is ""serious"" trying to link this trilogy with the LoTR trilogy using more ""realistic"" gritty scenes, similar to LoTR. But then there are ""funny"" scenes that in no way help link this movie to LoTR. There are scenes where (similar to the barrel riding in Desolation) it's so unrealistic that it's stupid. For example there was Thorin's cousin who would literally head butt his enemies...like wtf? or when Thorin and his cousin would literally in the middle of the war shake hands and have greetings...<br/><br/>The last Con would be the war itself...it was such a disappointment. Beorn gets literally 5 secs of screen time, the main fights between Thorin, Filli, Killi, Azog etc are separated from the actual war unlike LoTR. this really just kills the moment of an actual war for me. Oh and they don't use rams to break through walls.....they use trolls with big metal helmets that head butt themselves into the wall.....are u serious? ha ha funny...<br/><br/>Due to the Redeeming qualities of this movie, i would give it a 6/10 but I would still recommend to give this movie a try."

","This trilogy as a whole does not even reach half the level of the LOTR one. Again, Hollywood's greed took over and gave us an unnecessary three films out of one book. And the result is a long series of 'joyride' scenes, a couple of fights, and some isolated conversation scenes to form an incoherent trilogy that will not stand the test of time very well.<br/><br/>This last Hobbit chapter is filled with characters that you won't feel anything towards by the end. A love story that never was written by Tolkien. And a movie title war that doesn't feel half as intense as Helms Deep. Funnily enough. Aside from Bilbo. Alfred, who is the most pointless character in the film, was the most realized.<br/><br/>To me. This is not a movie trilogy. It's more of a game trilogy with Peter hogging the joystick to himself! You feel excited watching people play the first level. Get bored by the second. Then fell asleep by the third level. And in this trilogy, we the audience are mere watchers. We don't feel like we're apart of this joyride like we did in LOTR. In a sense, I see this trilogy as a slightly higher quality Transformers movie. You're watching for the adrenaline roller coaster, nothing else.<br/><br/>Two films would have sufficed Mr. Jackson. But I guess Bilbo(PJ) was corrupted by the ring after all. And greed has indeed reached the Shire(NZ)."

","This final installment of the Hobbit trilogy started strong. As a big Tolkein fan I enjoyed the background in this film - would be interesting to see a supercut of just these parts from each installment. So far: visually stunning, a great experience and a clever film.<br/><br/>However the minute the battle was reached the film fell down. The opening 10 minutes was very 'Lord of the Rings'-esque, brutal fantasy and a the Jackson we came to love. But it lost its way, the following 40minutes of battle was completely confused and lost with little to no dialogue, character development or plot that didn't feel entirely predictable. Heroics and characters became one dimensional superheroes, gratuitous and self indulgent. <br/><br/>In summary: 6/10 for a solid blockbuster but a good LOTR film, cheapened and lacking the class of Jackson's previous real visual effects."
"moviescoundrel","8","5","10","18 December 2014"," Battle Royale
","My expectations for this film where that it would be as good of a closer to the Hobbit as ""LOTR: Return of the KIng"" was to the LOTR trilogy and an adequate transition to the LOTR trilogy. I hoped it would not drag as much, and there would be enough action and important character screen time. While it has been awhile since I've seen ""LOTR: Return of the King"" in its entirety, upon first reflection this installment succeeds. I could not believe how FAST this movie flew by, which is always a great thing when a movie has a 2.5 hr run time. After starting the film off with a confrontation between the dragon and Laketown residents, Jackson sets up the looming ""battle"" by putting the armies in place. While there are things that are a bit far fetched here in Middle Earth, it works for the most part, because fans of the book and the movies eventually are going to get what they want. HUGE battle scenes, MASS amounts of destruction, and LARGE numbers of dead orcs. It's just a matter of getting there. It doesn't make sense that 12 dwarfs hold up in the castle abandoned by the dragon and feel confident enough that reinforcements will eventually arrive, or that the elves or Laketown residents don't overpower them sooner and force their hand, as it seems quite obvious the dwarfs have no countermeasures available other than a few feet of busted stone between them and whoever else wants to enter. This felt off. Another thing that felt off was Thoren's (Armitage) intrinsic greedy struggle with possession of gold. No matter the situation, person, or conflict, Thoren seems determined to stay within his stronghold and not negotiate any amount of settlement or riches. I feel this conflict and struggle could have been portrayed a bit better, as it was just never that realistic to me, although it is sometimes difficult to show internal struggle. When Thoren does become the charismatic leader he usually is, the movie is all the better for it, even though if it's only to fight brainless orcs. Another detail that was interesting and a bit far fetched was the details of the battle. The battle was between five armies apparently. We don't see all five for awhile, and when the fifth shows up we don't get a very good glimpse of the actual battle, just some things happening quickly and from afar. Also, the dwarfs and elves were in this battle and we didn't get to see much of them in action. We see them lined up and in armor and marching, but as far as actually fighting, there's not much footage of them. We see the people of Laketown fighting, but apparently filming small dwarfs or cunning elves is a bit too complicated here. I was curious to see how the elvin people actually fight after seeing their leader and Legolas (Bloom) in action, but alas, no such luck. The orc armies this time around don't seem as detailed as they were in the LOTR films. They are covered in armor and in most scenes we see dwarfs, humans, etc. having no issue taking these monsters down. Not as graphic or gross as we see later in LOTR films It's like each person, dwarf, etc. has been trained in extreme mortal kombat and they know exactly where to strike for a quick kill and each swing gives them more strength for the next. Maybe minor quibbles, as I said, this film goes quickly. The battle is entertaining. Once Thoren and Legolas finally get into action, I could not get enough, and the choreography and special effects were top notch. When the battle finally ends I thought for sure the film had another hour to go, but there was only a 12 minute wrap up of things. As opposed to ""LOTR: Return of the King"" which had at least a half hour going away party. Definitely doesn't feel as painful here. While there were some minor quibbles, the characters you appreciated from the first two Hobbit films are here again and the action is a plenty, this is definitely one I'm going to have to catch again in IMAX."

","(Extremely slight spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>It's hard to judge movies without regards to your expectations and the possible quality of said movie. Therefore I won't try. The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is a climax stretched out far too long, walking in tonal limbo, with no discernible point. <br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings were movies suited to Peter Jackson's style of filmmaking, dramatic and epic both. I believe something similar could have been done with the Hobbit. However, it's as if Jackson (and the rest of the team involved, from actors to editors to writers) really aren't sure of what they want to do with the movies. It feels unpolished. The movie, for all the epicness it attempted, barely spans two days. It feels like a first draft. There was no reason to care about any characters. They gave you none. It's not enough to stick a character in the midst of an explosion; you need to care about that character. George Lucas once said that a visual effect, on it's own, is boring (oh my). Though the visuals of the Hobbit: TBOFA pleased me (colours, camera-work etc. and not the CGI), the enormous events/battles/falling stones are of little value. <br/><br/>I have read the book many times. I have also seen Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit: The book is an enjoyable piece of fiction, one that is best enjoyed near a fireplace, with hot chocolate in your spare hand. The Lord of the Rings is a series of movies where you are taken on a spectacular, moving adventure. The Hobbit: TBOFA is a movie I went to see because I felt I had to, and then went home to write a scathing review about. <br/><br/>I simply expected more from a filmmaker who has previously proved himself working with very workable scource material. More could have been done with a giant budget and good actors. Therefore I give the movie a 5."
"sunsparkles11","10","9","22","18 December 2014"," What is everybody's problem with this film?!
","Firstly, I want to say this film developed its characters exceptionally well with stellar performances by Freeman and Armitage. Okay, the film didn't exactly follow the book but where would the creativity be if it did? This film was an incredibly fitting end for the trilogy and the deaths of certain characters really tugged on the heartstrings. The effects were stunning with a large use of CGI; many reviews state the film was a ""disappointment"" yet this isn't justified. This film defines Peter Jackson and his ability to turn a beautiful book into a beautiful movie. So just enjoy the Battle of the Five armies for what it is: exceptional."

","After the first Hobbit movie I had high hopes that this trilogy isn't that bad. It was a decent picture. With "" The Desolation of Smaug"" my hopes and expectations were scaled down, but in my opinion it was okay. Whereas ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" disappointed me in many ways.<br/><br/>With almost nothing important to tell there are so many scenes just filling the long hours. The ridiculously bad cut relief of Gandalf, about ten attempts of the coward character not to fight in battle or Thorins (well played) struggle with himself also told in to many ways only to be dissolved by talking to himself in a talk to myself- cliché.<br/><br/>With Kili, Fili and Thorin the only three dwarfs die, which I remembered from the first two movies. On one hand that was a good idea to find some emotions in the viewer (someone watched enough game of thrones), but with the unlikely love story, that comes out of nowhere, it was a bit over the top in my opinion.<br/><br/>It is like it always was. Better graphics (which looked very poor and not believable in my opinion) doesn't cover up for bad storytelling. In fact there were so many situations without sense, that the characters had to tell how they feel and what happened and what will happen, so the viewer doesn't miss the turnarounds. (This is Bard. He killed the Dragon. I saw it. Now he is our leader, because our former leader died)<br/><br/>Besides some stupid lines, they had to do, I think that the acting (except for Orlando Bloom as Legolas) was very good and made my giggle some time, although the Jokes were very predictable.<br/><br/>All in all I think, that two movies would have made it well. Everything after Smaugs dead just disturbed me with its trifle.<br/><br/>Oh and Bilbo kills Orcs which are specially described as ""created"" or ""trained"" for battle by throwing stones at them. Come on!"

","Frequent unwarranted comic relief, horrible and cringe inducing romantic subplots, strangely questionable CGI, Billy Connolly appearances and a sense of deja-vu, yes indeed ladies and gentleman, hobbits and orcs, the finale to our life in Middle Earth and the supposedly grand farewell to 3 years of meandering Hobbit entries is a massive misfire and solid evidence that something from the get go was a tad NQR about Peter Jackson's follow up to the spectacular and accomplished Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>You'd be hard pressed to find vehement defenders of the Hobbit series and that is for good reason. From the moment that we all knew the seemingly short source material was turned into a 3 part trilogy many questioned just how the simple story of Bilbo (once more played by Martin Freeman well but not memorably) and his adventures with a bunch of dwarfs we can't remember the names of could possible be padded out into 3 two hour plus movies. The first entry into the series was validation for concerns that fans had then the second installment showed enough promise that we were justified in being excited for this last epic hurrah that is sadly such a non-event that you truly wonder if anyone will remember it in 10 or even 5 years time.<br/><br/>While we may have been well and truly spoiled with the LOTR series there is still no excuse for the often shoddy and amateurish way the Battle of the Five Armies comes together. After a promising start the film quickly descends into an arduously plotted film with even more atrocious scripting and it feels like once and for all that Jackson knew not what to do with the material at his disposal. After three films we still feel no real affiliation with Bilbo or any of the countless barely registering dwarfs and the whole film feels like it's just waiting for the battle to commence and when it does what a let down it is.<br/><br/>What should be something that matches the large scale carnage that flowed through the Two Towers and Return of the King is instead punctured by some worryingly laughable CGI, more delving into romantic subplots, oh and a man dressed as a women because that is exactly what we need to see when 5 vicious armies have gathered to do battle. It's a real shame that this meeting of foes is such a let down as small moments in this battle showcase just what could've been or perhaps just remind us that whatever Jackson was trying to do here, his done before and done it much better.<br/><br/>One eyed fans and those that merely wish to be reminded of past glories may find great pleasure in watching this last entry into a once great franchise but all those with their eyes open and brain switched on will be sadly disappointed in a film that will be quickly lost in time. Some good will from the glories of old save this film from the depths of one star failures.<br/><br/>2 ridiculous mountain goats out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","I did not enjoy this movie at all. Unfortunately, when you take what is a short section of a book, and try to turn it into an exceptionally long movie, what you end with is not worth watching.<br/><br/>As an avid Hobbit fan (the book), I've watched the first two with trepidation. Usually after watching the movie, we dissect the deviations from the book, and whether or not they were useful. And then ask my siblings (who've not read the books) how the movies fared as a movie, not as a book adaption. With the first two, the response is usually ""They were good"" from non-book readers, and from book-readers, it was a case of ""they were okay, should have stuck more to the actual story and not add in random characters"" With this final movie - all of us agreed that the movie sucked. 20 minutes into the movie, the climax happens (smaug is killed), and then you are left with a very long, drawn out, boring battle. Now all of the movies (hobbit and LOTR) have moments where you think ""yeah right, as if that could happen"", but given that they're fantasy, you let it slide. The Battle of 5 Armies has so many of those moments that it's impossible to actually do much other than roll your eyes the entire movie.<br/><br/>Death scenes should not be drawn out so long either. I'm watching a movie, not going to the opera where people take 30 minutes to die.<br/><br/>And if you add in a female character to balance out the male-ness of the movie, don't then transform her from a strong warrior into a sobbing love-ridden, useless girl.<br/><br/>All in all - this movie was a waste of time. Such a disappointment. Jackson would have been better cutting out 2 hours of this movie, and having 30 minutes added to the end of the last one. That would have been sufficient!"

","This movie was so anticlimactic that it's not even funny to mention. Seeing Smaug eliminated so early in the movie even before we see its title seems this should have been more of a made for TV rather than the big screen. Then Galadriel standing down Sauron so yet again so early to save Gandalf. The rest of the movie kinda went downhill even with the warring factions it just lost its essence, it just deteriorated nothing to build up to really. Minimal tension as to what may happen to our heroes except when Thorin realizes what he must do. Still like I said anticlimactic, disappointing and dare I say it boring!<br/><br/>Again what plagues this pseudo-trilogy is the fact Mr. Jackson needed to appease investors and greedy money-hungry mongers not unlike the monsters one sees in The Lord of The Rings that this has been a total deception. It should have been just 1-film thus sustaining the integrity of the work and Mr. Jackson's reputation.

","Great ending to a well done trilogy. I, like many others, had read The Hobbit and realized some differences from the book to the movies, but what movie has replicated a book perfectly? I thought this was a fantastic ending! Not a dull moment in the movie, everything kept moving but it was not too quick. Twist after twist! Just when you thought that the Dwarfs and the Elves were going to have it out, an army of Orcs shows up! As goofy as this sounds, and if you have read the books it makes sense, but I'm glad that Thorin died. When it comes to things that should have killed somewhat but didn't, I become a bit of a stickler. When Thorin got up after taking a sword to the chest, I became worried but later on when he passed, so did my uneasiness. Another thing that caught me off guard was those goat like creatures that Thorin and some of the other dwarfs found and road off. Not sure if Thorin's cousin brought them or if they were just there. Im not sure if in the book that Legolas was sent by his father to go find Strider or if that was just added but I think it was kind of a weak stretch to connect the Hobbit with the Lord of the Rings. I did enjoy how it ending, feeding right into the Fellowship of the Ring."
"just_for_movies","9","6","13","17 December 2014"," Epic, intense, and dramatic
","Having read the book and having seen the first two movies, I cannot say how overly excited I was to see the last installment in this trilogy. I saw it as early as possible and I'm quite glad I did. The movie starts with an intense action packed scene that has some very impressive visuals. Then we get some peaceful time with a little character development and dialogue. After that the real stuff begins. The battle is epic and huge and long. Tons of CGI and mind blowing visuals. It's very intense and dramatic but really fun to watch. Some emotional scenes follow that and then we get a nice and peaceful ending. As always Peter Jackson does a fine job directing another ambitious project. I've always felt that the cast in the Hobbit trilogy couldn't have been better, and in this movie they prove that; great performances by all. The story and plot are good but you really have to watch all the movies because without the others, this one doesn't make much sense (it's still enjoyable though). Finally, as I have said before, the visual effects are really quite stunning on this movie.<br/><br/>I do have a few gripes though. The opening scene could have been much longer, they could have focused more on Bilbo, the ending of the battle and such could have been more clear and efficient, and some characters farewells could have been better. Other than that though, this movie was one of the best movies of the year. The whole cast and crew did an awesome job on these movies and I just want to thank them for inspiring me in many ways. This trilogy has been very fun to watch and enjoy and I look forward to watching it many times again."
"3xHCCH","6","6","13","16 December 2014"," Not the Spectacular Finale We Expected
","December 16, 2014<br/><br/>Even for the past two installments of this film franchise, I have been wondering why the title is ""The Hobbit"", when the main story had really been more about Dwarfs. In this film, the chief Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield and his internal conflict was the central plot around which the other stories revolved. Even the Elves Legolas and Tauriel had more scenes than our solitary hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. The only scenes Bilbo totally owned for himself were those in the last five minutes.<br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes, Smaug, the dragon who attacked Laketown at the end of Part 2, was already down and out of the story. For the rest of the 134 minutes running time of this film, we will be watching battle after battle among various armies trying to gain control of the massive trove of gold that Smaug left behind in his old lair in Erebor. <br/><br/>Because Thorin was overcome with madness from ""dragon sickness"", he refused to peacefully negotiate with the Humans (led by the Bard) and the Elves (led by Thranduil). This eventually leads to war -- a five-way battle along with two groups of vicious evil Orcs (led by Azog) and finally, the Great Eagles (with Radagast and Beorn). After the conclusion of the battle, Bilbo finally returns back to his home in Bag End after 11 years.<br/><br/>If you have seen the past two episodes, the level of acting of the cast is basically the same. Nothing so spectacular, nothing so bad. Richard Armitage does very well in the lead role of Thorin. He imbues the character with dignity and honor, despite his initial turn to the dark side. Other actors who stood out were Aidan Turner as the lovestruck dwarf Kili, and Luke Evans as the Dragonslayer Bard. Aside from seeing Ian McKellen again, it was also good to see a lot of cameos from the original LOTR series, like Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Ian Holm.<br/><br/>For a film that is basically all computer-generated effects, the quality of these effects in a lot of key scenes were rather disappointing. There was a scene of Dwarfs riding goats up a rocky mountain that really looked fake. The scene where Legolas hitched a ride on a bat in flight was snicker-inducing. The worst was the scene where Legolas was climbing up rocks as they were falling down from a crumbling bridge. The CG was so bad, it looked like Legolas was running up in thin air.<br/><br/>Speaking from the point of view of a non-LOTR fanatic, this whole Hobbit film franchise could have been just one big film or maybe two. Even if it was interesting and engaging, the story felt too overstretched when director Peter Jackson decided to make it into a three film series. The expectations for a truly spectacular finale in this film was not really met fully because this had been marred by some poor visual effects. Despite this lengthy storytelling, this film felt a bit incomplete. There was no scene telling us the aftermath of the battle, nor the fate of the gold, which was the main cause of the war.<br/><br/>I felt that the second film, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was the best of the trilogy. It had the best part of the story, the best action sequences and the best special effects of the three. Anyhow, the tying- in of certain details in this film to the first LOTR film though makes me want to watch that first series all over again. 6/10."
"vaderis","7","6","13","14 December 2014"," Pretty good but certainly not good enough
","Compared to any standard action movie, The Battle of the Five Armies is pretty good. The action sequences are fast paced, the CGI is above medium and the music is somewhat epic.<br/><br/>But this is no standard action movie! This is a high budget movie based on the absolutely wonderful universe of J.R.R. Tolkien. There are so many things you can do and so many stories to tell. The cast is great, the production crew is experienced. What could possibly go wrong? Well, quite a lot actually:<br/><br/>Just to mention a few: - What is up with Legolas being a superhero? If he was over the top in LOTR he is Superman in BotFA - Why does the CGI armies look like CGI armies and not just armies? Surely they could have looked better. The CGI looked way better in 2001 (The Fellowship of the Ring) - Is that love story with the random elf lady, Legolas and Kili really necessary? It comes off as an annoying cliché - And what is up with that elf lady? First of all she falls in love with a dwarf (which is unheard of: Gimli ADMIRED Galadriel and that was shocking! He was even called Elf-friend and Lockbearer because this was so unique). Second of all she threatens her own king with a bow when he commands his army to fall back. I could go on, but her behaviour is simply anti Tolkien. - Where is the army of wargs? Peter Jackson removed them!! (Instead he gave us the worms from Dune because he misread Tolkien) - What is up with the bats and the eagles just appearing for 2 seconds and doing nothing? - What is up with Beorn being dropped from an eagle and killing orcs for 2 seconds, then disappearing? - What is up with Beorn NOT turning the battle, picking up the wounded Thorin and killing the orc leader (like in the book)? Why change it? - What is up with the rams suddenly appearing? - Why do the dwarfs charge into battle without their plate armour? And why do they even make a difference when there are already hundreds of dwarven warriors who are actually wearing heavy armour? - Where does Dain go after the battle. He is the new king for crying out loud!! - And what the heck is up with the cowardly Alfrid acting like a clown every two minutes?<br/><br/>I can accept some changes when a book is adapted into a film. But the changes in BotFA are simply unnecessary. Why ruin a perfectly good story with ridiculous buffonery and over the top matrix-like maneuvers? Why not show Thorin as the old noble dwarf he was in the book? Why not show Dain as the king he was in the book? Why not include the wargs like in the book? Why not show Beorn fighting like he did in the book? All those things would not make the film worse: The film would be better! But still Peter Jackson and his script writers chose to ignore them and instead include clowns, interracial love triangles and matrix-like action. It's a shame."

"russellingreviews","6","7","16","17 December 2014"," Are you entertained?
","""Are you not entertained?"" - Gladiator <br/><br/>     The book was published in 1937 and it is hard to believe that it has taken this long to come to the conclusion of the The Hobbit films. It would have been hard for anyone to miss the 13 year cinematic journey of The The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, but here is the brief summary of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The film continues the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the world of Middle Earth. In the process of reclaiming their homeland from the Dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch), the band of dwarfs unwittingly unleash and enrage the dragon. In his fiery rage, he lays waste to the community of Lake- town. Through the battle for the town, Bard (Luke Evans) becomes the champion and leader of the human colony and subsequently must defend it from the various armies that come to fight for the contents of the mountain. Due to Smaug's defeat, the mountain is left without its guardian and battle lines begin to form outside the Lonely Mountain.  The elves, humans and dwarfs assume that they all have claim to many of the treasures held inside. As the battle cries unfold outside the mountain, an internal battle grows in the multitude of rooms and within the treasury of the reclaimed dwarf homeland. Thorin's desire to hold onto his the kingdom and its wealth comes at the expense of the relationships with his countrymen and Bilbo. The hobbit attempts to reason with the dwarf king and his loyal men, but cannot defend against the internal battles of the king. This leads to a desperate act by the halfling that leads to the centrepiece of the upcoming battle. In the meantime, Sauron has sent forth legions of Orcs in a stealth attack upon the Lonely Mountain. As the tensions rise and the Orc invaders show their numbers, the dwarfs, elves and men must decide to battle one another or to band together for the sake of the mountain and their lives. Bilbo finds himself in the middle of the battle for Middle Earth, his life and the lives of his friends in this final instalment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy.      <br/><br/>You may ask, 'Why quote the classic Ridley Scott film at the beginning of the review?' For all of the loyal fans of the books, The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, you will need to ask the ""Are you not entertained?"" Those who have read the original book and eventual trilogy and know the changes made to the story will roll their eyes as many times as orcs heads roll in the film. Jackson's adaptation of the original book would even have been taxing for his most loyal of fans, but in the end it was entertaining. If there is a bright light in the series  it is the strength of Bilbo's character and the acting abilities of Martin Freeman. He will go down in cinematic history as the true Bilbo Baggins. Freeman managed to maintain a level of excellence that lifted many of the weaker characters. As in the book, Bilbo is the smallest character in stature, but is larger than life in the story and in the lives of the all who meet him. Realistically, the difficulties abound within this series from the unfortunate use of HFR 3D to the unexplained potholes and the addition of an unnecessary love story. Even with these challenges, Peter Jackson manages to take a less than stellar film and entertain the audience. His heavy reliance on CGI effects and video game action cannot make up for the weakness of the story. This will appeal to the current generation, but most likely will miss its mark for the generations who have loved the literary material. Jackson was able to round out the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings effectively, but succumbed to a Revenge of the Sith-type ending for The Hobbit. In trying to tie off all of the loose ends and link them to the original series, the ending comes off as haphazard and laboured. In the end, the film was entertaining, but the book was better.     <br/><br/>The final scene between Bilbo and Gandalf is the one of the few profound moments of the film. The wise wizard says, ""You are only quite a little follow in a wide world, after all.""  As with many of the words from Gandalf to Bilbo, they held a warning and a reminder. The warning was not allowing ourselves to be caught up in the moment and to keep a realistic perspective on our lives. The use of the hobbits allowed for the value of humility and the realisation that many answers to life's challenges come from unexpected things to be a central theme throughout this film and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bilbo presents a problem for many in the film. He is the smallest and most unassuming character, but manages to be the conscience and strength of the story. Even though he is far from perfect, he does become the voice of reason for the leadership and is not ruled by a need for power. at one point in the film, he simultaneously holds onto two of the most powerful symbols (the Arkenstone and the Ring) in the film and is the one left to make the choices that are best for all in the film. This lesson of his character makes room for consideration of the value of humility in our lives. (A suggested read on this topic is Humilitas by Dr. John Dickson) <br/><br/>    <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film?  1. What is the value of a good leader? (Matthew 20:25-28, 1 Corinthians 12:12) 2. Humility plays a part in this story and throughout the Bible (Philippians 2:3, James 4:6)"

Coming out of the cinema I felt like I had enjoyed the film, but thinking back a lot was left unanswered, like what happened to the lonely mountain? I know all the orcs ran off, I don't know why since they seemed to be doing pretty well and the dwarf king was dead along with his sons. Who would have then stayed there? the 10 remaining dwarfs? and what happened to the arkenstone? Bard seemed to have it the last I remembered but there's no real ending to what happens with it. It was nice to see Bilbo return to the shire but it would have been better to see a bit more of that scene, rather than just literally arriving to all his stuff being sold.<br/><br/>Overall an enjoyable film with a lot of action but could have done with some more complete storytelling in my book."
"d_fitheques","9","11","30","11 December 2014"," The Final Third of the Six
","Quite a set of years ago, I heard that Peter Jackson was finally jumping into the Hobbit convoy to take up the reins once more. I as many had been struck by the ever going miracle that were his three installments of Lord of the Rings and, no least, King Kong. The miracle that all of them had been done at due time, without losing anybody on the way. Many thought that it couldn't be done again.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it was no question that the introduction of another director could achieve to herald such a heritage, and I simply stepped away. But P Jackson coming back sounded like a duty crawling up its claim : Bilbo had to be done by the ones who made the Ring. At this stage, my remembrances of the book were far and sparse, and I decided to read it again, something i did not with Lord of The Rings, which I had never read ; but the movie-making of LOTR had so much impressed me that I saw an opportunity to estimate, out of this new beginning, the challenges of such an adaptation.<br/><br/>Soon after reading the book it soon came to my mind how parallel the two stories were : a long journey East, launched by a cohort of undersized characters, ending with a huge battle. How could anybody succeed in meeting the public expectations out of a prequel as much similar as a draft ? For me, the 3D-HFR stuff came as an obvious answer. As legendary as LOTR was, those did only show a flat-screen Middle-Earth. That technological shift had so the potential to bridge the gap of consistency between the Hobbit and Lord of The Rings. Without 3D, there surely wouldn't have been three, and maybe even two movies : fifteen years ago, the first draw had only planned one movie.<br/><br/>So the challenge this time was not about choosing which part of the book was to be cut off, but which stuff had to be added. Enough said : People cringing about the additions and blaming the Jacksons for them just don't get their necessity. Some day, they'll end realizing the emptiness of calling for two movies when one-book-to-three-movies had to be pioneered.<br/><br/>Three movies we have now. And the Battle of The Five Armies appears, not exactly as the extra-one, but really as the defining one for the three. This movie was the movie I was the most afraid about.<br/><br/><ul><li>First, it had the most to add to the book out of tiny bits</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Second, it had to show a battle which was described as an unexpected one, as an inextricable chaos.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Third, it had to plunge into this battle in a full-scale HD+3D+HFR</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fourth, this battle had to challenge the two mighty battles of Helm's Deep and Pelennor, without overwhelming them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fifth, The Hobbit was still supposed to be a children movie, PG13, without too much blood I didn't expect I could want to see such a movie. I didn't expect I could stand such a movie. I didn't expect I could enjoy such a movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, how did it came out ? For me, perfectly fine. In fact, audiences see the least possible of the full-scale battle. Five minutes of scrums maybe, but not much more ; instead of the never-ending slaughter, we have many, many, many victorious close-ups. Many, many episodes which are NOT the battle :<br/><br/>We see the sickness of Thorin inside Erebor, which is NOT the battle in front of Erebor<br/><br/>We see Legolas and Tauriel in Gundabad, which is NOT the battle in front of Erebor<br/><br/>In Bree, we see women of Laketown sent by Bard to a shelter, which is NOT sending them into the battle<br/><br/>We see again and again Alfrid Lickspittle, who is doing all his best (or his worse) to AVOID the battle<br/><br/>We see Thranduil fighting almost alone, unattained by foes, then walking alone among the dead corpses, which is AFTER the battle<br/><br/>We see Thranduil fed up with the blood spent, quitting the battle to come, which is another time AVOIDING the battle<br/><br/>We see Thorin, out of his madness, jumping into the scrum and soon meeting with Dain : that is not FIGHTING into the scrum<br/><br/>We see trolls, hit by arrows, falling down by the numbers even BEFORE any struggle against dwarfs and elves<br/><br/>We see Azog giving orders with his Chappe Telegraphe, setting so himself a as FAR away from the battle as a chief can be<br/><br/>We see much of Bilbo getting in or out of Erebor, talking with Gandalf, and wandering here and there without being PART of the battle<br/><br/>We see Legolas jumping here and there, even flying under a giant bat, and emptying off his quiver, i.e. killing AT A DISTANCE from the battle<br/><br/>We see many characters being saved by other characters, which is avoiding being VICTIMS of the battle<br/><br/>We see the heroes climbing the Raven Hill where they meet their fate one by one, killed sparsely (only three die) FAR AWAY from the main battle.<br/><br/>We see only A GLIMPSE of the Eagles arriving and ending the battle after throwing Beorn into it<br/><br/>Almost all the warriors, elves, dwarfs, orcs included, are HIDDEN under heavy armory (orcs get killed by Laketown women nevertheless)<br/><br/>As I remember, I've seen only ONE orc's head rolling somewhere in front of us at the end of the battle.<br/><br/>So, that's what we have : a tragic battle, but not a graphic bloodshed shaking us with nightmarish close-ups.<br/><br/>That was NOT was I expected, and that's precisely why I'm so happy of what I have seen. The rest was just splendor everywhere."

","One star for being a Tolkien movie and one for bringing the Hobbit saga to an end. If none of these reasons are very important to you, I cannot recommend watching the battle of the five armies. <br/><br/>The whole (long, actually very long) movie appears like a desperate attempt of Peter Jackson to justify the production of three movies based on one considerably short book. The movie continues the plot and numerous sub-plots of The desolation of Smaug before the story ends in the infamous battle of five armies (actually I counted only four armies since the wolves were missing but let's not be too picky). The battle-scene in itself is hilarious, it takes ages, is incredibly confusing and fails to sufficiently explain what happened with all the sub-plots and characters that were introduced before (I am looking at you, Dain and Beorn!). Instead we have to endure multiple closeups of Tauriel and this much-to-tall-to-be-a-dwarf- dwarf Kili until the tragic end of their relationship. Oh yes, the closeups recalling the slap-stick 70ies movies but lacking the self-irony. Where is the wit of the book gone?"
"rawlingsedward18","10","10","27","10 December 2014"," A gripping finale to the trilogy which will benefit with an extended version
","I thoroughly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings and two previous Hobbit installments, but this was a truly compelling finale. The film is particularly successful in the captivating acting of the cast. Armitage and Freeman present a beautifully moving relationship that brings back the essence of their relationship in AUJ, only to finish it in a profound bond of friendship. While the lighter previous installments felt like an adventure, this film allowed the audience to engage with it's emotional atmosphere. Touching moments include (SPOILERS AHEAD) Thorin's death and Bard comforting his son during Smaug's attack on Laketown. The battle may not have lived up to the realism of LOTR battles but it was still very entertaining. Filler aspects of the film such as Tauriel, Legolas and Dol Goldur felt more welcoming this time round as they were expected. It was interesting that there was no prologue to the film like the other five middle earth films, but the opening Smaug scene set the mood for the movie.The only problem I had with the film was that the ending felt rather abrupt. However the extended edition will fix this minor issue. The lack of iconic aspects of the novel such as Beorn will be shown in the extended version. Also the CGI felt rather excessive, but this did not stray away from the heart of the film. This was the one film in the trilogy that would have benefited by being longer. Even though it had the least source material left to use the perfect tone established in the movie would have worked well to summarize each significant character at the end. The presence of LOTR connections fitted nicely into the movies and contributed to making both trilogies feel like one epic six film series. The emotional and significantly darker tone of this third installment, along with Character portraits ans Billy Boyd's ""The Last Goodbye"" gave the Hobbit Trilogy a more weighty and meaningful impact. The cinematography was amazing, but it would have been nice to see some more wide-scape location shots like in AUJ. This was a superb ending to the Hobbit Trilogy and Middle Earth saga that ought to be treasured for years to come."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","4","8","23 January 2015"," A forgettable way to cap off an inconsequential trilogy.
","So after the first Hobbit film underwhelmed and the second film bitterly disappointed, any hope for this series to have even a moment hit the bar set by The Lord of the Rings trilogy has utterly deflated. The Battle of the Five Armies is a disheartening pale shadow of what Middle Earth once was. It's more or less an extended epilogue of The Desolation of Smaug, a film that looks much worse yet way more eventful in hindsight. There's no improvement in aesthetic, narrative or character investment. Bilbo gets a single moment to revel in rather than each scene. Battles are tedious, pointless and unremarkable. Richard Armitage has never been worse and the Unibrow guy is especially abysmal. To its credit, compared to the other two this film holds a somber mood of denouement, one that The Return of the King has as well, but here it's more of a relief. An unmemorable way to cap off a forgettable franchise.<br/><br/>5/10"

","That's the polite version of what I was thinking while I sat through this. The rest of the thought was ""Will it ever end?"".<br/><br/>The kicker is, there's some very good acting and it's a classic story with some truly touching moments. But the endless repetitive and exaggerated action scenes, unnecessary subplots, ridiculous added material and alterations to the plot distract mightily from the main. Personally, I'm hoping for a directors that culls all three movies down to the three hours total that's required for the story.<br/><br/>Less is more, keep it simple stupid.. Choose the phrase. I don't know if it's bloated because of Jackson, or bean-counters, but rumors indicate the latter and it's a shame.

"jake-law123","8","4","8","9 January 2015"," Terrific conclusion to this epic trilogy.
","For me, the Hobbit films only got better. I enjoyed the first, the second was a huge improvement, then this one just knocked it all out for me. It concludes the epic story in such a stylistic fashion, completing arcs for all characters of the trilogy, bringing you to tears, and for the journey to continue into LOTR.<br/><br/>The epic trilogy conclusion follows Bilbo and his Dwarf friends as they prepare for war against the Orc army, while dealing with Oakenshield's inner demons preventing him from associating a truce with the Elves and townspeople of Laketown.<br/><br/>The opening scene is the battle with Smaug. The reign of terror by Smaug, followed by his downfall. It's really well done and really well shot. Though part of me feels like it could have just been thrown into the last film at the last second, it makes for one great opening scene.<br/><br/>Most of the film is the lengthy battle, hence the title. There's a lot of build up between all the sides of the army. This is the one where I really felt the pressure of the situation. I felt scared for everybody; Bilbo, who's caught in the middle of all of it, Oakenshield, who is forced to make a difficult decision, Legalas, and Bard, who has to lead the people of Laketown in their attempt to recover from the reign of Smaug. I was scared for Gandalf up to when he's freed by Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman from the evils of Sauron, which perfectly sets up Saruman's following of Sauron.<br/><br/>In terms of the battle scenes, outstanding. The action is fluent and fast paced, with spot on choreography. Not to mention certain scenes, (don't wanna spoil) that are soooo freaking awesome I had my jaw dropping for a solid minute. The scenery is beautiful, even though most of your concentration is on the action, the characters use the environment to their advantage to progress the battle. It's such an amazing battle of epic proportions, because so much stuff is happening at once, you're all over the place.<br/><br/>I will say a lot of the character confrontations are pretty much over and done with during the fight, but that's kind of the point. One book stretched into 3 movies, it all comes down to this, and it does a heck of a job.<br/><br/>I was not expecting to be so wrapped up into the character, which really hit me hard at the end, of it all, I ended up crying. The ending was one of my favorite parts, it perfectly concludes this story and perfectly wraps it into LOTR, you just get goosebumps the way they do it, perfect!<br/><br/>If you're interested in epic battle scenes that blow your mind every second, then I highly recommend this. I enjoyed every second of it, simply too epic to not enjoy."

Stripped of sense and generally bad acting or at least bad depicting of characters from the actors, Which would mean, that there probably wouldn't be the same international hype about it.

"Callum_Hofler","7","4","8","3 January 2015"," A Reasonably Effective Conclusion To The Franchise
","A few things to note before I muster up the energy to write a full-blown review.<br/><br/>-Legolas is a god and is absolutely hilarious in this film<br/><br/>-Thorin's development is initially far too sudden, but evens out as the film goes on. By the end, his arc is understandable and well done.<br/><br/>-Howard Shore's score is incredible; a great improvement over the far less impressive The Desolation of Smaug score<br/><br/>-The love story which I actually loved in the previous film is so utterly cringe-worthy that I could barely watch whenever it was brought up.<br/><br/>-That said, the final scene with Tauriel and Kili is incredible and beautifully constructed.<br/><br/>-The visual effects are not as good as they were in The Desolation of Smaug. Whereas in Desolation the visual effects shots had clear grandeur to them, Jackson and Co. dress much of Erebor up with strange pink and grey colouring, as well as distracting smog.<br/><br/>-That said, the character models and large-scale battle scenes are incredible. The orcs looked fantastic (particularly Azog), the interior of Erebor is vast and huge, and Smaug once again looks suitably brilliant.<br/><br/>-For once, an action director who is willing to hold the shot, and keep from cutting every single hit. The battles and individuals fights are sometimes slightly incoherent, but enjoyable nonetheless<br/><br/>-The best opening scene from a film in 2014. The destruction of Lake- Town is harrowing, brilliantly filmed and utterly breathtaking.<br/><br/>-Stupid comedic relief from the Lake-Town Master's deputy is stupid. Burn it with fire.<br/><br/>-I reiterate, because it's fantastic: Legolas is a god, and I could not for one second (nor could those who accompanied me for the screening) take him serious in battle.<br/><br/>-The first act builds up the characters and their arcs brilliantly. Luke Evans shines in these opening scenes.<br/><br/>-The second act is lacking and oft-times boring. Too many boring battle scenes that contain no peril, discussions between people that feel repetitive, and stupid character tropes.<br/><br/>-The third act ties into The Lord of the Rings, whilst maintaining the emotion and scope of The Hobbit films, concluding the majority of the character's stories.<br/><br/>-Bard doesn't get a memorable or definitive resolution. This is an issue.<br/><br/>-Jackson's cinematography, as always, is gorgeous. Even if you hate his use of visual effects, you can't doubt that he has gotten better with his camera-work since The Lord of the Rings, utilizing close-ups rarely and swinging his camera with purpose, instead of idly.<br/><br/>-Much of the comedy is fantastic, apart that from the aforementioned Lake-Town deputy.<br/><br/>-I have to say it once more: Legolas can not be killed.<br/><br/>-The performances are all exceptional, even if some of the dialogue is slightly shoddy.<br/><br/>-The sound design is fantastic as always, and for once, there are no Wilhelm screams! (there was one in Desolation by the way, in the Extended Edition, during the Thrain scene)<br/><br/>-The costumes, make-up and props are award-worthy. Brilliant work once again from all those involved.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Jackson brought me to another world, and made me enjoy much of my time there. I can't wait to experience this film alongside both of the other Hobbit pictures, as well as The Lord of the Rings films, as the ending literally ties into the beginning of Fellowship.<br/><br/>Congratulations Peter Jackson and all those who have collaborated to bring this amazing vision to the screen. A fantastic but nevertheless faulted ride."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","4","8","2 January 2015"," A nice conclusion . . .
","Let's get this issue off the table right away: I have no problem with Peter Jackson and his company expanding J.R.R. Tolkien's slender tome ""The Hobbit"" into three movies. If he tells a good story and the movies don't bore me to tears, I'm okay with the extra time. I think the derisive grousing that has come from critics leading up to the film's release has been unjustified not to mention, painfully unfair. Even if you don't care much for Jackson's second trilogy there is no denying that his heart is on every frame, that he works virtually alone in an arid desert of modern cinema where studio executives limit their imaginations and are terrified to take chances. Jackson should be applauded for his efforts.<br/><br/>That said, I was happy with The Battle of the Five Armies, the concluding chapter of this series. It is evenly paced, and the organization of the narrative is much cleaner than The Desolation of Smaug which I felt was messy and too stuffed with uninteresting characters. Here the placement of characters and their motivations is handled much better and much more economically. Even better, when there is a battle sequence, it's not just a jumble of swords and hair and armor. There's actually some orientation to what's happening. Everyone has a purpose for being in battle and there's a price to pay for every action.<br/><br/>When we last left Lake Town, it was about to be besieged by the dragon Smaug. This movie picks up immediately where the previous movie leaves off, and deals with a scene that feels like it should have been tacked onto the end of the last movie, but moving on.<br/><br/>Once things settle down, we find tension amid the ranks – the men, the dwarfs and the elves, most of it fueled by greed over the mountains of gold currently locked away with the dwarfs in The Lonely Mountain. Within its walls are the baker's dozen of dwarfs and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). They could easily form an alliance against an army of Orcs headed their way, but they are held off by their leader Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) who has reclaimed his throne, but wants nothing to do with anyone outside, mainly due to the fact that the accursed gold inside the mountain is poisoning his mind.<br/><br/>The tension between the Dwarf king and the other factions makes up the film's first half which works well as a story of the deadening power of greed. The second half, of course, mends those issues in order to portray the battle the Orcs. This is the part I was least looking forward to – yet, as I said, they are organized well so that we feel the tension in what is happening to individual characters. Do they go on too long? Yes. Was I bored? Not for a second.<br/><br/>In between are the individual characters, and the movie organizes them well too. Everyone has a motivation and everyone has a story to tell. Yet, they don't leaden the story. Something that I think was missing from the last installment was time for individual characters. Here, the extra time leads to some very good performances, especially by Martin Freeman as Bilbo who seems to be the only voice of reason amid factions that only want to bark and fight with one another. He manages to keep Bilbo's charm and leaven this very heavy-handed story.<br/><br/>The great drama of the film comes from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakensheild, whose character has an arc. There's a reason (and an unreasoning) for the misdeeds that he is committing and he sees the damage that he is doing. Thorin is this trilogy's most complete character, a dwarf who has been through a terrible ordeal, wants to return home, reclaims his kingdom, and pays the price by allowing his newfound power to poison his mind. That's a great story, and it fuels much of what happens here. We get to know his so well, that when he finally has his moment of truth, we care about his fate.<br/><br/>That's the film at its best. Where it fails, I'm afraid, is in the visual effects. Much of what made the Lord of the Rings trilogy work was that we felt that there was a mixture of various effects so that the movie didn't feel like a video game. Here, there's so much reliance on computer effects that some action scenes feel like a video game. Characters tumble down hills or run across landscapes and we don't feel the weight of motion, it's clumsy and awkward. The same goes for several characters who are created via computer and don't feel flesh and blood. For example, a dwarf called Dain (Billy Connolly) comes into the story on the back of a pig, but both he and the pig are mostly made up of CGI, and look almost as if the effects weren't finished. Same goes for the villain, Azog (Manu Bennett) which is made up of so much CGI that he never seems to be in the same scene with the actors.<br/><br/>That objection aside, this is an enjoyable movie. It's not as good as the first, but it's better than the second. I think that this trilogy is underrated and I've had a good time watching it. Does it match The Lord of the Rings? No. But it is entertaining. You feel that you've gotten to know Bilbo, and you feel that the will have a wonderful tale to tell when he gets home."
"Troy_Campbell","4","4","8","29 December 2014"," Bloated, exhausting and full of subpar CGI.
","The Hobbit was already seen by most as the weaker, shallower series within the Middle Earth cinematic saga, and this underwhelming trilogy-closer does nothing to dispel that line of thought. Essentially the final act of the second instalment stretched out to feature length (giving further credence to those who argued a two-parter would've been more suitable), Peter Jackson's latest effort is one prolonged climax that will test the tolerance of even hard- core Tolkien fans. There are a few choice one-on-one fights that quicken the pulse, however for a film that relishes in grand-scale combat, it is disappointingly dull. Majority of its set pieces are muddled and repetitive, and, surprisingly for Jackson, the geography of the action is often confusing. Perhaps most shocking, however, are the subpar effects littered throughout – be it the completely computer generated wide shots or the CGI-augmented warfare. Thank goodness for Martin Freeman though. His Bilbo Baggins remains the best thing in the LOTR prequels and every time he is on screen, which unfortunately isn't as regularly as in the first couple of outings, the movie gets instantly better. Richard Armitage also captivates as bullish Dwarf leader Thorin and Ian McKellan's Gandalf is as watchable as always, whilst Evangeline Lilly is a refreshing presence in the only notable female role. Condensed into an hour finale for Desolation of Smaug, the eponymous battle could have been an intense, breathless culmination to an entertaining series. As a standalone entry (even at a franchise-low 144 minutes), Battle of the Five Armies is saggy, exhausting and one of the biggest let downs of 2014."
"svederen","4","4","8","29 December 2014"," Peter Jackson's Jar-Jar-Binks disaster.
","I'm not a fanatical fan of either the books or the Middle Earth universe in general, but I've read the LoTR trilogy and the Hobbit, and I've enjoyed Jackson's adaptations in all the five film so far. That sadly ended with ""Battle of the Five Armies"".<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint exactly what's gone wrong in BoTFA, as there are just so many different areas where it falls short of what we've come to expect from the series. There's been plenty of reviews here on direction, pacing, writing, etc, so I'll focus on two points where I the film really broke for me. The absolute worst was how the film shoves comic relief in your face throughout, to a degree where it actually feels like the serious scenes are ""serious relief"" in a comedy. A badly written and not really all that funny comedy that is.<br/><br/>To that end, Alfrid Lickspittle is Jackson's Jar-Jar Binks. I get it, he's an unsympathetic character. I realized that the first time we saw him in Desolation, but somehow Jackson figured we needed 12-15 more scenes with the guy, really driving home that point, all of them attempting at humor and all of them failing miserably.<br/><br/>Then there's the 45 minute long battle scene, with the now obligatory god-ninja-elves defeating hundreds of orcs without breaking a sweat. It's gotten so bad that it's really hard to be scared of the orcs anymore, and it's indicative of a major problem in the movie.<br/><br/>Orcs have become such obvious cannon-fodder, that their armies never really feel like a threat, or even a force to be reckoned with. Don't get me wrong, Azog is pretty bad-ass, and so is his second in command, but the rest of the orcs seem to die if anyone just looks at them sternly. At one point there's a young boy with no battle training, looks to be no more than 12 years old, taking out two heavily armored Uruk Hai sized orcs in five seconds, with a couple of swings of a sword.<br/><br/>Between the god-like ninja-elves and the trying-to-be-hilarious-but-also-god-like dwarven fighters, the orc armies are just a minor nuisance, that are ultimately dispersed and killed by a few of the ever present eagles that seem to show up every time someone needs to have their day saved.<br/><br/>I couldn't enjoy the narrative, because it was broken, riddled with bad humor and full of plot holes. I couldn't enjoy the character development because there wasn't one, and it was very difficult to enjoy the combat scenes, because of these weakling orcs.<br/><br/>In the end, I have to give it 4 stars for Bilbo's acting and for Christopher Lee kicking ass at Dol Guldur."
"stephab67","5","4","8","28 December 2014"," Disappointing Overall
","This review is actually for all three movies. First, though I want to say that I'm not generally a person who expects films to be exactly like the books, because I know that good filmmakers need to make choices about how they are going to relay the story, and sometimes things need to be changed due to the different nature of film vs books. Having said that, I found the whole thing disappointing overall, for several reasons. Many of them have already been enumerated by previous reviewers, so I'm just going to go over the most egregious problems I had with the films. <br/><br/>1. MOST IMPORTANT: There should have been only two films. The book wasn't even 300 pages, so there was no reason to spread it over three films. I can understand why they didn't want to do only one, but two would have been plenty. If they'd tightened up most of the battle sequences, eliminated a couple that were completely extraneous to the plot, and dumped a couple of pointless characters, that would have cut the film down to two right there. <br/><br/>2. Having said that, given that there were three films, why is it that there was really any characterization for only four of the dwarfs (Thorin, Balin, Fili, Kili)? I have the same problem regarding Beorn. First, they jazz up the meeting of the group with Beorn, turning it into them running from him like he's going to eat them when he's in the form of a bear, then they don't even spend any time with him afterward. Annoying. <br/><br/>3. The love story between Kili and Tauriel. Why? Having Kili die defending Tauriel totally takes away from the story - he should have been fighting with Thorin to the end, like he was in the book. <br/><br/>4. The ridiculous Orc-as-main character. Pointless. I think we saw more of him than we saw of Bilbo in the last film, which is unforgivable. I'm going to add Alfrid to this, because why was he even necessary? There was enough drama in the film already. They should have killed him off when they killed off the Master of Lake-Town. He served no purpose except to suck up screen time from other, more important characters, like Bilbo and the dwarfs. <br/><br/>5. The drawn-out battles, especially in the previous two films, with endings that didn't even make sense in the world of the film (every one of the dwarfs and Bilbo should have been dead long before they reached the Lonely Mountain). And why change the way some of them happened? The escape from the Orcs in the first film, the change of the troll scene (hilarious in the book - why not keep it that way?), and the escape from Thranduil's prison, which ends up being a fight against Orcs, were all great scenes in the book already. <br/><br/>6. Radagast's character assassination. I actually am fine with him being in the movie, but they made him out to be a total joke, which he is not. <br/><br/>7. The lack of wrap-up in terms of Thorin's funeral, what happened to the treasure, the people of Lake-Town, etc. If I hadn't read the book, and only saw the movie, I'd be thinking, ""What happened?"" <br/><br/>8. Riding goats, Thranduil's elk, Radagast's rabbit team, etc. WTF? Also, too much CGI in general.<br/><br/>What I did like: 1. I thought the acting overall was great, and that Martin Freeman made a terrific Bilbo. I just wish I had seen more of him, especially in the last film. Same with the dwarfs. Richard Armitage gave Thorin the proper level of gravitas, and Ken Stott and Aidan Turner did the best they could with the limited amount of lines they had. I think the actors who played the other dwarfs, especially James Nesbitt, were wasted. They should have had far more to do than they did. Lee Pace was appropriately ""elvish,"" and Benedict Cumberbatch was perfectly creepy as both Smaug and Sauron. <br/><br/>2. I actually did not have a problem with Tauriel as a character, and I understand why they added her. If they did not, there would have been no female main characters at all. I just had a big issue with the time wasted on the romance between her and Kili. Couldn't they have just had her be a great fighter and leave it at that? Us ladies don't always need a romance to keep us interested. <br/><br/>3. I actually liked that they incorporated some of the LOTR appendix stuff, Gandalf's explanation in ""Fellowship"" of what happened to him when he went to Dol Guldur, and Legolas as a character. Those events took place during the time of ""The Hobbit,"" so I thought it was legit to show them. Otherwise we would have Gandalf just disappearing for parts of the movie without an explanation of where he went, which would have made no sense at all. <br/><br/>4. Smaug looked great, as did Lake-Town, the kingdom under the mountain, Dale, and Thranduil's hall in Mirkwood. Jackson got the atmosphere right, which is what I would expect. <br/><br/>5. Bilbo's return to Bag End was pretty much exactly how it was in the book, as was the scene where he finds the Ring. If more of the films could have been like those two scenes I would have been ecstatic.<br/><br/>I'm not sorry I saw the films, I don't think they were a waste of time, but I was disappointed in them."

I think the directors and producers simply wanted to go out with a bang by focusing more on fighting and action scenes than a an actual journey like the other films.<br/><br/>To me, the elves truly made this film and I can't even lie Thranduil had me clutching my pearls and getting my life YES GAWD!<br/><br/>I know they said this is the final journey but I really hope they continue on with the Hobbit/LOTR franchise, there is so much potential for other amazing films."

If you are into just straight-up epic fantasy battles, then this is the movie for you. My only complaint is that I wish they would have given Gandoff more swag, and had him use his ""magic"" more.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were nothing short of awesomesauce. There really isn't a lot of plot development or twists, just because the first two do such a great job setting up this last picture.

"albertrwz","9","4","8","23 December 2014"," The Battle of Five Armies : Not A Single Movie
","If the Rings was a legendary and unbelievable trilogy of all times, then the Hobbit would a great and enjoyable trilogy that still satisfied the audience. The novel was written in the similar way. While the Rings requires more time commitment and vocabularies to read through, the Hobbit is more geared toward a younger audience (children and teens).<br/><br/>If I review the The Battle of the Five Armies as a single movie, I will point out a lot of flaws. The first would be the pace of the movie. For example, in the beginning of movie, Bard vs Smaug was way too fast. Peter Jackson gave Smaug an infinite amount of armor but a non-existent hitting points. From there, we can tell the second flaw of the movie - too much distortion in the fighting scene. The Orcs can only attack but has no defense ability. The Dwarfs suddenly have the fighting ability as Elves. And this leads to its third vital flaw - the fast change of character. I like how the Elf King and Tauriel changed in the end. However, how Thorin changed his mind was too suddenly that the audience would feel something was missing. <br/><br/>If I review the The Battle of the Five Armies as a conclusion of the Hobbit trilogy, these flaws I pointed out would make more sense and may not be viewed as flaws anymore. The movie created a suspense that was not really exited in the book. Without carrying away the main theme of this movie, The director has to limit the emphasis on Bard's fight with Smaug. The same goes with the change in Thorin. The director wants the five armies share the same development. It was a trade-off between showing Thorin thinking and arguing against himself alone for 10 minutes and developing the massive grand fight for 10 minutes. I would not blame the director to choosing the latter. <br/><br/>Lastly, the unrealistic fighting scene in the movie does not make the movie unreal. In my opinion, the ending in this trilogy was far more sorrow and realistic than the ending in Rings. Tauriel asked the Elf King why things ended this way, he provided a simple answer ""because it was real."" If an explanation is needed for all unrealistic scenes in the movie, we can find one before the very end. When Gandalf bade farewell to Bilbo, Gandalf said the fundamental of the whole trilogy ""you don't really suppose that all your adventures were managed merely by luck, do you?"""
"aag-muus","9","4","8","23 December 2014"," The Hobbit, the final battle!
","The final movie of the Hobbit trilogy, the end of the Tolkien era is near... Though I think that the Hobbit did not need to be filmed over three movies as it is such a smaller story then the LOTR I still love the movies.<br/><br/>The Hobbit - battle of the five armies is all about the battle. It goes further where the second movie ended - with the dragon Smaug. There are some parts I found a bit disappointing. For example the part where Legolas fights Bolg with the bridge caving in. It looks like a Matrix part which I think did not quite fit in the whole Hobbit movie. I also did not completely get what the five armies stand for in the movie... But put that aside I really love the movie. <br/><br/>The special effects are again excellent and acting off course was awesome. Martin Freeman plays the role of Bilbo so well and as for Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage playing the roles of Gandalf and Thorin. Though Peter Jackson made up some extra plots which are not in the book mentioned. Like In the actual story, Fili and Kili died defending Thorin in battle. But nevertheless it is still a good story. <br/><br/>It is so sad that the Tolkien movies have ended and we cannot longer live in the middle age world. Goodbye to middle earth and all the creatures.."
"spartantom25","8","4","8","23 December 2014"," Amazing imagery, heartfelt emotion for a satisfying, but slightly rushed finale
","The final installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit Trilogy,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues in the footsteps of previous installments, but makes a few mistakes on the way. The film succeeds as a finale in a trilogy, but falters slightly as a film on a whole. Some of Jackson's finest abilities as a director shine. The problems never cause enough damage to ruin the experience. The movie redeems itself by the end.<br/><br/>Thorin has regained his homeland and the surrounding people and elves want a share in the gold of Erebor. This idea drive the narrative for the first act of the film. I feel Jackson's storytelling ability works here. He sets up some very compelling character conflicts. The problem stands by the fact that most of the characters are not given enough time to complete their development. This become a problem when the battle begins.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies as the title suggest has a battle. The massive battle really creates the most extraordinary spectacle. Peter Jackson knows how to paint some beautiful imagery. However, the battle extends throughout almost two thirds of the film. This would not present too large of a problem, but in order for it to work the characters need to be strongly developed. One could create the most amazing action pieces ever made, but they will mean nothing unless the audience cares about the characters within the action. Not to say that this happens with all the characters, but after thirty minutes of action, one can start to forget a person's motives. The movie does make the assumption that the audience has viewed the previous installments.<br/><br/>In terms of character development, the major standout is Thorin. Richard Armitage gives a great performance and really sells his departure into madness. Thorin's character arc seems to be the only one fully utilized. Bilbo does carry much of the movie as well and Martin Freeman plays him tremendously well. Sadly, most of the other characters are never really fully realized. Some even become more of functional characters, like Gandalf, who merely gives out important expository information when needed. Jackson hit some of the emotional moments with great heart, however a certain relationship in the film seemed a little out of place and never really hit it's intended mark. Also, a few comic relief moments do not really fit. However, in the end it is Thorin and Bilbo's character relationship which carries the film.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has taken a three hundred page book and successfully made three very entertaining films out of it. They may not be perfect films. Some characters never really reach full realization and some become merely functional. When all is said and done, however, Jackson has told a compelling story and created some wonderful imagery. The Hobbit films, though with their problems, have succeeded by the end."
"gogarrett","9","4","8","22 December 2014"," Best of the 3
","I was pleased with everything Peter Jackson created in this last installment. During the first two movies I was having issues with all the things that were not like the book, especially adding new characters and relationships - but the drama, action and the essential thread of the story was so well created and acted out in this installment that I was able to put all my issues aside and enjoy the ride and all of the characters. It was actually fun to see scenes that did not happen in the book, which helped bring the story full circle into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy filmed a decade earlier. One of the big character changes in all of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies is that the writers always add more female characters. It's a smart move, even though at first I objected to there being a Tauriel elf girl and Legolas present as the son of Thranduil in this version of the Hobbit. It's also great to see the casting people use New Zealand actors in each movie, since that is where the filming happened. It was really fun to see the return of characters from the first 3 movies in this last Hobbit movie, even if they may not all have actually appeared on the pages of the book. I am ready to go see the movie again to pick up on details I missed, including the fact that a familiar actor I watch on the Arrow t.v. series played the leader of the Orc army, Azog. He was totally CGI of course, but now I will be looking for the actor, Manu Bennett, in the CGI version of him, like I was watching for Andy Serkis in the Gollum character from the first movies. I also want to rewatch for the signs of the return of dark times in Mordor in relation to Bilbo's finding and use of the ring. I hope Peter Jackson is able to keep making movies of this caliber. The passion and detail of his work as director, writer, creater of other worlds is quite a gift to all of us."
"chademe","5","4","8","21 December 2014"," Not that great.
","This movie seemed to struggle to find its identity. Was it a spectacular fantasy epic? Was it slapstick comedy? Or just an action movie? The fact that it was hard to tell indicates that it failed to be whatever it was trying to be.<br/><br/>Being ""The Hobbit"", it seems it should be a spectacular fantasy epic, and there were elements of that in it. Unfortunately there was way too much fighting and too much comic relief for it to be taken as a serious movie. Fighting and fantasy movies go hand in hand, but in order for it to be a really great movie, there needs to be some plot and story to justify the fighting. But the fight scenes in this movie dragged on forever. The special effects were well done, but often times the movie seemed to be more of a study in different types of fight sequences instead an actual movie with a story and character development. At some point the action becomes so over the top as to be unrealistic. I know in a movie with elves and dragons there is a certain suspension of reality that's necessary, but eventually the ongoing fights just became ridiculous.<br/><br/>Even serious movies need comic relief, but this movie seemed to have too much. One character was the butt of many many jokes throughout the movie, and while the jokes were funny, they didn't lend themselves to the rest of the movie very well.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why this movie was even necessary. All of the story could have been added on to the last movie pretty easily. It seems to have been necessary just to add in more action sequences and generate more box office revenue. It was OK to watch for a while, but it's not something I'd be interested in watching over and over again. Compared to the other Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies, this one definitely ranks at the bottom."
"mgruebel","6","4","8","21 December 2014"," A decent finale
","This film is basically one giant battle, and so Peter Jackson is in his favorite medium, as he was in the grand battles of ""The Two Towers,"" and ""The Return of the King."" The Hobbit films have pretty much lost the innocent charm of the book, which is on a much smaller scale than LOTR, but they work OK as a view into the bigger events surrounding Bilbo's quest. As in the previous two installments, the film, although acknowledging Bilbo's feats, minimizes them in favor of more background information hardly mentioned in the books (or not at all, but generally plausible).<br/><br/>It's only an OK ""6"" because the battles and mano-a-mano duels do not tread new ground, the romance falls flat, and because of the many unnecessary CGI indulgences. I think even an audience brought up with video game physics will have to smirk (as many sitting next to me did) when Legolas steps upward on cobblestones in free fall, violating Newton's third law. The slow motion accentuates the poor physics, and indeed, slow-mo fails in many different places in this movie.<br/><br/>Tolkien's book just did not have women in it, and the politically correct addition of an elf-dwarf romance fails on many levels: a dwarf had to be turned into a mini-human (with care taken not to show elf and dwarf in ways that allows a height comparison); the freely invented characters are not strong enough to make it work; it is simply corny - again, the audience smirked at the longing gazes and flowing tears.<br/><br/>All that said, it's still a good bang for the buck: Cumberbatch's Smaug is suitably ravenous and destructive, the chief of the town gets his due punishment, his opportunistic second hand escapes in drag so that not EVERY evil character gets killed (although probably he'll get offed in the extended edition), Thorin is besotted by the treasure but redeems himself. Some of the invented/misplaced characters work just fine (like the Orc chief and his lieutenant). The battles are great, and heads fly galore.<br/><br/>I bought all the LOTR films, seeing them many times and enjoying them as much as I had enjoyed Tolkien's books before. Seeing the Hobbit installments once at the movie theatre was enough. They simply have too much boring baggage added to them to be really great. Jackson should have stayed a little truer to the books by keeping to his original intent of a two-part Hobbit movie. I hope a fan cuts these three behemoths down to about 6 hours, then we'll have a taut, entertaining road trip mini-series. Or someone is just going to have to remake the Hobbit sooner than would otherwise have been necessary."
"saulius-dziugelis","5","4","8","19 December 2014"," Meh.
","This movie will come off as a no surprise to anyone who's seen the previous two. If you've seen those, you know what to expect. If you liked them, you'll be just as fine with this one, but if you didn't, you'll be just as disappointed by this conclusion. <br/><br/>That said, the movie does fix one flaw of its predecessors- that is the pacing. If in the previous two I found myself at times waiting for a boring scene to end just so we could get to something interesting, this movie rarely drags its feet. It's almost nonstop action. The name is appropriately picked- as most of the movie IS fighting. But amidst the things getting whacked with weapons, there was very little time dedicated to any plot or character development. <br/><br/>Speaking of plot, the whole movie is essentially just a two and a half hour wrap up to the many loose plot points of the previous two. It kicks off with the first fifteen minutes of battling the dragon, which really should have been the ending of the last movie. It feels oddly out of place and is over far too quickly, disposing of Smaug in less than satisfying manner. The subsequent reclamation of the city by the dwarfs and Thorin's corruption is rushed. In the original trilogy, I fully believed the way the Ring corrupted Frodo. In this one, it seems that Thorin goes into the mountain and instantly becomes a douchebag to everyone. It doesn't flow well. And it doesn't make you feel any sympathy for the character, as with Frodo. But it serves to kick off the events of the battle itself. As for secondary plot lines, Gandalf's sidequest serves little more than to reveal an enemy we've known all along and provides an opportunity for a cameo for three characters from the original trilogy and the Ringwraiths. Which, you guessed it, feels unnecessary. Another thing in the realm of unnecessary is Tauriel the Not in the Book's romantic subplot with Kili the dwarf, that no one asked for in the second movie and no one wanted to take so much screen time in the third. But instead of going for actual events in the book, the movie spawns a sort of romantic triangle between the two and Legolas (another unnecessary cameo) who leads Tauriel on a sidequest to deal with his personal nemesis, CGI Orc the 2nd (I forget his actual name). Thoring also, unsurprisingly, gets to set things straight with Bolg. <br/><br/>Speaking of unnecessary characters, they once again take the focus off the characters I WOULD actually like to know something about, like, oh you know, the twelve dwarfs that we've been with from the beginning? But no. Peter Jackson continues to amaze by probably being the only director in the world who can have a character be in a trilogy that's almost 10 hours long altogether, and not give him a single line. Really. Some of the dwarfs- the majority, in fact, never speak. Or really do anything either. The only ones we get to know a little (not enough) about are Thorin, Kili the romance interest, Balin the old wise guy, Dwalin the tough but reasonable bald guy and Fili the brother of Kili (that's all we ever find out about him). The others, well, I didn't even remember their names from the first two movies and I don't feel I've missed out on much. Hell, Thorin's cousin Dane shows up halfway through the movie and manages to show more character than most of those other dwarfs, whom, like I said, have been with us from the very beginning. It's a stark contrast to the original Fellowship. As for other characters, Bard's scenes are frequently ruined by the horrible, HORRIBLE and despicable side character that's, I guess, is supposed to be a comic relief, but his lines and scenes didn't draw a single laugh from the audience and in fact, felt embarrassing to watch. A bad attempt at humor if ever there was one. And the one character that COULD actually provide an honest laugh, you know, the main character who's in the title of the movie? Bilbo, played wonderfully by Martin Freeman? Oh he's still in the movie, but not much really.<br/><br/>So that concludes the characters. Now from a technical perspective, the movie is, in my eyes, bad. The high framerate flows smoothly, yes, but it doesn't change the fact that everything looks fake. The battle scenes are boring, with copy-paste characters hacking each other with blunt weapons and the bloodless beheadings are laughable at best. What happened to the mature tone of the original movies? The movie also gives a big middle finger to the laws of physics- which, of course, is expected to a certain extent in a movie about fantasy, but some of those are still inexcusable to the point of ridiculous. But all of these points were present in the last two movies too- the only example of impeccable CGI in the entire trilogy is Smaug the dragon and Gollum's cameo. Well done there, but everything else looks like a video game. And not a very good one at that.<br/><br/>So that's pretty much it. That's what this movie is. An almost 3 hour non stop cgi fest that wraps up the previous two movies, both the things we liked and the things we hated. It does that, but does it do it well? Not particularly. None of the plot points really come to a satisfying conclusion. I still got the warm and fuzzy feeling in the ending, but only because it plays to the nostalgia for the original trilogy, by tying the ending of this movie to the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring. If this was a good Hobbit movie, it would have been an ending worthy of tears. It's not a good movie, though, so it's simply a cherry topping on a bland tasting cake."

I have listen to the audio books of the Hobbit and of the full LOTR. Yet I don't consider myself a fanatic about the Tolkien universe, I recall that the first movie from 2001 left me a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>I recall that I was feeling that the movie had an excellent cast, that the music was outstanding, and I loved to finally have a clear vision of what I constructed in my mind during my childhood. But at the same time I was disappointed with little details that I was not ready to understand. Stuff like the way Aragorn fight the black riders for the first time, or why we had a love-story in the way... details that were big at first, and became lighter after watching the movie, then later the extended, and finally getting immerse in the mighty world Jackson created. At the end of the LOTR, I was sad it was over.<br/><br/>Then I heard about the Hobbit, a trilogy again! It couldn't be better, I thought. Plenty of time for developing characters, for getting amazed with another set of views of the Middle Earth. This time I was ready for weird plots coming in, to please some illiterate producer that does not get that you can get an excellent movie without old clichés. <br/><br/>But something got twisted, and more twisted, and re-twisted, and by the second half of the desolation of Smaug I started to feel something I've never felt before. I was sick of THIS Middle Earth. As if Peter Jackson was presenting us a joke of what a real ""The Hobbit"" movie could have been: No character development, bad done CGI everywhere, awful lines, and that Legolas playing God-mode-on....<br/><br/>I mean, come on! in the LOTR we saw how savage an orc can be. How difficult is to kill a beast. We had Boromir, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn,... freaking out because there was a troll (small size after all) in Moria. It took minutes to kill it. Then we have this last movie where there are giant troll rushing in the battle, but crumpling in seconds.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours pointing out what is wrong... this third (sixth) last movie, is plainly bad directed. Many things are unreal, unbelievable,... not many years ago Jackson presents us that dwarfs can get tired, out of breath,... here they move along the field, up and down a mountain, without much problem.<br/><br/>I am sorry it's over.

","""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"" concludes ""The Hobbit"" Trilogy – 3 Movies based on 1 Book, a prequel to ""The Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy of books, made into 3 movies prior to the Prequel Trilogy – The Books all written by J. R. R Tolken, all the films Directed by Director Peter Jackson. The movie picks up where the last one - ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" left off - with the Dragon ""Smaug"", voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, about to attack the city of Laketown, after his departure from the Lonely Mountain, now reclaimed by the Dwarfs, led by ""Thorin"", played by Richard Armitage. The Dwarfs have been aided by among others, the Hobbit ""Bilbo Baggins"", played by Martin Freeman, the Wizard ""Gandalf the Grey"", played by Sir Ian McKellan (reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), and Elves ""Legolas"", played by Orlando Bloom (also reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), ""Tauriel"", played by Evangeline Lily, and Lakestown resident ""Bard the Bowman"", played by Luke Evans. Overall – I enjoyed the movie very much. The Visual Effects and Cinematography are wonderful. The Battle scenes are a joy. Emotions are often stirred, by great acting, particularly in the love triangle relationship of Lily's ""Tauriel"", Dwarf ""Kili"", played by Aidan Turner, and Bloom's ""Legolos"". Other highlights for the acting would be the journey the character of ""Thorin"" takes, as well Freeman and McKellan's performances of ""Bilbo"" and ""Gandalf"" the Grey respectively, continuing to fight to bring everyone together for the battle that centers the 2nd Half of the Movie. Luke Evan's also gives a great performance as ""Bard the Bowman"" - a man trying to save his family, and lead his townspeople at the same time, as well as attempting to keep the peace by all to avoid War during the 1st half of the movie. There are a few moments that maybe could have been improved, but it doesn't hurt much for the overall enjoyment. I thought the first movie, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was alright, and I really liked ""The Hobitt: The Desolation of Smaug"". So – a really great movie to end a very good trilogy – 3 ½ out of 4 Stars."

","Well, I can understand why many of the LOTR book fans are so disappointed of this movie, and maybe the whole trilogy, for in the end I am one of the book nerds. But I couldn't feel but utter joy while watching the last movie that visits the middle earth realms. Truth be told, three movies are too much, and one movie is too few. The book had many plot twists in the Tolkien sort of way, but with the added touches of Peter Jackson, the events taking place would never fit in a one theatrical version movie, or even the extended copy. As we watch the final movie, we can't help but notice that the whole gap between the death of Smaug and the 13 dwarfs discovering that fact was never there. Bilbo in the movie informs them that he saw Smaug dying, which never happened in the books. Not so fast. In addition, the whole Necromancer thing was a complete addition by Peter Jackson, for in the book, it was told that Gandalf went and came with no telling about his little journey or detour. Was that a bad addition? No. I enjoyed this specific scene. I enjoyed the way Saroman the White, Lord Elrond and Lady Galadriel fought. It was utterly epic, especially when Lady Galadriel banished Sauron back from whence he came. Tauriel was another addition that I didn't like that much, especially when Peter Jackson tried to make her one of the main reasons Legolas leaves his kin to wander off and team up with Aragorn. It is said that Tauriel was mentioned with an elf reference in the book, but the whole Tauriel-Kili thing was a bit off the topic.<br/><br/>To conclude, I fell in love with the movie. I felt taken aback by how I was gazing at the screen trying to fight the flow of emotions. And I loved the theme song. And that was enough for me."
"ollie1939-97-957994","6","6","14","14 December 2014"," Was this really the end that the fans really deserved?
","I am going to start off by saying that this movie is a disappointment. Whilst I'm not a hardcore fan, I do really like Lord of the Rings and enjoyed the first two Hobbit movies throughly. However, many people had problems with the other two Hobbit movies and this one highlights them a lot. First off, without spoiling anything, the first 15-20 minutes of this movie could've been the last 15 minutes of the last Hobbit movie. It feels very out of place. All of the events of these first couple of minutes happen before the title for the movie even appears so it just seems like a very out of place intro. It ruins the great, nail biting cliffhanger that the Desolation of Smaug had. The movie also suffers from a massive tonal in balance. The Lord of the Rings films were dark with elements of humor. The first two Hobbits were more light hearted with elements of darkness. However, this one can't decide what it wants to be. It tries to be dark but there's so many stupid scenes that completely ruin the world that it's trying to create. I understand that it's a movie but when there's a scene of Legolas jumping across the fallen parts of a broken bridge, you can't extend your disbelief that much. Also, the acting was surprisingly a mixed bag. Whilst returning actors like Martin Freeman and Ian Mckellen are very good, other actors like Richard Armitage and Evangelie Lily are terrible. Also, actors like Stephen Fry, Hugo Weaving and Benedict Cumberbatch are also greatly underused. It focuses far too much on Thorin Oakenshield. In a movie franchise called the Hobbit. This wouldn't be as bad if Thorin was an interesting character. Instead, we get a lot of moping from Thorin which really doesn't help the movie. Why could it not be about Martin Freeman. Not only is he a good actor, but it's a movie named after his character?. Peter Jackson clearly was running out of steam when he started making this one. <br/><br/>Okay, I've talked about the negatives. There are some positives and despite my bashing, it's by no means a terrible film. The first hour of the movie is very good and actually looked like it was going to be the best out of the trilogy. The action is also good near the start of the battle which nearly made me think that the battle was going to be as good as Return of the King. The last scene was also good as it led directly into the Fellowship of the Ring. The music score was of course excellent and the cinematography is still amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit isn't a bad film. It just suffers from a massive tonal in balance and focusing far too much on a character that I don't really care about it. It certainly is the weakest Middle Earth film and I expected a lot more from a franchise beloved by many. Go see it if you're a Middle Earth fan and if you enjoyed the others, but you're in no rush to see this one."
"MattBrady099","6","6","14","12 December 2014"," ""I can't believe all this is behind us.""
","Time to say goodbye to middle earth for the last time.<br/><br/>The story is about Dwarven party led by Thorin Oakenshield finally reclaims their kingdom of Erebor, the vast treasure draws out now only the wrath of Smaug but also the army of men and elves, who want the fortune for their own.<br/><br/>Let me give you a quick feed back of the other two films then to this one. A unexpected Journey I thought was pretty amazing... when I first sawed it, after a couple of watchers later it's not as amazing as the first time, but I still enjoyed it even with the problems showing. Desolation of smaug in my opinion was way better and way more fun and better film paste then Unexpected Journey, and Smaug as the villain was icing on the cake. Now we got Battle of the Five Armies and I can conform that the movie is actually pretty good and it's a solid finale to The Hobbit series.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson directs this movie in a way that middle earth feels like a real pace that we can go to anytime we want and I got to give him that. Jackson clearly adores middle earth as he really doesn't want it to end and I can see why, it probably makes him feel at home directing these movies and sometimes leaving you home behind sucks.<br/><br/>The visual effect's at times looked really good and once again this movie had that shiny mix with grey color with the character's Armour and the background of beautiful New Zealand. But I like the Lord of the Rings effect's a little better, why you may ask. because the effect's in that movie still holds up today but that's just me... maybe.<br/><br/>The all the cast members did a outstanding job, Ian Mckellen will always be Gandalf because his the best, Martian Freeman did a fantastic job playing Bilbo Baggins and to be honest I like Bilbo Baggins more then frodo in my opinion.<br/><br/>My biggest problems with the film is some of the visual effect's in the movie looks very noticeable and I had the same problem with the other two films. The love story between Kili (The Dwarf) and Tauriel (The Elf), I didn't find their romance plot to really needed for the film and when something bad happens to the two of them I just sitting thinking ""Well stuff happens"".<br/><br/>Overall The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is a solid final to the Hobbit series with some problems there and then. Good action scenes, good performances and a brutal fight scenes."
"Dileno","6","6","14","12 December 2014"," Decent but in no way a classic
","The Middle-earth saga is concluded with arguably the worst part in the Hobbit series and thus the worst movie out of the six in Peter Jackson's Tolkien universe.<br/><br/>We know the characters, we know the setting but what we experience is nothing short of just milking the series with one extra movie.<br/><br/>To be fair, this finale lacks the character development and attachment we normally feel when watching these movies. Also, the plot is seemingly non-existent. The creators rely way too much on the war scenes, super cliché fighting and some actually bad acting from the people of Dale.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the previous 5 movies and am sure the extended version of this movie will be quite something else than the cinema version. The final chapter deserves more."

The film does well to highlight the story from the book, and how it isn't really a story. They all converge on the mountain, ostensibly to take the treasure, have an almighty row in which *spoiler* every army suffers huge casualties, the rightful king of the mountain dies, and then Bilbo goes home.<br/><br/>I guess the remnants of the five armies just wander off, whistling tunelessly.

","I haven't read the Hobbit but still felt like the movie was lacking. Where do I start? From the cheesiest love story ever? or the forced ""funny moments"" that lasted more than the actual battles.<br/><br/>Random stuff was happening all the time without explanation. Oversize goats and worms no character development, nothing. Later I learned that the hobbit is 300 pages long, seriously? You make 3 two hour movies out of 300 pages and can't find some time to add some important information? 100% Disappointed, do not watch if you are a fan. I will have to re-watch the whole LOTR trilogy to feel any better. Why is it so difficult for the directors to follow the book nowadays?"
"calgacus86","3","5","11","1 February 2015"," Jackson thinks he can write scenes better than Tolkien - and proves once and for all that he can't
","If you keep your expectations low the film is OK for the first 60 - 70% (other than the woefully bad lines in the cleansing of Dol Guldur, like ""you should've stayed dead""), then, where the battle with the orcs and goblins and warg riders and wolves in a horde under storm clouds and swarms of bats and lightning, swarming around mountainsides desperately defended by dwarfs, men and elves should have been, and where there should have been a giant bear fighting trolls and giant eagles, instead Jackson decided he could do it better. And produced a tedious and bizarre series of dull, predictable one-one-one duels, with ridiculous video editing that removed all possibility of suspending disbelief. Combining impossible to believe with tedious takes some doing, but Jackson manages it.<br/><br/>Oh and such great alterations to the book as Fili (or was it Kili) saying ""I've got this"", which really fitted in perfectly.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes that stick close to the book dialogue are well acted and good, but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>If i wasn't opposed to the death penalty i'd say that Jackson should be dressed as Bolg son of Azog and torn apart live on film by a giant bear as part of a book-accurate remake, to pay for his crimes against Tolkien.<br/><br/>It's not just that he changed the story from the book, but that he replaced it with such awful scenes rather than even half-decent ones."
"Avwillfan89","5","5","11","30 January 2015"," It ruins it, precious
","The third installment of a famous film saga usually either triumphs or fails spectacularly. It is the latter in this case. <br/><br/>This film truly disappoints, especially when compared to The Return Of The King. Not the least of which is its complete detachment of the joy, purity and epic feel of the Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>The added swear words, painfully lengthy battle sequences, lack of deep emotional moments and the prolonged scenes of a scowling, semi-maddened Thorin just scraped out any goodness that was in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Smaug falls after twenty minutes, random, unimportant creatures appear out of nowhere for war and worst of all, Bilbo takes a back seat throughout the whole battle. He doesn't even get use his sword, Sting, despite the poster showing him brandish it, ready for a battle he will never go to.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey was quite entertaining and playful. The Desolation of Smaug started to wear thin until the introduction of the title character, the majestic and terrifying Smaug. But this one, as a sole movie, simply had no particularly interesting scenes. I only watched it for my love of the characters, and the exiting moments of the first two. But I won't be watching it again in a hurry, that's for sure."

","this movie was terrible. I knew it wasn't going to be very good but I went to see it anyways and I should shoot myself in the head for doing so. The First Lord of the Rings movie was unbelievably good. It was epic. It was amazing. I lost myself watching that movie. Each one has gotten a little bit worse. This movie battle of the five armies is about as low as it can go. It's exactly the same old stuff all over again. The story was awful basically nonexistent the acting was terrible and the only thing that was barely acceptable was the special effects. But you can see special effects in any movie nowadays. When the First Lord of the Rings came out the special effects were amazing. But that was a long long time ago. The producers writers and directors of this latest movie came up way too short on this one. If you want to see this movie just watch one of the old Lord of the Rings movies over again and like 10 years age to all of the actors. Do not waste your time. Don't even rent this movie."
"miky-199-790837","3","5","11","30 December 2014"," Horrible, exaggerated, cheesy, pompous, sacrilege
","This movie is the worst adaptation of Tolkien books so far. We expect a few alterations compared to the original book and the Tolkien world, but not this sacrilege of an elf loving back a Dwarf. This is absurd. Nowhere in Tolkien universe there is recorded an elf and dwarf Union. Only dwarfs may be taken aback by the beauty of elves and maybe even loving them, but not the other way around.<br/><br/>There were a lot of useless stories just to allow the book to span over three movies. The dialogs are so cheesy and cliché that you just want to throw up 70% of the movie. Which is more than half full of cheap CGI. And this leads to the worst representation of orcs in the movies. Really..... orcs marching in formation wearing similar armor and taller than men? Not to mention the gargoyle looking bats and the earth worms. And the Eagles at the end....<br/><br/>And huge strategic mishaps, like in the battle placing the army of men (the lake town people) right in the middle of the formation. Which happens again when Thorin and the rest of the dwarfs sheltered in the mountain, decide to drop off all their armor and charge out in the battle to save their friends, again in the front middle of the formation. That's what you always do. Place your weakest element in the front middle of a battle formation.<br/><br/>I am glad this is over and I hope that this drama does not repeat itself in the future with other Tolkien adaptations."
"rooak","4","5","11","27 December 2014"," How can such a charming story be made out to be so boring?
","Peter Jackson has turned the charming story of The Hobbit into three movie-length sessions of boredom that not any amount of CGI can rectify. The first hour or so, with Smaug's attack of the town should have been thrilling, but I found myself looking at my watch... Actually that happened several times during the movie. How is it possible to create a movie of so little emotional involvement out of Tolkien's wonderful myth?<br/><br/>And what about the tragic comic mis-timing, particularly in the character of Alfred? And Thorin seemed to be channeling Mel Gibson as William Wallace....<br/><br/>True enough, the battle scenes are epic, but having seen one, haven't you seen them all? And the pop psychology inserted (via Tauriel) when Fili died rang a very strange note. Why not simply stick with Tolkien's sparkling writing?<br/><br/>The music was great, New Zealand looked wonderful, and the cinematography in general was fantastic. But movies are about characters that you care about in stories that grip you."
"vincent-malisse","4","5","11","22 December 2014"," What was Peter Jackson thinking?
","After 3 great movies (The Lord Of The Rings) and 2 good ones (The Hobbit), the last one of the Hobbit trilogy was a huge anticlimax. Perhaps my expectations where to high.<br/><br/>The film can be summed up in 2 words: ""fighting"" and ""dying"". But both of those concepts did not convince me. There is little or no overview in the fighting part. Smaug is literally killed before the opening credits and the real sense of dread absent at all times. <br/><br/>Dying just - takes - too - damn - long. (and there is a lot of it)<br/><br/>Next to these two concepts there were two other things that I found very annoying. The first one was the recycling of ""wording"" used in the first trilogy, as if people of Middle-Earth have a limited vocabulary and have to re-use entire phrases to say something.<br/><br/>The second one was the deviation of book. Sometimes this comes out OK. (Gandalf against Sauron), but what are Legolas and Tauriel doing? OK, Legolas could be partially understanding. The biggest error, however, in this entire trilogy, must have been the love between Kili and Tauriel. If you read Tolkien, this is not done, at all. (even love between man and elf is frowned upon and in the time span of 4 ages rarely occurred). To me, this part goes against the entire idea or concept that Tolkien must have had about Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>The movie is a dragged out 2,5 hour journey of miserable story telling. And although you probably want to go see for yourself anyway, make sure to lower your expectations significantly. Perhaps it might just become bearable."

The good guys seem to be overwhelmed, losing badly - oh, I get it! they've been waiting for the King to heal miraculously for no reason at all! And lo! twelve little dwarfs with the right spirit make all the difference. But, hey, there's a second army coming! Trouble? Naaah, wait for the aviation (eagles, always there where the script needs them...).

"nelsonhui06","9","5","11","20 December 2014"," My Review
","After much anticipation, I finally got to witness what is possibly the last film of Middle Earth from Peter Jackson. It was definitely a bitter sweet experience. While the Hobbit trilogy has its flaws, it has also been an entertaining ride thus far. I went into this film with high hopes and much anticipation, but was also worried that it may not deliver (especially after reading the mixed reviews on it). Really glad that I came out of the theater absolutely impressed and satisfied.<br/><br/>One of the things that stood out for me was that for the first time in this trilogy, Peter Jackson nailed the pacing. I thought both An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug dragged on some of its scenes way too long (i.e. in Bag End, in Laketown etc). For this one, I never once thought any of the scenes overstayed its welcome. Yes, there was a bit of filler and deviation from the book, but anyone who has been following Peter Jackson's work should come to expect that from now. If you want a carbon copy version of the book, then his films are not for you. <br/><br/>For anyone who has seen Lord of the Rings, they know that battle scenes are Peter's specialty. He has the ability to minimize battle fatigue - you never feel tired of watching random minions attack each other, and Peter does a good job at forming a story for his battles. Yes, there are tons of over the top action sequences (looking at you Legolas), but I personally am a fan of 'video game sequences. I want to be wowed by action pieces (I am paying money to see a blockbuster film). I find such scenes very entertaining - just don't take it too seriously and you will have fun too! That said, I do agree with most reviewers that the scenes with Alfred dragged on a bit too long - Peter tried a bit too hard to add some comedy into this film to break up the tension. I also found myself rolling my eyes at the shoe-horned love story of Tauriel and Fili - it was not necessarily, but fortunately it made up only a small part of the film. Rest of the plot was fine in my eyes. <br/><br/>I also read a lot of concerns over Peter's reliance on CGI. After seeing some of the trailers, I too got worried that there may be some spotty CGI. I watched this film on IMax 3D, and I thought the film looked fantastic for the most part. From the burning of Laketown, to the armies converging towards Erebor, the vision of Peter Jackson's team was breathtaking. Certainly a feast for the eyes! Yes, there is a ton of CGI, but this is a fantasy action film. I personally thought the CGI for this film was less jarring and distracting than its predecessor - definitely more polished for the most part. <br/><br/>Finally, I just want to talk about the superb acting from the main cast. Martin Freeman and Sir Ian McKellen once again nailed their roles as Bilbo and Gandalf perfectly. Martin and Richard Armitage showed great on-screen chemistry in some of the most critical and emotional scenes of the film. Truly the casting and acting for these films is what separates it from the rest of the other fantasy films, or the Star Wars prequels for that matter. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me was the ending. The Hobbit to me was always a metaphor for going out on an adventure and leaving one's comfort zone. How often do we come back home from a vacation only to feel withdraw and sadness? When Bilbo says goodbye to Gandalf and returns to his empty home, you can't help to feel the same emptiness that he is feeling - our adventures in Middle-Earth have now too concluded. ""The Last Goodbye""- sang wonderfully by Billy Boyd just did it for me in terms of emotions. Thank you Peter Jackson and crew for making these amazing films. I can't wait to watch the Extended Edition!"
"JustinFrederic","9","5","11","20 December 2014"," An Almost Perfect Sendoff to One of the Greatest Film Sagas of All Time
","I was fortunate enough to view this film opening night in a large format theatre. I read many reviews from Rotten Tomatoes criticizing it for many reasons, but I went in with an open mind.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is by far one of the best from any film in history. Watching Smaug destroy Lake Town was amazing on the big screen. It was epic and very intense, just what I had hoped for.<br/><br/>The film has brilliant moments. Thorin's ""dragon sickness"" is portrayed brilliantly by Richard Armitage. The whole Kili and Tauriel love story works very well, kudos to Peter Jackson for pulling that off. Ian McKellan is brilliant as always, and Martin Freeman proves that he really was 'born to play Bilbo' in this film.<br/><br/>The ""Battle of the Five Armies"" was very good, although I feel that it started and ended way too abruptly. Fili and Kili's death scenes were portrayed well. I really liked how Tauriel got emotional seeing Kili dying. I definitely shed a few tears at that part. Thorin's battle with Azog was also well done, and Thorin's final moments with Bilbo before he dies was beautiful. Cried at that part the most. And I really liked when Thanduil hinted to Legolas about Aragorn and the familiar ""Lord of the Rings"" theme played for a few seconds. The film ends right where ""Lord of the Rings"" begins, which I liked a lot. And the end credits with sketches of the main characters, similar to ""LOTR: Return of the King"" was brilliant. And with Billy Boyd's ""The Last Goodbye"" playing over it made it even better.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed this film for the most part, I had some issues. Firstly, the film ended without explaining what happens to Tauriel. She isn't in Lord of the Rings and I happen to really like the character, so I feel that she deserves a proper ending. My second, and main issue in this film, is that they forgot a major scene from the book: when Thorin is buried with the Arkenstone. I was furious that they didn't include that key scene. I'm sure it will be in the extended edition, but it should have been in the theatrical release. My final issue with this film is that it should have been longer by about thirty minutes. The previous instalments drew criticism for their ""formidable"" running times, but when you are making the last Middle-Earth movie, 144 minutes flies by and just isn't enough. The ending also felt rushed, as I would have liked a more emotional goodbye between Bilbo and the Dwarfs, and maybe a conversation between Bilbo and Gandalf on ""The Return Journey"", possibly about Thorin.<br/><br/>We have to give credit to Peter Jackson. He created an amazing trilogy out of a very small book. The Battle of the Five Armies in the book was a very small part, and Peter Jackson created an amazing, long Battle in this film. He has an amazing mind and must be respected for what he pulled off.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is an ""almost perfect send off to one of the greatest film sagas of all time""."
"writerever365","8","5","11","20 December 2014"," Flawed, But This Last Foray Into Middle-Earth Does Not Disappoint!
","When making a trilogy out of a children's novel, it's important for the audience to remember that there will be add-ins, changes, and things you're not OK with. But what's also important to remember, when going into any adaptation, is that you have to see it as a film first and an adaptation second.<br/><br/>The film was a success. The final chapter in the Middle-Earth saga brought me to chills and tears. As a longtime fan of Tolkien's work, I could not appreciate it as much as I'd like to, but even that did not deter me from having a good time. <br/><br/>First, the acting. Martin Freeman takes a surprising backseat here. He is still the Bilbo we know and love, but for the first half of the movie, he is not that important. His turn as Bilbo in this film is wonderfully realized, appropriately emotional and yet maintaining the sting of levity that is necessary to hold the dark events unfolding around him together. One thing in particular to look for, to the end of the film, when he is back in Bag-End, he removes the Ring from his pocket, and in a chill-inducing split second, his expression turns to outright evil, most easily describable as a ""Gollum face"". He is spectacular in every rite of the word.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan continues to amaze. His turn as Gandalf is the mark of a well-seasoned actor completely disappearing into a character. McKellan simply IS Gandalf; no substitution will do. His facial twitches and line delivery are exactly what this film needed, and he stands comfortably in the supporting role he is in. One especially good line to look for involves a wonderful interpretation of the line ""To cut the head off the snake.""<br/><br/>Richard Armitage is the true star of the film. Thorin Oakenshield could not be better played by Olivier. The effects of avarice are especially well played here, as Thorin's character spends the first two-thirds of the film completely consumed by greed. Every nuance of the character is right in place. <br/><br/>Other standout roles include Aidan Turner as Kili, Evangeline Lily as the made-up-but-oh-so-enjoyably Tauriel, Ryan Gage as Alfrid Lickspittle (gotta love that name), and Luke Evans as Bard the Bowman.<br/><br/>Now to the quality of the film itself. There is little to be said for the effects, as it has all already been said. Cutting edge, crystalline clear graphics permeate the movie and almost overwhelm at times. The music is perfect, especially the credits song by Billy Boyd.<br/><br/>Where the movie falters is the script and story. I made no boons about how disappointed I was with how they ended the second film, and that disappointment sadly carries on here. When the second film ended, what everyone was looking forward to was the death of Smaug in this last film. Smaug's death is sadly glossed over and finished before the title of the film shows. Furthermore, the film feels disjointed and jumbled at times, like they were just going through the story scene by scene. The movie does not hold well together in the beginning-middle section. Thankfully, they were able to pull it all in together by the middle-ending for a truly memorable movie.<br/><br/>One of the things I was happy about was the tone of the ending. One of my big worries was that they would end it too happily. What most people need to remember is that this is only the halfway point. The Ring corrupts, and its corruption is the cause of the Lord of the Rings. I really did hope for the correct emotion going from Battle of the Five Armies into Fellowship of the Ring, and I was not disappointed. As mentioned previously, you can see, in a completely haunting millisecond, the effects of the Ring already taking their toll on Bilbo.<br/><br/>Memorable scenes include the Dragon's death, Thorin's Insanity On the Gold, the Battle at Dol Guldur, the Earth-Eaters, and the Fight on the Ice. You will not want to miss these excellent scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is flawed, but those flaws do not stop the film from being immensely enjoyed by all!"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","5","11","18 December 2014"," Battle of the Five Armies ends the trilogy in an emotionally satisfying way
","Despite the idea of turning J.R.R. Tolkien's prelude to the Lord of the Rings ""The Hobbit"" into a three film adaptation receiving mixed reactions, Peter Jackson returned to Middle-Earth with ""An Unexpected Journey"", the first half of the story, which received mixed to positive reviews, but fans of Tolkien's work and other people loved it, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"", the second half of the story, while not being as well received as the original trilogy, got much better reviews than everyone anticipated. Now, at last, this year, Peter Jackson ends the trilogy with ""The Battle of the Five Armies"".<br/><br/>Taking place right where the previous film left off, Smaug flies from Erebor to Lake Town and burns it. Meanwhile, Bilbo and the Dwarfs led by the power-driven Thorin Oakenshield have been forced to engage in a war against the people of Lake Town, the elves, and the Orcs led by Azog the Defiler and keep the treasure from them at all costs.<br/><br/>After seeing the first two Hobbit films, I went to see this with my siblings and a friend of ours, hoping that it would exceed my expectations. It did and... I can't believe it's over. For over thirteen years, Hollywood has enchanted us with the original trilogy and with this to close not only the prequel trilogy, but the adventures on Middle-Earth as well, I really love this even more than the first two films. An Unexpected Journey did drag itself too long and it had an uneven tone while Desolation of Smaug only had an ""that's it?"" ending, but Peter Jackson has managed to improve on the previous two and did it perfectly.<br/><br/>Not only does the story channel the last act of the Hobbit book, it also managed to tie in some of the loose ends from their predecessors while connecting other elements to the original trilogy. It also gives you the feels to what will happen if the dwarfs would win the war and defeat Azog or not and it shows. Even it's moments hits the emotional resonance that the original trilogy brought. The pacing, on it's 144 minute length, is very brisk.<br/><br/>The characters are still as good as they are even in the previous films. Especially Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield. Martin Freeman gives the character the same level of confidence and bravery while Richard Armitage still retains the brooding, and sympathetic personality to Thorin driven by greed, power, and hatred and as always, his performance is beyond intense as I thought. The other characters, including Gandalf, Galadriel, Saruman, Elrond, and Legolas, the cameos from the original trilogy, do what they can to help the dwarfs defeat the Orcs and while they also give the same good performances, the action sequences with them are fantastic. Smaug, despite his small appearance, manages to give a terrifying presence Benedict Cumberbatch still maintains from the previous film.<br/><br/>The music score from Howard Shore not only gives an emotional depth to the film, but the action music while retaining some of the same bits from the previous films and the original trilogy is really breathtaking with it's epic choir and contains suspense and atmosphere perfectly. Then, there's the action sequences. Aside from the ones with the characters from the original trilogy, the climax between the five armies and the battle between the dwarfs and Azog the Defiler is a contender for the best action sequences in the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies marks the end of the adventures on Middle-Earth and as an improvement over the last two films, this is my recommendation to Tolkien fans and those who read the Hobbit. A solid thumbs up from me! :)"
"DarthVoorhees","6","5","11","16 December 2014"," Suffers from Jackson's egotism and 'Phantom Menace' prequel syndrome
","Can I really hate 'The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies'? Possibly but I'd be something of a hypocrite if I did. This is a Jackson film through and through. His tendencies as a filmmaker and writer are dialed up to their utmost extremities. I do like Jackson and even after re-watching his first 'Hobbit' effort I came to grudgingly appreciating it even if it was flawed. The problem here though is that the movie isn't much of a movie even by Jackson's standards. The entire film is one long battle sequence for the most part. Does Jackson do a battle sequence well? Of course. If such a thing is all you are concerned with then this film may be a masterpiece. I look back though to 'Fellowship of the Ring' which was Jackson's first and best Middle Earth film. It had spectacle and drawn out action to be sure but it realized much like Tolkien did that Middle Earth with all it's wonders was only as good as the characters that inhabit it. This film assumes too much(or too little) of it's audiences. I very much get the feeling Jackson felt he had already done everything he needed to with his characters and so no new nuances are explored. What follows is a battle and fan service...<br/><br/>I wrote in my original view of 'An Unexpected Journey' that despite the flaws of that film Jackson was spot on in his casting of Martin Freeman in the title role. I stand by that. Had this been a concise 'Hobbit' adaptation that actually cared about hobbits and not warriors then I would say Freeman could have given an Academy Award winning performance. My biggest problem with this picture is that Bilbo is a prop, baggage meant for the dwarfs and bigger warriors to carry. He gets so little screen time to really do anything significant at all. More time and emphasis is given to Legolas ( who was not in the original novel) and Tauriel (who does not exist in any Tolkien work). I am reminded of Thorin Oakenshield's dying words to Bilbo which touched me greatly as I read Tolkien's novel,""If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world"". Jackson has never valued food and cheer and song. He's valued warriors. A throw away moment to every other viewer struck me profoundly. Bilbo is about to be attacked by Orcs and he still flinches. Couldn't Jackson have allowed Bilbo to have gained his courage to actually fight alongside the big boys? Couldn't he have saved them by this point in the story? It would have given weight to a title character that the film really doesn't care about. It would have given Martin Freeman, an excellent actor, something to do. Why couldn't Bilbo have destroyed Azog the defiler? <br/><br/>There's a lot of fan service here. Annoyingly so. I was reminded a lot of the 'Star Wars' prequels who would take the time to consistently wink at the camera. Why is this necessary? I suppose it's fun but the level this film takes it to is ridiculous. I think it exists merely because Jackson knows he cannot fill this film to a normal capacity. This film is padded beyond being reasonable and so he tries to borrow credibility from his superior films. It doesn't work and is just silly. I'm tired of gloomy pretentious dialogue about Sauron. <br/><br/>I suppose though that I cannot really hate this film. I can dislike things about it but the formula still works. There's as always a lot of imagination and passion to the performances. Jackson can effectively stage a huge battle scene and that is commendable. It's more fun than any other big action set pieces that have come out this year. The problem is that while the battle is spectacular not much else is."
"luke-walpole","9","5","11","16 December 2014"," The End of a Journey
","To set the scene, Smaug has been awoken and has Lake Town firmly in his sights. Whilst he char grills the town, the dwarfs watch on anxiously, with Bilbo's final, desperate monologue of ""What have we done?"" from The Desolation of Smaug becoming a visible nightmare. The Dragon is dealt with and all eyes turn to the mountain. The Dwarfs, led by Thorin, seek to hold onto their newly claimed home, yet every man and his proverbial dog, horse, warg, ludicrous Elk (King Thranduil), or even more ridiculous Pig (King Dain) want a share of the gold. Thus tensions bubble up to explosion on the battlefield as Men, Dwarfs and Elves take on the Orc and Warg ridden armies of Sauron. <br/><br/>As we can expect, the action scenes are sprawling and magnificent to behold, but it is much more than a bombastic war movie, and here's where I think the strengths lie. The power of Jackson is that amidst the whole scale destruction there is always a humanity present, a sense of helplessness and the feeling that the stories are more to do with character arcs and development than just meaningless blood-shed. We all love the action scenes, and they're the ones we wax lyrical about when we come out of the cinema, yet in this film in particular, the anchor to the plot is the story of Thorin. Richard Armitage simply plays a blinder in this film, stealing the lime light from the once again excellent Bilbo and the thoroughly impressive Bard. This is an arc within a arc; the descent into madness then the redemption of a dwarf who will not fall to the same dragon sickness as his grandfather. But this isn't some hammy Shakespearean actor reeling off their best Richard III impression, this is much more persuasive and powerful stuff. <br/><br/>Further positives include the desolation of Smaug in full force. Cumberbatch's serpentine tones leave you transfixed and wanting more. Indeed, it's a shame that he's dispatched so quickly, yet the reality is that there wasn't any way that they could have conceivably stretched it out anymore, so it becomes a hollow criticism. As I mentioned, Bard is brilliant as the reluctant King of Lake Town and the arrival of King Dain – a ridiculously CGI-ed Billy Connolly – offers genuine comedic rest bite from what can be a pretty grim two and a half hours. <br/><br/>On the point of CGI, here's where my gripes start. The tone of the film is meant to be different to LOTR, this I appreciate; the source material is lighter so it makes sense to make the baddies more mythic. But I think that this tonal shift at times undercuts the peril of the action. For example, Bard gets a pretty epic, legolas-worthy spate of badassery where he kills a troll, yet the Troll looks more like Wayne Rooney than a terrifying creature meant to strike fear into your hearts. Moreover I think that the decision to make Azog and Bolg mo-capped as opposed to genuine physical presences undermines their on screen presence. The most visceral battle scenes, in my opinion, are in Dale when Bard leads the beleaguered men of the Lake against blokes dressed up as Orcs, not coming from an admittedly very impressive computer. <br/><br/>A point of both praise and criticism is that the film seems acutely aware that it needs to give nods to, and in some ways emulate, LOTR. In some ways it's really good to see, such as the size of the battles and the cinematic deaths of some characters instantly creating a stylistic flashback to Boromir in the Fellowship. Finally Bard is a pseudo Aragorn in the sense that he is the reluctant leader of men. These are subtle cinematic nods. But I think the plot strands can be slightly shoe-horned in. For example, the forbidden love of Tauriel and Kili smacks of the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. Also, the final dialogue between Thranduil and Legolas tries to create a tangible link between the trilogies, but just feels a bit forced. <br/><br/>All of this aside, and I think that it is triumphant. Both characters old and new come together to create a rousing couple of hours of entertainment. The old band is given their curtain call – Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond etc. Whilst the new characters deservedly become an appreciated part of the canon. Thranduil is chilling, Tauriel is moving (and I fell in love with her again), Bard is bold, the dwarfs are given more to say and Bilbo and Thorin steer the ship. It is imperfect, but every film is. When you put it amongst the other 5 films it doesn't stand out in a negative way, indeed the battle scenes rival the Return of the King in terms of scope. This is as shining an endorsement as any."
"oskar_toledo1128","3","5","11","11 December 2014"," Coming from the Theatrical Screening, Rating 7/5
","OK, first of all, i must tell you that i am not a extreme Tolkien purist and i will not going to complain about the accuracy of the movie in relation to the novel, you had hear enough about it by now; Secondly, and as a warning for those who haven't read the book or seeing the movie yet, THERE ARE SPOILERS on this comment, so don't go further. OK, to the point: I rate the Theatrical release 4, because it is a BAD movie on the make, not doubt about it, and i have the knowledge of the now mandatory Extended Edition will come the next year, a Edition that will try to fix thing and not add new good stuff. BOTFA is not near even a good film, because its is full whit too many gaps, narrative problems and plot holes all over, but specially at the ending, been that fact that makes feel the actual final chapter as a whole, too rushed, delivered to only fulfill the product demand just on time to please the masses-fanboys and go straight forward to some film award nominations. I loved Peter J in the past for his effort to bring the Middle Earth alive, but in the case of the Hobbit, that was done at what cost?. Is he tired of the story?, Is there no more time or more money?, Was he short of source material or ideas?, maybe, i don't know for sure, but take note of this: 1)Smaug, one of the main and well done CG characters, had almost no time on screen and he is dead in a snap. 2)Thorin's dwarf company and main protagonists of the story, had almost no time on screen. 3) What about the actual battle of the five armies, gathering Dwarfs, Elves and Men against a common evil? Visual stunning?, yes... for a very little time, but a tactical mess and worst of all, pointless at the zenith, why? We are able to see Dwarfs forming protective shield ranks, Elves gallantly jumping over and dispatching the first wave of Orcs whit their blades... and never using their deadly trained archers, meanwhile men does nothing. And when the the battle tide change in favor of the bad guys, the men break ranks and go back to the now under siege Dale Town to protect their women and children, left there a day before, and leaving the dwarfs and elves alone to... well, the dwarfs to make a last stand on the front of the gate at the lonely mountain and the uber trained elvish army to... vanished to never see them again on screen without any reason. 4) The death of Thorin, Kili and Fili in a nonsensical move, riding mountain goats that materialize from nowhere, leaving the rest of the dwarf army, now under the command of the self proclaimed new King Thorin, to their fate, only to search fight alone against the main Orc villains Azog and Bolg, in the classic hand to hand showdown, which is the worst part for me because i had pictured they dying in combat in the main battle, one at the side of another, in the a fore mentioned last stand, and before the rest of the good guys could been saved by, and as always, the Air Force, i mean, the Eagles. 5)What happened to the Arc Stone?. 6) Who reclaim the mountain in the end(see the pointless of the battle!)?. 7) What happened to Bard and his people?. 8) In which terms ends the Elves, Dwarfs and Men after all?. 9) Does Bilbo plants his Tree back on the Shire?. 9) The monster eating-dirt super maggots, WTF?. 10) Turiel not dying at the end, Why??? She and her SO GLUED love affair were invented for the movies, so she could and should be killed. And finally, we have the once upon a time so badass Legolas, now appearing only to be cartoonerized to fit in this story, making a little more cameo on screen, and just to force the link to the first trilogy. Well, those are some points that i wanna take off my chest and share whit you all, because those are the little things that makes the whole movie wrong and disturbs me the most about this PJ vision of the story and make me sad and so mad about the ending, which was reduced to a full packed action and pseudo-sentimental movie, whit much of the potential misplaced, because the Director and Writers wanted to play more in the way of checkers than Chess on this one, for the last time. However, and on the other hand, i gladly will revisit the movie on cinema for a one and solely purpose: Contemplate once again the scene of Cathe Blanchett and her epic five minutes play on screen alongside Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Christopher Lee and Mr. Hugo Weaving, because that scene worth the price of the ticket and makes you forget that the rest of the movie could had been a better written story, but is just crap."

","I'm gonna say it, I think that line there it better than the whole movie. One chapter to ruin them all. This is the trashiest culmination of flashy, gaudy, ostentatious garbage I've ever seen. They invented a gigantic albino character to just add screen time, then make up a fictitious 45 minute battle that was just ridiculous. A book that was about dwarves reclaiming a lost heirloom and ancestral home, turned into as many over the top battled as could be squeezed in between poorly written uneducated jokes.
What makes this whole ordeal worse, and I cant explain it to save my life, is how people are giving these movies a rating of 9 and 10. Compared to the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, these arent even coming to close to a 3. And only in a world where those first 3 movies didnt exist, MAYBE! we could say these arent absolute garbage. Tolkien loved untamed wild nature, and Mckellen wept bc he didn't even get to see his companions most of the time while filming. The use of green screens is appalling."

"fmagill-19440","3","2","3","22 August 2018"," Some good fun but too much new stuff and too many loose ends.
","I realize these films are several years old, but maybe this review will help someone who is considering spending a little money on PPV or DVD's. My advice: buy them on sale or watch for them on TV and use your DVR to speed thru all the commercials. I have read the entire LOTR saga, The Hobbit plus the trilogy, at least six times, and The Silmarillion once. I loved the original LOTR trilogy by Peter Jackson. My reaction to the three Hobbit movies? Meh. The first part of my headline above could really apply to all three Hobbit films, not just this extremely disappointing finale. There is way too much extraneous material that was invented by Jackson and his team, obviously in order to bloat a simple, 300-page story into almost nine hours of film. The story could and should have been told in one film, and had Jackson stuck as closely to the book as he tried to do with the LOTR, it probably would have been just as good as those films were. But instead we're ""treated"" to many unnecessary and often annoying embellishments, chief among them the idiotic ""romance"" between elf and dwarf. All that does is diminish the significance of the friendship between Legolas and Gimli in the LOTR, in my view. Battle scenes are overdone and repetitious, Legolas must really be Superman in disguise, trolls and giants can't really be such powder puffs in combat, and please, not the eagles again. Moreover, despite the bloated size of this trilogy, it manages to leave out some really important parts of the story, such as Beorn's role in the Battle of the Five Armies. Finally, for anyone who hasn't read the book, the last 30 minutes of BOTFA leaves them scratching their heads wondering what happened to all those people like Thurandil and Beorn and Bard, and what about the Necromancer and Elrond and Galadriel and Saruman? All these loose ends left dangling in the breeze after all that screen time is just inexcusable. If you want to spend some time with the Hobbit, you're much better off just reading the novel. Then go watch the original LOTR trilogy again."
"kristoffer-46","7","2","3","15 March 2018"," The Legendarium who could have been better
","The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five armies was a movie I both longed to see but also dreaded to see. For knowing that it was the last of the Hobbit movies I felt sad that the adventure in Middle-Earth was about to come to an end but at the same time I felt excited to see how the ending would turn out. Having read The Hobbit book before the movie came out I already knew which characters would die, and what would happen in the main parts of the story but still I looked forward to see it all on the big screen. <br/><br/>I liked both of the two other movies and have always looked at the movies and books in separate ways as I believe the two mediums are simply too different to compare with each other. However for me this movie sadly failed on many levels, and the only thing keeping it together was the continuing excellence of the actors. <br/><br/>The overuse of CGI really killed a lot of magic in this movie and I've heard it did so for many others as well. CGI was of course used in both Desolation of Smaug & An Unexpected Journey but not as much and in the same way as it was used here. It felt as if the production was very rushed and sadly this caused many things to simply be replaced by CGI and pointless scenes of action. And the many scenes with Legolas also annoyed me as even though I like the character and the performance of Orlando Bloom, it simply felt that it was far too much and that focusing so much time on a character who are not even mentioned in the book just felt wrong and misplaced. It is really a shame that the production company did not give Peter Jackson and crew more time to give this legendarium the ending it deserved, as it felt that much could have been improved. <br/><br/>The scenes that are good in the movie are however very good, as once again the amazing actors/actress delivers great performances. However all in this movie ends a very unique trilogy and even though it is the weakest of the three it is still a movie that all lovers of fantasy should see (If you have watched the other two). <br/><br/>7/10 Good!"
"gavinp9","7","2","3","2 January 2018"," Too much going on, but an adequate resolution to this trilogy
","The third - and final - Hobbit film is a valiant attempt to recapture the 'Lord of the Rings' magic of Middle Earth, but too often feels tired and repetitive, especially in the sixth film in the franchise. It's by no means bad, it's just - as with the first two Hobbit films - unnecessarily padded, with lots of flashbacks and scenes of staring into the distance. I'm still not convinced the three Hobbit films couldn't have worked as one cohesive 3 & a bit hour film...<br/><br/>Even though the second film featured his name in the title, Smaug (Cumberbatch) is quickly dealt with and the plot hastily progresses to be about the humans - led by Bard (Evans) - tying to move into the Mountain with the Dwarves - led by Thorin (Armitage) & a mostly redundant cameo from Dain (Connolly). To complicate things, the Elves - led by Legolas (Bloom)'s dad - show up too and then the Orcs arrive. By my count, that's four armies. The fifth army never really eventuates... Gandalf (McKellen) & Bilbo (Freeman) are left stuck in the middle of all this.<br/><br/>There's some quick appearances from Elrond (Weaving), Galadriel (Blanchett) & Saruman (Lee), which are unnecessary and don't add to the plot. There's some good battle scenes, but nothing to top 'The Two Towers' or 'The Return of the King'. Some mild humour thrown in, but a lot of the film feels bogged down and aware it's ""the defining chapter"" or ""the final farewell"" as it's been billed.<br/><br/>Plenty of frustrating moments - Tauriel (Lilly)'s ""romance"" with Kili (Turner), Thorin's ""dragon sickness"", the get-out-of-jail-card that the Eagles pose. Despite these, the score is still great, with the use of the familiar motifs still effective and the cinematography beautiful."

There wasn't much of a plot, just a lot of computer effects that start to get boring and ""armies"" going at one another. The Ring hardly has a presence in this film; it should have been used more. The dragon dies in the first 10 minutes and then for some unknown reason, Thorin gets all the gold and the townspeople get none. How come? Thorin didn't rescue the city. And what did the elf King have to do with anything. He helps rescue Gandolph then disappears. There was just too many things like that.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst of the franchise.

"FilmAlicia","6","2","3","6 July 2015"," Disappointing in view of Jackson's triumphant LOTR film trilogy
","This review contains significant SPOILERS:<br/><br/>I finally saw the final installment of Jackson's take on Tolkien's children's book, ""The Hobbit."" While Jackson's beautiful LOTR film trilogy was a work of art on its own terms, bringing what was thought to be an impossible-to-film work to memorable life, ""The Hobbit"" trilogy seems curiously lifeless and half-hearted. <br/><br/>Tolkien's original work is a bit long for a children's book, and there are sections that I personally find tedious. But, the book comes to life when Bilbo finds the Ring, and begins to discover the hero within him (or the Took within the Baggins, as Tolkien would have it). <br/><br/>That leads to, what is, for me, the best chapter in the book, ""Spiders and Flies."" I literally want to stand up and cheer as Bilbo attacks the giant spiders, and rescues his dwarfish friends. This sequence, which I thought was the best section of the book, was given such short shrift the second installment of the Hobbit trilogy that it was practically non-existent. <br/><br/>And, as others have suggested, this is the basic flaw in Jackson's Hobbit films. Bilbo Baggins is reduced to practically a minor character in the story that bears his name. As Bilbo, Martin Freeman, a likable, if not compelling, actor, spends most of his screen time looking vaguely befuddled. In ""The Battle of the Five Armies,"" the main characters appear to be Bard, then Thorin, then, Gandalf, and then, maybe, Bilbo. <br/><br/>And what is Orlando Bloom, as Legolas, doing in this film? Not only was he not in the original story, but Bloom has, if you will pardon the exact pun, lost his bloom. While he is as handsome as ever, he looks 12 years older than he did in ""The Return of the King,"" and seems completely out-of-place in the film. Evangeline Lilly makes a great elf, and is a pleasure to look at, and I had no particular objections to the character of Tauriel, except that she wasn't in the book, and that Tolkien would probably rotate in his grave at the idea of a romance between an elf and a dwarf.<br/><br/>Without going into the multiple problems in the first 2 ""Hobbit"" films, my main complaint about the trilogy finale, is, that when a movie is called the ""Battle of the Five Armies"" we should see the good guys win the climactic battle. <br/><br/>Instead, Jackson and his co-writers chose to shift the story's focus to the deaths of Fili, Kili, and Thorin Oakenshield. This could have been wonderful as a means of showing the human (or dwarfish) cost of the war, but instead Jackson and company appear to have entirely forgotten to end the battle, except for the suspense-free announcement ""The eagles are coming."" The death of Thorin should have been moving, but coming at the hands of such a lifeless and unconvincing CGI villain, simply seemed to me like an inferior replay of the death of Boromir, in LOTR. <br/><br/>And, following the unsatisfying climax, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"" appears to trail off rather than having a proper denouement. Since the original subtitle of the book was ""There and Back Again"" we should have had some sense of closure at the end, and should leave Bilbo in peace to write about his adventures. Instead, we leave him on a sour note as the Ring is already beginning to tempt him and warp his winsome personality. I can't help but think that Bilbo Baggins deserves better."
"ooolga-39356","6","2","3","2 July 2015"," A muddled confusion...or confused muddle.
","First of all: though I am not a great expert of incredible Tolkien's world (something I read, something I didn't), I do respect his works and do not find the idea of changing the canon on a whim by the filmmakers rather appealing.<br/><br/>General impression of the entire movie-trilogy: it is a muddle. Trying to feed the story to the audience such as I belong to (non-experts of Tolkien) by making it more obvious - they just made everything worse. The result is sometimes incoherent, sometimes illogical and sometimes ridiculous and unconvincing. <br/><br/>Althoug there are undeniable ""bright spots"", to be sure:<br/><br/>1) Nice picture and costumes and environment and all. Impressive.<br/><br/>2) Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins - is brilliant. There could be more of him, but - sadly - there wasn't. He often was overshadowed by ""epic muddling"" of the others.<br/><br/>3) Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield - he fits perfectly, end of story:) He did a great job. Talented actor he is, constantly delivering us the play of the highest quality. Though the story is not about him originally but about Bilbo - and in the movie they made it as if it was all about Thorin.<br/><br/>4) Lee Pace as Thranduil the Elven King - well, this one is the Jewel! The pure diamond in this muddle. He is fabulous, he is absolutely brilliant. Thranduil stole the show. Notwithstanding all his grandeur and pathos there is a certain humorous element about him at some moments. He is heading his elven army riding the giant elk with enormous antlers, no less! :))) His glossy arrogant, menacingly cool, haughtily pathos,malevolent, narcissistically glamorous character just made this movie for me and made me sitting and watching and laughing whilst I was growing fed up with all the mess and was tempted to abandon it. <br/><br/>5) Benedict Cumberbatch's voice as a dragon Smaug. It's worth hearing in it's own merit. By the voice alone Cumberbatch delivered much more of the real performance than dull and annoying Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) with all her dramatic looks and making eyes.<br/><br/>And now - about the silliest and the most ridiculous things: <br/><br/>1) Tauriel- which is non-existent character - is unnecessary addition to the plot. The story gains nothing here. Evangeline Lilly as she is - though has quite pretty face - is annoying and unpleasant. She is at her annoying worst. And here she plays exactly the same ""Kate Austen""- character as in ""Lost""-series and in the same irritating manner. At certain moments I've been experiencing sort of deja-vu and felt as if I was actually watching "" Lost"". I'd rather prefer the movie without a single woman in it than with ""Tauriel"" of that sort.<br/><br/>2) Love story as such in here. In ""Hobbit"", seriously ? Whatever for? It is inept and inappropriate. It is ridiculous and doesn't fit. Tolkien didn't write that sort of stuff. Yes, there were few love stories in his books, but all of them were extremely epic and high-ranking due to the participants, their level and significance of events. The pallid eye-making at each other, called ""love story"" here is definitely neither of aforementioned. <br/><br/>3) Love story between the elf and the dwarf. Ha-ha-ha! There is something sickly and morbid in the very concept of it, you know. And it ruins the very idea of how the system functions in the Tolkien's world - even for me it's obvious, let alone for the experts of Tolkien. I am surprised they didn't go further and performed the hobbit-elf or orc-elf relationship for that matter...or any other morbid perversions (for example Gandalf-Galadriel, Azog- Thorin pairing - because they are as much ""why not"" as any other non- existent rubbish in this movie).<br/><br/>4) Love story as delivered here. It was badly written and badly played. They were boring, pathetic and ridiculous, both of them. It seemed they were forced to make it because it was kind of obvious as the credit for Tauriel's presence and they spared a lot of screen-time for nothing.<br/><br/>5) The character of Alfrid. Though was not badly done by the actor...but was totally pointless and useless as such. Who cares? Who gives a damn about Alfrid? Whatever for he even was there , spending so much of the screen time? The scenes with him supposed to be funny and refreshing, I guess...but they were boring and stupid and obvious, and I personally only waited for them to end and for Alfrid to disappear , because he was insignificant and not interesting.<br/><br/>So ""6"" is my vote. For Martin Freeman, for Richard Armitage, but for the royal presence of Thranduil and Lee Pace's outstanding performance mainly, which was a pure joy to watch and which made me watch it through."
"pickard233","5","2","3","11 May 2015"," An impressive vision, executed poorly
","I owe The Hobbit (the book) a lot in the way of sparking my imagination as a child. It was a fantastic story of a little guy doing big things, having grand adventures, and seeing an impressive outside world.<br/><br/>When I heard Peter Jackson was going to do the Hobbit, I was both excited and nervous. As were many. When I heard he was splitting it into two parts, I thought 'okay, makes sense'. But when they announced they were going to split it into THREE parts, my heart sunk. I knew they would be stretching, an already rather short story, thin. <br/><br/>Sad to say, I believe I was right.<br/><br/>I wasn't overly impressed with the first installment, but very much enjoyed the second. I think mainly due to the City on The Lake and Bard's character/story being an interesting and engaging tale to tackle, and even found it more entertaining than the main story. That along side the brilliant Smaug, left me excited for the third film. <br/><br/>Battle of Five Armies starts off immediately after the finish of the second film... Which was the first of many, many problems. It felt horrendously out of place and absolutely should have been the end to the second movie. <br/><br/>From then on everything seemed very oddly put together. The event's didn't seem logically cohesive, and the film repeatedly left me wondering 'what the hell is the point in that?' The storytelling was easily the weakest of all the Middle Earth films. The editing was chaotic and poor. Unnecessary over the top CGI plagued otherwise brilliant make-up, costume and set pieces. And the dialogue/dramatic moments were borderline cringe worthy. <br/><br/>I get the feeling this particular film would have benefited greatly from being down scaled, with the focus being on the characters in the 'situation' rather than the situation itself.<br/><br/>The 'situation' of course being the battle of five armies. A disappointing mess of 'what the F%#k is going on?' which felt tired and re-used from previous LOTR films. <br/><br/>I understand that it was suppose to be an big epic finale to the series, but it came across severely rushed and so plot riddled that by the end you ask yourself 'Is that it?' <br/><br/>Overall the film seemed to focus on the wrong things. And more than often, totally unnecessary things. I still cannot for the life of me understand why Albert got as much wasted screen time as he did, since he brought nothing but eye-rolling 'humour' to the film. <br/><br/>I could go on forever about things that were wrong with the film, but to be honest, the things that were right, were few and far between. The acting, in spite of poorly written dialogue and characters, was on spot. Even the bizarre romance between Kili and Tauriel was played out well (considering their back story and reasons for falling in love were nil). The costumes and make up were fantastic (as always), and the score/ sound effects were wonderful.<br/><br/>There are so few moments where this film shines, and as far as entertainment go, it was rather banal. Also, I know Jackson copped a lot of criticism from the length of Return of the Kings ending, however this one felt far, far too rushed and anti-climatic.<br/><br/>So much potential wasted."
"vincent_tillema","8","8","21","11 December 2014"," Fitting finale
","The Battle of the Five Armies finally closes the biggest and most epic fantasy series to ever hit the big screen. And it does so in a fitting way: grand, epic and making the last connections to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>The usual gripes of the Hobbit trilogy are still there: too much CGI, too little story mainly. But just like the Desolation of Smaug this is mostly forgiven by the way Jackson has once again managed to make everything work together. It doesn't feel as 'real' as LotR did, but by now we've come accustomed to the leading Ork villains being CGI characters. Unfortunately, in high frame rate resolution the CGI can be a bit clunky and fake. And if BotFA makes one thing clear, it is that this series should've never been a trilogy. Half of the first movie could've been cut, Smaug and the actual battle could've been one movie. Alas, that's not what happened. <br/><br/>Does that mean BotFA is a disappointment, victim of a story stretched too thin? No. All story there is serves to set up one of the biggest battles we've seen in the series, including LotR. One that is sure to excite. The finale on a misty and icy tower especially ranks among the best set pieces in Jackson's take on the series. Underlying themes of dragon's greed, akin to LotR's One Ring obsession work well and show a Thorin Oakenshield that grows ever more insane. <br/><br/>Smaug's short presence in this movie is sweet, but in the end made me wish his story would've been either wrapped up in the previous movie or be bigger in this one. A great character with so much screen presence, and a shame to only be in here for a few minutes. <br/><br/>There actually is a lot of great humor as well. And big surprise: it isn't even distracting! Right- hand to Laketown's ruler, Alfrid, especially has some great scenes. Although I can imagine people disliking him. Personally, I feel he was a great addition, just like some of the Dwarf fighting and the new uses of the Cave Trolls. <br/><br/>Meeting up with the Shire for once last time, finally, was a bit emotional. A sort of cinematic homecoming after all these years. A sense of the peril in Middle Earth finally being over. And while BotFA isn't perfect and certainly has its flaws (most of which are true for all 3 Hobbit movies) it is a fitting finale to a fun and entertaining trilogy.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ajith_thiy","1","7","18","23 December 2014"," Awful movie
","I made an account because I just had to comment on how awful this movie is as a standalone film, as a trilogy with the Hobbit series and in comparison to LOTR.<br/><br/>Great acting by all involved however the script and screenplay has failed them due to Peter Jackson's arrogance and overuse of CGI. The CGI creates a sense that we are watching something out of a video game/ anime because it appears like a cartoon and fake. The first half of the movie is pretty good but completely shatters once the actual battle begins with the humans/ dwarfs/ elves against the goblin army. Unlike what most commentators have said, I as a hopeless romantic enjoyed the love story between the dwarf and the elf, HOWEVER, it was underdeveloped, clichéd and (SPOILER) tragic. Was there any point in Tauriel spending all that time in the 2nd film saving Klee's life when he will die anyways and she falls in despair?? Bilbo Baggins is sidelined and has very few moments and lines to say. Amazing since this is called the HOBBIT. Basically an hour of screen space and time is used up for overlong battles that defy gravity and physics, and a cluster of CGI animation that confuses and blinds us beneath our 3D glasses. Seriously, I had a headache all throughout this movie. Thorin battled one goblin (the leader) for literally what felt like 30 minutes and died after watching its face swim smoothly beneath the sheet of ice, looking up at him! Are you kidding me?? Also, how can Legolas and Tauriel kill like 50 goblins in a few minutes but struggle to kill just one. This one kills Klee, severely injures Tauriel and has God smiling upon it as it survives a hundred lethal blows from all parties concerned. Legolas is an unneeded character and this is due to him not even being a part of the novel. The dwarfs all look the same to me and have almost no lines to say. Thorin's cousin appears and disappears in the blink of an eye. Bard's role was good but we never found out what happened to him or the elves. This whole film was useless and boring.<br/><br/>Overall, this is failed cinema in order to mooch every penny from our pockets (SURPRISE!) I'm just happy I watched Hunger Games: M-Part 1 first because it was a far superior film with almost no action scenes whatsoever! I got into Hobbit free afterwards with 3D glasses because I knew it would be a waste of money.<br/><br/>If Peter Jackson wanted to make another epic fantasy series after LOTR he could have adapted the Wheel of Time or a Mercedes Lackey novel series. Instead he butchered a 300 page novel into 3 movies and made a lot of money out of it. I hope his future films are better (and it will be, he is a great director if he has the content to make a proper film). I rate it 4/10 strictly for the great acting, decent buildup and a lovable character in the form of Bilbo Baggins. P.S. I am a 21 year old law student and care more for the story of a film than useless Hollywood CGI special effects. Hollywood, technology does not make a film better. The best sci-fi movies were in the 1980's with very minimal CGI effects and more care taken towards the story treatment and execution."

PETERE JACKSON is a LEGEND.<br/><br/>I loved the battle scene but still, they were cut I think and some of the trailers scenes did not appear in the theatrical version, which gives my guess a chance.<br/><br/>The love of gold and money was so powerful and true especially while showing how mad Thorin had gone. <br/><br/>The music is amazing and I loved how he linked the hobbit to the LOTR using just Legolas and Aragorn but I think that there will be something surprising in the extended version completely like the Desolation Of Smaug <br/><br/>Last thing, I enjoyed it a lot and can't wait to watch again in the few coming days and I eagerly wait for the extended version."
"jamamaes","8","5","12","12 January 2015"," End of a film era.
","the original lord of the rings trilogy are my favourite films of all time. I loved all three and when the Hobbits first came out my expectations were a lot higher so perhaps I did not enjoy the last three instalments as much but they are still brilliant and well made films. There is no one else on the planet that could have made these six films I all as good as Peter Jackson has made them. If people did not like this film or the other hobbits then that is fine but lets be thank full that they have been made and to as good of standard of film cinematography as possible. The battle scenes in all of the films and particularly this one are second to none they are amazingly created. It must be very difficult to actually produce the high action quality that is shown and I could watch it all day. Sometimes it does become a bit too much but this isn't something I would say is such a bad thing. I love the action in this film. The acting is very good, couldn't name someone who could play Bilbo as well as Martin Freeman has done and the same goes for Gandalf with Ian McKellen there are a lot of good acting with this film. I also really liked the ending where it ends where the lord of the rings takes off.<br/><br/>However there was some flaws within the story and felt that with some parts left unexplained. The unexplained parts could be within the books which then is something I would have to explore and probably will do. I think with the huge battle scenes some things get left to just be accepted. What I would say is that I do find it a bit annoying that not just for this film *spoilers* that the eagles have to save the day, again and again. If this is sticking to the books then that is okay but this is one thing I don't really like or understand fully. With all the elves, dwarfs, men, wizards, spirits that the only way of stopping the enemy is through eagles swooping in to win the battle. If they was explained more or given a section of the film or a previous film to say why they turn up and help all the time it would be great. This one little thing does have a little annoyance to me.<br/><br/>Furthermore I absolutely loved all the lord of the rings and hobbit movies, I am so gutted that there will be no more of them. It is like an end of an era in film for me as I grew up watching these films and loved every moment of them. I am going to buy this film when it comes out along with the rest of the hobbits to have all of them. would recommend this film to anyone but would have to of had a love for the lord of the rings or the previous hobbits to fully enjoy and understand the true brilliance of this franchise. Lastly which perhaps wont get as much credit as it deserves is the song at the end of the film through the credits performed by Billy Boyd, I loved this song and had to listen to it again and again, Brilliant.<br/><br/>8/10 but a 10/10 for the whole trilogy."

","The Hobbit trilogy has overall been a really fun and exciting set of films but the major flaw has been that for the most part they can't stand on their own. They always feel like one film in a trilogy but now that the trilogy is complete, I can honestly say that it's the best looking, most colorful, best produced trilogy of films I have ever seen. It's amazing how well they take a small children's story and make it into an incredible, epic trilogy.<br/><br/>A complaint with the previous two films was too much filler, it is clear in this film that Peter Jackson has only included the more valuable scenes for the story (except for a certain master's deputy.)Each scene in some way contributes to the story.<br/><br/>When I went into this movie I expected two things; an end to a trilogy and also a transition from one trilogy to another. I can envision people in the future to watch the two trilogies back to back. Then the story will be completely fluent and jointed.<br/><br/>On the whole the production value is the highest I think I have ever seen, incredibly good effects, great looking CG and on the whole on of the biggest movies I have ever seen in my life. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is not a good movie if you have not recently seen the movies that came before it.

After his brilliant adaption of the Lord of the Rings I knew he could do the Hobbit justice even if he did add and embellish some of the story. This man deserves an Oscar for giving us not 3 films but 6 films of just epic entertainment.

"tlfirth","8","5","12","14 December 2014"," The Culmination of My Childhood
","I'm 18 years old now and Tolkien's Middle-Earth has been a part of my life for a long time. I was 7 when I first heard about the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I decided to watch all three movies then and there and adored them. I was too young to watch Return of the King at the cinema, so I bought the DVD as soon as it came out in 2004. The third is by far my favorite, but they are all particularly impressive in their own ways. <br/><br/>From here, I decided to read the novels. It took a while for me to finish the novel trilogy, but when I did I was particularly pleased. There are some differences between novel and movie, mainly when one book finished and another began, but the essence of the story was prominent in both, and the movies didn't hinder the novels in any way - they only enlarged them. <br/><br/>In 2011, when I heard that the Hobbit was being released as a film adaption, I found myself a copy of the book. To be honest, I wish I'd read it sooner. Somehow it was far better than the three other novels combined and there was enough material to make a decent three-film adaption, I believed. <br/><br/>Honestly, the Hobbit films were definitely not going to be to the standard of the Lord of the Rings, but by no means were they terrible, or half-hearted. They carried the same spirit as the original trilogy and even made nods to the previous films, which were quite poignant in their own ways. The quality did nothing to hinder my enjoyment though, and to be back in Middle- Earth was a sensational experience all the same. <br/><br/>Now in December 2014, after seeing the final film, I feel quite drained. The film took me back to my childhood, back when I was 7 years old, back to the times when I read Tolkien's incredible novels, and yet it also has Jackson's touch - the action scenes are amazing to behold. It was an incredibly emotional end too, with Jackson honoring the book with the deaths of Thorin, Kili and Fili. No matter what anybody says, this film made me long to be seven again and be watching the Fellowship of the Ring for the first time. And the end to the Hobbit series really sums up the title of Bilbo's book - There and Back Again. We were there at the beginning with Bilbo and Frodo and no we've come back again.<br/><br/>Of the things that I enjoyed (there's too many to note everything): Smaug's desolation; Galadriel's confrontation with Sauron; Thorin's sickness; Bilbo taking the Arkenstone; Thorin Vs. Azog; Legolas' farewell; the ending. <br/><br/>There were three things that I did dislike about the film, however, and the reason I didn't give it 10: The character of Alfred was very distracting; the battle scenes sometimes faltered, and weren't as engaging as the Battle of Helm's Deep or Minas Tirith; the eagles are coming are a deus ex machina.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was a huge success and is my third favorite of the saga. Comparing these trilogies with other movies, my ratings for each movie are: the Return of the King: 9.8/10; The Two Towers: 9.4/10; The Battle of the Five Armies: 9.1/10; The Fellowship of the Ring: 8.8/10; The Desolation of Smaug; 8.6/10; An Unexpected Journey: 8.0/10.<br/><br/>If I was to pit them against each other though, the list would be like this:<br/><br/>The Return of the King: 10/10; The Two Towers: 9/10; The Battle of the Five Armies: 8/10; The Fellowship of the Ring: 7.5/10; The Desolation of Smaug: 7/10; An Unexpected Journey: 6/10.<br/><br/>The books have come a long way since they were first published. There's probably more being purchased now than there ever was. As a massive part of my childhood (11 years actually), I owe a big thanks to Peter Jackson for giving us a superb experience at the movies, but I owe a bigger thanks to J R. R. Tolkien for putting quill to paper first, and creating such a wonderful world of men and elves, of dwarfs and goblins, of orcs and witches and wizards, and most importantly, of hobbits. <br/><br/>Thanks very much!"

Peter Jackson, by turning it into a three movie epic saga has padded a one inch thick book to the same size as the three two inch thick books of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. as much as I admire the stellar job he did on LOTR, the bloat job he did on the Hobbit is blatant disrespect for Tolkien's literary work."

There's definitely some good scenes in it, but then is followed by vapid confrontation scenes, or vapid love triangle/reconciliation scenes.<br/><br/>The fight with the dragon was cool; The Battle of the 5 Armies a bit lackluster. Thorin dying with Bilbo by his side was great; Tauriel upset that one human-looking dwarf dies was dumb. There were many ups then downs in the story like these.<br/><br/>I recommend it if you like a good fantasy/adventure movie. Expect some really stupid things, but expect surprisingly strong scenes as well.<br/><br/>I believe Martin Freeman really knocks it out of the park with his performance in this movie more than the others, as he's given a wider range of emoting to play with in the script, and does so very well. The scenes with Thorin a were especially strong.<br/><br/>And at the end of it, you get a song from Billy Boyd (Pippin of LotR), who is, to my surprise, a very good singer.<br/><br/>It doesn't have the cathartic resolution that LotR had at the end, and falls a bit flat trying to emulate the previous success, but it's still a decent movie.

This was highly entertaining with some of the best if not the best fight scenes ever well worth the blue ray buy..A must see movie it pushed the matrix down to number 2 for me lol. The love story line for me was not a big deal it slightly enhanced the movie but not my cup of tea. I cant wait for them to do the Silmarillion that should make a great set of trilogy's, Hats of to peter Jackson for this great group of movies that surpasses the first"
"pronker","8","4","9","20 January 2015"," My addition to the reviews of Battle of the Five Armies: great stuff!
","I saw this deliberately not in 3D, because the charm of Rhosgobel Rabbits pulling a chariot was spoiled slightly in the previous film by 3D's affects that made it appear disconnected with the film. I raised rabbits for 20 years and really liked that image, way to go, Peter Jackson!<br/><br/>So in this non-3D film, the rabbits came across beautifully. So did Smaug and the other fantastic beasts; had to laugh at the giant pig. I chuckled at Alfrid's giant bosom, but other than that the film's serious tone carried the day. The number of characters overwhelmed, though, and it took 15 minutes to place them all where they belonged: Bard's children, all the dwarfs, etc. but short of a lengthy character list in the beginning, I don't see where that could have been corrected.<br/><br/>On to the spectacle: the effects were marvelous, not just the ending battle but the supernatural battle between Galadriel and her friends and Sauron which was one of the best showing-not-telling scenes of characters who we root for, yet are not human. All in all, this scene did its job the best in the whole movie, for me. The acting: Freeman and Armitage convinced me that they were friends; Galadriel and Saruman and Elrond and Sauron made me believe that their world is on another plane than mine; that Peter Jackson handles grandeur better than any current director, helped immeasurably by Tolkien's original story."

","Actually, I was looking for 8.5 but no option for half points, so I thought I'd err on the side of entertainment. Not a movie for the arty, cultural elite, perhaps, but for pure entertainment, laughs, delights and lots of action and adventure it's first class.....not to be missed!!! The costumes and graphics are amazing, the story keeps one's interest and bowls along with no flat spots. My wife and I were both surprised that the time had gone so fast by movie's end. I think that Peter Jackson and his vision and the crew he assembled have changed movies for the better, bringing another dimension to the genre and the expectations of movie-goers around the world.

","First of all, you people who tend to be in the fandom never cease to amuse me. You all remind me of tumblr and the likes and the never ending fighting there about who is the righterestest. Whatever you can'T tell me this was AS bad as some depict it. First of all, yes I'm biased. I loved LOTR I loved Jacksons' universe, and it amazed me back then in '02 how it was so detailed, dark and well-made. And I already had notices and known the differences between original fiction and PJ's creation.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Hobbit. WHy? I don't know but believe me I will after this so I can laugh at you all expecting.. whatever you are expecting. Ahem. So, you all complain about Tauriel... you serious. You all read Lotr okay, Arwen had like two columns in the whole set of wonderful books and it was all about pretty much just giving some information about her and Aragorn's love. There was no Arwen fighting, no her dying as noticeably as in the movie, he didn't even really know that s..t right then just felt about her fading away and hell no Elrond giving the sword that had originally been already given in the first book.(Okay it was a long time ago I've read it but even being 13 I understood why Jackson decided to give him and her that much screen time...jeebus people).<br/><br/>What, long fight scenes? So what, they're still well made. Not Tolkien like characters? Again go back to Gimli and Legolas, Arwen, most of the human characters back in Lotr, they were changed and changed the good way and for a reason - to fit into a modern storyline. This movie well; probably Jackson tried to make it bigger than what it could have ever been-wouldn't you want to do the same? I understand and I saw the flaws as well, but you honestly can't just tell me about bad acting...I have seen that floating around here. Even I admit the fighting was awfully long, certain things weren't the best, I gave it 10 because the whole Jackson franchise taught me a lot and that's how I learnt about Tolkien's works.<br/><br/>And moreover, there is no way I couldn't enjoy a movie like this, even if it wasn't because of my undoubted love for this whole atmosphere -which Jackson delivered no matter what you fan boys tell me, costumes, settings, camera shots, music was just right - but because of the movie itself-if you know what mean. I kind of felt like though he tried to go on the feels train - not just putting that romance in there, but about trying to recreate his past success for the sake of nostalgia (and yeah money I know).<br/><br/>There is no way I would give it 1 star-you serious, even Twilight would receive 2 from me for the setup (and the parody dub) and I hate that monstrous disgusting piece of turd with my heart. Go away with the comparison to LOTR - this is not LOTR, not enough material, not enough storyline, even the characters don't have time to evolve in those aforementioned few hundred pages. He put too much of suspense in it, and I really expected him to deliver some extra from the vast amount of information Tolkien gave about the whole universe (yes I'm an elf-shipper and there would have been so much to put into these movies as subtle story lines instead of fully focusing on the non-existent elf lady and the dwarf love.) Overall, go away people with being 'AH SO Disappoint JEEBUS' I can't stand that. What the hell did you expect from a really short book? I expected more of what I have mentioned above, yeah, but no way I would say this was an 'absolute disappointment'- that would be weak and childish without considering what these movies are actually based on."
"JohnWelles","2","4","9","10 January 2015"," A Thrilling Climax to a 13-Year Long Saga
","The final part of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, ""The Battle of Five Armies"" (2014), directed by Peter Jackson, is a hard film to judge. Shot at the same time as its two antecedents, ""An Unexpected Journey"" (2012) and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013), for a speculated total cost of $745 million, it really has to be seen in the context of the entire three films. Certainly, Jackson seems to feel this way, the film opening with a direct continuation of Smaug laying waste to Laketown, offering no introduction for those unversed in the saga.<br/><br/>There's further development of Richard Armitage's character, Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the band of dwarfs seeking to claim the gold under the Lonely Mountain, who descends into megalomania and greed. It's an intriguing turn and one based in character, which gives an emotional centre that might have otherwise have been lacking. That's due to the fact that, as per the title, the series' climatic battle dominates the film. It's thrilling, masterfully choreographed and the special effects utilised are impeccable but there's always the danger that the vast armies clashing can become distinctly impersonal. Jackson confronts this by a memorable fight between Thorin and the orc Azog (Manu Bennett) on a frozen river that reduces the conflict to a more thrilling, intimate level.<br/><br/>It seems perverse to comment once more on the scriptwriters (Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro) lack of faithfulness to J.R.R. Tolkein's original 1937 novel. From the start, it was clear they weren't interested in making an accurate version but rather an expansive Middle-Earth epic and the detail surrounding its fantastical environment has always been the films' strongest suit. Here, the veracity of the characters' surrounding is compounded by the 3D and the high frame rate (48 frames a second as opposed to the standard 24 used for all other films) that puts the audience truly within the drama unfolding.<br/><br/>The performances are fine, although one wishes that Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins, ostensibly the main character, had more screen time. Jackson is cutting between so many story strands that it feels as though Bilbo gets lost in amidst the web of plot lines. Yet it's the most succinct of any of the films in the trilogy or The Lord of the Rings for that matter, which this acts as an extended overture to, and there is a certain satisfying quality to the final epilogue bringing to an end a series that has lasted thirteen years. Taken as a whole, ""The Hobbit"" films may not have reached the same mythic resonance of their forbears, yet when viewed without such retrospective judgement, the films themselves come alive and dazzle the viewer like nothing else."
"rudolfstr-432-2789","8","4","9","4 January 2015"," A satisfying conclusion to a franchise
","And so the Hobbit trilogy ends. After 2 quite plain and frankly boring films the final movie offers more action and less Tolkien (which in this case isn't a bad thing). Battle of 5 armies reminds more of the original LOTR films in both: production quality and advancement of story, of course the film is overly stretched, but that should be expected by anyone who's ever seen a Jackson movie. The film builds upon the story of the first 2 Hobbit movies, but is more independent than Descolation of Smaug. The dragon is a second- order character, which suffers a surprisingly early demise and the story focuses around the storyline of elves and orcs. This does make the story quite anticlimactic, since the initially introduced main antagonist has a net screen time of roughly 40 minutes (over the 9 hour long journey), but BO5A makes up by some of the most beautiful fight scenes I have ever seen and that is enough to make the movie enjoyable. Battle of 5 armies presses strongly on the nostalgic feeling many have toward LOTR with the introduction of a fight scene between Saruman, Galadriel, Gandalf and Sauron, as well as by honoring the ""well-tested"" movie progression of: actual storyline(1hr)-> an epic senseless battle(2hr). The rating I give this film is largely inflated by my fanboyism towards Lord of the rings, since the Hobbit series on their own aren't anything game changing. But this movies is a must-see for anyone who liked the initial series by Peter Jackson and will offer a very nice nostalgia trip."

","Although it wasn't the best way to bid farewell with that EXTRAORDINARY universe, but it'll always remain miles ahead of any other cinematic universe(The galaxy far far away,Hogwarts,....). This universe incorporated each and every human feeling, it showed us the true nature of Men. Greediness, courage, ambition, disloyalty, fear,love and friendship these feelings make us human. The Battle Of The Five Armies was indeed a major letdown in the context of the series. But if it's reviewed as a separate movie if we decided to forget The Lord Of the Rings series. This movie is good. Peter Jackson can still manage wars on a gigantic scale. Still the movie lacks the spirit of the lord of the rings like the 2 previous installments. As for me, i wanted to see what will happen between Saruman and Sauron. what happened to alter his loyalty. On the other hand, the movie explored some hidden secrets the relationship between Lady Galadriel and Gandalf. ""One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them; One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."""

","The final battle which the other movies set up was literally put into its own movie. There was little story because The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was literally 144 minutes of non-stop action.<br/><br/>The only reason that people think this movie falls short is because the Lord of the Rings trilogy came first and was legendary and set an insanely high bar for any future science fiction movie. However, by not considering the LOTR and considering The Hobbit as a stand alone movie, it is actually extremely awesome. The special effects were amazing and the fighting scenes truly captivated me.<br/><br/>Yes, Elrond, Sauromon, and Galadriel were not in the original book, but in my opinion it is okay that Peter Jackson included them in the movie because they acted as easter eggs for the set up of the plot of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This truly is a great movie and brings the story full circle as the last scene in this movie was the first scene of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I recommend it for any science fiction lover."

","This movie is a disappointment in the sense that it is incredibly commercial. The over- use of CGI combined with over-the-top action sequences downgraded the movie greatly. It is a shame since the first two installments had managed to encapsulate the spirit and the tone of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Overall, it felt more like i was watching the Matrix or Transformers than a poetic movie about The Hobbit. Sadly, Martin Freemen the actual Hobbit has very few screen time.<br/><br/>This being said, as an action-packed movie, I did actually enjoy this film and found myself laughing quite a few times.

","'THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The final installment in director Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation, of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 novel 'The Hobbit' (following 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' and 2013's 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG'); which also serves as a prequel trilogy to Jackson's blockbuster 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movie series (also based on Tolkien's popular books). Jackson once again directed and co-wrote the movie; with his wife Fran Walsh, his other usual writing partner Philippa Boyens and acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was also originally going to direct 'THE HOBBIT' film series, in two-parts). Walsh and Boyens also co-wrote all of the other Tolkien movie adaptations (as well as multiple other Peter Jackson films) and del Toro also co-wrote the other 'HOBBIT' movies. The film once again stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch and many other returning cast members (as well as a few new ones). I highly enjoyed it, surprisingly to me, and think it's the best of 'THE HOBBIT' film trilogy; but I still don't think it quite lives up to any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' movies. It's definitely one of the best films of the year though!<br/><br/>The film opens, where the last installment left off, with the dragon Smaug (Cumberbatch) attacking Lake-town (which is resolved 12 minutes later, before the title of the movie even appears). Gandalf (McKellen) is still a prisoner of the orc prison and Thorin (Armitage) has gone mad with power and greed. He desperately wants to find the Arkenstone, which he still doesn't know Bilbo (Freeman) has. At the same time armies of elves, dwarfs, people and orcs approach the Lonely Mountain; ready for war. A lot of action ensues.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' (a lot) and thought it was true to the book in spirit, I was deeply disappointed with it's first sequel. That whole movie feels like excessive filler, packed with uninvolving video game style action scenes (that go on for way too long); which makes it a pretty boring and uneventful film. It also lacks it's natural ending (which was instead used to open this movie with) making it by far the weakest installment out of all of Peter Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations. I once was a big fan of Jackson's because he does have a lot of talent and passion for making films but 'THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG' is the biggest example of how much of a sellout he's become (kind of obsessed with power and greed, like Thorin is in this movie). For that reason I went into this movie with pretty low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong. The film is completely fast paced, filled with brilliantly thought out and involving action scenes, and it also has a great deal of emotional depth and character development (everything the second film was lacking). It's far superior to 'SMAUG' and definitely the best film of this trilogy (which should have never been a trilogy). Still it's a great movie, one of the best of this year, and a fitting conclusion to the entire epic six film series. Obsessive book fans and purists will still be disgusted, and hate it, but most others should at least have a fun time.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4"

","I really enjoyed the first two. I don't buy into the criticism that a 300 page book couldn't be made into a full blown trilogy. That said, I found the last episode way too full of battle scenes and gratuitous violence, big armies banging into each other, terrible orcs riding wolves, and the ultimate confrontation. In the process, all the charm that had been built up in the first two movies seemed to be dropped for a bunch of special effects. It starts well with the appearance of Smaug who fulfills his promise of destroying the town. But after that its a hodge-podge of romance and revenge and ultimately death. As this one ended, I literally felt, ""Oh, is that the end?"" Having read ""The Hobbit"" a couple of times, I knew what was going to happen, but it didn't quite work the way I thought it would. There was just something empty. Don't get me wrong, I could revel in the effort, but I can't say that this will stay with me for a long time."

No real complaints there.<br/><br/>Some sort of triumphant music was added to nearly every scene, to the point that I enjoyed the shrinking portion that didn't try to be built up as something it wasn't. There was no set up to the comic relief and it wasn't funny when it hit.<br/><br/>The fight scene with the ghost kings, in the words of my 50 year old mother, ""looked like something from the original Power Rangers"".<br/><br/>It wouldn't end either.

From beginning to end we are in the edge of our seat with a fast heart beating pace and personally this is why I love this movie because of the stirring of the emotions and I think this is why we go to see movies to makes us feel and suffer the pain of the characters as well as the joy and happiness.<br/><br/>Some people will hate this movie but the majority will love it but there is no doubt that this is a cinematic experience that only happens once in while!"
"FilmMuscle","7","4","9","21 December 2014"," All Hope Is Not Lost
","Once upon a time, Peter Jackson was overwhelmingly lauded for translating a literary masterpiece into a cinematic masterpiece: the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Despite their immense runtimes, there was never a wasted moment—in fact, the fans begged for an even longer cut of these films (these cuts turned out to be 20-40 minutes longer, still without any hint of overstretching). There was so much to explore in that classically grim and grand tale, adapted from three separate sizable novels (the original LOTR—although once compiled into one enormous book by J.R.R. Tolkien—was split into three books by the publisher later on). <br/><br/>However, Tolkien's prequel, The Hobbit, doesn't have that much material in one single novel to warrant three 2 ½ hour movies, which is why this recent trilogy has honestly overstayed its welcome and presented us with a seriously disposable middle point—The Desolation of Smaug—that barely contributed to the overall narrative. Jackson, like George Lucas, has simply become so fanatically passionate about this world that he'd be willing to showcase every acre of Middle Earth if it was his choice; in a way, that's sweet (or there could be a more cynical aspect to it), but few people are asking for this much. The Battle of Five Armies immediately begins with the ultimate clash against Smaug (that last segment of Desolation of Smaug could've just been inserted here and everything else therein scrapped), which ends fairly quickly only for the situation to now center on Thorin's gradually corrupting mind—his obstinate, greedy hold over the treasure he has finally reached in the vast caves of the Lonely Mountains. A colossal war soon ensues, involving the dwarfs, the humans, the elves, the eagles, and the orcs, over this gold—lust for wealth and power has always been a motif in the tales of Middle Earth. <br/><br/>Entering the theater with lowered expectations following disappointment from the last entry, I actually walked out surprised with how wildly entertaining the film was throughout most of its duration. At this point, some of the more central characters and relationships were fully developed, allowing for more audience investment in their arcs and endgames. The riveting dynamic between Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman), in particular, remained the highlight, as well as the fuel to carry the film from a slower build-up to a climactic finale with satisfying pace. Aside from its ending, which was dragged out with a totally relaxed and plodding speed almost to the excruciating extent of Return of the King, there was never a dull moment that even remotely compared to the boringly prolonged sequence with Smaug towards the end of its predecessor. When there wasn't interestingly-choreographed and colossally-scoped action on-screen, the intriguing evolution of certain characters' paths was placed at the forefront. Moreover, while the orcs were as effortless to kill as ever, the primary villains (Azog, Bolg) took arduous, calculating confrontations with powered warriors like Legolas, Tauriel, Thorin, Gandalf, and more to overcome. <br/><br/>On the other hand, instead of putting effort into utilizing impeccable practical effects to meticulously assemble a believable Middle Earth like Jackson accomplished with the LOTR trilogy, the use of CGI this time around really makes everything appear so cartoony and cheap for such a big-budget epic. The first twenty minutes of the picture specifically exhibit The Hobbit at its visual worst with the sight of an animated-like village being ravaged by unconvincing fire effects. Perhaps, the creatures seem fascinatingly-envisioned, especially Smaug, but the whole production occasionally looks like one giant cartoon— totally unlike LOTR."

","Note: To keep eye-strain to a minimum, I will be referring to the three Hobbit movies as H1, H2 and H3, respectively. Thank you. Having felt let-down by the bloated feel of H1, and then surprised by the monumental improvement in the performances and story choices made in H2, I sat down for H3 with tempered expectations keeping me from floating from my seat. And that turned out to be for the best. Because through my lenses of noncommittal gray, Middle Earth became the color of awesome. The visuals were stunning of course, and *most of the time*, believable (but more on that later), and the battle-scenes, the one-on-one variety in particular, were easily the most spectacular of the series. Would that I had had more jaws to drop. And this was H3's strongest point. The fighting raged on almost non-stop, and yet it was so well choreographed, inspired and varied, that I never felt fatigued as I had during H1 (how many damn goblins can there BE under that mountain? Really!). I'll leave my only gripe on this matter in the form of a question: How many good guys can be saved JUST as a raised weapon is about to splatter their head? You very well may find out. The story was compelling. Enough. When the fate of the entire world is not at stake, as it was in the LOTR films, the gravitas is naturally lessened from that level. However, though our heroes' plight is more localized here, the urgency is always apparent and well-conveyed. And though there is no shortage of wide shots, the directors were not afraid to pull in close to let the actors shine when they needed to. There was a certain character introduced who was entirely CGI, which I did not understand the reason for, but trying to cope with that plastic face was the only situation where I was too ""taken out of it"" to appreciate a performance (for some reason, monster races = acceptable-looking plastic. Don't ask me why). Performance-wise, some actors finally seemed comfortable in their own feet (Martin Freeman), some more seasoned ones finally got to kick some much deserving arse (I'll leave the whom to your imagination), and some showed a much wider range of emotions from what had been demanded of them in previous installments (Lee Pace and Aidan Turner). If you're expecting the same feeling of wonder and amazement that The LOTR films brought to your hopelessly geeky heart, forsooth, it is not to be found here. H2 came closest in that regard. No, this is instead a story pieced together by one and a half chapters of actual book, and a whole lot of notes that would be boring in the retelling if not slathered in a sweet sweet sauce of orc blood, dwarf curses and a whole lot of elf swagger, which it was. Thank Sauron, it was."

","I have not read the book, but i still feel this story could have been told in one film. I kinda liked the first movie, i thought it was OK, and i liked Desolation of Smaug, which was an improvement. But those movies, as entertaining as they are, are still too long and have unnecessary filler. So now there's BOTFA, which is the shortest (at 144 mins.), but that doesn't mean it's better.<br/><br/>The movie starts immediately where the last one ended: Smaug escapes from the mountain and it's heading to the village to destroy it. The opening sequence it's both good and underwhelming. I expected a more exciting battle against Smaug, but he was quickly defeated. Disappointing, after the cliffhanger of the last movie.<br/><br/>But then there's the main battle, the battle of five armies as the title suggests. And that's my issue with the movie, that this battle it's all it has to offer, and it's not even a that great battle.<br/><br/>The battle takes almost the entirety of the movie, and it just keeps going. Even with all that spectacle on screen, it's never too exciting. And the excessive use of CGI doesn't help, it's looks cartoony at times.<br/><br/>But there's also good stuff. The performances are great, Martin Freeman is great as Bilbo, and Ricahrd Armitage kills it as Thorin. Great acting overall. Also, the quieter moments were more entertaining: the scenes with Bilbo and Thorin, Bard trying to keep the villagers calm and the final moments after the battle.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent conclusion.

So if you watched LOTR and Hobbit 1 & 2 like me (I liked all of them, LOTR obviously more than the Hobbit-movies). Don't watch the Hobbit: Battle of the five armies.

To end with on a positive note: the best 10 seconds where at the end of the movie because that's the LOTR."

","The most amazing thing about Tolkein, or Star Wars, was that you didn't know what happened in the middles or between the movies, or books. Tolkein's stories only loosely fit together because of how he wrote each one, but this was the most amazing thing about his writing. We were left to guess how Sauron turned to the dark, or what Gandalf, Sauron and Galadriel were doing before Lord of the Rings. One had to read the Simarilion, but even then one couldn't fit together the whole story because the world was so much bigger than its fractured records in Tolkein's prose.<br/><br/>This generation of movie makers, from Lucas to Jackson, have ruined the fantasy genre by seeking to tie together every storyline leaving little to mystery. There are so many repeated images and characutures of the LOTR that the Hobbit only makes Tolkein's world so much smaller. Movie magic ruined too much of the mystery of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Even then, there are countless plot holes, and useless plot devices in the Hobbit. Now that three movies were created, the Arkenstone, and the Dragon's madness both are pointless next to the greed inspired by the actual horde of gold. At one point a bell breaks through a door, swinging as dwarfs exit, but disappears by the next shot. Orc commanders are not destroyed or suffocated by Arda's water, but somehow pretend to go to sleep in it. Even Legolas' story is tied into LOTR in a a dreary manner that reeks of a neurotic perfectionism that somehow misses the whole point of how big Tolkein's world really is.<br/><br/>If JJ Ambrams is smart, which I'm not counting on, he'll learn from Jackson's Hobbit movie, and Lucas' errors and make the Star Trek and Star Wars universes much bigger than they ever were before by purposely leaving things to mysterious developments that go unanswered- but without developing new gaping plot holes."

","I was expecting so much more from these movies. They are not even close to what the other LOTR movies were. Its just the only feeling I had during all the three movies was ""these movies feels so rushed and somehow, not genuine"". Everything felt so empty, like it was thrown together and don't get me wrong, it was still better then most but not even close to the real deal. I never could shake the feeling that this was just thrown together and I think its a side effect of all the green screens and the over endulgment of the CGI. The Green screens that made Ian Mckellen cry because he couldn't act properly, the green screens that replaced EVERYTHING. I respect CGI and green screens but I don't know, the LOTR still tried to do as much as possible without CGI. In this movie, they were just lazy."

","Battle of The Five Armies has all the faults of the first two films, and fans of the book will probably hate the changes and many of the stupid plot points added by Peter Jackson and his writers. It's just a glittery cgi-creature that feels nothing like the book.<br/><br/>There are pretty hefty extrapolations from the source material, including a worm-tongue like comedy character who proved a bit distracting to the main story, and a superhero Legolas who ridiculously jumps off a pile of falling stones on a bridge to save himself, and who hitches a silly bat ride to rescue Tauriel. Bilbo is also still a lost figure, but Martin Freeman, excellent as ever, is still a great Bilbo.<br/><br/>Five Armies is also a little derivative of The Return Of The King film, too, but on the whole is a less than satisfactory conclusion. My unpractised eye detects an awful lot of stuff has been edited out - so expect a whopper extended edition.<br/><br/>Christopher Lee's action Saruman is a bit of an eye-opener! The scene where he features is actually an acceptable adaption of the appendices material, even if said scene isn't actually in the the appendices! I thought the Dol Guldur stuff the best scene in the film. Billy Connolly also turns up as Dain Ironfoot. He's lively but almost unrecognisable in the Dwarf makeup and the material he's given isn't particularly funny.<br/><br/>So while the movie, and trilogy as a whole, doesn't come anywhere near the Lord Of The Rings movies in quality, it's not quite the turkey some would have you believe.

"bryank-04844","4","3","6","6 May 2015"," . It's quite a sad story when I'm not all up in arms and joy about a movie that involves Middle Earth.
","We are at the end of this 'Hobbit' trilogy with 'The Battle of the Five Armies'. The last three years seem to have gone by fairly fast. It seems like yesterday when I was writing about Warner Bros. heading back to Middle Earth with the 'Hobbit'. I was super stoked about it, because I was such a huge fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I think I saw each of those films five times in the theater, owned each version that came out on DVD and Blu-ray, and went back to see them when they were re- released. I just can't get enough of the 'LOTR' films. But shortly after the announcement that we were receiving a 'Hobbit' film, things started going downhill.<br/><br/>Now, 'The Hobbit', written by J.R.R Tolkien is only 320 pages long. The 'LOTR' books were well over 1200 pages long combined. You can do the math yourself, but taking a small 320 page book and splitting it into three long movies is very difficult to get right. Well the end result was less than stellar. There was way too much filler, slow pacing, and everything just kind of fizzles out. With 'Lord of the Rings', Jackson and his crew took their time and made three incredible films. <br/><br/>I am still to this day thrilled, watching 'Return of the King'. It's emotional drama still makes me tear up and the battles are still incredible, along with it's several endings, which are all necessary and beautiful. You really connected to each of those characters in 'LOTR' and even felt that you went on that long and dangerous journey with them. With these 'Hobbit' films, that is definitely not the case. With the first 'Hobbit' movie, it took literally 45 minutes to get out of a young Bilbo's house and start this journey. And even after that, it took another hour to have even a little bit energy. The second film was a bit better, spent some more time with each character and has some fun adventurous action. And most importantly, it finally told us where the story was headed, which was to see the big evil dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch).<br/><br/>Part two literally left us hanging on a cliff with Bilbo watching Smaug head to the lake town to destroy it. So what would seem like one of the big climactic scenes of the book, being Smaug destroying the town and then meeting his own fate, happens before the title ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" appears on screen. And that is a big problem with splitting this book into three long movies. Smaug was one of the coolest and greatest characters in 'The Hobbit' and he didn't get a chance to shine, at least in this third film. Where 'Return of the King' had tons of depth, meaning, and intense action scenes, 'Battle of the Five Armies' did not.<br/><br/>Instead, this third and final film is basically just one long action film, void of any real character development or payoff. Since Smaug is no longer a living dragon, the dwarfs can claim their throne of treasures once again. But this also entices a big powerful orc army to travel to their kingdom to destroy it and use its riches to conquer and kill Middle Earth. So from one fight to the next, we get a straight up action movie. And while we still have these epic large battles where ten-thousand people fight another ten-thousand people, Jackson made the main characters have more intimate fight sequences, which was nice, but again redundant. No character has a transformation in this film. In the 'LOTR' movies, each character went through a rough transformation.<br/><br/>They were not the same people at the beginning of the film as they were at the end. But in these 'Hobbit' films, particularly this final third one, not one person has changed or gone through some difficult transformation. The only character to have a glimpse of change is Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who is blinded by the cursed gold in his kingdom, therefore he comes across as a dick. But of course, he has a change of heart, throws off his crown, and becomes the good guy again. And that is the extent of the character development in 'The Hobbit'. Jackson does manage to hint his 'LOTR' trilogy, but it is done in a very small way, which comes across very cheesy, as if Jackson was giving us a big wink several times in a row. And now let us discuss Legolas. You know the blonde elf who is a Jedi ninja with his swords and bow and arrow.<br/><br/>It seems like the studio and Jackson wanted to film a lot of scenes with him trying to have those big cool moments like he did in the 'LOTR' films. But rather than having one of those big moments per film, Jackson added about a dozen of those moments within the span of a half an hour in this 'Hobbit' movie. It completely took the awe and coolness out of each of those moments. Not too mention they were mostly laughable and the CG wasn't perfect. All that being said, the movie as a whole, looks beautiful and was filmed perfectly. The landscapes and epic battle scene shots look very nice. But the performances are solid other than Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman).<br/><br/>It seems like everyone else was tired of making the film by then. It's quite a sad story when I'm not all up in arms and joy about a movie that involves Middle Earth. But the fact remains is that the studio was so greedy that they ended up having a poor film trilogy in order to make more money. And who suffers? We the fans and audience do."
"derangedxzombie","5","3","6","3 May 2015"," Actually disappointing..
","I haven't read all the hobbit book and for years, so can't point out discrepancies in that way, yet it was still disappointing. The desolation of smaug felt like a long journey with a variety of scenes and events, culminating in a great finale between Bilbo, the dwarfs and smaug. In the this one however there aren't really any memorable scenes, it felt rushed, and shorter, it felt it lacked variety and left some questions unanswered. I felt like I mainly watched the battle of the 5 cgi armies, and it weren't quite a battle like any in the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, Pixar didn't release the 3rd until about 10 years later and it was perfect. Peter Jackson though normally in form with everything had this trilogy released yearly, it's worth watching bit don't expect to be blown away, for a finale it isn't amazing."
"user-196-766417","4","3","6","4 April 2015"," Very poor adaptation.
","The Hobbit trilogy started out wonderfully and then just disintegrated into a sprawling mess of the beloved world that Tolkien so masterfully created. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a long- winded, shallow, unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Bad writing, a disrespectful plot, and the overuse of CGI ruins what could have been a decent film.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>Firstly, the battle. There was so much CGI, it looked like a video game. The battles in ""The Lord of the Rings"" are convincing because they have warriors played by real extras, and the Orcs are much more terrifying than the computer-generated ones of the Hobbit trilogy. The battle in this film just felt fake, and Legolas defying physics didn't help.<br/><br/>Secondly, the dwarfs. Apparently three movies still isn't enough to characterise all thirteen of them. It feels like some of them are reduced to supporting characters as they hardly have any lines, or any personality, for that matter. Even Legolas and Tauriel have more development than half of the supposedly ""main"" characters.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point: Tauriel and Kíli. Their relationship undermines Legolas and Gimli's friendship in ""The Lord of the Rings"", as Legolas and Gimli's friendship was so significant to the reconciliation of their races. I may have forgiven Tauriel and Kíli if they had any chemistry, but when lines like ""You make me feel alive"" (where did this come from? An 80s love ballad? Modern EDM songs?) are being bandied about, I couldn't help but cringe. When your fanbase thinks that Bilbo and Thorin have more chemistry than Tauriel and Kíli, you know you're doing something wrong.<br/><br/>Smaug is killed before the titles have finished showing. What was meant to be the climax of the book is squished into the first few minutes, and afterwards I just didn't really care for the battle. If you love battle sequences, you're in for a treat, but I was just bored by it.<br/><br/>The film's lack of resolution is really upsetting. Where are the funerals for the Durins? Where is Dáin's coronation? What happens to Tauriel and Thranduil after the film ends? What happened to those giant worms? How was the treasure divided? How did Bilbo use it? After all that happened in the first two films, after everything the characters did to get this gold - wouldn't that dignify some sort of conclusion about what happened once they actually got it?<br/><br/>Apparently a few of these questions will be answered in the Extended Edition, but Jackson obviously believes they are minor plot points he can replace with Alfrid's ""comic relief"" to create a more action- based Theatrical Edition. Disrespectful.<br/><br/>Some people say that this film tries too much to set up ""The Lord of the Rings"". I personally don't mind. I like the Dol Guldur subplot because it gives us insight into the backstories of Galadriel and Saruman and Sauron. But Thranduil's comment to Legolas about finding ""the ranger"" and ""discovering his name for yourself"" sounds stupidly over-the-top. (Not to mention that Aragorn was about eight years old at the time.)<br/><br/>Overall, the concept of the story has been ruined by Jackson. ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" have never been action stories, but an exploration of journey in all its forms, and a criticism of war. So when Jackson values the film's forty-minute long battle sequence over actual character development and resolution, he is pretty much destroying the heart of Tolkien's work. <br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>The actors are great. They do what they can with their shoddy script and manage to redeem this film to a 4/10. I think Martin Freeman's Bilbo is absolutely spot on - always has been. Richard Armitage's incredible portrayal of Thorin shows the depth of his character, especially in the gold-sickness scene. Ian Mckellen is amazing in everything he does. Because of the actors, Thorin, Fíli and Kíli's death scenes are painfully heartrending.<br/><br/>The ending. The ending was so beautiful. No spoilers here.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" was a poorly- made film that simply concentrated too much on the battle rather than exploring the major characters and plot points of the book."
"LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt","6","3","6","28 March 2015"," All 'battle' and little else, as the title suggests.
","Hobbit 3. The last time we revisit Middle Earth and all its merry folk. So how amazing was this final venture? Not very. <br/><br/>The movie starts well, with Smaug the Fiery Dragon. Smaug was the best thing about the preceding movie, and he sure does liven up the beginning of this one. This fire breathing dragon gave me the chills, as ironical as that may seem. <br/><br/>Now, enter good ol' Azog. Azog the fair skinned, ambitious young lad, always frustrated and miffed off at everybody. Azog the Defiler never actually seemed a scary enough villain to me, just very mean. His character was considerably one-sided and Azog had this weird habit of stressing on every word he says, like a growling five year old. So, a vile, ferocious monster, with no depth whatsoever, is just that. <br/><br/>And I'd also like to mention the Mighty Gundabad Orcs, that are apparently very strong and fearsome, because anytime any character mentions them, they widen their eyes and take a deep breath. So, when all the characters convinced me of how terrible Gunadabad Orcs were going to be, it was considerable vibe-kill to see Bilbo throw fist sized stones from afar at the Orcs, to which they were knocked out cold, in an almost comical way. One would expect more from the much lauded Gundabad Orcs. <br/><br/>And that brings us to Bilbo, i.e; Martin Freeman. Freeman's comical prowess is undisputed of course, but this role actually required him to bring some more dramatic meat to the screen. I found Bilbo being too laid-back for much of the movie, cracking witty jokes time and time again, which while having been entertaining, undermined the seriousness of the moment. <br/><br/>And Gandalf? Never before has he done so little in a movie, at one point he himself says something along the lines of ""Since when has my counsel counted for so little?!"" He was speaking the truth. That isn't necessarily a problem, but along with other characters that are similarly thrown in, but have little to actually do, brings a feeling of vagueness to proceedings. Special mention would also go to the Elf-Goblin romance that was shallow and forced. <br/><br/>The story is simple. People, elfs, goblins and orcs fight very hard and for a very long time. Its a two half hour sequence of battle scene after battle scene between every possible creature you and I can imagine. But to be fair, the title does warn us very clearly. So, we can't actually complain too much on that front, but I believe we can say that there could've been more narrative depth and coherence to the script. <br/><br/>It has now come to my notice, that I've mentioned far too many cons and not enough pros. There are some really swell moments in the film. The background score for the movie complements the battle sequences very well. The battle sequences themselves were well done, if not legendary. And Thorin Oakenshield. He was the crowning glory of this movie. As much as it claims to be The 'Hobbit' 3, I felt that this installment was a lot more focused on the life and times of Thorin Oakenshield. Richard Armitage gave every scene his all, and added much dramatic depth to the story. Where Bilbo was comical, Thorin was intense. <br/><br/>All in all, the greatest fallacy of this movie, is quite simply it's lineage; in the sense that it is inevitably compared with the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, which can never be bettered. The comparison with the preceding movies is what works most against it, but these comparisons are very much valid. Still, The Hobbit: Battle Of The Five Armies in all its visual brilliance, auditory resonance, and good performances, manages to make us feel epic along with all our Elf and Goblin kin, who fight valiantly. <br/><br/>Thank you Peter Jackson. And thank you, JRR Tolkien."
"drqshadow-reviews","4","3","6","19 January 2015"," Somehow Bland, Despite the Ninety-Minute Fight Scene, Middle Earth's Farewell is Missing a Heart and a Purpose
","Peter Jackson finishes with Middle Earth, again, six films and well over a thousand minutes of screen time after he began. It should go without saying that Bilbo's last fight is over-extended, indulgent and often very slow - at this point, those have become LOTR calling cards - but even amidst such expectations, this is a pretty big stretch. There's just so little real substance here, especially after the ferocious dragon Smaug is dismissed very early in the first act, that it feels like we're watching a medieval war reenactment and not a polished bit of Hollywood storytelling. The cast gets plenty of linguistic work, with lots of tongue-twisting names and locations to murmur in a foreboding tone, and the screen dances with all manner of wild paperback-cover visuals, but it deeply hurts that there's so little plot. Even the battle scenes, large and loud as they are, suffer from a bad case of the Rambos. That was a problem I could generally overlook in The Two Towers, even when Legolas was single-handedly taking down herds of war elephants, but now by comparison that seems almost quaint. It doesn't matter how outnumbered our heroes may be, if they're involved in a fight you'd better believe a couple hundred baddies are about to lose their heads. Believability is already a tall ask here, and those fight scenes scrap any shred of disbelief that may have remained somewhat suspended. It's a pantomime, a hopeless exaggeration that rambles on without point or purpose like a drunken Granddad after Thanksgiving dinner. There really, really didn't need to be three of these."
"cubsckc","8","3","6","15 January 2015"," Good... but What Happened to Jackson's Skills?
","I understand fans that fanatically liked or disliked the film. The film carried some new good stuff, and yet lacked so much greatness and potential that Peter Jackson has always put in his films. WHAT HAPPENED?<br/><br/>I had read reviews thinking that people were being picky about the movie, yet as a person that still enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but ask, did Peter Jackson stop caring during the film? It had all the tools as well as help from some good cast. If your going to put romance then you really have to establish the connection. I felt like Fili and Tauriel were dating for sometime right when they started throwing at each other. The screen time between the battles and unnecessary Wilfred scenes kind of make me cringe. What a waste. Fili and Kili's deaths were sad but they weren't as emotional as they should have been. Peter Jackson failed to make these characters death momentus. Boromir's death was able to look tragic despite being an unlikable character throughout 95 percent of the film. Yet his death was 10 times more important and tragic than Kili and Fili. And I say that regrettably. During serious moments, I really felt Peter Jackson was either hesitant to set the mood or just didn't bother caring. The sad scenes and dramatic scenes had terrible background tunes. It made the audience unsympathetic to these scenes. <br/><br/>Even though the battle scenes were pretty good, they still seemed to lack... a lot... and its noticeable. The beginning of the battle is the biggest scene really. After that there's very few good battle scenes. It brings up the question of whether Peter Jackson decided to cut funding. The final battle between Thorin and Agog isn't very dramatic. It was okay, but with all the tragic deaths of Lord of the Rings, this did not come close. We had Boromir's Death, and Theoden's that had their sad and honorable endings, and as a king Thorin really should have had that moment better. No funeral? Very interesting. Again, with the duel between Thorin and Azog and the lack of a true ending for the characters we have been on a journey with for three movies, you wonder if they looked at their bank account and just said... heck with it. <br/><br/>Okay movie, but you have to ask with the lack of, whether Peter Jackson made the movie in such a way to just kill the series. Its very tragic as especially with the movies this year, it could have really made a big noise in the Academy Awards."
"jonedney124","9","3","6","29 December 2014"," The end of an incredible journey
","I would go into more detail but I only have one thousand words so...I find on reading some reviews of this final Hobbit film that most of them couldn't care less (see for example Rope of Silicon's review). The reason that this film is currently on 60% on Rotten Tomatoes is that most people cannot look past the three-film decision and punish this film in particular for that very reason. When I see the words 'hollow spectacle' being used to describe this film, I can't help but snort, given the number of comments I've seen around the internet (mostly from fans, the people who DO care) that found themselves tearing up at certain points in this film.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson and co have always been aware that characters cannot be just lifted off the page and plonked on the screen and this is certainly the case here. Characters like Bard, Thranduil and the dwarfs themselves come across so much more strongly because effort has been put into their characters emotional journeys. Take the spectacular Laketown opening: the climax of this is fairly anti-climactic in the book, given that the story's main antagonist is felled by someone we have just been introduced to and yet here, we have already met Bard in DoS and know what's important to him and to see that played out is so much more satisfying than the book because there is real emotion running through it and that goes for the whole film.<br/><br/>I am fed up of reading comments saying 'Bilbo doesn't do much'. READ THE BOOK, PEOPLE! Tolkien sees fit to have him hide or be knocked out throughout the battle and a lot of what he does in this part of the story is observing the tensions unfold around him, even though it is from his perspective, he often isn't actually doing anything compared to earlier in the story. An early scene between Thorin and Bilbo perfectly captures the hobbit who dreams of home and who is loyal even when friendships are tested.Another scene shows Dwalin, an aggressive dwarf loyal to Thorin, seeing his friend's descent into madness and pleading with him to see reason. Hollow spectacle? PAH! That's not even going into the emotional ends of some of the main characters, one of which has a considerable amount of dialogue lifted straight from the book. Other scenes, such as the White Council at Dol Guldur, are inspired by Tolkien's canon and other arcs, such as the love story, tap into universal themes of innocence, love and loss.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are spectacular if not quite as spectacular as LOTR but then the same could be said for the book, story and film. Nothing in this film can quite match the sheer desperation and then emotional release in Return of the King simply because it just isn't there in the story. What they do have they make the best of, bringing this grand saga to an end in a spectacular and emotional fashion. It may not be quite the defining chapter, that will always be whichever LOTR is your favourite, but this is a shining example of filmmakers going above and beyond the call of duty when adapting a book. Most just look at things to cut, as they would have done had this been one or two films: here, this possibly final cinematic representation of Middle-Earth celebrates the visionary mind of JRR Tolkien's wider world, remembering, as Gandalf says in the book and the film to Bilbo: 'You are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all'. This is a Hobbit made in light of The Lord of the Rings, literary and cinematic: the original novel only had itself to contend with in the minds of readers. If the average Hollywood director had approached this material, you would not have ended up with this six film saga that is faithful to Tolkien's world in so many ways and the critical send off that this world has received is pathetic. To those of us who truly care, this is the end of a cinematic journey like no other."

"supatube","7","10","31","9 December 2014"," An epic end to an epic story.
","""The Battle of Five Armies"" begins with the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) flying through the sky towards Lake-Town bellowing fire in his belly and setting the town alight without sympathy. Smaug's malevolence comes from his isolation and ability to hoard what he doesn't need. So when the dragon is defeated by the astute archer Bard (Luke Evans) his evil doesn't dissipate with him. Thorin (Richard Armitage) claims stake to his treasure and the greed grows steadily within him. This is the first sign as to the evil behind accumulation and the unwillingness to share. But Thorin will be the first to evoke aggression for the possession of all the gold. <br/><br/>The people from Lake-Town now make their way to the supposed safety and shelter of the abandoned town on the Lonely Mountain. <br/><br/>The Dwarfs barricade the entrance to the treasure on Thorin's command while the Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid. Thorin denies the Elves, and Men, what he had originally promised them. <br/><br/>Tension escalates as Orcs and Goblins advance on the mountain. Soon a Dwarf army arrives to defend Thorin from the advancements of Elves not knowing of the Orcs and Goblins. But their fight for wealth is stifled when the real enemy descends on the Lonely Mountain, attacking the women and children seeking shelter in the abandoned town and the armies of the Elves, Dwarfs and Man.<br/><br/>The battle is a forty-five minute barrage of destruction and death. Epic to say the least as the fighting's relentless and aggressive across the entire lonely mountain. <br/><br/>The Hobbit Trilogy is a very welcome film epic but in terms of story the two most memorable parts of The Hobbit are in fact the dragon Smaug and the dark, wet cave where Bilbo finds the ring. With the ring being found and the dragon out of action the last two hours of ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is more than a little dragged out. In the same fashion as how the introduction to each Dwarf in the beginning of ""An Unexpected Journey"" is dragged out –there's only two fleshed out Dwarf stories, Thorin and Kili. But this is to be expected when one tries to turn one story into three. <br/><br/>Nonetheless ""Battle of the Five Armies"" is a great action/adventure to end the year off. A great way to end one of the most amazing stories ever told. It may be a book that teenagers read but this Peter Jackson Trilogy has turned the written word into something more visceral than my teenage brain could fathom. <br/><br/>""Battle of the Five Armies"" can sit up there (just under) with the other big-budget, high effect driven films of 2014 like ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"", """"Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" while it slaughters the likes of ""Godzilla"", ""Transformers"" and ""The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""."

","This was an excellent film very good to the book. Excellent performances by Richard Artimage, Bendict Cumberpatch and Luke Evens. It was sad to see the end of Middle-earth. Some Characters I really enjoyed was Lord of Dale and Alfrid. The CGI effects were amazing in this film and people should go and see it in 3d as if not you are missing out big time. The one thing Peter Jackson stated before hand was that the hobbit films and Lord of the rings films should link into each other which they did. This film should win Oscar for special effects as this was just jam pack so sorry interstellar. I also like to state that all the sets were amazing from the hobbition to the Lonely Mountain. This is one Christmas film you have to see this Christmas."

","With Erebor back in the hands of the king, Smaug(Cumberbatch, snake-like) taking out his fury on Laketown which leaves the inhabitants as refugees, the gold and area are claimed, to varying extent, by various groups who may not agree, and a legion of Orcs on the way, the titular five armies will have to either fight each other, or band together against a common threat.<br/><br/>This resolves everything in the trilogy, and is smoother in doing so than Return, albeit that is in part because there is less to deal with. Ultimately, while some of us prefer the darker tone of this to the more child-friendly novel(which this follows quite nicely), this should not have tried to connect itself so tightly to The Lord of the Rings. Never reaching Star Wars prequel levels, this does go out of its way to simultaneously set up, and not dig too deeply into, where this leaves off and that picks it back up.<br/><br/>A lot is done with what was built up in these three. Strong male bonding, in particular the dynamic relationship between Bilbo(Freeman, awkward and homesick, yet still proving himself a hero, and utilizes his skills and wit to help solve the conflict) and Thorin(Armitage, obsessed with his newly found wealth, yet beneath, maybe still honorable). Will old enemies be able to settle their differences? Have some steps been taken that cannot be undone? Will everyone have a place to call home, and a future?<br/><br/>The climax is an awful lot of fun, and you can tell Jackson has been missing doing vast battle scenes between several sides each with hundreds of organized forces, and that, apparently, this will be his last chance to do so. It does end up too long, extending, well, padding, the shortest of these since it was decided there would be more than two in this series. There's room for fan-service, new creatures and settings, and for not only endangering the people we came to see and also their loved ones but then letting some of them disappear into the background. At its best, there is drama, it's poignant, and satisfying. This is not always the case here.<br/><br/>There is moderate(pushing PG-13, as has been done lately) violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the J.R.R. Tolkien Middle Earth epics. 9/10"

","I have been always one of the though defenders of the adaptations that PJ did for the LOTR and TH movies, but for this one I can't, PJ destroyed completely the essence of the finale of this story. The beginning was great, the death of Smaug great, but come on the mess he did for the finale is something I can't understand. The editing of the film is the worst ever too, I'm sure that all the cuts and questions with no answers of the film will be in the Extended version but in this special case those cuts destroyed the movie. Beorn one of the most beloved characters of the film was reduced to be 3 seconds in screen an after that you don't know a thing about him, the same for Radagast. One of the reasons we bought why we needed to have 3 The Hobbit movies were to be explained for many of the thing that weren't told in the book, but at the end was the same, the book has a much better ending with much more answers for the future of all the characters. PJ forced too much to include Legolas that he killed some of the greatest parts of the book like Thorin's funeral, the fate of the Arkenstone, the heroic death of Fili & Kili defending his uncle. What a mess, please PJ don't you dare to work in any JRR Tolkien material again, this movie is the worst of all the 6, the first two were OK, but this one is crap. Legolas battle in the bridge is crap, the fight between Thorin & Azog crap, Alfrid's character crap, the Elven King reasons to be am asshole crap, I hated this film."
"harpreetc","9","7","21","11 December 2014"," Great but could have been greater
","As usual, after a movie Peter Jackson makes on works by Tolkien, I post a small outpouring of my thoughts. This time is no different, though I will be able to get a more definite picture – literally – after I see it a couple of times more. I don't feel like letting go, and though everyone says it's #onelasttime I don't really see the last bit happening. So I am not really sad about it. Especially because I still have the Lord of the Rings to turn to for superlative story telling.<br/><br/>There will be spoilers from now on, so if you aren't interested to know plot details please do not read further. Fast, fast, fast does it go, and never a moment's pause in action. It begins with Smaug and that dragon is dispensed with in just about 10 minutes flat, which is pretty awkward and antithetical to all that prosaic dialogue and running around furnaces for what seemed like a long time in the previous part. There is no use of birds except the raven sent to notify Dain Ironfoot. Who by the by has done a good cameo. Everyone seems to be riding animals though: Dain on a wart hog, Thorin on a ram, Thranduil on an elk – hmmmmm. I loved, absolutely loved, the White Council scenes. Galadriel's entry, carrying Gandalf, and finally the using of Nenya, is absolutely glorious! The action scenes are fast and get over all too soon. I loved this scene, have I mentioned? Oh, well, I'll mention it again, I loved it. The Elves are everywhere! Thranduil, Legolas and Tauriel have their parts stretched to suit fandoms everywhere. I am not complaining, but I would have liked to see more Beorn, more eagles, more Gandalf and Radagast, too. Alfrid is given undue weight-age but I suppose it is to prove that not all bad guys get their just desserts, on in this case, they get the desserts they always wanted to have. I liked the dialogues of this part. They have a certain lyricism that reminded me of the Lord of the Rings. The death scenes are handled well, and grief is given its due place in the scheme of this movie and helps pass on age old morals, that do not really seem jaded in these contexts. When Tauriel asks Thranduil, ""why does love hurt so?"" and he answers, ""because it is real"" – I was moved. Honest, direct and true. No flowery stuff. It kind of sums up what the genre of fantasy means to me . The movie has a faster pace than either of its predecessors. There isn't a moment to take into consideration character movement, unless you take Thorin's descent into madness induced by possessiveness for property and want of power. The scenes flow seamlessly, but too fast, in my opinion. It's almost as if PJ wanted to rush through this one and get it over with. In fact, I think this movie had more places where the scenes could be prolonged, like the epic confrontation between the White Council and Sauron and Beorn's part in the battle of the climax, to name just two that I was really looking forward to seeing. Well, maybe in the Extended Version of the Blu-Ray then. Do I see it again? Of course!!"
"tieman64","Null","4","10","26 January 2015"," In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit
","John Tolkien wrote ""The Hobbit"" in 1937, an epic adventure set in the mythical world of Middle Earth. Director Peter Jackson would adapt the novel in 2012, turning it into a series of three feature films.<br/><br/>The first film in the series, ""An Unexpected Journey"" (2012) stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's a hobbit, a pint-sized creature with giant feet. Bilbo joins a band of dwarfs, a funny group of bearded warriors led by King Thorin (Richard Armitage). Thorin's journeying to Erebor, where a giant dragon, Smaug, lords over an ancient dwarf kingdom. Thorin wants to reclaim this kingdom. To do so, he must kill Smaug.<br/><br/>Tolkien's dwarfs, borne of twelve tribes, each banished from the same homeland, were inspired by the Israelites of the Old Testament. Conforming to old Jewish stereotypes, they are thus greedy, big-nosed and obsessed with money, gold and meticulous bookkeeping. These are attributes which hobbits, good natured and humble, do not possess. Indeed, Bilbo was assigned to this quest by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) precisely because hobbits are less prone to the temptations that befall others.<br/><br/>Nothing much happens in ""Journey"". Despite its gargantuan running time, the film simply watches as our heroes amble from point A to B. Along the way they randomly encounter various monsters, whom they battle or flee. Like Jackson's original ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"", the film's plot mostly feels like an excuse to pile one battle or sub-quest upon the other. As this is what epic fantasy literature has essentially always been like, and as Jackson obviously adores his source material, the film's arbitrariness never becomes too troublesome. Jackson's touch is mostly light, playful and personal.<br/><br/>""Journey"" ends with Bilbo discovering a magical ring. This ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron, was designed to corrupt the inhabitants of Middle Earth and so push the world into utter chaos. With Middle Earth's various factions at war with one another, Sauron hopes to descend, conquer and reign supreme.<br/><br/>The second film in the series, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013) opens with our heroes fleeing Sauron's goblin armies. The film's thin plot once again finds our heroes battling arbitrarily conjured up CGI monsters. Assisting them are a group of elves, led by the elf warriors Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Essentially vain fashion models, elves look down upon all other creatures in Middle Earth. Scratch their pompous facades, though, and the elves reveal a compassionate and sacrificial streak. With the grace of ballerinas and the combat skills of Jackie Chan, Legolas and Tauriel risk life and limb for our heroes.<br/><br/>""Desolation"" is packed with cool sequences. Jackson treats us to a battle with giant spiders, an escape from an elf encampment and finally a journey into Laketown. A cross between Venice and a Medieval village, Laketown brims with fun set design. Here our heroes meet Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), a member of a human tribe ravaged by the dragon Smaug. ""Desolation"" climaxes with Bilbo and his buddies journeying into Erebor and confronting Smaug, who sleeps upon mountains of gold. Awesomeness ensues.<br/><br/>The last film in the series, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014) finds King Thorin retaking Erebor, only to find human and elf armies at his doorstep, all demanding their fair share of the treasures stored within. As King Thorin is a greedy jerk who increasingly craves power and wealth, Thorin refuses to listen to their demands. When dwarf reinforcements arrive, complete with hilarious Combat Pigs and Multi-Purpose Armoured Mountain Goats, Thorin feels he has the military forces necessary to safeguard his selfishness. His confidence doesn't last long; Sauron has also sent a mighty army to conquer Erebor. God dammit Sauron.<br/><br/>At its best, ""Five"" portrays Middle Earth as a feudal hellhole in which different tribes fight petty battles for land and gold. Gandalf, the wise wizard, wants Middle Earth's citizens to band together, to share, to unite against Sauron, but suspicions, greed and quasi-racist animosities keep elves, humans and dwarfs apart. In the end, it is the humility of the hobbit, a bizarre interspecies love affair between elf and man, coupled with Gandalf's subtle scheming, which draws the inhabitants of Middle Earth together. They're tentatively united in a kind of pluralistic, multi-ethnic mega-army. But as Tolkien was a bit of a nutty Christian, his material's critiques of ""power"", ""corruption"" and ""greed"" nevertheless ultimately boil down to a kind of Biblical apocalypticism. The solution is always mass murder, killing is glorified, and conflict is always a Manichaean thing in which the good guys struggle against the bad guys (the hyena riding goblin slaves, the violent Easterlings, the elephant riding Haradrim, all with racial connotations which Jackson mostly softens), who must be exterminated as they are innately evil creatures who differ in appearance, behaviour and opinions.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, Jackson's trilogy is spectacular. Jackson offers some serious mountain porn, turns cross-country hiking into a Wagnerian spectacle and his FX work is at times impressive. It takes a certain type of genius to adapt Tolkien in a manner that isn't ridiculous.<br/><br/>On the downside, Jackson's battles too often neglect more interesting political and tactical jousting in favour for bad CGI rag-dolls and endless hack and slashing. With mega-worms and giant troll catapults at your disposal, why focus on repetitive sword-fights? Considering the length of Jackson's Tolkien outings, it's also amazing how empty his characters are. With Jackson, there are never any substantial relationships or conversations, love affairs are unconvincing, friendships are exclaimed but never seen, and all the film's ""human drama"" is treated as perfunctory filler. What the films mostly care about is running and carnage. Escaping these tendencies are Gandalf and the hobbits. Epitomising a kind of Arendtian ""banality of goodness"", Jackson highlights their ordinariness, their lowliness, their lack of possessions and ambition, which makes them uniquely suited to assuming positions of the highest responsibility and power.<br/><br/>8/10 - See ""Ran"" (1985)."
"PrashunChakraborty","8","4","10","7 January 2015"," Liked it more than I should
","Like most people who grew up in the 2000s I deem LOTR to be a modern day classic fantasy film series like Star Wars was for the kids back in the 70's. This makes me biased when it comes to the Lord of the rings series. Yup I am a HUGE LOTR nerd but even then I am not blind enough to see that the Hobbit trilogy doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy simply because Peter Jackson decided to make three films out of a single book whereas the each of the book of Lord of the rings got a whole movie treatment. The original Hobbit movie was decent but the lack of quality became most apparent in the second Hobbit film Desolation of Smaug (which is easily the weakest of all 6 films of the series), thus I was a bit skeptical while watching The Battle of the Five Armies (should have been called There and Back Again like in the book in my opinion). Well, I am glad to say that I was wrong I really like this one, it has some good old LOTR charm, hopeless battles in which good guys almost lose, good guys win, bad guys die, some good guys die too, predictable yes but LOTR has always been that and it's still so awesome.<br/><br/>What has made Hobbit films unique are Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins) and Richard Armitage (Thorin). Bilbo is probably my favorite Hobbit ever! he is charming, funny, resourceful and most importantly isn't at all whiny (yes Frodo you could learn something from your uncle Bilbo). Thorin started out as an Aragorn prototype of a king without his kingdom but he quickly stands out as an ambitious focused individual who doesn't mind breaking a few necks to get his kingdom back, him under the influence of the dragoncurse is an interesting angle as well. Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf has always been a fan favorite and he is impeccable as Gandalf in the final movie of the saga. Sir Christopher Lee as Saruman has always been the unsung hero of the series his booming voice is in all its glory even at such a late stage in his life. Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett aptly portray their old roles. <br/><br/>As far as criticsim of the movie goes there is quite a few of them, rest of the dwarfs are forgettable, Bard is such a boring character (they had three movies to develop this guy and he still his character can't match Boromir who was introduced half way into the fellowship), some terrible and unnecessary romance between a dwarf and an elf, some really bad cgi action scenes and finally, weak female characters with some terrible acting by Evangeline Lily. However don't let this deter you from watching this film, it hits some great emotional highs and I nerded out when at the end of the film Thandruil told Legolas to search for a certain Dunedain ranger who goes by the name of Strider, the film is filled with such small easter eggs for the fan of the series and the last shot in which we see an old Bilbo Baggins hearing Gandalf's knock on his door which starts the events of the Fellowship of the ring is perhaps the best end I could have hoped for, it was beautiful. I would love to own the entire Hobbit trilogy extended edition because this film was clearly butchered to adhere to studio runtime (especially Saruman angle), it would look good beside my original LOTR extended edition."
"eduards-slava","7","4","10","3 January 2015"," Superb cinematography (3D HFR) with decent story
","This review is meant to help people decide whether its worth their time and money to watch this movie or not.<br/><br/>Overall feel? I have read Hobbit and story deviations didn't bother me at all (not a die hard fan). I am usually annoyed by plot/character inconsistencies and those weren't issue either. Mostly movie was in action type setting, but had emotional conflicts and bit of romance, some funny bits and my favorite parts: that nice gray wizard trying to light up his pipe. You won't find deep philosophical knowledge here but there are moments for reflection. Its strongest point is definitely visuals and if you are not into it and didn't like story/characters from previous Hobbit movies this probably won't be better.<br/><br/>Visuals? Oh gawd they were good (HFR at least). For me it seemed very realistic although still sometimes disorientating and lacking in realistic physics. I enjoyed HFR of previous movies and thought it was even better in this one. I'm speculating that having screen covering larger portion of your field of vision might be better (as effects are cutoff outside screen). The whole experience might have been worth just because of visuals."
"timewhorl","5","4","10","25 December 2014"," The Last Journey to Middle Earth
","I know that one more review is unlikely to change opinions, alter perspectives, or enhance or detract from another person's viewing experience. What this review gives is a chance for me to end a thirteen year journey through Middle Earth, read the final page, then put the book on the shelf. It has been an amazing time as a Tolkien fan and I feel blessed to be living in a time when these adaptations have been made and put onto the silver screen.<br/><br/>There are so many moments I love, particularly in The Lord of the Rings movies, so many memorable lines and deeds and characters. I wanted the Hobbit to be as well made and expected it to be even better.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>As a Tolkien lover, I don't know how to fully express disappointment over these new Hobbit films without sounding like I am comparing it to either the original book or the Lord of the Rings and saying it is SO much worse. But I have to say that I did not love, nor even really like the new Hobbit movies. What I truly wanted was less. I didn't need the big budget, the added story lines and characters, the CGI, the over-the-top moments of added romance, king madness, epic warfare and recycling of plot points from the Lord of the Rings. I just wanted The Hobbit and what I got was The Hobbit remade in the Lord of the Rings image.<br/><br/>I don't really want to SPOILER a whole movie for others, but I couldn't like some characters, namely Tauriel and Alfred and the entire section spent in Laketown because they took focus off Bilbo and weren't needed as plot devices. I understand how some people argue that there is more going on in the story with the White Council and it shouldn't be singular focus on one character, but why? According to Tolkien's book it follows Bilbo directly, with a few moments (like when Smaug is attacking the town) where you are with other characters, BRIEFLY. It is called The Hobbit because IT is about his deeds, his thoughts, his life with these dwarfs and is not about how heroic Kili is, nor how useful as a healer Tauriel can be, nor how awesome Legolas is at boulder hopping, nor how corrupt and smelly the people of Laketown can be.<br/><br/>It is also a disappointment because CGI shouldn't be overused the way it has been in this trilogy. Some characters like Smaug and Gollum require it (or impressive animatronics, which is hard to make and very expensive). I saw images of Bolg back when there was going to be two films and it was real person playing him, decked out as a very impressive, hideous, and strong villain. There was no point to making him CGI, nor to giving his importance to an orc who died long before this story takes place. Why make him CGI? I also was surprised by the low quality of some scenes where I could tell that the whole thing was CGI, from background to horse and rider. It looked like a computer game. Why couldn't they use real people, real horses, and real scenery? It took a lot of the enjoyment out of the movies for me because it was surreal.<br/><br/>The acting was mostly good, with Martin Freeman giving the best expressive performance, followed by Sir Ian McKellen. Martin's scenes stand out because of his talent but are often overshadowed by the intrigues and plot thickeners added. In other words, Bilbo never gets the change to shine, be himself and tell his story. Instead, he is caught up in other people's trivial lives and gets bowled over by the angst.<br/><br/>It is a relief for this Middle Earth journey to be over. I am grateful to Peter Jackson for a lot of his work, but just not these movies. I will not be seeing the third movie again, nor any of the others, as re-watching them has not made my heart grow fonder. I have skipped the Extended Editions, too, because I feel the stories are extended enough without Peter Jackson adding more. <br/><br/>Namárië, Middle Earth. <br/><br/>4 Stars Given For: *** Casting, * Sets and Costumes."

","As he did with the Rings trilogy Jackson has greatly improved on the books, for those who criticise him for the big changes he has done, go back and read the hobbit again. it is not a great book, it spends more time describing places and things than it does in plot or characters, people are just mentioned in passing almost. There is no drive to it. Admittedly i think two films would have been sufficient, but at least we get to spend one last time in middle earth. yes there are flaws in this final part, and the battle is very scatty, but it also has some great action and the ending is truly moving, and of course it links very nicely to the fellowship of the ring. lets hope that Star Wars is able to fill the void for next Christmas,"
"vikram-ry123","9","4","10","19 December 2014"," The Epic Mythology v The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (A Review)
","The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies was Peter Jackson's adaptation of the popular fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien. Yesterday I was lucky to count on the final act of the Hobbit trilogy on 3D at INOX theater, Jayanagar, Bangalore. The experience was awesome and not comparable to any such high end production. It was an experience, the inner feeling, at a point of time I was thinking, if such story continues for the lifetime may be I would love to keep watching and watching. Yeah! 144 minutes of the video was passed like an eye blink.<br/><br/>Some important facts from the movie I wanted to highlight in this review. The epic mythological standard of the Hobbit story is undoubted. In the Indian epic mythology, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, or The Greek epic mythology, the Iliad, or all the literatures of the mythical standards have one thing in common, either a tragic end or the downfall of the heroes.<br/><br/>In the epic, The Ramayana, Ravana who was a good king, built the first democratic republic in the human history for his people. He had wealth, gold, and luxury in his kingdom. He was the conqueror of the heaven by defeating the demigods. But at the end he had lost the battle with Rama, an ordinary human prince from Ayodhya, India. Because the one mistake of Ravana by stealing Sita, the wife of Rama. Ravana did not listen to his ministers, brothers and wife to send back Sita, and protect the kingdom. In-stead of the sick king declared his own followers as the traitors and banished them from his kingdom. Here in the Hobbit, the exiled dwarf king of Erebor, Thorin Oakenshield, became blind of all his promises to the people and his followers once he got back the gold treasury. The life of people seemed no value to him in compare to the gold. He lost his conscience and became sick by not trusting his own people for the gems stone, called the heart of the mountain.<br/><br/>In the epic, The Mahabharata, Duryodhana, the elder prince of Hastinapura, India. He had claimed to be the king of Hastinapura. He had conspiracies and several false promises made to his cousin brothers for the share of the wealth of his kingdom. In spite of fulfilling his promises he chosen the war which took place at Kurukshetra and ended up after 18 days of devastating destruction and the complete ruin of his life and the kingdom. Duryodhana told, ""Without the war, I will not give even a needle worth of land"". Here in the Hobbit, Thorin, forgot of his promises made to Bard, the dragon slayer and the descendant of Girion, the Lord of Dale and to his people. Bard saved the life of Thorin and his followers. He and his people helped them, by giving food, comfort, and nourishment. Without their contribution it was impossible to Thorin to get back to the mountain. But when the time came to reclaim the promises made by Thorin to Brad and his people; Thorin chosen the war. He was not ready to pay a single gold penny to them.<br/><br/>In the epic, The Iliad, Priam, the king of Troy and his elder son, Hector, both of them were aware of the mistake done by Paris. Helen, queen of Sparta, who eloped with Paris, the younger son of Priam, was the cause of the Trojan War. Perhaps Priam act at the right moment to send back Helen and protect Troy. But he did not, which caused the downfall of Troy. In Hobbit, Thorin, it was look like, though he had a small strength of army which was not sufficient to go for a war, declared his own downfall.<br/><br/>May be, he could allied with Bard, and Thranduil, the Elven king, have had been helped by the alliance a smooth win against Azog, the Orc chieftain and his Goblin army. At the end, Thorin could have a happy life by ruling, Erebor, until the end of his career. Which he did not act at the right moment, and bring his own downfall at the hand of Azog.<br/><br/>Albeit, Peter Jackson had no hand on that part of the story, as, I hope, it was all written by J. R. R. Tolkien in his novel. Albeit the commonness of the Hobbit version of the mythology, here I found beautiful and unforgettable supporting characters like, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Legolas, Saruman, Radagast, and Galadriel. These characters were acted and protected the role of wise, honest, courageous, who were changed the permutations and combinations of the Hobbit, the epic mythology.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Always love, Vikram"
"nij-chris-532-818683","7","4","10","12 December 2014"," Good, but not brilliant
","Saw this in Imax 3D at the first showing in B'ham UK. I had to queue, at 0945! In the am! Firstly, you need to be up to date with both the last movie Desolation of Smaug, and the first (Fellowship of the Ring : first and still the best). Some scenes which might seem non-sequitur rely on an enthusiast's recall of the original story and the preceding two movies in this latest trilogy. The rather thin plot, which follows upon the demise of the lovely Cumberbatch in the disguise of the loathsome Smaug (not a spoiler I hope) revolves on the Dwarf King wanting to hold on to more gold than there actually is, at least in this world (or any other I strongly suspect) - anyway, enough to disturb the balance of earthly economies. So that's the first 1/2-hour dealt with. The rest of the film is a confusing battle between Dwarfs on the inside (with gold), Men and Elves on the outside (who want the gold), Dwarf Cousin Billy Connolly and his mates on the outside (who want to help the little guys on the inside keep their gold), and no fewer than two whole armies of the spectacularly-poor-warrior Orcs on the outside who don't want the gold, just the whole mountain, together with everyone's death. No change there, then. Gandalf, as usual, flits ineffectually in and out of the movie to give some continuity with the previous screenings. And no-one needs to eat or go to the toilet. If you like Dungeons and Dragons, you'll love this. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you may be disappointed. It was all rather 2-dimensional for a 3D-movie. And me? I loved it, can't wait to see it again."
"harryplinkett14","1","5","14","24 April 2015"," Anti-cinema
","This is anti-cinema brought to perfection. There is no story here, there are no characters. This is a computer game posing as a film. Still, the point of a computer game is to be able to play it, which is why the film is way less satisfying than even a proper game. I wonder how the director even gave direction to actors who are now completely in a CG environment and interacting with CG characters. How on earth are they supposed to feel or act? The only attempt at 'acting' is poor 'Bilbo', whose quirks are now quite tedious and irritating. He stares a lot in this film, I guess that's supposed to be acting. This final installment is even more story-less and life-less than the previous two. It feels utterly fake and at no point do you even think you might have seen a genuine environment. Monsters in their tens of thousands and countless varieties clash for what seems like forever, without giving the audience the time to emote or even see what is going on. The close-ups of the battle give you absolutely no chance to see who you are supposed to be rooting for. I won't even go into the details about how illogical the battle is or how utterly devoid of storyline this film is. This is nothing but pure anti-cinema: visual gratification that has no artistic ambitions whatsoever, let alone the ambition to emotionally engage the audience or convey some sort of message. No, this is instant gratification for the senses, with absolutely no soul and no humanity. The 'cinema' for the new generation of idiots, that is all it is."

Now, the company of Thorin has entered the Lonely Mountain and led Smaug the terrible to seek his fiery act of revenge upon Lake town. Meanwhile, the dark shadow has risen from the past and it threatens to return to the peaceful lands with nefarious orc armies marching towards the gates of Erebor. Against such an enemy, the dwarfs shall follow their King, Thorin, one last time into an epic battle consisting of five armies. 'The Battle of the Five armies' is closer to Tolkien's Hobbit than its predecessors and with just a 144 min duration that engaged viewers with some exemplary CGI and emotionally charged performances, Jackson leaves the world of epic fantasy on a high note. <br/><br/>Fire and death follow Smaug's blitzkrieg on Lake Town, that paid no heed to Bard's warnings of imminent ruin. The black arrow is what shall stand between the dragon's wrath and survival of lake men who suffer the consequences of the dwarfs creating havoc in his lair within Erebor. The bowman's heroics saved the town from death but not from ruin and soon he marches with the survivors towards the mountain, to claim their share of the treasures that was promised by Thorin. The King under the mountain has reclaimed the dwarf homeland and the dragon sickness (greed) has taken over his mind while he incessantly searches in vain, for the Arkenstone. With the lake men and wood elves as his unwelcome hosts demanding their righteous share of the treasure, Thorin chooses war in his defense with support from the ironfoot dwarfs in his cousin Dain's army. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Dol Goldur, lady Galadriel aids Radagast in Gandalf's release, only to be challenged by the spirits of the Ringwraiths. That's when Elrond arrives and together with Saruman the white, they confront their greatest fear that has arisen from the dead. In a CGI heavy sequence, the white council overthrows the dark lord's spirit with an incredulous assurance from Saruman that he will take care of Sauron himself. We all know how that went down..... Dark clouds gather at the gates of Erebor and as legions of Orcs storm into the valley, every character from the book and Jackson's creative mind is engaged in an epic battle that draws a close to the quest for Erebor. <br/><br/>In the midst of the chaotic battles, there yet remains a focus on the relationships between characters and how their dynamics play out when the world around them faces destruction. Jackson's invention of the Tauriel-Killi saga comes to its befitting end with Evangeline Lilly having her fair share of action sequences. Bard rises as a leader of the lake men and while being a responsible father as well, he leads the defense in the ruins of Dale. Thranduil (Lee Pace) marches his Elvish army to the gates with the intention of securing the white jewels but ends up in a battle that he always wanted to avoid. Gandalf (Sir Ian Mckellan) confronts his greatest fear and while he directs the forces strategically during the main battle, at the end of it all, he appears calm and collected while lighting his pipe as though it was just another day in Middle Earth. Legolas (Orlando Bloom)'s stunts are immense fun to watch as he defies gravity with swift actions especially against Bolg, the orc. Thorin, the new king under the mountain goes through a remarkable transition from a determined leader of his company to a tenacious guardian of the profound treasure. This is more a story of Thorin's journey to take back what was once his people's and some of his insecurities seem justified to that end. But the heart of the story is with Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins. The lazy Hobbit turned reluctant adventurer who sheds all inhibitions when it comes to choosing right v/s wrong. He is as natural as Bilbo as he is Dr. Watson. <br/><br/>Jackson plays all his cards, always keeping the faithful reader and dedicated fan as his target audience. The CGI is superior to some of the sequences in the prior films and takes advantage of the large canvas that Jackson provides for WETA. <br/><br/>Howard Shore is partly responsible for the film's epic feel. The soundtrack is powerful in times of war and with tunes of Lake Town and Shire repeating at the poignant moments, one simply becomes a part of the scene. Every digression, addition and impulsion over the previous two installments falls in place now as Jackson manages to steer to the conclusion in less than 150mins. But there's one keen element that is missing from this series. It is the lack of desperation in the quest. Even if the treasure for which the five armies battle it out is immense in measure, the stakes still do not seem high enough. Perhaps this is simply because 'The Hobbit' was a children's tale that Peter Jackson turned into a perilous journey through evil lands seeking justice but ending up with greed. <br/><br/>Overcoming the flaws of the previous films in the Hobbit trilogy, Peter Jackson ensures a solid end to a story that shouldn't have taken this long and at the end of all the perilous battles, losses and victories, he smoothly completes the transition to the story of the fellowship. That moment brings cheerful heaviness to the heart at the conclusion of a journey that though off-sequence does feel complete, while leaving a bitter sweet feeling that only Peter Jackson and his dedicated team could, one last time. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.341 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","One of the best coming from Peter Jackson, at last a Hobbit movie that really blows your mind. It really is interesting to see how much progress has been made from the LOTR series be it CGI, details etc. The early hobbit movies where a little dull for my taste but this one surely changes that. I believe this one sticks to the book more than the others but Jackson did change a few things which helps engage the viewer in a good way. I went to watch the movie after office and was dead tired and was hoping I would have a good doze off, but it turned out completely different(Awesome) and the feeling which I had when I watched LOTR for the first time came back.A must watch!!!"

There cannot be a reader alive who has not dreamt of seeing the battle of the five armies on the big screen. The dwarfs, the elves, the the men, the orcs and finally the eagles. How can it fail?<br/><br/>This film fails on so many levels that it defies comprehension. Legolas is randomly here once again, this time paying a pivotal role and appearing in what is undeniably the single most stupid action sequence in any movie in history.<br/><br/>Literally days could be spent detailing what is wrong with this film. It is certainly much easier to state what is right with it. Nothing.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson had the chance to make an amazing trilogy of movies, though frankly 2 movies would have been better. Instead, he has produced a steaming pile of excrement, literally fit for nothing. The only people who even vaguely like this movie, and believe me even just as a movie it really is insanely poor, simply have not read the book.<br/><br/>The only real hope for fans of the book is that this movie is simply so bad that at some point in the near future it will be remade. A decent director could make a good movie from this material so let us hope the studios see it this way too.<br/><br/>You might think you want to watch this movie but believe me, you really do not."

","This movie was only produced to milk peoples money, and for people with more intelligence than average, its a bad movie.

The faces of the elf army was visible totally identical and computer generated, this was carefully avoided in the first LOTR-movie produced 15 years ago. Very strange that the movies should be worse now a days.<br/><br/>Galadriels fight with Sauron was also quite awkward. And afterwards Sauroman states ""He has been banished and will go to the east"". OK but in that case the majors did have knowledge of Saurons spirit endured and exactly where it was heading? They knew about his spirit, why was no action to destroy his spirit undertaken already before LOTR-1? Also elf army going to war over some pieces of jewelry, for real?? Also to movie is filled with some strange misandric subtones. ""Women an children first?"" Its equality no? If there is a black man also present? Why not gender equality.

","I'm a fan of Tolkien and I didn't mind the Lord of the Rings adaption, especially the first one.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a different story though (excuse the pun). I could barely watch it, particularly The Battle of the Five Armies. The CGI is terrible, its like watching someone play a computer game. The CGI is dark, cold, sometimes way too soft, sometimes too harsh and totally unrealistic ... I just couldn't connect to the movie with those visuals.<br/><br/>It's also stretched out with made up content that adds nothing and is not relevant to the story.

"AbhiMathews","5","3","7","16 February 2015"," The End
","The Hobbit trilogy has certainly been a level below its predecessor: The Lord of the Rings (it is actually the sequel chronologically). It's the series that lingered on a little too long and ultimately failed to bring the same magic the original films did. <br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies finally put an end to it all. After a tumultuous battle with Smaug, it's the inevitable fight for good to keep peace on Middle Earth. One of the best parts of this movie were the fight scenes. With that being said, it was also one of the worst. With extremely long and seldom entertaining fights that we've become used to watching, I'm glad to say it's finally over. <br/><br/>It was the grand journey Frodo and Sam led that initially kindled my fascination with Tolkien's translated work. I wished I could have enjoyed these cinematic pieces as much as the first three, but I simply didn't."
"logueybear","6","3","7","15 February 2015"," It's fun but all the problems came earlier
","While I have enjoyed this trilogy it has begun to feel like it was stretched a bridge too far. You get a strange feeling two would have been better for adapting the 300 page book and they probably debated this in the writing process but sadly they went the way that meant it began to feel too long and filled with padding with events and characters you didn't care enough about. The cast deliver as always and while there are parts of the film that I liked and thought were strong it suffered from its previous entries mistakes. While the scene in which Gandalf is rescued is done well and provides a fight scene with wizards and elves against the dark lord, it feels like the mystery origin story of the villain wasn't very interesting or entertaining because you knew what was going to happen. Seriously, you know what's going to happen and this film and neither of the others provide any relevant or new information that changes the story dramatically, it just shows what Gandalf was doing while the dwarfs were off being caught every so often. However, I was glad to see a good end to the dwarfs story which to me should have been the end of the second film, but I digress. The action was fun if punctured on occasion by scenes that didn't need to be there. I think Peter Jackson could have done better by getting as far away as he could from The Lord of the Rings and concentrated on the story of The Hobbit. Maybe one of two nods to the trilogy but never in your face. Less is more.<br/><br/>Basically a conclusion to a trilogy that was bogged down by a subplot that didn't do anything interesting in the origin story of Sauron, coupled with the dull love story, secondary villains and perhaps an over reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>Just all a bit too much in the end."
"spaztasticnerdette","7","3","7","7 February 2015"," A Journey that was Only Satisfactory
","I love the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. From the first day and on those films were my soul mate. When hearing that Peter Jackson was finally making this film I was overjoyed. I have been to all three midnight releases and I don't regret a single one. I felt this film disappointed me the most. I loved that they went into the necromancer in this film and unlike most I couldn't give hoot about the Tauriel and Kili love story. We all knew it was short lived so I wasn't surprised like some in the theater when he got killed. The was one thing missing from all three films that the Lord of the Rings had, heart. The compassion, the emotion, and the male bonding that was essential to these two trilogies. The film tried so hard to be new and innovative that there wasn't enough room for emotion and love. I think the cast was fine over all but I do think the script was far off than ever. Of course I did cry in the end of the film because I was still pleased enough to experience middle- earth one last time. Also my other complaint was the overload of CGI. Come on that was just silly."
"michael_the_nermal","7","3","7","3 February 2015"," Decent Ending to a Bloated Epic
","I agree now with most critics of the Hobbit trilogy that this story went on far longer than needed. The fights seem dull and interminable rather than gripping and exciting. There doesn't seem to be any decisiveness to the conflict presented until the very end. The same problems with the battles with Smaug from the previous film are evident, on a much larger scale, in this film. This movie also leaves many loose ends unresolved, particularly with regards to the Arkenstone and the corrupt rulers of Lake Town. There is also much in this film that seems hastily concluded or unfinished. I am not saying the film is completely unsatisfactory, but it is far from being a perfect ending.<br/><br/>That said, there are positive aspects to the film. Bilbo Baggins remains the likable, sensible character holding this movie together. He represents the hobbit race perfectly: plain, humble, unprejudiced, unpretentious, and without the greed and lust for power that poisons the minds of the dwarfs, elves, humans, and orcs surrounding him. Bilbo is a credible audience surrogate, and remains the bright shining jewel of humanity (a metaphor for the baser Arkenstone, if you will) that keeps this film worth watching. <br/><br/>The other races of Middle Earth (whether ""good"" or ""evil"") are comparatively unlikeable, particularly the elves and dwarfs. Thorin Oakenshield, the dwarf leader, is especially poisoned by greed. This film does a wonderful job showing the dangers of greed and power, and how Throin resolves these issues *by himself*. There is a vague hint that Thorin is not inherently greedy, but is manipulated by some supernatural power left by Smaug--I didn't like that aspect of it, as it did not ring true to me; having Thorin resolve a conflict that is entirely within himself seems more true to life. The elves, the ""good"" analogues to the repulsive orcs, don't come off much better than the dwarfs. Their leader Thranduil is moved by a strange sort of racism and cold-heartedness (his pale hair and flat effect reflect this coldness), which does the elves little good. Balin the Dwarf and Tauriel the Elf seem the most positive representatives of their respective races, and counterbalance the coldness of their leaders. As for the orcs, it's hard to feel true hatred towards them because there is no conflict within them: they are inherently, innately ""evil"", and that's that. They're ugly monsters with no complexity to their characterization. It's therefore easy to root for the good guys to kill the whole lot of them.<br/><br/>In all, the film could have been much shorter; ninety minutes would have been enough. I don't fault Jackson for expanding ""The Hobbit"" beyond the book into the appendices of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the greater mythos of Middle Earth. His main flaw with the trilogy was that he focused way too much on fighting and action, and did not focus enough on the story as presented by Tolkien. The final film's greatest flaw was its failure to resolve loose ends from the previous film. Beyond that and the action, the movie is actually good, and worth watching. If you buy the trilogy on DVD, be ready to fast forward through large portions. The film may actually seem better that way."
"mg-fre","5","3","7","27 January 2015"," Middle Earth - Transformers Style
","I actually started out liking this trilogy. Clearly Peter Jackson doesn't care much about the books, but as long as those become lively stories with intricate characters, those few empty theatrical moments are easily forgiven.<br/><br/>However, if the plot is turned into something that is dragged along unlovingly and is replaced by absolutely silly fight scenes that literally drag on for hours. Then you have a 'Transformers moment', which makes you want to shout out asking why the evil guy can't just be dead now.<br/><br/>The visuals, true to the Lord of the Rings legacy, are still stunning, that has to be said. Beautiful animations and cutting edge movie technology surely aren't absent, but that is far from saving the movie.<br/><br/>I would have liked to like that movie, but as it is it is empty, trying to give LOTR fans the bare minimum of resemblance to the original trilogy, but otherwise Middle Earth has lost its charm."

","I finally went over to see this movie last Sunday, after hearing from friends that it is for sure worth my time. And even though I did enjoy the movie, there were also a lot of things I didn't like at all.<br/><br/>The total overuse of CGI. It was too much. Galadriel looked like an animated cartoon character, the trolls looked very much fake also. / Tauriel. They made a huge mistake 'creating' that character and making her fall in love with a dwarf. It was just too cheesy. Especially at the end. And they even made Thranduil turn soft on her after all she did to him. I would have left her crying over Kili's body instead of saying: Because it was real. Useless and not needed. / Alfrid. Enough said. / What happened to the people of Laketown after the battle? It would have been nice to have seen that. / Bard, what happens to him and his whiny, screaming daughters (seriously, that's all they did, run and scream). / Beorn. You only see a glimpse of him transforming and jumping in the battle that is raging. Shame, since that's a character most of us wanted to see more of. / Did Thranduil get the Jewels of his kin back? Since the necklace was shown in a deleted scene from the first Hobbit movie and being shown in this one when Thorin holds it. I would have loved to see that Thranduil got it back. / The mentioning of Legolas his mother. She wasn't mentioned in the book, so again, they wrote her in for no reason. No mention of Oropher, Thranduils father who died in battle. / The Arkenstone. It's all about that stone, until Bard puts it back in his coat. No mention of it after that. Was it buried with Thorin?<br/><br/>I seriously blame the writers and Peter for messing this up. So many missed chances of this movie being a perfect 10, instead of a 6."
"ehochstatter","6","3","7","16 January 2015"," The viewer is constantly reminded of what could have been
","This is essentially a review of all three Hobbit movies. What could have been one excellent film based solely on the Hobbit book itself, was instead turned into three bloated, mediocre films. The Hobbit is NOT the Lord of the Rings, yet director Peter Jackson and team seem compelled to try to turn it into that kind of epic story, and they fail in the effort.<br/><br/>It's not all bad. Casting was great, especially Martin Freeman as Bilbo. New Zealand looks as beautiful as ever, and the FX are improved even from the LOTR films. Anyone familiar with the book, however, is constantly reminded of all the extra sub plots shoe horned into the Hobbit story in order to introduce characters and foreshadow events in the LOTR trilogy and, let's face it, stretch the story into three movies in an attempt to make more money. Some of the sub plots, especially the Elf, Dwarf, Elf ""love"" triangle, were frankly embarrassing.<br/><br/>At another point, one of the middle earth dwarfs says ""You go ahead...I got this,"" which pulled this viewer right out of the movie.<br/><br/>I will always admire the work Jackson did bringing the LOTR trilogy to the big screen, but this shameless Hobbit money grab tarnishes that legacy a bit. There's a reason I have the extended editions of the LOTR films in my library. There are also many reasons why the Hobbit trilogy will likely not be joining them."
"tsampakiourispetros","10","3","7","15 January 2015"," Epic, Touching, Masterpiece
","I recommend watching this movie and the older one's. It has every feeling a viewer can ever imagine, a lot of action, suspense (well unless you've read the books though :P) fun(I personally laughed in some scenes :) )and last but not least, the sceneries are the most amazing one's I've ever seen in a movie franchise. You see, when a series of books has an amazing success, then everyone can assume the movies derived from them will be great as well. Although this is not always true (I felt the Harry Potter story for example, didn't end as well as it ended in the book series.) the Lord Of The Rings as well as The Hobbit were a fine and a pretty touching franchises. I will definitely miss these stories. Now speaking of this one. I heard that many people (friends of mine most) didn't like this movie because (SPOILER ALERT) ............. ............. ............. ............. Kili(especially him),Fili and Thorin died. Well I believe this is the exact reason the story was touching. In most stories we usually see only the ones we call ""bad guys"" dying and that makes me lose interest in most movies and stories. I mean when you know that the main character will not die then the whole suspense is gone. This doesn't happen here. Watching this the viewer cannot except who or when he dies which I find it exciting. Now about Kili I believe his death wasn't in vain at all. Think about it. Tauriel was kinda ignoring him every time he was trying to confess his true feelings about her in the whole story. The moment Kili dies , Tauriel hurts which means she found out what true love is. I know it's sad because her true love is now lost but that is what makes J.R.R Tolkien's stories that wonderful. Every character that died, was eternally remember for being a true hero. And that's what Kili was.A true hero!!. Every single one who died was a hero. Even Fili and much more Thorin!! I believe Thorin's death was a moment that will be always remembered the most in this story. A Hero, King and a Brother. He died but took Azog with him and saved his people. Also (And my personally favorite moment) he atoned for his sins (the curse of the gold that 'blinded' him) apologized and finally acknowledged Biblo as a true friend."
"Robert_duder","9","3","7","13 January 2015"," The finale is easily the best in the second trilogy! Nearly a perfect experience.
","This film is so close to being a ten it almost pains me to give it a 9. But then at the same time I hesitated at giving it a 9 because there were some flaws in it that were almost too frustrating to be ignored. However, when you're looking at a film and series of such epic scale you have to look at the big picture. When Peter Jackson undertakes a project of this magnitude there is bound to be some flaws so you have to balance the good and the bad and the truth is I had really enjoyed this. It is however definitive proof that there did not need to be three Hobbit films and I've said that from the beginning. The first film was very good, the second film was average at best. It felt like complete filler...left overs that were slapped together to make another movie. Now having seen the third movie I know that that middle movie was completely unnecessary. The Hunger Games series suffered from the same, splitting Mockingjay into two films simply isn't necessary. Battle of The Five Armies is visually stunning of course with some beautiful and breathtaking scenery. Too much CGI is used once again but that seems to be par for the course now for this series and other blockbuster films. The missing character depth from the second film is returned ten fold and the characters we love are even better. The film runs a little long but that is also something we've come to expect from Jackson's Lord of The Rings films. It builds up to a war you know is coming and it doesn't disappoint when the climax hits.<br/><br/>Richard Armitage who was very nearly lost in the shuffle of the second film comes back swinging in a brilliant finale as Thorin. He proves he deserves to be the latest King in the series as he goes from Dragon sickness to the hero he was born to be. Martin Freeman closes out his titular role in an emotional and heroic end. Freeman was a brilliant choice for Bilbo and he's terrific. The group of dwarfs that were nearly pointless in Desolation of Smaug are given back their characters and dignity in this film and you will love all of them (although I still think they are way underdeveloped compared to the original trilogy's characters.) Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, Aiden Turner, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow and Adam Brown were underdeveloped in the series as a whole BUT they do get their just scenes in the end with especially emotional parts for most of them. Hopefully I didn't forget anyone. Thank goodness, Ian McKellen returns to a more significant role than in the second one (he was probably filming X-Men during the second film.) McKellen is amazing as Gandalf. He's probably the best character to come out of this entire series and he holds the cast together. This was no exception. Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly also return and get much better roles in this one although Bloom is still not as likable as he was in the original trilogy. Lee Pace also gets a more significant and very good role this time around.<br/><br/>The cast is massive and its hard to cover everyone but I can say that this was far better character development than Desolation of Smaug. The action starts immediately picking up right where the second film left off and drops you into a final battle and a perfect farewell to this iconic blockbuster series. Truthfully there were times where I thought Battle of The Five Armies simply felt like a remake of Return of The King but maybe that is more of a compliment than a negative comment. It was a climactic ending and while I don't think this trilogy needed to be three films and I also felt as though this one ran a little long, the true brilliance is in the guts behind making such an ambitious project. Jackson has created and set the bar for what we consider modern day epics. This one was a fantastic time at the movies. Bravo and farewell Middle Earth!! 9/10"
"joaopmgoncalves","7","3","7","11 January 2015"," One word: disappointment.
","The feeling of disappointment that resent me when I left the theater was due mostly to seven things. First, seeing Smaug being killed like 5min later after the start of the movie was a hell of an anti-climax. It would be better if that same scene belonged to the second episode of this trilogy - that'd be a good way to separate content.<br/><br/>In second place, Bard, the character that kills Smaug, plays a persona that has no ending. You see it the last time like 45min before the ending of the movie and it'll remain untouched. From that parallelism of the argument, (3) the character of Alfrid is really forced in the storyline. It doesn't add anything to the story and this kind of trick is usually played by blockbusters to fill space in the screen.<br/><br/>Forth, even though I'm a really huge fan of Lee Pace, his character, Thandruil, is weak to average. I guess that since the beginning we was not the wisest choice to play this character. But even worse than this is (5) Evangelline Lilly that has the worst role in the entire trilogy as Tauriel (I don't know how she got the role, really). The face she puts to Thandriel when Kili dies in front of her is just amateurish. I'd even say that that same face is the most fictitious thing in the entire movie. <br/><br/>Sixth, the production of this movie was the weakest of them all. I even got out of the theater thinking if the team went to New Zealand to shoot anything - everywhere you looked, you'd see cheap CGI. There was no preoccupation at all in turning things more realistic. This CGI is at the level of the one used 10 years ago for the original trilogy. Only back then was the awesomest thing. Today it's just cutting on spending. Just a commentary: even HBO gives more importance to quality CGI than a movie with a budget around a hundred of million dollars.<br/><br/>To end, the connection to the original trilogy is also very amateurish and quick. It seems that they gave no thought to it at all.<br/><br/>Concluding, this episode was really disappointing regarding the expectations that were created. This is actually the worst movie I've seen from Peter Jackson, it's the worst of the entire Lord Of The Rings movies but it still is a medium-good movie looking the titles of last year. Yet, for Lord Of The Rings movie, it's just sad."

","That's a charitable 4 - for effort. They tried. The special effects are quite good.<br/><br/>This one is loosely based on characters created by Tolkien, but they're put into situations way outside his story line.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have noted the goofs.<br/><br/>Ryan Gage's Alfrid was probably put in to provide comic relief, but I believe your comic relief character should have some likability. Alfrid is about as likable as one of the lesser orcs.<br/><br/>The Thorin/Tauriel sub-story was unconvincing at best. Did it never occur to the writers that a male/female relationship could be a friendship at the same level as Bilbo's and Thorin's?<br/><br/>Most of us who grew up with the early Gene Autry/Roy Rogers westerns will recognize the eagles as the cavalry charging in over the hill to save the day. What were they waiting for?<br/><br/>Spoiler!!!<br/><br/>The coincidence of Bilbo arriving back at his home in the Shire, just as his stuff is being auctioned off, stretches belief to the breaking point."

","On the down side: It was the wrong five armies. It was far too long. Smaug was out of it quite quickly. Did I say it was far too long? On the up side - the casting of Billy Connolly in the role he played was excellent. The creepy little tax gatherer was a nice touch and the comedy female clobber raised the odd laugh.<br/><br/>You really did feel the plot stretching as it dragged on and on and on. The love stories and characters that were never there, the links into other stories and just everything left you feeling that Peter Jackson was as weary as the audience of the draw and hobbit fest.

Expecting a good story will result in a big disappointment. <br/><br/>All the way I kept on waiting for the events to escalate but that did not happen, the same pace to the end. The movie lacked the focus on a certain group of characters to have a good base or a center to build the events around it.<br/><br/>I liked the visual effects and I believe it is something expected from a movie that cost 250 millions but came out disappointed as it is without the original flavor we had on the ""The Lord of The Rings"""
"reginald-anselm","7","3","7","2 January 2015"," ""There's only a hundred of them."" - says Thorin to Dwalin as the two of them face an army.
","Is Jackson parodying his own fight scenes or what?<br/><br/>But anyway, The Battle Of The Five Armies is a film that mostly just suffers from being 2 hours of battle and half an hour of actual character scenes.<br/><br/>There's a very incompetent feel about the Hobbit as a whole. An Unexpected Journey had too much plot, The Desolation Of Smaug had plot, but that was bizarrely cut out for more fight scenes and the cheesy subplot and this one goes even further by being one huge battle with little plot pellets in-between.<br/><br/>To give Jackson credit, the movie still managed to entertain me a lot and there was much to love, like Alfrid, Thorin's development, Bilbo and Galadriel's standoff with Sauron. But those moments are few and in- between.<br/><br/>How come there's so much time and yet the film accomplishes so little? Why is the ending so rushed(though it is a wonderful ending)?<br/><br/>If I'd been Jackson, I would've padded out the second movie(so that people would want to see the third one) by lengthening the Mirkwood section. Remember the magical river, black squirrels, the starvation of the dwarfs and Bilbo's taking command? Had they turned the forest into a real threat, it could've easily filled out a large portion of the movie, plus the Dol Guldur subplot and maybe an early introduction for Bard on his own?<br/><br/>Have the movie end with them seeing the mountain, like the first one.<br/><br/>But no, all the padding is here. It is good padding, though as we see Thorin really well developed(though everyone else is just kinda there - like Radagast and Beorn and the rest of the Company) and the focus on the people of Laketown works great. Bard is also a charismatic character and then there's the wonderful Alfrid.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to the Master though? I kept expecting him to reappear as he was in the trailers. He would've made a great comparison to Thorin like he did in the books(he supposedly fled with a load of Erebor gold and died alone).<br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me was the Galadriel scene. Psychedelic(almost like a horror film) and scary as hell. She reminded me of the girl from The Ring in those scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is extremely padded, but it's the good kind of padding."
"Foal24","5","3","7","1 January 2015"," Big, epic spectacle with little substance,.
","Disclosure: This review is written by a long-time fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's writing; one that has grown ever more dissatisfied with Director Peter Jackson's treatment of the source material, and is unable to just accept the films as stand-alone pieces of entertainment.<br/><br/>The latest and, (almost) definitely, last installment in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth films picks up right where its predecessor left off: with Smaug the Dragon literally steaming towards Lake Town, hell bent on wreaking destruction on the men he believes are behind a plot to steal his monstrous horde of gold.<br/><br/>As in the last film, Smaug looks and sounds fantastic. He is so grand on the big screen that he's probably worth the price of admission alone. That is, if you have any interest in the film in the first place.<br/><br/>After his part in the tale is done things cruise along at a surprisingly upbeat pace. Like all three films in the Hobbit trilogy, it has its slow moments (a natural side effect of making three movies out of one 285 page book), but this one is definitely the most action packed of the three.<br/><br/>The film's title is not misleading. Apart from the brief opening scenes and a briefer confrontation featuring a couple of wizards, elves and various wraith like super-baddies, almost all of the 140 or so minutes is taken up by the battle that Tolkien enthusiasts and 'Lord of the Rings' film fans have waited with such anticipation for.<br/><br/>It is certainly spectacular. In parts. The epic, wide shot sequences, in particular look amazing. Other shots, though, just look like they were taken straight from the, no doubt, soon to be released video game of the same name.<br/><br/>A major problem with the movie is that there are simply too many characters, with too many agendas, and too little screen time to develop any kind of empathy for them. There's an Elf King, Dwarf King, other Dwarf King, Elf Princess, Elf Prince (no relation), Elf Lord, Dark Lord, Witch King, White Wizard, Grey Wizard, Brown Wizard, Orc Chieftain and other Orc Chieftain. By the end you care diddly-squat for any of them.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman has done a fantastic job as Bilbo, but his involvement in proceedings here is incredibly small considering that he is, in fact, The Hobbit. Sir Ian McKellan is solid as Gandalf, but his 'swivel and slash' fight scenes could've been cut and pasted directly from 'The Return of the King'. <br/><br/>There are also a number of characters that just disappear, leaving you to wonder what happened to them at the end. One in particular (a concoction of Jackson's) is possibly the crappiest character ever, with no redeeming qualities at all. He's not even a good villain. So, just when you're hoping he dies a gruesome death he's just sent away. Off he goes. In the middle of a giant battle. No harm, no foul, and possibly to live out the rest of his days with some hot Elvish goddess (hey, if a beautiful teen Dwarven lad with permanent 3 day stubble can pick one up, anyone can). <br/><br/>All in all, it just feels like Jackson is trying to pack in too much cool stuff, at the expense of good story telling. It's like ""hey remember when I made 'Lord of the Rings' and there were heaps of giant trolls? Let's just randomly throw a bunch of them in. Also, I think the previous five films had dangerously low levels of farm animals covered in armour. Let's remedy that. But, to counter balance that, we'd better cut Beorn: the awesome, shape-shifting, giant, bear-man down to one shot of about 5 seconds screen time. Literally."" <br/><br/>Conclusion: If you're happy with big action, with little consequence and even littler substance see this movie.<br/><br/>5.5/10.<br/><br/>You can see a longer review including a detailed critique of the book to film adaptation, and our other reviews here: www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews"

","I'm going to send Peter Jackson a copy of the book. He obviously hasn't read it. <br/><br/>Seriously, though, throughout the movie I found myself wanting to like it, but not being able to. It could have been so much better if he had been willing to fill in the actual story, rather than adding in sub- plots that only detracted from the whole. For instance, if he would have left out Alfrid, plenty of time would have been made available to finish up the story without leaving the audience with lots of questions.<br/><br/>Some of the things that annoyed me:<br/><br/>-Lack of character development/dialogue. I realize that these aren't as 'exciting' as battle scenes, orc beheadings, etc., but it's hard to get into the story, when you don't feel any interest in the characters.<br/><br/>-Couldn't they have found time to include a funeral for Thorin, Fili and Kili? They're pretty major characters to be so lightly dismissed after their deaths. But, no, they're dead so we're moving on to Gandalf obnoxiously cleaning his pipe.<br/><br/>-Alfrid. 'Nuf said.<br/><br/>-Where are all these absurd mounts coming from? I mean, elk, boar, goat-bighorn sheep things, Radagast's rabbit team. Maybe they're all hipsters and think that horses are too mainstream. <br/><br/>-Failure to observe how the laws of physics work. Need I say more? (*cough* Legolas *cough*)<br/><br/>Some things that I did appreciate:<br/><br/>-Billy Boyd's song at the end was a very good choice.<br/><br/>-Bilbo's return to the Shire was great although rather rushed. <br/><br/>-I really liked the Lake Town set and inhabitants, they were beautifully done. <br/><br/>Over all, It was an entertaining movie to go see, and a fun way to spend an afternoon. It could and should have been so much more."

","It's Christmas, and the final Hobbit cash-in has arrived. Will the dwarfs finally reclaim their homeland? Will Smaug destroy all in his path? What about the Orcs? The answers await you. Sadly, this is it people - Tolkien will never reach the big screen again - but you'd be surprised to hear it's not because this is the final film in The Hobbit trilogy. Alas, the decision lies with the Tolkien estate. His descendants have claimed they hate this trilogy, and that his stories have been modernised beyond recognition. Adaptation is a cruel business indeed.<br/><br/>What of the film itself? Well, Sir Ian McKellan will forever make a superb Gandalf (nothing new there), same goes for Christopher Lee as Saruman. There's nothing special about the rest of the cast however; Martin Freeman continues to be as Martin-Freeman-ish as he can whilst the rest contribute to a potent display of overarching masculinity. Director Peter Jackson's digital perfection segues nicely from the last films, but to a point. There were some blaringly obvious CGI casualties - when Cate Blanchett's Galadriel has a showdown with Benedict Cumberbatch's Sauron you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>So, is it yay or nay? If I'm honest, the trilogy was doomed to failure from the start because well it's a trilogy. Have you seen The Hobbit as a book? It's tiny. That meant that this film became a giant overkill of climaxes. Overall, there's near persistent fighting for 2 and-a- bit hours, it's tiring to say the least and, if I'm honest, I think the actors are tired too: it shows. Their weak performances show they are fed up with it all and are all glad it's over. The DVD extras for the last films indicate Jackson's own jovial dislike for the film process, but I have an itch the problem lies deeper and that this external jovial persona merely hides an all too awful truth - Jackson is fed up with Tolkien. It's nice to see a layered, rich blockbuster, but it's a sad end to what could have been a fantastic trilogy. If you've seen the first two, then go to the cinema and finish it off in style, otherwise just wait for the DVD."

","This is not a bad movie. I am surprised that it received worse reviews than the first two Hobbit films. This sequel most clearly demonstrates the connections which exist between the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings franchises. It does not have as many lulling periods as the second movie. It is action-packed and fun, and it has very few dull moments. It is probably the best movie of the year, although that may not be saying that much. James Berardinelli was astute for giving the movie 3.5/4 stars and deeming it the best of the Hobbit movies.<br/><br/>Although the Lord of the Rings franchise is over, the movie nevertheless says much about Peter Jackson's future. Hopefully, he will direct more movies that are action-packed like King Kong. Except for The Frighteners, many of his pre-Lord of the Rings movies were rather campy. Similarly, I was disappointed with the Lovely Bones.<br/><br/>P.S. One perception I've had about his Hobbit movies is that they have more of a stale Harry Potter feel. I do not consider that a bad thing; he probably needed more variety in his franchise.

","So here we are, the last we'll see of middle earth on the big screen. Being a major fan of LOTR trilogy and having liked the previous two Hobbit films, the feels of goodbye was indeed high when watching this film, not to mention there were some really emotional scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>It picks up exactly where the last film left off, with Smaug flying to Laketown. I gotta say, it was one hell of an opening sequence. Then the story boils down to a slow paced conflict with the impending battle owing to the film's name slowly coming closer. Almost all of the second half of the film involves the battle and events in it. The movie had some really spectacular scenes, my favorite being rescue of Gandalf. That scene was filled with awesomeness. <br/><br/>Performances from the main characters were yet again great while many of the rest were a mixed bag. Martin Freeman(Bilbo) and Richard Armitage (Thorin) really carried the film emotionally with their great performance. <br/><br/>All was not well I'm afraid, the stretching of the source material is yet again glaringly apparent just like the last part. Lots of filler content, which, for the most part, just hampers the pacing and isn't interesting enough. The pointless love triangle was again pointless and dragged on. The 2 hour and 20 min runtime could have been shaved a lot to remove such extra stuff, I don't know why Peter Jackson insists these movies should be long when the source material itself is limited unlike LOTR. <br/><br/>Also, the overuse of CGI again was an issue. It is not that the CGI itself was bad as some stuff looked great, it is that they didn't used it well, like they lazily implemented it all. You can't expect to throw everything at the screen and expect it to look good. Lots of areas had fakey feeling and you could tell that green screen was used etc. This issue has been persistent in this trilogy. <br/><br/>The battle of the five armies was a long ass sequence but even with all the new tech and story material at hand (Five armies, DAMN), it didn't had THE FEEL of battles from LOTR, especially since the accompanying soundtrack is nowhere near as good. The claim that it will be the biggest and best battle done yet by the creators clearly falls short. <br/><br/>Despite its many shortcomings, it was an entertaining ride with some great scenes and serves as a sendoff to this middle earth saga. The tie-ins with LOTR were great. Now, I can watch all of them in sequence, Hobbit trilogy first, then LOTR. A MEGA MIDDLE EARTH MARATHON.<br/><br/>8/10"
"stephendaxter","9","3","7","25 December 2014"," The epic and emotional conclusion to Peter Jackson's Middle Earth
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the finale in the trilogy of Hobbit films and most likely Peter Jacksons final visit to Middle Earth, and boy does he go out with a bang. The film picks up from where The Desolation of Smaug ended and from that moment you know that this film is going for all out action. Over half of this films runtime is filled with what we loved the most from the Lord of the Rings trilogy; the battles. The fast pace and epic battles are what make this film so brilliant. From the enormous size of a single dragon to the epic spectacle of thousands of warriors all going against each other, this war of The Lonely Mountain was the real star of the film. <br/><br/>And in saying this it leads to one of the minor downsides of the film, and that is that for the first half of the film Bilbo Baggins aka 'The Hobbit' is almost like a supporting character to many others. It is a minor detail but he didn't get enough screen time i felt over the course of the whole film. Despite the screen time he had, he still received a lot of character development, and along with Thorin were the only two characters who really developed throughout the film. Even though this film was shorter then the previous two hobbit films i do feel that around 20 minutes could have been cut out in the middle of the film where the pace noticeably slowed down to keep with the fast pace of the film. But these issues didn't take too much away from my enjoyment of the film as the fast paced epic battles along with the ties to The Lord of the Rings give a fitting conclusion to this trilogy of films. - 8.8"

","Though ""The Return Of The King"" was a fitting conclusion to an immensely satisfying trilogy, it left you wanting more (what with ""The Hobbit"" begging to be filmed). ""The Battle Of The Five Armies"" is also a fitting conclusion, though ""The Hobbit"" trilogy itself has not been nearly as memorable, and the director, the estimable Peter Jackson, seems more than ready to let go of his creation and move on to new challenges. Still, Jackson throws himself into the finale with a lot more energy than you would expect he could muster at this point and of the three ""Hobbit"" films, this one is the best. Although the emphasis on battle seems like filler, it's more interesting filler than the filler the two previous films reeked of--the plot is almost given short shrift in favor of the magnificently filmed action scenes. The ""Hobbit"" actors have overall left much less of an impression than the ""Lord Of The Rings"" performers (indeed, the film's best scene involves holdovers Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellan as well as the image of Sauron) but here it makes it easier to give yourself up to the kinetic sensuality that the film is constantly pushing you towards; the battles fill you with more emotion than the narrative does. As good and as much fun as it is, though, it will eventually join the previous two films and fade in the collective memory--whereas its predecessors' place is assured."
"seminarski-fpn","6","3","7","21 December 2014"," Very bad movie
","This movie is worst of Tolkein movie adaptations. This somewhat reminds me on third class western movies, where movie directors were faced with a task of eliminating thousands of native-Americans against few cowboys or USA solders. The result of that task was that thousands of mounted natives were rushing toward few barricaded gunmen, and dying in hundreds (or circling around) until they are dead. The high point of plot is when one USA gunman was wounded or killed. Here, it is the same. Director of the movie was faced with a task of eliminating orcs. However, it was even worse in this movie, because orcs are tallest, roughest, thickest armor, best organization, heavyweight fighters. Director handled it perfectly. Armor is useless, because every strike against the orc solider, no matter where, with what, or force of it, kills it. Moreover, every highpoint in all Tolkein series is handled by eagles. Really, really, terrible execution of the scenario. And there is Orlando Bloom, who is always giving dramatic statements like ""bread only for war"", and in the next moment, all the dread of bat horde is nullified by eagles. All high-points of the movie are handled terribly and all events from the book were displayed very poorly, with no imagination, on level of old western Indian-cowboy third-grade movies."
"griffolyon12","8","3","7","20 December 2014"," Movie Review: ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies""
","Did The Hobbit need to be turned into three movies? No. Does The Battle of the Five Armies feel like it's stretched thin? Yes. Does that mean it's a bad movie? No. What you get with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is exactly what you expect, a big battle between five different armies, while wrapping up the final few chapters of The Hobbit book in a two plus hour movie. <br/><br/>As far as the action goes, this is top notch action movie-making. By this point, you like all of the characters, and Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is so good, that you wish there weren't so many subplots going on that he gets a bit of the shaft (it is called The Hobbit afterall). Of course, the greatest thing that this movie does is that it never lets off the gas. It's always going somewhere and doesn't feel as if it's spinning its wheels. While that somewhere is probably another action scene that might have been better served for the eventual extended edition, if you're a fan of Middle Earth you wont care, and that's really all that matters at the end of the day. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of these books and movies, you'll see this movie and you'll enjoy it. Is it the crown jewel of the franchise? No, as a matter of fact, from a filmmaking standpoint, it's probably the weakest film of the six Middle Earth movies, but the weakest film in this franchise is still better than the strongest film in most other franchises. There is a great thematic undercurrent about the destructive power of greed that runs throughout this movie, as all of these different forces are vying for the treasure in the Lonely Mountain, and it's when this theme is in play that many of the strongest scenes occur on an emotional level. <br/><br/>It was really nice to see Peter Jackson work in a little something on the human side of things to keep this from feeling like a two hour brawl, but that's really what he does best. He finds the humanity in the largeness of his vision, and that's why he's such a great filmmaker. The only thing I feel like Jackson fumbles is the ending, by trying to tie everything back into The Lord of the Rings, rather than ending happily as the book does. The Battle of the Five Armies ends kind of mysteriously with suspicion about Bilbo's ring, and that kind of dampens the impact the ending could have had. While I know that this is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, the movie might have been better served as a movie had it not tried to foreshadow what's to come and just embraced the sentimental emotion of the farewells between Bilbo, the dwarfs, and Gandalf. That's just my personal feeling, and it's kind of a sour cherry on top of what was a pretty good hot fudge sundae at the movies."
"sowon7890","7","3","7","20 December 2014"," An enjoyable film, if you aren't a devoted Tolkien fan..
","As a person who preferred the action-packed Two Towers and Return of the King to the quieter Fellowship of the Ring, I had high expectations for BOFA. I was never the hobbits and dwarfs kind of girl, so I was excited about the editions of Legolas and the White Council. However, I was always against the addition of Tauriel, especially the love triangle, and o boy was I right as she killed the movie. I think the reason why the Hobbit movies fail to captivate the critics as much as the LOTR movies did, is due to the lack of character development. The LOTR movies had an even bigger cast than the Hobbit movies, but the audience was able to empathize with every character (even the antagonist Gollum). In the Hobbit movies, PJ just throws random 'emotional moments' everywhere, like the whole Mommy issues Legolas suddenly has at the end of the movie....He never makes us care about a character (with the exception of Bard and Bilbo). Some characters just show up as a cameo almost (Beorn).. <br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable to watch, if you haven't read the book or a huge LOTR fan. Sigh.. I watched the Fellowship of the Ring right after coming home from the theatres.. big mistake as it just made me compare BOFA to the high- quality story telling of the LOTR movies. I watched it with my friend who was watching it for the first time and he remarked that it looks like a movie that came out in 2014 and not in 2001. <br/><br/>*Spolier*<br/><br/>Now onto the battle itself: PJ tried to match the epic battles of LOTR with the addition of a lot of weird orcs/monsters... That show up for like 2 seconds each. In LOTR, the heroes were shown at least struggling to kill the orcs (even the great fighter Aragorn took more than one strike to kill orcs). The Dwarfs that make up Thorin's company aren't skilled warriors like Boromir and Aragorn, (some of them never even used a weapon) however they kill orcs much more easily. Legolas and Tauriel are just plain ridiculous. Legolas should be able to fight a whole army of orcs without getting a single scratch. <br/><br/>The death of Fili wasn't tragic because he said like 3 lines in the whole trilogy. The death of Kili was forcibly made sad by the whole love thing with Tauriel, but even his death wasn't all that sad. Thorin's death was just plain stupid."
"Dawnz","Null","3","7","17 December 2014"," Over in a Flash, with a very few noteworthy moments
","I have been a loyal LOTR and Hobbit Fan. So when I heard Cinemark theatres is screening all three Hobbit movies in a one-day event marathon, I was the first one get the tickets. I made sure that I am seeing the movie in the f best suggested format: IMax like screen + HFR +3D<br/><br/>The marathon movie event, had brief introductions by Peter Jackson before each movie. Before the start of the third movie, he says ' this is best of the lot, and his favourite'. However, The best movie of the three was undoubtedly the second one. The third movie BOFTA has very little recall value.The director and team's exhaustion shows in this movie. They just want to get over with it. Feels rushed. There are two sequences where the whole movie team has put in their best<br/><br/>1. The first: The Dragon lake town devastation sequence is good. When you see the movie, please note the spectacular way the dragon flutters, dives, rises in superb acrobatics. His body language and tone adds much credence to why Smaug is a 'weapon so great in the wrong hands'. The sequence is 10% of the movie, and gets over fast. After a Super Charged adrenaline movie start, you are waiting something equally extra-ordinary to happen the whole time, but it never comes.<br/><br/>2. The second: The Azog and Thorin final sequence is nice and emotional. The fight choreography is consistent with a sense of revenge that both Azog and Thorin carry for each other.The whole sequence is a match between equals, one getting better of the other. Since they are equals in wit and muscle, in the end there are no winners<br/><br/>Now the problems:<br/><br/>1. Bilbo and Thorin's screenplay:Are they friends with each other? Yes. DO they respect each other. Yes. Do they shed a tear for each other. Yes. But does anyone of them trust each other? No. Bilbo would rather trust Thranduil and Bard to avert a crisis than confront Thorin and dwarfs. I think the director would have wanted to leave the audience with a tragic sense of haunting loss and friendship. He couldn't do so because of so many distractions along the way.<br/><br/>2. The Army: What are the five armies? Those who haven't read the book, here is a quiz, watch the movie and list down the five armies. Eagles, elves, Men, dwarfs and ? Yes, you guessed it right. It is (Orcs/Goblins/Wolves). They changed the title of the movie, but the armies's character, resolve, feature and strength is completely omitted. It just feels, like different sized men in varied costumes gathered to fight a war, sometimes with each other and sometimes with the ugliest looking guys. Nice jumps, and swings, and then a sudden pause for a conversation and hug amidst one of the greatest battle the middle earth has seen.<br/><br/>3. Appear and Disappear without any affect to the story or battle: Huge Earth digger worms, large bats, Giants, Elvish arrow snipers, Gundabad, reference to legolas's mother and that she loved him? Witch Kings fighting like Matrix reloaded twins (probably because Elrond was agent smith in those movies), Sauron flashing and burning, Saruman saying' Leave Sauron to me' . What happened between Sauron and Saruman that he turned evil. BTW why didn't the earth diggers dig directly under the lonely mountain?<br/><br/>4. The solution to all and every problem irrespective of time, place, circumstance, quantum is to summon the.................EAGLES!....yaaaay!....and they always arrive late to the scene. Because the righteous need to show of their skills and dramatics before they can be rescued. Why couldn't the bats be fiercer and smarter to give the eagles a tough fight? Could the orcs have a good catapult ot bring down the eagles. The destiny of middle earth would have been completely different without these silent giants. The Evil army always ignores to take care of its biggest adversary in size, stealth, speed and strength: The Eagles<br/><br/>5. Irregular Battle scenes: The battles starts, soldiers fight. Cut! next Bilbo is having a predicament about the ring. Cut next short scene, Thorin brother is talking to himself while fighting orcs. Cut next scene, even bilbo killed a giant ugly orc. Makes you wonder, orcs are kids in costumes. Cut Next scene. Tauriel is calling for Kili. cut next scene. Thorin is coming back to his senses. and Voila! Cut next scene. He is hugging his cousin in- mid battle. They are enjoying killing orcs. etc etc. Hey Jackson, please let me see some fight. You have giant worms, don't you? I don't want to be transfixed on Thorin's cousin's moustache.<br/><br/>6. Another flash quiz: What happens with all the gold? was it divided? lost? sealed? or do the Dwarfs keep it for themselves?<br/><br/>7. Lovely song at the end by Billy Boyd - a good way to end the series.<br/><br/>9. Alfrid gets long scenes and dialogues . His screen time is more than the worms, bats, giants, elvish army put together.<br/><br/>10. Gundabad was shown, and the audience saw its nice walls.<br/><br/>One must definitely see the end of the saga. However, if your theatre is charging you an extra for those premier shows, you could probably wait a week or two and then catch it."

","Shortest of all but a satisfactory finish to the middle-earth legend. It works as a finale but not as a stand alone film. Thorin being an idiot(dragon sickness) for most part of the film didn't work but when he realizes, the film starts to pick momentum and the last hour is breathtakingly good and this is where it gets the Lord of the Rings vibe. <br/><br/>Battle looked great but ended abruptly(extended cut may be?) with the entrance of Eagles and Beorn and it shifted to Thorin vs Azog. Still it was good but don't expect it to match the likes of Battle of Pelennor fields or Helm's Deep. <br/><br/>Gandalf didn't had much to do. Sauron will be seen in a scene. Aragorn's mention will make some fans happy. Tauriel is surprisingly good this time. Bilbo was okay but he should have got more presence. We don't get to see what happened to some key members(again, extended cut may be?). Earlier half of the film was wasted at Arkenstone subplot. It should have been chopped a bit and that run time might have helped the climax, giving it some depth. <br/><br/>HFR 3D looked different and added depth to the dialog scenes but it looked cartoon-sh in the action sequences. <br/><br/>Will miss these films :( Oh wait , Silmarillion may be ? is it too much to ask Mr. Jackson?"

","After a decent effort in the first two films, this was an overly long orgy of tedious fighting. I couldn't wait for it to be over. <br/><br/>As usual CGI was spot on-on and there was loads of beautiful countryside. The dwarfs didn't have much of a look-in this time which was a shame as they were entertaining characters, there was a continuation of the dwarf/elf love-in with Tauriel, Orc upon ugly Orc and plenty of flying heads. I didn't feel any of the emotion and bond there was supposed to be between Bilbo and the dwarfs at all. Overall I felt it contained little of the magic of the wonderful book and had too much of a LoTR feel about it. <br/><br/>In the end, it reminded me of the first LoTR film in that it was a little like eating too much of a rich fruit cake: made you wish you'd not had anywhere near as much."

",". . . as the Theory of Continental Drift was all the rage as the ""latest thing"" during the time frame when novelist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote THE HOBBIT. As PART THREE: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES illustrates, each round of Evolution culminates in Human Dominance before Life is virtually reset to zero by mechanisms such as meteor strikes and shifts in the magnetic poles (the latter catastrophe illustrated five years ago in the film 2012). If you see FIVE ARMIES, you'll thank your lucky stars that we live in a relatively benign cycle, free of Sauron, Orcs, and many other malignant influences. True, today's world also seems devoid of wizards, elves, and hobbits, but that is NOT necessarily a negative. After all, the current controversy over Gay Marriage would pale in comparison to the first time an elven chick fell head-over-heels for an Orc dude. Furthermore, having the fate of mankind depend upon the custody of a single ring (as it does in the HOBBIT follow-up, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is somewhat off-putting. I sometimes can't find my car keys!"

","There were almost no epic moments in this movie, there was no real ""charge/clash"" of 5 five armies, only dwarfs deciding to rush the enemy themselves and then elves spontaneously joining in, in the books Gandalf stops the 3 armies of the dwarfs, humans and elves with one single shout if i remember correctly? ""Death has been bestowed upon you all the goblins and the wargs are coming!"" He's able to rally and unite the armies in one single charge they clash with the goblin army, that would be much more epic.

There was no aftermath either, just Bilbo going home, the end, nothing connecting to the lotr series. Will the EE be able to save this movie? Im not sure, was LOTR a better trilogy? Absolutely. A weak movie, not complete. I just felt disappointed, an entertaining battle but not emotional, no LOTR-quality here and then I mean the seriousness of the lotr trilogy felt a lot better than this. Thorin, Fili and Kili's deaths were so weak. <br/><br/>I mean really? If this was going to be the very last movie of Tolkiens worlds why didn't u make it good enough PJ!?

"lczcassinova","9","2","4","25 April 2018"," LOTR vs The Hobbit
","I feel many user reviews have been unfair to Jackson as they seem to summarily dismiss the Hobbit series altogether as one monumental redundancy. I've watched both the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit series with equal delight, but I loved the latter more. <br/><br/>I found the premise of LOTR too abstract and surreal giving a hint to the over imaginative mind of Tolkien. I felt the same with Rowling after the sixth part of Harry Potter was out. 
It seems painfully fantastic. What with the sinistrously powerful ring which is hell bent on reaching its benevolent master, the hideous eye constantly guarding Mordor, and poor Frodo constantly overwhelmed and under prepared for the herculean task he has undertaken, his life tottering on the brink of his grave- the film gets altogether depressing as it progresses and ends with a rather predictable climax. The final part is a whopping four hour long of ass numbing misery. I just wanted it to end. Even the Orcs in LOTR are predictable and stupid. Like petty toy soldiers they are prolific in numbers but lacking in wit, fighting other people's battle unlike in Hobbit where they appear sinistrously ghastly and macabre. They also had a leader with brains. <br/><br/>Hobbit is beautifully directed in three parts. First is a nail biting adventure which keeps you hooked throughout. In the second, we've the inimitable Benedict Cumberbatch playing Smaug, the most fearsome dragon, who is nothing short of being brilliant, and in the final part we get to see the Dwarf King Thorin Oakenshield played by the versatile Richard Armitage in his full element. The scene where the dwarves decide to join in on the battle is a classic. It pumps my adrenaline everytime I see it. ""Will you follow me for the one last time?""<br/><br/>Since I watched the Hobbit first, I missed terribly the presence of dwarves in LOTR although Gimli was brilliant. <br/><br/>Battle of the five armies is a pure nail biter. It moves with a swift thrilling pace, and is definitely not clichéd. Technically, it precedes LOTR, and however much Jackson may have experimented with the adaptation, it all unfolds wonderfully making it an instant classic."

","THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>The Hobbit film series is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from humble beginnings who is asked to go on an adventure to help save the homeland of the Dwarfs, Erebor. He is contacted by a wandering wizard named Gandalf who wants Bilbo to go with him on an adventure, which sounds a bit scary to our inexperienced halfling friend. He decides to go no the adventure and joins a group of Dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield, heir to the throne of Durin, and rightful king of the mountain of Erebor. Their company must travel across the land of Middle Earth to the Lonely Mountain far to the East to reach their Dwarven home and take it back from the dragon who has stolen it away from them. They are captured on multiple occasions and must work together to escape from the clutches of their captors many times throughout the adventure, whether it be from trolls, orcs, wargs, goblins, Elves, a dragon, and I think you get the point. They have to make alliances with the Humans and wood Elves to complete their adventure, because fighting them would mean absolute failure. They finally reach Erebor and release a giant dragon who had been keeping hold of their treasure hoard that they lost many years before and the dragon unleashes his wrath on a nearby town which is floating on a lake, the home of our Human friends. After the dragon is defeated by a Human from Lake- town the Dwarfs get surrounded by the Humans and Elves because they want the riches they had been promised for assisting the company during their quest to the mountain. After settling their differences they must fight in a massive battle with five different armies involved to secure the repossession of their home. They win the war with the help of the Humans, the Elves, and the Dwarfs from the iron hills of the north and finally regain control of their home, after which Bilbo is able to return to his peaceful hobbit hole in The Shire."

"jontoole","4","2","4","20 January 2016"," Started with a bang, ended with a whimper
","If you don't want to read everything below here is the synopsis. First 2 parts were great, the 3 part was very forced and left more holes than it did answer questions. See below for more detail. <br/><br/>The Good: The story line up to the 3rd movie was entertaining and definitely left you wanting more. The third movie itself was fun and suspenseful.<br/><br/>The Bad: I hate to say there was bad and even more so ugly in this final chapter, but there was too much that was unexplained or added for ""prequel"" effect.<br/><br/>-For example, there was no need for Legolas's father Thranduil to direct Legolas to where Aragorn/Strider would eventually live. Remember these movies take place 60+ years prior to the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Without that line we could have assumed that that Legolas and Strider meet somewhere along the way. Now we have a specific marker and it forces us to consider exactly how that relationship was formed. Consider this- if Legolas went directly there he would have been around when Strider's father was born as well as when Stider was born(potentially). Basically making Legolas a God like figure (or at the very least an awesome uncle) to Strider. All because of that simple line we now have to consider these scenarios.<br/><br/>Had it not been mentioned that Legolas go to that specific place in time we would have assumed that Strider and Legolas meet as Strider was becoming a Ranger. Now we are forced to wonder when they met along with how long had they know each other. In the LOTR they seem to be friends, but that would seem odd if they had known each other for all of Stider's life. Again, consider uncle/nephew relationship.<br/><br/>-What became of the weaselly character? I believe his name was Alfrid. Why put so much into that character only to have him escape. Sure in real life bad people don't always get what's coming, but that's what makes a movie fun. You can watch weaselly characters get their due. Very unsatisfying.<br/><br/>-What's the deal with the Necromancer?! I know it was meant to show the ""coming storm"" but so little happened. I guess I can live with the way it sets up to eventually turn Saruman, but the ""battle"" was so quick and unfulfilling that I am not sure it was truly needed. The lead up was cool (Gandalf being captured) but the result was once again unfulfilling.<br/><br/>The Ugly: -You know where I'm going. The Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Kili relationship. What was the point other than trying to generate a love interest for the movie. First, Tauriel and Kili barely knew each other for her to have so completely lost her mind at the end of the movie. Second, what was the point if nothing came from their meeting each other. It would have made a whole lot more sense if she had died and he was left crying over her, especially since she had saved his life. <br/><br/>It would have made more sense if the love story was between Legolas and Turiel, and she had died at the end of the movie. It would explain her absence in the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>I wonder if this was Jackson's way of giving the ""little guy"" the girl....<br/><br/>-Cumberbatch. No I'm not saying he's ugly. I don't understand why they had him voice the dragon and necromancer. Because of the way they altered his voice you could hardly tell it was him. I suppose you can sort of tell with Smaug (he did a good job with the role) it's just not recognizable that it's him. In reality any voice actor could have done these roles.<br/><br/>Final thoughts (I promise) At the end of the day this movie could have been done in two movies ending with the death of the dragon and been far less contradicting. In fact, this leads me to the ugliest of uglies. Jackson tries so hard to link this series with the LOTR trilogy that it creates holes in areas where no explanations were needed. For example, Gimblie's father was one of the Dwarfs in the quest. OK. Who cares. Now I'm forced to do the timeline. Also, Legolas plays a big part in this series. OK. Why? It's not needed. If he wasn't in the movie we would not have thought otherwise<br/><br/>I can go on, but you get the point. This is classic Hollywood capitalizing on a known commodity. I think it was cool that they remade the Hobbit, but the third movie was completely unnecessary."
"timelderofficial","7","2","4","7 January 2016"," Over the top action ruined the story
","Out of all the six movies about Middle-Earth, this one is definitely the worst. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, because the plot is too good, but this movie is just so much worse than the original Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>The action scenes were over the top, and also very predictable. In most scenes the good guys will be in grave danger, but still defeat their enemies in the last second, which is really annoying to watch. In my opinion the fights (in particular the ""boss fights"") should have been shorter, and the action should have been more believable. <br/><br/>I also dislike how much screen time is given to Alfrid, who is the most annoying character in the movie. Legolas and Tauriel could also have done with less screen time. Important characters like Bilbo and Dain on the other hand don't really have enough screen time.<br/><br/>The good things about this movie is the feeling of Middle-Earth. It's wonderful to see the armies of Dwarfs, Elves and Orcs, as well as seeing places like Erebor and Dol Guldur. The dragon also looks really nice.<br/><br/>The one who makes this film truly great is Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He is by far the most enjoyable character to watch, although Gandalf and Thorin are also well played.<br/><br/>The extended edition adds a LOT to this movie. Sadly, it also contains more over the top action sequences (which do look nice by the way). The Battle of the Five Armies could have been a superb movie with nice battles, but Peter Jackson failed to deliver."

","I read some of the bad reviews of this film and I don't know why they are being so harsh. It wasn't that bad. Well maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of stories about wizards, elves, goblins, and magic, although I enjoyed the Hell out of ""Legend"" and ""Labyrinth"", and I know little about J.R.R. Tolkien's books, just what I have seen in the theaters. To me this film was pretty much like the others, including ""The Lord of the Ring"" trilogy. I thought all of them were good. From what I have read from some of the other reviews there were some unanswered questions in the film that were covered in the books. I can see where that can be a problem for the ones who read and are into the books but for the ones who never read the books, if you liked the other ""Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Ring"" films you'll probably like this one too."

","When I heard that Peter Jackson was making ""The Hobbit"" into a movie I was very happy. My level of appreciation for Tolkien books is Fan, not Fanboy... so I thought that the minor changes he made in ""Lord of the Rings"" were quite acceptable. The acting, special effects, and story adaption were fantastic in ""Lord of the Rings."" When I heard he was going to make three films from ""The Hobbit"", my heart dropped. Jackson has filled his second trilogy with fluff and trash. He came nowhere near being true to the book with his story. He treated it more like an excuse to bring back all the old crew from ""Lord of the Rings"". The 5 armies in the book were Dwarfs, Humans, Elves, Goblins, and there is some disagreement on whether Wargs or Eagles are the fifth, as both are present. There are no Trolls, giant worms (stolen from ""Dune""), or Orcs in the book. Nor are there Elf and Dwarf love stories. The book was an epic. The movie trilogy was a cash cow for Jackson. The acting was good, the special effects fair, the story was full of dross... like a 12 year old wrote it after reading the Cliff's notes and then filled it with things that he thought would make it cool... mistakenly. If you aren't a fan of Tolkien, this might be watchable... turn it on and switch off your mind so you can enjoy it. If you are a fan of Tolkien this movie will be like fingernails on the chalk-board for you."

","Hope this doesn't sound like pedantry, but why do directors insist on going as far afield from the source material as Peter Jackson does here? What is the point of adapting a book like 'The Hobbit', that's about as specific as a screenplay, and then turn it into something almost entirely different? If you have already have a (speaking) dragon as one of your main characters, really, what else do you have to add? Apparently, almost the entire cast from LOTR. To say they don't belong in this story is almost beside the point, Jackson has added them anyway. Wonder if this was a requirement to get the films done, or something from overinflated ego of the director? The Hobbit is a great story. The director has chosen to tell a different story. Maybe not a complete bait and switch, but close to criminal behavior in my book."

","Guardians of the Galaxy - 2014 (I rated 10 out of 10) does a wonderful job of matching a great storyline to incredible CGI. Perhaps its the longevity of the Hobbit story or its just seeing the same shop worn characters over and over and over again. Whatever it is, the Hobbit really wore out its welcome about two or three movies back. Who's counting? How do they keep refreshing a story after so many episodes? The short answer is you don't you move on after three at the max. There does appear to be an exception to this rule and its the Fast & Furious franchise 8 (I rated 10 here) going on 9. What keeps F&F going of course are the cars, the T&A (c'mon you noticed), bringing in fresh A list actors to the scripts, the exotic locations and the incredible fast pace. Could this have been done with the Hobbit, I don't think the cutesy tameness of the little dwarfs lends itself to the F&F formula."

","O.K.Ladies, gents, let me tell you,first of all , that I read all of them Tolkien books, about this saga. Second of all, when I was younger(I am 42 now), I was really critic about movies made that were based in History or Literature, if they did not stick to the core of its font. But, once, I read an interview of a very well known director, whom I will not name because it does not have anything to do with this movie, who said ""Hey, I'm not a history teacher (Literature teacher, could apply here), I am a movie maker, I wanna show something, my view"". That small sentence changed my whole point of view, about these kind of movies.<br/><br/>This Battle Of The Five Armies,accomplishes a very good point of view about the ""Smaug's plot"", and respects the plot points of Thorin and his kin(Great last Thorin scene, with Bilbo, even if as far as I know, Bilbo was not there in the books). In the other hand, the movie takes many plot licences, but, it's a movie, not the book. The only thing that I can criticize it is the fact that the final battle did not really show the defeat of the ones who were defeated. ¿What did it take, 30 more seconds, of them running scared, to show?. And the end seemed kind of abrupt, in a general point of view, but many of the main characters got their ""closure"" . All in all. a good movie, worth to see, even if you read the books or not."

","I enjoyed An Unexpected Journey. Its reception was fairly mixed, and for good reason. However, I was thrilled to be back in Middle Earth. Desolation of Smaug was even better in my opinion, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as the dragon, coupled with outstanding special effects made Smaug the best part of the series (closely followed by McClellan and Freeman's performances). My only real problem was the cliffhanger ending and sometimes obvious filler. However, this movie is almost all filler. The best part of this flick was the, uh, desolation of Smaug in the first 15 minutes or so. However, my favorite part of the series is quickly dispatched and afterward only filler is left, it seems. This movie was the shortest of the three, and it certainly felt like it, but this is the movie I wanted to be the LONGEST of them all, since it is the last of the Middle Earth films. I suppose the reason it felt short was because there was no substance to it. An infamous amount of CGI was used, but the real reason I felt so detached was probably because the conflict felt contrived.Dragon sickness comes out of nowhere, The Elf king wants his necklace suddenly, but just as quickly the Dwarfs and Elves become allies, only for the Elf king to again abandon the dwarfs. The actors did their parts well, and the characters friendships felt quite real, but not much else did. I wanted to enjoy this movie. I wanted this movie to completely convert those against the Hobbit series, and I never wanted the Middle Earth saga to end. But alas, end it did, and it may have almost done the opposite of what I wanted, as it came near to converting me to the side against the saga. It is with a heavy heart that I score this film a 5/10."

It's fascinating then, to see the Hobbit break a lot of these rules that were established for me by LOTR.<br/><br/>from a stand alone point, this movie doesn't work. It begins with a climax, has little sense of direction, and has virtually no set ups and payoffs exclusive to this chapter.

The music and visuals just don't have the impact they once had. <br/><br/>Despite all of this I still like the movie. It has frustrating moments, but I do realize that these moments are made out of love for the source material. Another pro, the acting by Martin Freeman is just amazing, I've been a fan of his since Hitch-hikers and it's great to see him in a movie like this.<br/><br/>This movie felt like a turning point, not that I have grown out of middle earth, but that I have moved on from it.

Characters added to the whole set of three certainly subtract from the film, but add the needed length to stretch it to three films to generate piles more cash. It feels like grave-robbing. I love that another reviewer pointed out how this goofy romance between the ""Jackson was smitten so he created an elf for Evangiline"" Tauriel and the too-human-looking Fili robs the Legolas/Gimli relationship of the uniqueness and depth Tolkien put into it. The 3 films are rife with this trash. I guess if you're Tolkien fan you hate it.

But the creators had to continue with the subplots (that ""justify"" a three movie adaption of a 300 page children's book) that appear in the first two parts which made this third part more confusing and more insulting (and probably some pockets deeper). Some of the subplots are: <br/><br/><ul><li>The foundation less love triangle among Kili, Legolas and Thauriel. - Thauriel (who does not appear in the book but appears more times in the movie than other characters from the book) - The political battle between the government of Dale and Bard (which sounded to me as a criticism to socialism). - The dwarfs being chased by the orcs. - The battle of Gandalf and the white council against Sauron (although this part was kind of cool, except for the visual effects). - Alfrid (who does not appear in the book but appears more times in the movie than other characters from the book) - The worms. - Legolas (who does not appear in the book but appears more times in the movie than other characters from the book). - The insanity of Thranduil - The insanity of Thorin.</li></ul><br/><br/>Added to this ridiculous amount of subplots is the fact that they did not even close many of them and leaves people unable to answer the following questions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Did the elves get their gold? - Did the men get their gold? - Did the dwarfs get their gold? - Did Bilbo get his gold? - How did Saruman handle Sauron? - What became of the people of Dale? - What became of the people of Erebor? - What happened to the worms? (They could have easily destroyed the armies)</li></ul><br/><br/>All of these stories were represented by using some very bad visual effects which makes people question: Did this movie really come out more than 10 years after the LOTR trilogy, which had awesome visual effects? They even used CGI in scenes were Bard was by himself riding a horse in the open. At this point I am not even sure Dain was CGI made or a real life actor.<br/><br/>It seems to me that this movie was only made to make huge amounts of money and not to honor the wonderful novel that Tolken wrote.

","The Battle of the Five Armies isn't the worst of the three Hobbit films as some are calling it but it's undoubtedly flawed. It is the last in the trilogy and twenty minutes shorter. Its flow and pacing seem smoother with fewer stoppages that crippled the last two films. But the director Peter Jackson still hasn't solved several reoccurring problems which have plagued this saga. The film is more action than plot driven, which means the title character Bilbo is again promptly dwarfed in his own story. On a technical level Five Armies is inconsistent due to the distracting and unnecessary HFR (high frame rate) 3D format the film was screened in and also some of the flagging computer graphics. They are starting to show their age, with the monsters now looking more glaringly computer generated than threatening. Perhaps this is the problem with these films now. We've spent so much time in Middle Earth, meaning there are fewer surprises and our eyes hold the images in higher scrutiny than ever before.<br/><br/>Each entry in The Lord of the Rings once felt essential, even mysterious. Its world was unknown and unfolded excitingly before our eyes. That time has long past. Many have rightly continued to ask why a children's book needed to be turned into a bloated trilogy, a question bound to be prolonged by Jackson's decision to use Tolkien's appendices for this episode. The plot doesn't start well. It cheapens the ending of the previous film. The Desolation of Smaug concluded with the Company reaching the Lonely Mountain, where they awakened the dragon Smaug and the beast swooped down to attack Lake-town. At the beginning of Five Armies, Smaug is disposed of too hastily for such an impressively designed creature. But things improve once the film discovers some theme purpose. Greed and cowardice are more pertinent than before. The Dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) has become possessive, with the riches and his search for the Arkenstone sending him mad. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is secretly holding onto the gem out of respect to the other dwarfs laying claim to it. Thorin also walls off the kingdom to outsiders who lost their homes to Smaug's attacks. They're essentially wartime refugees. Thorin's slogan could have been: ""Stop the Orcs"". While the five armies, consisting of multiple races, battle waves of Orcs, Thorin refuses to fight. A side character Alfrid (Ryan Gage) also dresses up as a woman and hides gold in his costume to also avoid combat. The comedy doesn't work but the ideas are clear.<br/><br/>Five Armies also salutes male identities, defined by bravery and leadership, and its film's self-serious approach is unintentionally hilarious at times. The biggest laughs are from Orlando Bloom's stony-faced, monotone deliveries of silly Middle Earth names. It's also funny seeing Thorin and company run out to fight the Orcs. They look like a football team storming out onto the oval. There are deliberate laughs too, courtesy of Martin Freeman's performance whose effortless quips and nervous stutters are funny but tonally almost from a different film. Once the plot recedes the combat takes over and Jackson's real passion is on display: slaying Orcs in various ways. The combat sequences move smoothly enough but the 48 FPS format removes a lot of the punch and impact and the CGI is inconsistent. Overall, what these three Hobbit films have missed compared to the first trilogy is the heart and the smaller moments of conflict. They've been a showcase for huge battles and a gallery of monster types but nothing has matched the warmth and the dramatic stakes of Frodo and Sam's friendship. Is this the end of Middle Earth on screen? It looks like the waters are safe for now and this might be the last film. But even a movie as silly and generally superfluous as this realises gold and riches have great swaying power."

","I was dubious heading in to the cinema to see this, I just couldn't see how this last segment of the book could fill a 2 hour film. It started off right where it needed to and Smaug flying over the town looked spectacular. Nice to see Christopher Lee too, even if it was his face superimposed! The battle scenes were epic and the cinematography during these scenes was perfect. There are still a few elements I'm not sure have been depicted as in the book and the battle certainly filled up screen time where there was no dialogue. Overall it was enjoyable and I felt the same as I did when I got to the end of RotK in that I was wanting more as you do feel like you have been on a journey yourself with these films, but my opinion has not changed that they could have made two really good epic films without any filler, or Orlando Bloom."

In the Unexpected Journey Thorin and Co are saved by sunlight turning the trolls to stone, yet in this film trolls are completely unaffected by the daylight.<br/><br/>The love interest scenes between Fili and Tauriel are completely superfluous to the film.<br/><br/>The CGI is overused and completely over the top, Legolas defying physics running up a collapsing fallen tower/bridge.

"brandon-beswick","8","2","4","27 December 2014"," Expectations
","I went into this movie expecting to see all characters connected fully to how they were in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I was a little disappointed by that thought. What I was excited to see was what Sauron would do to Solomon to make Solomon so evil so easily. We saw nothing of this unfortunately. Additionally, I did not like the relationship between Kili and Tauriel. It was completely meaningless to the story and both of them are not in the story going forward. The last aspect I did not appreciate was minor but still very noticeable throughout the entire movie. I saw it in 3D (what better movie to see in 3D) and found it to be very overwhelming. There was ALWAYS a sword, hand, etc. in your face and made it very complicated to concentrate on other aspects on the screen.<br/><br/>Now to what I truly appreciated; Azog, firstly. I thought his battle armor fit his persona perfectly. His scars were his evidence of power and supremacy, and that's what he showed off. Had he been dressed in a full suit of armor, that would have been seen as confusing to the audience. I also noticed that throughout the 6 movies, we have never seen Legolas in a full suit of armor. His armor combined elegance and power all at once which I appreciated.

"jdkraus","7","2","4","26 December 2014"," It entertains well, despite its flaws, and there are many.
","The final stretch of The Hobbit Trilogy possesses visual awe, energy, and a darker tone to Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth. Picking up directly from his previous film, Jackson grips our attention with an intense CG fire-show, as the dragon Smaug sets the fishing port, Laketown ablaze. The sequence is so fun, that one quickly understands why audience members go see the movies. We can now know why Peter Jackson has forced us to hold our breathe for a whole another year for this big showdown. It was well worth the wait and is a witty method to catch the audience's attention for the first ten minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>With the desolation of Smaug being used as an introduction, the remainder of the film centers on its descriptive title, ""The Battle of the Five Armies."" Elves, dwarfs, men, and orcs on a scale that rivals the grand siege of Minas Tirith from ""The Return of the King"" face off and battle at the gates of the newly reclaimed city of Erebor. Though there is an abundance of action and subplots that are put to work simultaneously, the essential focus is on Thorin Oakenshield. Richard Armitage in the role as Thorin captures the essence of an individual consumed by greed in a very frightening manner. He becomes paranoid thinking that one of his fellow dwarfs is withholding his precious jewel, the Arkenstone, from him. He barricades the old city from all other races, despite his promise of sharing his wealth with the people of Laketown. He even threatens to kill his own fellow companions if they get in his way. Like the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" with Sauron's ring, the Arkenstone corrupts the mind of the hero. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Bilbo Baggins takes more of a supporting role. Martin Freeman, who captured so well the transition from a character that was out of his element into a clever protagonist is unfortunately limited in screen time. He is not given a chance to add more depth or significance to the movie. Including 'The Hobbit' in the title is sort of misleading. Only until the end do we think, 'Oh wait! This movie is about Bilbo. Not Thorin.' <br/><br/>For a 144-minute movie, the film is quick, but it feels too short in comparison to the other Hobbit films. The ending is particularly rushed and important details that are introduced earlier in the film are either not concluded or are completely disregarded, which as a viewer, made me scratch my head and think, 'Wait? What happens now to this elf character or this dwarf character, or even this human character?' Whether from the studios, time constraints, or just bad editing, the movie does not come off as entirely finished. Scenes of Ryan Gage as the witless Alfrid could have been replaced with much more substantial material. Hopefully the Extended Edition will help resolve these problems. <br/><br/>The mightiest flaw that ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" faces is the lack of emotional engagement in the characters. Several important good guys die and while their deaths are unpleasant to watch, they never feel sad. The heightened musical score and slow-motion cinematography during these scenes are dull and a clichéd attempt to drive the viewer into an emotional state. It would be easier and more shocking for an important character to die quickly and suddenly versus being drug out like a dramatic opera performance. <br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is not a dreadful movie by any means. Neither is it epic nor is it memorable. It does serve a purpose. It entertains well, despite its flaws, and there are many."
"samuelpatterson","6","2","4","25 December 2014"," Entertaining, but it ain't no Lord
","We all love middle earth, we all love Lord Of The Rings, and most of us love Martin Freeman. What could possibly go wrong with the Hobbit then? A lot is the answer to that. I personally enjoyed the first 2 installments of the hobbit, but the fact that there was 3 movies made from a short book as it is worried me from the start. 'The Battle of Five Armies' (I only counted 4 by the way) was great popcorn cinema entertainment. But as a film it wasn't much. 2 and a half hours of CGI filled orcs, dwarfs and some odd worm things which did nothing. Where was the hobbit in all this. Not doing much really apart from making inspirational speeches about friendship and getting in the way. In this film it was all about Thorin (Armitage, who plays the part well) and his mind going mad with greed after claiming back his homeland. It all seemed very rushed and lazy from a normally excellent Peter Jackson. The dragon scene lasts no more than 20 minutes when he is the main focus for the previous 2 films, they made up an Elf female just for a love interest which was not needed and just felt weird and then they had a barely recognisable Billy Connelly just making jokes in the middle of a very serious battle scene... You get the feeling his heart wasn't really in these films from the start. I get it was a much lighter story than Lord Of The Rings but the constant try hard gags weren't needed, they were much more subtle and worked better in Lord. I enjoyed it, but I won't be watching again and I had to go home and immediately watch all of the LOTR trilogy just to make sure Middle Earth hadn't completely lost me. Lord Of The Rings: The return of the king won 11 Oscars (obviously, it was excellent). This will not get near it. It doesn't feel like it was made by the same people."

","""The Battle of The Five Armies"" is the final chapter of ""the Hobbit"" trilogy, though people will prefer the LOTR trilogy, I enjoyed both of them and think they give a rich story to the world Tolkien has wrote. This movie was a blast, so many great intense moments and remarkable dialogue and chemistry between the characters. The main event of the movie was of course the battle of the five armies. One spectacular sequence that continues till the very end of the movie. One thing that bothered me with the beginning of the film was the quick death of Smaug the dragon. I think it would have been smarter to Keep him for the battle. So I feel the writers wasted some potential with this character. Martin Freeman gives a good performance, ian Mckellen is great as always, Richard Armitage does a great job as Thorin. The rest of the casting is fantastic and we got a nice closure to the trilogy that summons up to the timeline of the LOTR. Which is amazing cause we get a nice clear ending to the whole story. Both trilogys. A fabulous movie that is most recommended and delivers a tearful experience."
"curlymst3000","5","0","0","12 June 2020"," A trilogy that shouldn't have been
","Since Peter Jackson's highly anticipated, yet underwhelming, return to Middle-Earth in 2012 with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, many devout fans have given Peter Jackson the benefit of a very substantial doubt that he could still churn out an outstanding Tolkien film, myself included. But with Bilbo's swan song here, that hope is sadly extinguished, like the glory and splendor of the town of Dale.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies suffers from that which plagued The Hobbit trilogy since the beginning: bloated excess and a complete lack of focus. How Jackson and Warner Bros. justified stretching Tolkien's breeziest, most accessible text into three movies will forever escape me.<br/><br/>The film opens where The Desolation of Smaug should have closed, had Jackson shown just a hint of economy with this trilogy, as that silver-tongued dragon lays waste to Laketown and subsequently falls to the arrow of Bard the Bowman. Bilbo, our supposedly titular hero, is yet again sidelined in favor of Thorin and his merry band. This is surely Jackson's biggest folly throughout this trilogy. Too often it has felt that we are watching The Dwarf instead of The Hobbit. Martin Freeman was never given the chance to truly come into his own as Bilbo Baggins, though he hardly be faulted for that. He gave the character everything that he could, and in the few instances where he has been allowed to shine, Freeman knocks it out of the park.<br/><br/>The eponymous battle also disappoints. It does not nearly match the action, bravura, or emotional stakes raised by, say, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in Return of the King or Balin's Tomb in Fellowship of the Ring. Instead we are presented with something that looks more appropriate as a video game cutscene as thousands of faceless Elves, Dwarves, Men, and Orcs slam into each other. Yet Jackson eschews much of the climactic battle in favor of one-on-one fisticuffs between Thorin and his CG Orc nemesis, Azog, as well as the inexplicably shoehorned Legolas in an overwrought, physics-defying deathmatch that spawns more eye-rolling. We never get the impression that there is much at stake, nor the understanding that Elf, Dwarf, and Man put aside petty squabbles and greed to unite against a greater enemy, a point that Tolkien so beautifully delivered.<br/><br/>In the end, I just did not care about what happened to these characters. I wanted to love these films, as I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Gone are the days, it seems, in which Peter Jackson was wholly invested in bringing Middle-Earth to vivid life. Here he has fallen prey to the George Lucas effect. I longed for the gorgeous aerial shots and locations in New Zealand as opposed to endless over-polished glistening greenscreen cinematography. I miss the outstanding prosthetics and make-up that have been forsaken for CGI. For my part, there is no soul in this Hobbit, and the end result begs the question: If Guillermo del Toro had stayed in the director's chair, what would he have done differently?"

","Relative to 1 and 2, Part 3 is slightly longer and doggerelier, and Thorin's awakening is a bit stream-of-consciousness and simply brutal. The home is behind, the world is ahead, and it's hard not to get excited.
The film's original character, Tauriel, has been criticized from the beginning, but it is only now that PJ's intentions are understood, and not only does Tauriel play the role of Legolas's sensibility, infatuation, and athleticism, but also, at the end of the film, the camera switches back and forth between Tauriel/Kili and Bilbo/Thorin, making it clear that PJ's intentions are clear.
Unfortunately, aside from a few minor laughs, the Battle of the Five Armies doesn't do much to impress. There are few scenes that go straight to the heart of the audience."

More than the battle scenes, there was a severe lack of a strong story by the start of the third film.

","""The Battle of the Five Armies"" presumably marks the final instalment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's work. (Unless, of course, he is thinking of having a crack at ""The Silmarillion""). The battle was dealt with in a single chapter of ""The Hobbit""; its expansion into an epic feature film lasting well over two hours is symptomatic of the way in which this relatively short novel has been inflated into something far more grandiose in Jackson's hands.<br/><br/>The seemingly invincible dragon Smaug is killed early on by the courageous archer Bard while attacking the city of Laketown. This leaves the Dwarfs and their leader Thorin Oakenshield in possession of the dragon's treasure which they claim is theirs by right. Unfortunately, other parties also have claims to the treasure, and two Dwarf armies, one led by Thorin, the other by his Glaswegian cousin Dain, prepare to do battle with armies of Men, Elves and Orcs. (I know Glasgow is not actually in Middle Earth, but Billy Connolly plays Dain as though he were a denizen of the Gorbals).<br/><br/>Another strand in the plot deals with the development of Thorin's character. When we first see him in this film, he is suffering from what Gandalf calls ""dragon sickness"", that is to say that he has been corrupted by the dragon's wealth. He is so selfish, greedy and arrogant that he is prepared to fight the Elves and Men, who should be his natural allies, for possession of it; only later does he come back to his senses and make common cause with them against the Orcs.<br/><br/>In terms of spectacle and excitement, the battle scenes can compare with anything in Jackson's earlier ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, the film contains little else except battle scenes. The plot has many twists and turns, but these mostly involve the arrival of yet another army on the battlefield, the shifting alliances between the various factions or a reversal of fortune suffered by one side or another on the battlefield. Some of the actors are good, notably Martin Freeman as the resourceful Bilbo, Richard Armitage as the tormented Thorin Ian McKellen as Gandalf, but they tend to be overshadowed by the grand spectacle being played out behind them. ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" did nothing to overturn my view that it was a mistake to try and film ""The Hobbit"" in the same style as ""The Lord of the Rings"". 7/10"

","Remember those days when everyone claimed that the LotR trilogy isn't three separate movies but one movie split into three? It might have been true about the original trilogy, but it could not have been truer about the Hobbit.<br/><br/>The LotR trilogy, while being shot and produced simultaneously, was actually sourced from three different books which had their own arcs and conclusions to make each part stand out on its own. In terms of movies; each movie had drama, character development and action you would care about. This was an impossible feat with the Hobbit trilogy considering the sparseness/mood of the source material. The result? After the first movies you'll see legions of people decrying it for lack of action until the final few moments. After the third, it's vice versa. For fans of Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, this is in fact great news.<br/><br/>See, if you take BoFA as a standalone movie it does have its flaws - - some pretty serious. If you take the Hobbit trilogy as a chance to relive *that* Middle-earth, you'll get exactly the movie experience that you could have hoped for after LotR. For those fans, I'd recommend watching the first two movies like, in the 6 hours preceding the third one's showtime. All the drama, character development from the first two will start resonating with the action found in the final part.<br/><br/>Not only the LotR trilogy was a masterpiece, each part of it was a great film on its own. The Hobbit trilogy, on the other hand, is *one* great movie for fans of Peter Jackson's Cinematic Universe split into three disjointed ones. The trilogy gets 10/10 for what I wanted from it, the movie gets 6."

"s3276169","Null","3","8","22 March 2015"," A film that should probably not have been made
","I may be alone in my belief that the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy should not have been made into films. <br/><br/>The message lying at the heart of the books, reflects, for me, a deep sadness and reluctance in the face of war. Tolkien was appalled by Stalinist Communism and Hitlarian Nazism, in equal measure. He was also appalled by the indiscriminate bombing by the allies that took place during WW2. <br/><br/>Tolkien was in many ways a moderate who had first hand experience of and an abhorrence for the horrors war inflicts on ordinary people.Regrettably but perhaps, predictably, the anti war sentiment at the heart of Tolkiens works is largely lost in the films. <br/><br/>What we get instead amounts to visually pretty, action films. There is lots of exposition but little character development.This is in spite of an excellent cast of top shelf actors. <br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies continues this trend offering large helpings of action, clever special effects and bloodshed but little else. The net result is you are left feeling rather empty. <br/><br/>Yet another technically competent, commercially driven but ultimately soulless outing. Six out of ten from me."
"JaydoDre","5","3","8","18 February 2015"," Good looking and well acted mess
","There are a number of aspects in any movie and all of those aspects have to be at a certain level in order to make a good film. One important component fails and the movie fails. In the Hobbit 3 the acting is professional and the visuals have been polished to sparkle but it is the poor lazy writing concealed beneath the flashy outside that fails.<br/><br/>Obviously the movie is not welcoming to new-comers. You have to have seen the previous Hobbit movies to understand this one (and frankly you have to see the Lord of the Rings movies in order to appreciate The Hobbit movies). People do not seem to mind and that is fine, but in that case I want one movie ticket for all of The Hobbit movies, please. If I paid to see a movie, I would like to walk out of The Hobbit 2 and go into The Hobbit 3 with the same ticket because it is the same movie.<br/><br/>Not only is the Hobbit 3 simply a foundationless continuation of the last movie, but it feels like the ending to the Hobbit 2 that has been cut off and stretched out into a full film because rich directors need to eat too, I suppose.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the dwarfs being hauled up in their recaptured mountain fortress full of riches as several parties of Middle Earth converge on the mountain, while the dwarf king has to deal with an onset of madness. However, do not take the word ""plot"" to heart because there isn't really a plot here. There isn't an original solid story that can stand on its own.<br/><br/>The main premise is that the king becomes greedy as he desperately seeks the jewel Arkenstone and wants to protect his gold. If it sounds familiar it is because it is the same bloody premise as in the Lord of the Rings! A desirable macguffin ""insert item name here"" that corrupts you. Why did the story need to be recycled? <br/><br/>The script feels bloated. A fight happens, and another two fights are happening at the same time. They keep on happening and happening, and the fight will seemingly come to a conclusion, but no, it changes gear and we are back in the same fight again but from a different angle. As was the case with the Lord of the Rings, the movie refuses to end on moments that feel more than appropriate to end on, except unlike Lord of the Rings the movie is not nearly good enough to outstay its welcome like that.<br/><br/>The eagles! Let us talk about those friggin eagles. When the giant eagles first appeared in Lord of the Rings helping a hero out of a corner, like the very definition of ""deus ex machina"", it could have been forgiven or perhaps even explained, but after the mistake was pointed out and made fun of by the public Jackson continued to put those eagles into the story. He is insulting the viewer's intelligence and the viewer is letting him.<br/><br/>But I am glad the eagles were added to this movie because it gives a perfect example of what is wrong with the story of this film: stuff just happens. It does not feel like there is one single thread of events connected by reason but rather several loosely connected cgi scenes.<br/><br/>There is no logic for the mind to grasp because you know that in this cgi-fest physics need not apply and anything could happen for no particular reason because the makers can write anything and animate anything to fill out the movie, and so they do.<br/><br/>Imagine if instead of a song that has a specific mood, an intro, a chorus, verses and an outro what you got was a solo played by a robot consisting of just running up and down the scale really fast, then a few random chords from the scale, then another solo and everything is played dramatically. Yes, it may all be in the same key, but it is still sh*t.<br/><br/>Plot lines are left open. Something happens to one of the main characters that completely changes his behavior from then on and it is never explained. It just happened, deal with it. The above-mentioned Arkenstone gets completely forgotten towards the 2nd half of the film, and in fact, so does the whole mountain that all the fighting was about.<br/><br/>Every character is so cookie-cutter simple. The dialogue in this movie is not all bad but it certainly can take deep dives. People keep narrating what we can see perfectly well by ourselves. If you actually think about what is being said, much of it is drama for drama's sake, empty but epic-sounding over-the-top dialogue sold to the viewer by professional tradesmen that are these actors.<br/><br/>The thing that angers me the most is that people eat this movie right up. Mr. Jackson and his team woos the viewers with an expensive magical exterior and earns gazillions of dollars.<br/><br/>Maybe it is just that all of the weaknesses of all The Lord of the Rings movies are suddenly reaching me at once. If you enjoy this film, great. In fact, I suspect that boys will like it since it has a lot of action, simple characters and simple events. It is definitely advisable to watch right after the first two films so that its lack of independence is not as jarring.<br/><br/>Empty dialogue, ridiculous plot points, abandoned plot points, plot holes and in fact a giant hole where the plot should be. If you respect movies, do not watch this one because it does not respect you back. The Hobbit 3 is a very well shot and well-acted BAD movie."
"josarah_thevaliant","8","3","8","26 January 2015"," The Battle for a Good Finish
","THE HOBBIT: BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES It has been a long journey to the final instalment of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug ended with the dragon descending on Lake Town. The opening scenes of The Battle of the Five Armies leave no room to catch your breath. And there are yet more enemies on the horizon. Having travelled many treacherous miles to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and his companions must now defend the ancient home of the dwarfs from those whom would lay their claim.<br/><br/>Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, the dragon was truly terrifying. The rest of the cast, which included names such as Martin Freeman (Bilbo), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Orlando Bloom (Legalos), Stephen Fry (Master of Lake Town) and Cate Blanchet (Galadriel), gave a brilliant and authentic performance. With the exception of Billy Connolly (Dain), which is possibly the worst casting decision made since Pierce Brosnan in Mumma Mia. There was too much Billy and not enough character: the least he could have done is cursed in Dwarvish. Amongst such a stellar cast, his appearance broke out of Middle Earth and crashed back into the real world.<br/><br/>The CGI work was incredible: From the dreadful face of the dragon, to the sweeping background of a desolate battlefield. The stunt work and scene choreography brought the battles to life: Aside from a few moments, in which even an elf with Legalos' skill, were far-fetched aerobatics.<br/><br/>Despite earlier criticisms of The Hobbit being three movies, rather than one epic, The Battle of the Five Armies makes for a satisfying end to the story. Its final moments create a pleasing symmetry bringing franchise to a full circle- there and back again."
"dfle3","7","3","8","11 January 2015"," A satisfactory conclusion to the series. 72.5%
","I'll just provide a brief impression of this movie, as it's the 3rd of 3, so if you've made it to this movie, you'll be familiar with the story so far.<br/><br/>After a poor first movie, the second movie was quite good and where you'd expect a movie of this budget and background to be. The finale falls somewhere between the quality of the first two. I was considering giving this movie a simple ""Pass"" score (as opposed to ""Fail""), but it's a bit better than that and my score of 72.5% is there or there abouts.<br/><br/>One thing that is interesting about this series is that the first movie seems made for children but by the time of the final movie it is more adult in tone and themes. That would work for a young audience viewing these films as new releases but not so much if a young child was to view all three films in quick succession on disc or online. From memory, this final film has a shot of someone being beheaded.<br/><br/>Positives about this film include:<br/><br/>* Ryan Gage's performance as Alfrid. Gage is quite funny at times in this role. He puts into mind the very first series of Blackadder...he reminds me of that sitcom's titular character there...but funnier.<br/><br/>* Moments of poignancy regarding characters and relationships.<br/><br/>* Some of the large-scale battle scenes were well done. Some movies can't get this right, e.g. George Lucas' Star Wars movie ""Attack of the clones"". Director Peter Jackson did a magnificent job in this regard in the best movie of the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy, I think, in ""The two towers"". This isn't up to that standard, but it's good, nonetheless...has a touch of Saturday matineee swashbuckling to it, amidst the more sombre fighting scenes.<br/><br/>Not exactly a negative, but when you first hear the voice of Dain, you immediately know who is playing him (perhaps...not all people would be familiar with him though). It makes you wonder if Tolkien's world had that actor in it!<br/><br/>By the by:<br/><br/>Watching the end credits, the sheer number of people is staggering, especially with specific crew titles. In one category I counted over 50 crew and in another category I couldn't keep up after I counted over 80 crew members in a particular category...there would have been around 90 or so there, I imagine.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'll just say that the final film in this series does make it worth watching the series. That's a pointed comment to series like The Matrix, which starts off magnificently and goes nowhere fast from then on. ""The Hobbit"" series started off as ""The Matrix"" series finished but quickly established a reasonably good outcome."

","If you are a big Middle-Earth fan like me then you will feel the same. After the epic LOTR trilogy and the two promising Hobbit movies, the battle of the five armies simply can not be related to the whole series. It is not another epic tale, amazing adventure, overwhelming battles, or the enchanting world of Middle-Earth like we are used to.. this movie is just a fighting skills competition between the characters, a massive cliché of drama. it is entertaining with some popcorn, but sadly, nothing more.<br/><br/>It was my first time to watch a Middle-Earth movie in the theater, and maybe one of the worst theater experiences I've ever had. <br/><br/>Long story short: it is not worth the ticket price."
"Rob_Taylor","6","3","8","7 January 2015"," ""It feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.""
","Bilbo's own words from The Lord of the Rings ring true when it comes to this movie, sadly.<br/><br/>My feelings for the final installment of The Hobbit can be summed up by imagining the following discussion around the script-writing table...<br/><br/>""So, we have Legolas fighting ""Next-most-important-Orc (tm)"" at the end and the bridge crumbles, and so we get Legolas to run up the falling masonry to safety? Anyone?""<br/><br/>""Wow! That sounds so cool. Let's do it!""<br/><br/>There you have it. That one scene sums up everything wrong with the movie. That they thought it was a good idea is forgivable. That they went ahead and included it in the final film after seeing how bad it looked is just as ludicrous as watching it unfold on the screen in front of you. The stones fall in seeming slow motion yet provide a firm footing for the lighter-than-air Legolas as he hops up them.<br/><br/>It is, by no means, the only awful example of CGI in the movie, but it is the most jarring.<br/><br/>I complained that, in the first movie, the dwarfs were essentially interchangeable and generic. That changed considerably in the second film, to my pleasure, but Oh dear! In this installment, the dwarfs get almost no character time at all with the exception of Thorin and Kili. Some of them don't even get lines to say!<br/><br/>It is a movie too far, frankly. Padded out with unnecessary CGI battles that serve little purpose. There are weird worm monsters that the orcs seek out like they are going to be the battle-winner for them, which then get five seconds of screen time before vanishing into the ground never to be seen again. They don't even contribute to the battle at all, for goodness' sake!<br/><br/>I didn't expect the gravity and seriousness of Lord of the Rings, but neither did I expect the buffoonery of Alfrid in this movie, or the dwarfs in the first film. I did expect the movie to be competently done but, to be honest, I doubt Jackson had that much to do as a director. Most of the movie is CGI battle scenes or choreographed fights. The few moments of character drama are few and far between here.<br/><br/>Another annoyance was just how heavy-handed Jackson was in connecting this film (and the previous two) with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A crazy fight scene with the Nazgul vs. Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond in Dol Guldur? Really? It's not like they even tried to be subtle about it. It's more like a hammer to the face saying ""Look! It's Sauron! He's behind it all! There he is! See his Eye!"" Honestly, even M Night couldn't manage this level of obvious, in-the-face, spamming.<br/><br/>As a theatrical release, I suppose it serves the popcorn brigade well enough, but as an addition to the Tolkien movie roster, it is weak. I can only hope the inevitable extended edition fills in the gaps and makes it a more rounded movie, because as it is, it is seriously square! In fact, there are a number of scenes currently in the theatrical release that I would not miss if they magically vanished in the extended cut. But then, I guess they'd have to call it the reduced cut and that would never sell!<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Weak last installment. Jackson suffers from the Lucas Syndrome when it comes to making prequels. The only good thing that can really be said about it is that, in the future, people will watch this trilogy before the LOTR and be amazed at how much better the latter is."

","I believe as many others have commented that the Hobbit could have been made into 2 films rather than three. Not really sure why Jackson and the other writers wanted to use a whole film to depict one battle. It would be like making the Battle of the Pelennor fields (Lord of the Rings) into an entire film in its own right. Having said that I really enjoyed the film. The battle scenes are quite intense and well done. The sets and creatures are brilliant. In particular the Smaug scenes at the start were particularly good and Richard Armitage's depiction of Thorin Oakenshield is brilliant. Top marks to Luke Evans also for his portrayal of Bard."
"jadepietro","6","3","8","31 December 2014"," Battle Fatigue
","￼ This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>Let's face it: The Hobbit film series was bloated and overblown from its initial start. The slim book became a overly-massive trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, in the hopes of making a classic epic story with his prior Lord of the Rings fame and pedigree. The first film from this franchise was a disappointment, with too much broad slapstick and silliness; the second was a vast improvement with its darker mood and stronger character development, although its ending was abrupt and too much the cliffhanger. Part Three, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, immediately takes flight from that final shot of Smaug, escaping and soaring above, set to raise havoc on the village and its habitants below. <br/><br/>￼Three may not be the charm, but it does have some thrills, more so in the hand-to-hand combat sequences toward the end of the film, less so with the endless army battles on a grand scale. Jackson and his company provide enough of a rousing adventure even if their overuse of CGI sacrifices its characters and story. Too often, the film resembles a video game in far too many action sequences. While it's true that everything about this film installment entertains, it all seems frenzied and artificial.<br/><br/>￼The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies also seems choppy and redundant. While there is much to admire technically and the visual look of the film is epic, Jackson pacing is off this time around as he undercuts his suspense with the episodic structure of the film. He becomes too preoccupied with the war sequences and their staging, relishing in the slaughter and celebrating the war, the very antithesis of the Tolkien source. But it does sell more tickets.<br/><br/>￼The actors try to bring some depth and emotion to their underwritten roles, but seem to be mere pawns in Jackson's action gamer. Most of the actors overplay their roles with hammy facial expressions and gestures, barking out the dialog rather than subtly underplaying their line delivery. Some of the sound design is over-amplified to give a more dramatic spin, but the opposite effect applies. Coming off best are Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, Ian McKellan, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Aidan Turner and Evangeline Lilly; others like Lee Pace, Billy Connolly, Stephen Fry, and, at times, Richard Armitage suffer with their poorly written characters. However, Ryan Gage as Alfrid plays his character like a Monty Python wannabe, trying for comic relief and coming up this short of annoying. Even more talented actors seem wasted with mere walk-ons like Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving.<br/><br/>￼Production values continue to be top notch, particularly the art direction by Simon Bright and Andy McLaren. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies could have used a lot less armies and a lot more depth in the characters and story. The war may have been won, but the battles were lost in this film adaptation.

","The Tolkien saga is finished. For now. As expected this trilogy didn't come even close to the original The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But, as an almost unconditional fan, I must admit I did enjoy every one of The Hobbit movies. The first one was a bit too slow and the second one made some narrative choices I didn't like, but in the end I just took it like a true fanboy. Unfortunately this wasn't the case for the final episode. Not that it didn't entertain. Not that it didn't have its moments. It just didn't do any justice to what I think is probably one of the best children's stories ever written. Bilbo was no more than an additional character, the special effects were - apart from Smaug - awful (the scene were Legolas walked over those falling bricks? no... just... no...) and almost the whole scenery took place in and between Dale and Erebor. The best scenes of the movie were those in Laketown and Dol Guldur, which is saying a lot. Apart from one scene at Gundabad and one in the Shire, there weren't even any other locations in this third installment. I know this has to do with the book, but that's just the problem: The Hobbit is shorter than every single book of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The latter adaptations missed a lot of characters (most notably Tom Bombadil and Ghân, if I remember correctly), but nonetheless the films were diverse, exciting and not rarely very layered. Peter Jackson is a Tolkien lover and it may be that a dream came true for him, but I think Viggo Mortensen (who wasn't in any of The Hobbit movies) was right: Jackson sacrificed substance for technical and financial glory."

You can see all the audience will have their hand grasping and stand on their feet(Weird Example) because is really another great LOTR WAR style by Peter Jackson. This film have a little different that it really giving the audience to know the lesson behind the film that Thorin had suffer in the middle of the film, is really a great example and lesson for the society. Even in the battlefield, the director also didn't forgot about the emotion by Elves, Dwarfs and human. Every clans in the film have their distinctive value and personality, this is yet another special about this LOTR franchise.<br/><br/>The Cinematography is great and brilliant, yet another nice sight in the field the structure looks perfect and amazing, the audience also will the sight in this film, the score is impressive that the score play did made the people hearts pump and the medieval theme. the plot is slightly a down because of the ending<br/><br/>The disappointment part is the ending, it's lack of something and it is really short compare to the others LOTR film series, I was expecting for something more....

It's waves after waves of amazing battle scenes and storytelling. It's not just epic battle scenes, the movie also pulls on your heartstrings, the drama is at its peak. The heartbreaking moments made sense and did not overtake the story and turned it into a depressing movie. I was sad but satisfied. <br/><br/>The cast was really good, they all had their moments, I'm now more familiar with the Dwarfs because they had more substance, they were no longer extras in this big movie. Richard Armitage was so convincing as Thorin. He managed to annoy me with this character and bring me to almost hate Thorin before reeling it back to a point where I respected the character and sort of liked him in the end. Martin Freeman is The Best Bilbo that could have been cast. Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee were great, it was the best unexpected scene ever and it completely make sense with the Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>I'm not a sucker for love interests or love triangles in movies but Kili (Aiden Turner) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lily) were one of the best part of the movies. I said it before, I'll say it again, I'm glad she was added to the movies, it wasn't such a sausage fest with her in it. She's badass, interesting, and helped make the movies better. Their love interest added to the drama and apprehension during the movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit series is done and we now have a six movies saga that you can dare your friends to watch with you in one day.

","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.

As movie moves forward, the danger keeps on rising and you are well treated with slick one hour long CGI based detailed battle of the five armies.

The Gandalf story line sets ties in these movies to the lotr franchise while the rest of the movie is basically all fighting. It is not in the same caliber as The Two Towers or The Return of The King but is exciting and enjoyable in its own right. As expected great visuals, beautiful score and Bilbo's facial expressions are hilarious. There are various tie ins to the lord of the rings like Gimli's helmet as well as Bilbo's return to the Shire give fans lots of things to freak out about.

","Before I start talking about the movie just know that this review is coming from a rather biased perspective, as I love just about anything to do with Middle Earth. That being said, lets start the review. It's a pretty solid movie. Not quite as good as the last movie and I had some issues with it, but overall I had a good time. It's pure action, very little else. Since the action was filmed pretty well it didn't bother me that much, but I could certainly see why it would annoy someone else. The elf/dwarf romance is not at all improved from the last movie. When your movie is 2 ½ hours, you don't need a pointless romance that has no emotional weight. It just wastes time. The last thing that bothered me was one part where there is a bridge collapsing and Legolas is running up the falling chunks of rock and it looked absolutely ridiculous. Reminded me of Mario and took me right out of the movie. That being said I still thought it was a good movie. The action is well filmed, the cinematography is fantastic, and it brings the Middle Earth saga to a satisfying close."
"RevRonster","8","3","8","17 December 2014"," Bittersweet farewell to Middle-earth
","And with ""The Battle for the Five Armies"" my yearly trip to Middle-earth is once again overand it was a bittersweet farewell.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the last two films and, I'll be honest, this one is my least favorite of the trilogyof course, that isn't me saying I didn't like it or thought it was bad. The only problem I had with the film was there was some computer effects that I just couldn't look past this time and the actual battle between the armies had no real emotional value in it and wasn't as exciting as the stuff we've seen in LOTR. Despite that, the cast is still really great and they are really getting their characters right, I still like this adaptation of the story, and the final fight that sees Thorin taking on Azog was very exciting and entertaining. Finally, the film did do a great job of ending Bilbo's adventure and really made it a sweet but kinda sad goodbye to his life as an adventurer.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" may not have been perfect and epically entertaining for me like the last two—and its considerably shorter running time provides the argument that, with some edits, this trilogy could have easily been made into two films—but I still had a great time returning to Middle-earth for one last adventure."
"BrianDrbys","7","3","8","17 December 2014"," Nice tie up.
","Not as great as the whole of the 6 films, but better than The fellowship.. Bit surprised that Thorin Oakenshield should die, but nice tie up to the whole 6 in the last scene. The battle might be considered to be over long, and I found myself suffering a little ""battle fatigue"" when it was over. This said, I think Martin Freeman made a much better Bilbo than Elijah Wood did as Frodo. Orlando Bloom and Cate Blanchett were welcome inclusions. The destruction of Lake-town was spectacular something Peter Jackson always does well, (think Helms Deep). Overall, an enjoyable movie, not as good as the other 2, but then The empire Stikes back was much better than The Return of the Jedi."

"saiferz","6","3","8","16 December 2014"," The end of an ultimately unwelcome return to Middle Earth
","The Hobbit Trilogy really has been blighted by the additional content added in, and it's ironic that these moments have come at the cost of vital sections of the book. It's even more ironic considering that many story lines that have fabricated/added to the story of their own creation are not resolved. <br/><br/>To say that ""wait for the extended edition to judge how well it closes its story"" is nonsense this book has already been super sized to three films, the fact Peter Jackson has managed to release extended editions for each of his Hobbit films astounds me.<br/><br/>Certain set pieces are given a build up and just left dangling in the air. When you walk out of the cinema you actually realise a lot has been cut out of the film when reflecting on what you have seen.<br/><br/>Whereas The Lord of the Rings Trilogy took to blending all forms of film making (physical props, miniatures, CGI, etc), The Hobbit has placed an overbearing of CGI. This dulls the spectacle and during the film I actually realised what I am watching is 70/30 animated CGI and live action respectively. This is jarring and is one of the few times I have found CGI getting in the way of the story the film is trying to get across.<br/><br/>Jackson's exuberance on building upon Tolkien's story and relying so heavily on CGI has hindered what truly made his LOTRs Trilogy a pinnacle in storytelling. Whereas The Hobbit could not provide material for 3 films, the LOTRs books have plentiful and a lot of the book has been cut out in the film adaption even when considering the extended editions. That is the main issue here - and a trilogy that is rife with filler has really hindered The Hobbit Trilogy and the titular character, in my opinion, has not been given the spotlight throughout the Trilogy and this film in particular.<br/><br/>Jackson has managed to steer this away from catastrophe territory (a la George Lucas with the Prequels) into ""meh it's OK"" territory. I feel this trilogy could be cut down to 4 hours and would produce a far superior film.<br/><br/>Although I reference The Trilogy of The Hobbit as a whole in my review the same flaws which runs through the first two instalments are even more present and prevalent in this instalment - for two films I have been tolerant but the issues have now overstayed their welcome and I'm glad The Silmarilion movie rights are unavailable to anyone as it will prevent the gloss from the movies 11-14 years prior being dulled and tainted even further.<br/><br/>I was the target age for this Hobbit series when LOTR came out and even I can see the drop in quality, this is a question of aesthetic - which Jackson changed for the Hobbit and he has forgotten what made his original trilogy so special.... Much like the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy of the Star Wars saga.<br/><br/>I believe that the comments Viggo Mortensen made against The Hobbit films and Peter Jackson are valid after seeing these three films."
"sreethered","6","3","8","16 December 2014"," The aftermath of The Hobbit....
","Last year,when I reviewed Desolation of Smaug, I pointed out the possibilities that they can include on the next one. Those were: ""A dragon who wants to destroy the fisherman village, a man who waits for the dragon with a black arrow, an elf-dwarf love story, an elf who chases an orc who may be will find a pale one too, a forwarding army of orcs, and a wizard in cage.""<br/><br/>Well, most of them was indeed in the movie, with some good and bad elements. First of all, Battle Of Five Armies is a shadow of Return of The King. There are precisely five armies, slicing and hammering each other. Had to say, the fight sequences were awesome. Before that, there was Thorin Okenshield playing Humphrey Bogart from Treasure Of Sierra Madre. <br/><br/>Overall, the Hobbit series was a leftover of the Lord Of The Ring series, and as per the previous ones' standard, this one is a fitting conclusion. Still, it gave us the best hobbit ever put on screen, gave us some ravishing visuals. So don't be so hard on it...."
"josephiss11","4","3","8","15 December 2014"," Decent but disappointing
","I have been a huge LOTR and Tolkien fun for as long as I can remember. I want to start this review with this question: Since when has the LOTR and Tolkien fun-base become a 15-year-old dominion?<br/><br/>The film's major problem was that it targeted 15-year-old people who would normally watch reality TV. Of course I am referring to all the Tauriel-Dwarf relationship. What was that all about? Seriously? An elvish war-princess saying things like: ""why does it hurt so much""? Simply unacceptable Mr Jackson. And then having the elven king replying: ""Because it was real"". They met for one night, exchanged perhaps 3 looks and next thing you know they are in love. Pathetic. No need to mention that this totally undermines Tolkien's conception of elves-dwarfs relationship. <br/><br/>CGI was also very excessive. In stark contrast to LOTR authenticity, orcs and ""evil"" things were completely CGI-ised to not such a good effect. Also, this battle lacked the 'dark' and ominous feelings we got with Helm's Deep. Orcs were not evil at all, rather funny things that could be banged on with a Dwarf's bear head.<br/><br/>The film also felt like it did not resolve issues. The film's best scene with the White Council battling Sauron was not resolved, neither did we get to find out what happened with Lake-Town. Who became king under the mountain? What happened with the elves? Did they get their treasure? We simply do not know. Was the budget reduced at the last minute? <br/><br/>The film was saved by Martin Freeman's acting and the battle scenes (excluding the ridiculous 'comedy relief' parts). Also the White Council scene was amazing. <br/><br/>Mr Jackson has failed to live up to his reputation and created a rather harshly done trilogy (did not put in enough effort/attention), having more in mind to sell rather that create a worthy instalment to Middle Earth."
"Awesomephant","7","3","8","14 December 2014"," Definitely entertaining if you enjoy the genre and don't dwell too much on hows and whys
","If you are fond of Middle Earth and are willing to put up with a few annoyances (nearly unbearable ""comic"" relief character, for instance) and plenty of CGI, then you will very likely enjoy The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.<br/><br/>There is a lot of fighting in this film, and most of it is greatly entertaining. The acting is top notch as well; Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins) is a fantastic hobbit, and Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield) does an awesome job as a conflicted dwarf lord, portraying his character's good and evil sides extremely well.<br/><br/>I feel the story had a couple of loose ends, but nothing too intricate that you cannot puzzle out yourself.<br/><br/>In the end, it was a fun experience. Oh, and bonus points for Saruman's fight scene!"
"gercs","7","3","8","13 December 2014"," Not as great as any of the three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but a decent conclusion to The Hobbit story
","I have read the book, and I was excited when it was announced that ""The Hobbit"" story will be told through the live-action medium. However, I'm one of those who didn't like the idea of splitting the story into three films because there isn't much content unlike ""The Lord of the Rings"". So, I guess we were expecting a series of films not intended to be at par with the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy after all.<br/><br/>Contrary to the impression of many film critics, I thought the first film was memorable because I think it captured the atmosphere of the story well -- somewhat close to what I have imagined while reading the book. The first film also took its time to develop the characters. Then, there was this second film, which I found quite good; and overall, I thought that the first one was better despite the second film being more visually impressive. It's just that the second film seemed stretched out because more details were given in the action scenes, which contributed little to the advancement of the story. And then, here we go, the third film, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"", finally came out. Based on the book and what was told in the first two films, there isn't much story left to tell in the last film other than a vivid depiction of the battle. So, I wasn't expecting much from the third film other than a decent conclusion and some exciting action scenes.<br/><br/>I saw it this weekend, and indeed, the third film met my expectations. It is a decent conclusion to the trilogy, and it contains some impressive visuals and exciting action sequences. If you are expecting lots of action sequences, I think you will enjoy the film. If you are expecting a compelling story with the same level as that of any of the three films in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I think there is a high possibility that you will be disappointed. At the least, the film has provided a good background for The Lord of the Rings. If you are not aware that The Hobbit is a prelude to The Lord of the Rings, I think you will have the impression that many doors have been opened that the film failed to develop and provide satisfying conclusions. For those who are aware about it being a prelude, you will find it to be a decent bridge about Sauron's expulsion into Mordor, the resurrection of the nine fallen kings, and of course Bilbo's affair with the ring.<br/><br/>When it comes to the visuals and action sequences, I think they are at par with that of the second Hobbit film and at some point, better. Some of the memorable sequences are the Laketown attack by the dragon and the confrontation between the guardians of Middle Earth and Sauron. Just like in the second one, there were sequences where they ""overdid"" the CGI, which made some scenes looked artificial. I liked the idea that they inserted some story sequence not found in the book, and I think it worked. When it comes to the depth of the story, there were times when the film felt unsure about where it is going, and I thought that in some portions a better editing is needed. Many scenes felt too long for its purpose and were probably better off when cut short. The second film felt stretched out, but the third film felt stretched out even more. There were scenes that were ought to be compelling but ended up low-key or uneven. Some jokes didn't work quite well. I was expecting some solid depiction of Thorin's madness and its resolution, but ended up wishing for something better. After all, this is what I thought to be one of the highlights of the story. In the first film, I was thrilled by Gollum's riddles; in the second one, I had some eerie encounter with Smaug; then unfortunately in the last one, I don't think I encountered anything equally compelling or memorable. If you are expecting some breathtaking battle and some emotionally satisfying sequences just like what you might have experienced in The Lord of the Rings, I guess you will not be able to find it here. I was also wondering about the musical score; I couldn't seem to find a novel theme that stands out (something at the same level as the theme of The Shire), although I think the score suits the film well and the song at the end credits is good.<br/><br/>At the bottom line, this film is a solid story about greed and friendship, a children's story if one would like to put it that way. Despite the shortcomings, the spirit of the book is still there. And by the way, the scenery along Bilbo's return journey is breathtaking, and the Shire looked good as always."

","Having never read the Hobbit i've enjoyed each of the films so far. It may lack in some of the detail that was seen in the LOTR films but good fun nonetheless.<br/><br/>I was equally as excited to see the last instalment but unfortunately it just didn't quite live up to the hype.<br/><br/>The first hour was entertaining, really building up to what I and everyone in the cinema thought would be a great climax. Then it just loses it. Battle scene after battle scene where you watch Legolas jump from falling stone to falling stone, a huge Orc army which seemed endless suddenly loses when Thorin makes an entrance and later on, another Orc army which is instantly wiped out by eagles. It was either too elaborate or too quick and the plot vanishes from that point on.<br/><br/>Instead what this films ends up being is a half finished end to the Hobbit trilogy and more focus on how to tie into the Lord of the Rings. Whilst visually it may be stunning, the story just doesn't quite cut it."
"thenachoman","7","3","8","13 December 2014"," Great end to an uneven trilogy
","Let me say at the outset that I wasn't super excited by this movie. And this isn't a criticism, it's something all of us should keep in mind after watching it. The sixth movie in any series has a huge weight to bare, an unfair weight really. I'm sure most of the people reading this review were excited after coming out of FOTR - they knew that they had seen the beginning of something special and that there was more to come. But after 13 years and five prequels, this movie has very much lost that sense of excitement that accompanied FOTR. <br/><br/>This is a formidable barrier to surmount but the Battle of the Five Armies manages it. The plot moves along at a rapid pace. For a fantasy movie, the character development is pretty good. The acting from Thorin, the elf king, Fili and Tauriel is especially good (especially considering the rather weak dialogue they had to work with). The special effects are excellent, and in HFR they look even better. The is the first time I've seen a movie in HFR and it definitely sold me on the technology, mainly because the action scenes are so much smoother. You don't miss any of the action with HFR. The two orc leaders are evil and scary as hell. They fight like demons and seem unstoppable, but never cheat. The way they moved and fought was the antithesis of the elves, which is exactly how it should be.<br/><br/>My main criticism is the overwrought music during the battle scenes. It drained much of the impact of the battle scenes because it was so overbearing. On the few occasions that it quietened, my tension increased exponentially.<br/><br/>Also, it was a bit ridiculous how easily the towns people and Bilbo were able to kill the massive hulking orcs. Yes I'm talking about the scene where Bilbo takes out orcs by throwing rocks at their heads. This really diminished the strength of the enemy.<br/><br/>Strangely, my favourite part of the movie was the epilogue. It was the perfect length and set the scene for the LOTR trilogy perfectly. It also left me feeling satisfied with the Hobbit series. Yes, Battle for the Five Armies wasn't quite as epic as LOTR, but it wasn't intended to be. The Hobbit up to ROTK is a long building crescendo. The Hobbit trilogy makes the LOTR trilogy even better."

","The third and final installment in the three-part film adaptation based on the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is A Satisfying End to a highly impressive trilogy. Peter Jackson & Team, give us a dark, yet bombastic action extravagant!<br/><br/>'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' Synopsis: Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness.<br/><br/>At a 144-minutes, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is filled with moments of drama & spectacular action-sequences. The Graphics are beyond awesome & the stunts are astounding. I was mesmerized by the film's second-hour, because once the action sets in, you can't move from your seat. <br/><br/>Having said that, the first-hour of the film is a mighty bore! Slow & Dull, Jackson's third installment falls short on this count. A stronger, faster first-hour would have done no harm! <br/><br/>Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro & Jackson's Adapted Screenplay lacks meat for the entire first-hour, but becomes heart-pounding later on. Jackson's Direction is eye-filling. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Graphics are simply awesome. Costume Design & Make-Up are good, too.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: The Wonderful Martin Freeman as the lovable Bilbo Baggins, scores yet again. Sir Ian McKellen is as gripping as ever as Gandalf. Richard Armitage gives a far more serious approach to Thorin this time around, but its an impressive one. And Luke Evans steals the show as the heroic Bard the Bowman. The rest of the ensemble, pitch in credible work, as well. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is surely fun, but not without its flaws. Nonetheless, A Satisfying End!"
"cosmicfish14","4","3","9","8 January 2015"," A Solid Conclusion
","Before we start, I'll give you a rundown of my thoughts on the other 2 movies. An Unexpected Journey is my personal favorite, mostly because it feels more of a journey than an epic war like the other 2. The Desolation Of Smaug is my least favorite, mostly that there were a lot of characters and elements that seemed really forced, and it actually seemed longer than the other 2, but I still enjoyed it. Now we've gotten to the final chapter, and personally I say this is my middle favorite.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind is that even though this is about 20 minutes shorter than the other 2, it seems just as long. And that is probably because there is so much fighting in this movie! I feel like 2/3 of this movie is just battle sequences. Though, to be fair it is done a whole lot better than most recent blockbuster movies. It is done in some creative ways and the effects don't look that bad either.<br/><br/>There still are still some really forced moments in the movie. There was once a scene that was supposed to be a hallucination and that it was supposed to be scary, but it just seemed hilarious. Also the butler character from the second movie is back and is incredibly forced comic- relief. Also there were some fight scenes that were incredibly ridiculous as well.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but it was incredibly underwhelming. I mean, this is the end to a massive franchise and just has a pretty meh ending. But that was really the only big problem I had with the movie. All around it was a pretty solid conclusion to the prequel trilogy and the franchise as well<br/><br/>Final Score: 7/10"
"jonwavesu","10","3","9","20 December 2014"," 9.5, they were so close to the Lord of the Rings
","This is definitely the best of the three, and the closest to feeling like the Lord of the Rings. It is mostly a battle, but if you read the book, you'd know that was all that was left, and be paying for it willingly. All in all I'd say this is a great send off, and ties in beautifully with the lord of the rings.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>Positives: Thorin's story arc. The Dragon Sickness and his friendship with Bilbo were all handled really well. The White Council vs. Sauron. This is not an imagined thing by Peter Jackson, it was in the appendices, and needed if they were to tie in the lord of the rings and continue expanding the universe. And the fight scene was awesome. The Battle. Though it wasn't quite to the epic scale that helms deep or minas tirith was, it is still an awesome battle. Smaug. For what brief time we get to see him, he is amazing. Death. The deaths of Fili, Kili, and Thorin were all masterfully done. It got me choked up, and I don't cry easily. It was just enough emotion for a 90 minute battle.<br/><br/>Negatives CGI. The film was great, and I loved it. But the CGI pulled me out. Especially when compared to the lord of the rings where everything looks real. The landscapes, the orcs, and even a major dwarf character are all CGI. Now the CGI is really stellar, but it can't beat the real thing. Comedy relief. I liked the comedy, but I didn't. It just didn't fit. The film seemed like it was going for return of the kings bleak and dark tone, and most of the comedy took me out of that.<br/><br/>And that's about it. All in all I'd say they were so close to the lord of the rings, but the CGI and the comedy are what bogs it down."
"Al_The_Strange","9","3","9","20 December 2014"," Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies Review
","The journey of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin's company of 13 dwarfs was always destined to end one way: all out war. In their struggles, these 14 characters managed to cross paths with goblins, orcs, eagles, wood elves, and men. Inevitably, once Smaug is dealt with, they would all converge on Erebor to split up the dragon's treasure, and their bickering would escalate into the Battle of the Five Armies.<br/><br/>With most of the journey completed up to this point, the film's sole purpose is the climax: there is no rising action or build-up, the film jumps right into showing Smaug decimating Laketown, the White Council confronting the Necromancer, and five different armies breaking out in all-out combat. In spite of this, the film is easily the most action-packed and evenly-paced movie of the entire saga. There is tons of action and visual splendor, from the decimation of an entire town to the showdown between iconic characters in an ancient snow-covered ruin. The film is always shifting gears from one huge setpiece to another, as the battle constantly changes and new foes erupt to take the film in exciting new directions. The film is the shortest of all Middle Earth films, but its sheer amount of action makes it feel longer, more epic, and more breakneck than the others.<br/><br/>Where the film falls short, unfortunately, is the storytelling. Truth is, most of the burden of the storytelling was left to the last two films, so there's little left but to have all the characters fight. The film is at its best as it shows Thorin's madness from ""dragon sickness"" (or rather, unbridled greed), Bilbo's intervention in the brewing conflict, Bard's efforts to lead others and protect his family, and the occasional burst of drama involving Turiel and Legolas (although both could have been cut from this whole series without much impact). Once the battle's over, however, there are loose ends that the film only partially addresses. It does round off a few characters and make connections to The Lord of the Rings, but then it leaves other strands hanging, or just cuts them off. Even though having ""many endings"" like Return of the King would have strained some viewers' patience, I would have personally appreciated at least a little more dialogue or scenes to explain what happens to the folk of Laketown, the wood elves, Tauriel, Dain, Beorn, Radagast, and other characters introduced for The Hobbit specifically. Overall, this only feels like half a movie. It's the half of a movie that should have been tacked onto the end of The Desolation of Smaug. On its own, it's a rather flat and shallow storyline. In the larger context of the whole Hobbit saga, it generally works and it is a thrilling endgame, but a few more words concerning the characters and events would have made this a stronger ending, and maybe even a more powerful film.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film looks as good as the rest, with good, sweeping photography and concise editing. Acting is still strong from the whole cast, with Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage being the biggest standouts among the veterans of the series. Writing is still great. This production has great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. The music score is pretty decent too.<br/><br/>The film is definitely jam-packed with all the great fantasy-action we've always loved to see in the Middle Earth saga, but once studios made the decision to stretch The Hobbit into three films, there was little choice but to cleave off the climax and turn it into this odd standalone feature. On its own, it's rather dry, but with the other movies, it's a must-see. My only wish is that there could have been a longer and more pronounced farewell to all the players involved with the whole affair.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Perfect)"

","Having now watched this final installment of The Hobbit, I think it's safe to say that while this trilogy isn't as good as the Lord of the Rings, they're still excellent films in their own right. I've read The Hobbit but not Lord of the Rings (yet), so it's quite surprising how the makers managed to get three films from a short book, but overall I think they were really well done.<br/><br/>The criticism I've read from people regarding this final installment - and even the whole series - has been ridiculous to say the least, from complaining that certain things weren't in the book to bad CGI. Bad CGI?! Seriously?? I must have watched a completely different film because the look of not just this film but the whole trilogy, from the locations, photography, and cinematography to the action and visual & special effects were nothing short of excellent and were just as good as the Lord Of The Rings. As for some things being in the film that weren't in the book...this is a film ADAPTATION. The Shining was absolutely nothing like the book yet that was praised. I know every one has their own tastes and opinions, but there's a difference between opinions and just trolling.<br/><br/>The films may have been beefed out quite a bit, but at no point do they ever feel that they are just dragging along. For me, there's more than enough to keep your interest and to keep you watching with plenty of drama, tension, suspense, and action throughout. As with the previous films, there is the occasional silly action scene such as Legolas running along rocks that are falling in mid-air, but it's not as if these scenes ruin the films.<br/><br/>There's also a nice wee tie-in to the Lord of the Rings with Legolas being told to seek out the ranger names Strider.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a really enjoyable movie to round off The Hobbit trilogy, so if you've not seen it as yet (or the previous movies), then ignore the - sometimes over-the-top - hate and go and watch it. You may just be surprised by how good it is."
"willcundallreview","7","2","5","2 May 2015"," A fairly good ending to the Hobbit
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is an end to the Hobbit film series and a pretty decent film to finish. Yes for me it was kind of good but did well to end it all and bring to a close a good but mixed reaction film series. It's a tad rushed along the way and the special effects are in overdrive at certain moments but nevertheless as I mentioned I felt it to be fairly good and here below is just why so.<br/><br/>Now the action in this movie is truly thrilling, it is massive and I mean that with the fighting providing most of the running time of 144 minutes. Now with the fighting we see in films like the Hobbit and of course fellow Middle Earth connected Lord of the Rings, it is always fantasy battles at it's very highest, and that is what you get here. You can't make up some things you see here and this all coming from the mind of Tolkein and the people behind the movie makes this one crazy kind of finale.<br/><br/>The cast give it a good go and it is true to say no one character seems to be in more than others, there are a lot of people involved here. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is kind of OK if not a little subdued and for some reason he actually doesn't feature that much surprisingly. Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage and Orlando Bloom among others do an OK job and although they excel when acting with true dramatic moments, the less said about the fighting the better, in fact no one here can make the fighting seem un-cringe worthy at times. <br/><br/>I feel without good directing this could have completely fallen apart so all credit to Peter Jackson for handling the reigns with a firm but not a strong grip. He seems to make this movie just a little more exciting and the way in which the battles are fought are just magnificently done at times. Now the adapted script is OK but not great, it has some of the more cheesy lines here and there and it is very much up and down, but what it does do is finish this off how it feels it should be, with that same Middle Earth feel it always needs.<br/><br/>The effects are truly top of the range and the one's used here are in my opinion the best movies can do these days with technology in this film being kind of mind blowing. I think although the effects are great and all, it doesn't mind showing off a little and some moments will make you think whether that was CGI or it was not, kind of confusing. The epic scale of the effects is also used to it's full extent and I think the producers really wanted this to be the crowning glory of design. <br/><br/>Now with such a long running time you can't expect for one this review to be one paragraph, but also you can't expect it not to fit everything in. But, for some strange reason they do seem to rush scenes and that is evidentially there within the first say 20 minutes which if you haven't seen, well you will see what I mean. <br/><br/>Overall I felt it was more than OK as a movie and one definitely worth a watch. It was the kind of movie that probably needs to be seen on the big screen to get the full effects but nevertheless this is a fine renting or streaming etc film to watch. Maybe this is the end of Middle earth in cinema and maybe this is capping off two decades of fantasy movies, or maybe just maybe there is still more to come."
"arendhamming","3","2","5","10 April 2015"," OK movie, superficial compared to the book
","The book The Hobbit is less than half as big as each of the books of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy. Yet it was milked out to three movies. This seems to be for no other reason than monetization. Three movies from a strong franchise, sure to rake in money, is better than one or two. Yet it also demonstrates that the first and foremost concern isn't about telling the story. Much less so than it was of the LOTR movies to my opinion.<br/><br/>The central theme of The Hobbit is a story of personal development and maturation of Bilbo, the hobbit after whom the book was named. Yet it is this character development that is lost in the movies. No matter how well the actor tries, so many stuff was added to stretch the story to three movies, that the personal development just got lost in translation. Worse, parts of the story that are details to the event progression but essential for the personal development, such as Bilbo being unconscious during the battle of five armies in the book, were altered to make up more stuff. Another theme that's important to Bilbo's development is his friendship with Thorin. The first two movies did a good job of showing that, but this movie goofs it up with unnecessary simplifications from the book in how Thorin himself develops. Stretching a small story out over three movies should have given ample space for depicting it properly.<br/><br/>Some quotes were literally taken from the books, yet there are some major changes that are just odd. In the books there is no mention of orcs at all, they're called goblins. Yet in the movie there are only orcs, which are very different from the goblins encountered in a previous movie. Apart from such major changes, there are all kinds of details that just don't make sense and feel like superficial stereotypes. Bard's family, for example, is perhaps meant to draw us into his character further, but they feel clumsily weaved into the story. Radagast never appears in the books, but he has appeared throughout the Hobbit movies. In this film appearance feels even more contrived than in the other movies. He just appears at two moments, not adding anything to the story.<br/><br/>For those who saw the previous movies, this movie will be the OK conclusion of the trilogy. But it won't please anyone who also read the book and enjoyed the journey and maturation of Bilbo.<br/><br/>To me, this whole movie seems more like a superficial means to earn money with tons of special effects, than a medium through which the brilliant story of the book is told. is properly told."
"SimonFrederick","4","2","5","8 April 2015"," They shouldn't have split this into 3 films.
","Unfortunately for me, I found that with each film I was enjoying it less and less. The problem I had with this feature is it felt more and more like a generic action film. Me and my friends were guessing every time someone would come in and save the person just in time, we could predict some of the deaths and the plot changes. This however doesn't make it a bad film, just makes it not as enjoyable as we'd have hoped. What made it bad was the messiness of it all, you can tell this film has been segmented into the last film in the way its cut. Smaug was done with immediately and you were off to the next stage, the triple arguments between races. This was incredibly interesting nor was it executed well. Everyone had an issue in their ranks and everyone disliked each other..this is where adding characters (Tauriel) has some negative as I didn't really care about her issues with her kingdom as I haven't had enough time to. Also, Thorin's change in personality due to apparently being in this place was kinda quickly brought on, and just felt like a poor version of watching Frodo's mind twisting due to the ring (which was very nicely done in retrospect). I also couldn't stand every scene that the mono-brow cheap version of Grima Wormtongue was in. I can't believe he got so many scenes and so many lines, completely pointless and irritating. Once you get to the 6th film, the nice lighting and music have ran their course; the fighting was cool and the CGI was mostly good and I enjoyed the new creatures but the plot just didn't have enough. I'm gonna have to give it a lower rating than the last film just because I thought it was messy.<br/><br/>I think it was a poor idea to split this and the first film into 3 films. I think 2 films would've played much nicer and would've made 2 good individual films instead of this partial film."
"terrellrobinson71","9","2","5","25 March 2015"," ""Will You Follow Me...One Last Time?"" Of course, we will
","4 books by J.R.R. Tolkien. 6 films. 2 trilogies. And they were made by one director. Plus, it took 17 years to create these films. Has there ever been a time in which Peter Jackson needed to take a break? After creating ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, maybe he can. In one of the quieter moments of ""The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies"", Bilbo Baggins reminisces to Thorin Oakenshield about their journey that led them to the Dwarfs' Kingdom of Erebor, but also ""The good, the bad and how lucky I am that I made it home."" There is a lot to remember in the final Hobbit film, especially in the entire Middle-Earth saga. There are moments of light humor, thrilling action sequences that includes marvelous special effects as well as some awesome orc and goblin beheadings, powerful drama and of course, the enchantment that started with the imagination of an amazing author and an amazing filmmaker as well. In ""The Battle of The Five Armies"", the best of ""The Hobbit"" films, the stakes are high and our hobbit Bilbo along with our heroes are faced with deadly obstacles, not to mention that they discover something a whole lot more that could change Middle-Earth forever and will also lead into the events in ""The Lord of the Rings"". Now, of course, ""The Battle of The Five Armies"" immediately picks up right where ""The Desolation of Smaug"" left off. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the Dwarfs has unintentionally let the dragon out of its cage. Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) has left Erebor, and now terrorizes Lake-town. What happens to him and Lake-town is an astonishing sight to witness. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) was captured by The Necromancer now revealing itself as Sauron and is now discovering that Sauron has built up an Army or two lead by Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett) and his co-hort Bolg (John Tui) so they can cause and create hell on Middle-Earth. Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the remaining dwarfs including Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Bofur (James Nesbitt) has survived the attack on Lake-town. And the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace) wants nothing more but to reclaim his own treasure. In the kingdom of Erebor, as predicted before, Thorin ""can't see beyond his own desire"", as he is suffering from Dragon-Sickness. Bilbo and the Dwarfs slowly starts to notice it, which leads to Bilbo to commit one fateful act to save Middle-Earth. If only that would be the case. Then, it leads to the subtitle of this film, in which Orcs, Men, Dwarfs, Elves and Eagles fight to the death in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil in the entire trilogy. Being the shortest of the entire Middle-Earth Saga (It's only 144 minutes), ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" has moments in which the characters realizing that something is worth fighting for rather than each other. They also commit (and sacrifice) themselves to find their place in this world. Because Jackson has a knack of creating the world of Middle-Earth with breathtaking special effects and a big cast, the films give each of the actors their moments to shine even if their moments are not as big as the others. For example, look at Martin Freeman. He caught my eye, surprisingly, as the lead in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and now, with the help of ""Sherlock"", the first season of FX's ""Fargo"" and with ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, he's becoming an top-notch, A-list star. His performance as Bilbo through these three films is remarkable, creating humanity as well as developing a surprisingly emotional side to him. I guess you can say he is becoming more like Bilbo, as well. Armitage's Shakespearian-like Thorin is scary-great. He creates a incredibly tragic character who slowly starts to care more about the journey, his kingdom, the Arkenstone and the gold, rather than the people guiding him on that quest, until he sees the dangers of falling into what his father and grandfather has done before, even when he says he doesn't want to be like them. Plus, it can be the last time we see some of the returning regulars like Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, Cate Blanchett as Lady Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman the Wise and Hugo Weaving as Lord Elrond as they strike back and make magic one last time. But, as I stated before, the supporting players like Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lilly, Ken Stott (as Balin), Graham McTavish (as Dwalin) and Ryan Gage (as the slimy and greedy Alfrid) add a lot more sting and more emotional depth to their performances. ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" brings back some of the magic and greatness of ""The Lord of the Rings"" mainly because it adds a bit more substance to the films and it also moves in a more quicker pace. Plus, the action is more intense, the drama is more emotional, the love story between Kili and Tauriel is more stronger and there is some quirky humor snuck in there even when the tone has gotten more darker. These movies captivated me for so many years and it's rather fitting to say farewell to the cast and crew for bringing Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth to the screen with the last installment of the series. Like ""Harry Potter"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", and ""The Hunger Games"", their stories will (and have) become classics and once you viewed or read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" as one equal, it all connects. Sometimes the best one is the last one worth waiting for."

","I'm a fan of Tolkien and I didn't mind the Lord of the Rings adaption, especially the first one.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a different story though (excuse the pun). I could barely watch it, particularly The Battle of the Five Armies. The CGI is terrible, its like watching someone play a computer game. The CGI is dark, cold, sometimes way too soft, sometimes too harsh and totally unrealistic ... I just couldn't connect to the movie with those visuals.<br/><br/>It's also stretched out with made up content that adds nothing and is not relevant to the story. What is does do is make 1 movie into 3 movies ... a way of trying to milk every drop one money out of it with no benefit to the us, the audience.<br/><br/>Could have been great, turned out rubbish."
"nejcmlakar37","3","2","5","10 March 2015"," Just bad.
","I love LOTRO i have read everything there is to read about it. But this is simply bad. If it didn't have so much budget, this would be the worst movie ever. Let me tell you why:<br/><br/>1.The whole movie is just one big battle which is great, but there is no story you simply have a couple of different armies who fights for treasure.<br/><br/>2. They killed the dragon, everybody feared, because he was so strong and powerful, but yet they killed him with 1 arrow. And yes i know, he was lacking a scale but cmon people, can you really kill a dragon with an arrow that goes 30cm under your skin.... i don't think so.<br/><br/>3. Legolas, he was cool in LOTRO, but it seems that in Hobbit he is this powerful man that bends gravity and physics. Did i forget to mention his role in this battle is none. Why even put him in this franchise ? Plus he looks weird<br/><br/>4. Speaking of stuff looking weird, have you seen the faces of elves in the battle, they are all computer made. That wouldn't bother me that much, except they made them look like monsters.<br/><br/>5. Where did they find a armless, legless troll and decide, oh look a troll without arms and legs, lets put some weird looking metal ball there.<br/><br/>6. Orcs have a big army, we are talking like enormous army with catapults, goblins, worms, you name it. But guess what they use for destroying walls ? Yes of course, a troll that has a helmet made of bricks so he can bump head first into a wall and destroy it. Yes it does look funny, but it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>7. I barely cared of any of the characters, i really couldn't wait for Thorin to die, i completely forgot about Bilbo he didn't play any major role here and so on.<br/><br/>8. Am I the only one that thinks all elves look ridiculously lame in all the movies.<br/><br/>Well here are my reasons why this movie is bad and too long. It would be better if you spend your time watching porn or some dumb stuff on you tube."

In fact it was just the beginning of a return journey which would take a further two hours and a bit.<br/><br/>In that time Thorin gets seduced by the Gold, goes back on his word and promises. Various armies gather and there are epic battles with decapitations and Legolas becomes a super elf.<br/><br/>Bilbo becomes a secondary character in his own story and although the battles in what is mainly CGI is entertaining the whole enterprise is rather pointless as it should had been tagged on in the last movie.<br/><br/>Ryan Gage's scenes as the cowardly Alfrid looks misjudged, Lee Pace as Thranduil is an arrogant bore<br/><br/>The film does provide a bridge to the Lord of the Rings trilogy with characters such as Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond turning up and fighting which kind of reminded me of the Star Wars prequel and Christopher Lee's stunt double was in those scenes as well.<br/><br/>Lets be plain, The Hobbit films were turned into a trilogy because they were seen as a cash cow and this cow was throughly milked."

","I really don't know what happened on the entire trilogy, maybe one book wasn't enough for three movies or something, but what i can say is that watching this one and the second part have been one of the most disappointing experiences on my life as a movie fan. I had so many expectations from years of watching LOR over and over again, but the hobbit is so full of made up stories and characters and so full of cgi effects that is insulting, for real. I expect peter Jackson to one day amaze us with something great again, but being honest and clear about it, surely the hobbit is not that surprise. Far way better advise, stay with the book. I'm still trying to understand how the same guy did directed LOR, a masterpiece really, and a few years later this."
"dangent280","7","2","5","2 January 2015"," One Last Time...?
","Here we are at last. After 726 minutes of Lord of the Rings (I'm including the extended Blu-Ray editions as i recently watched them all) and 343 minutes of The Hobbit so far (once again, the extended editions) we have the final instalment of our journey through middle-earth. What a ride it has been. Shall we do it one last time? <br/><br/>The Hobbit series so far hasn't at all gripped me in ways that LOTR did. I found An Unexpected Journey way too long, yet a solid start, and although The Desolation of Smaug was a much improved addition to the Middle Earth saga, it still stood in the shadow of all films within the LOTR trilogy. Now we have The Battle of Five Armies, a film that starts with a superb opening scene following on from the conclusion of the previous film, in which the monstrous Smaug descends upon Laketown with death, and death in huge numbers, in mind. Ironically, the epicness and awe-inspiring first section of the film is never really surpassed in the two hours that followed.<br/><br/>In terms of the good, the first is that the film is much shorter than the previous offerings resulting in a better pace as well as eradicating the feeling that the story was dragging on, something which i had felt particularly in the first film. Secondly, Richard Armitage is fantastic as Thorin, and in my view stole the show portraying a character battling with his inner demons in a way not too dissimilar from the effects of the one ring, although this inadvertently results in Freeman's perfect portrayal of Bilbo almost being sidelined. Other positive points include the way in which Christopher Lee, aged 92, can still kick shadowy butt, and the way in which the film nicely rounds off the middle-earth saga by leading the audience straight into The Fellowship of the Ring. <br/><br/>Now for the bad. For some reason, the makers of The Hobbit Trilogy have gone CGI crazy, particularly within this last instalment, and for me the sheer amount of reliance on such sadly reduces the feeling of epicness i should have been feeling. CGI orcs? Not needed. The orcs in LOTR were brilliant. Why change that? CGI Dain? WHY? You could have easily just asked for Billy Connolly to be in the film directly, yet instead, Mr Jackson or whoever believes his voice is all that is needed and a computer generated version is much better. No. The over-use of CGI also results in the film looking like a video game in some occasions, with some scenes looking like they have been lifted from last years' Shadow of Mordor. Other minor problems included Orlando Bloom looking very scary as a post-plastic surgery looking Legolas, some cheesy love-in moments, and an overall sense of repetitiveness during the titular battle. <br/><br/>In conclusion, The Battle of the Five Armies has rounded off the middle-earth saga in a solid, yet strangely unspectacular fashion, featuring a brilliant opening scene as well as a stand-out performance from Armitage, weakened by an over-reliance on CGI and a feeling of repetitiveness throughout the battle sequences. Farewell Middle- Earth. It's been emotional. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 7/10"
"CinematicInceptions","7","2","5","29 December 2014"," Same feel as the first two with tons of action and character interaction. Worth seeing in theaters, but far from perfect.
","This, I feel, is the best movie of the Hobbit Trilogy. Almost everything that was added from scratch that I had doubts about previously turned out to be worth it in this final chapter. I, as with many viewers, was expecting this to have rather a Return of the King feel to it. But it really had more of a Deathly Hallows Part 2 feel to it with the very, very extended climatic battle as opposed to a couple of smaller battles leading up to the shorter climax. However, it switched between characters in much the same way as The Two Towers and Return of the King did, though not quite as well.<br/><br/>I will begin with the two main negatives. First is Alfrid. His role in Desolation of Smaug was manageable and didn't detract much. However, I felt like his comic relief role in this installment was unnecessary since Dain was already kind of a comic relief. Also, the humor was sort of lame, especially since they tried to make him the goofy Grima Wormtounge of the series. Of the twenty-ish gags they gave him, I laughed at maybe two. That's not to say that other people might enjoy his humor. The other negative is the rushed falling action. I'm familiar with the aftermath of the battle, so it didn't leave any holes for me. But in context of the modified film version, there were way too many people whose fate after the battle went unexplained. We have no idea what happens to the Arkenstone or the people of Laketown or the treasure of Erebor. Dain and Bard are untouched, and even Tauriel's status at the end feels incomplete. So maybe all of that will come in the extended version.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie was spectacular, but certainly not for everybody. If you have felt averse to the characters or the modified storyline thus far, don't bother seeing this. Dain is the one new character and he's pretty small, so there is practically nobody new to root for. Anyone thinking that this one will be more like Lord of the Rings, you will be disappointed throughout except maybe during the scene where the White Council battle the Nazgul and Sauron. However, if you're looking to compare characters, Thorin could be called the Boromir of the series, and Bard could qualify as the Aragorn character. One last thing for prospective viewers to look out for is the trailer. I would say that it's about 80% accurate to the movie, which isn't too bad considering how much stuff some trailers add that isn't in the movie. Most of the lines are included, but some aren't in the completed movie, and the same goes for the action sequences in the trailer. <br/><br/>Despite the battle being the main plot line of this film, it is still very character driven because there is kind of a ""unite or die"" issue throughout much of the first half. Bolg and Azog's approaching armies require the other leaders and forces to stop fighting each other. Thranduil and Thorin are the two people who drive this conflict because of their succumbing to the dragon sickness. This malady could have been better explained, but was well presented with Thorin's Smaug voice and distrust of everyone. The symptoms seem a bit over the top, but I think that's because it's severity was poorly explained rather than poorly presented. I really liked how Thorin decided to forsake the gold of his own accord, especially because we were able to see his thought process. After this transition we get to see Torin epitomized in battle. When he leads his charge from the mountain, he tears through the orc army with an incredible amount of fighting skill. His character is really the most notable in this movie. There are certainly other very big characters, but none of them have progression like Thorin. Bard protects his family and the inhabitants of Laketown throughout. Gandalf is in his usual position as adviser to all. Thranduil's character is a little weaker in this movie, for although his personality is retained, his actions and motives are inconsistent throughout (this is especially bad for his character because he is centuries old and probably not too whimsical). Tauriel and Kili's relationship is retained, but not developed (I was actually shocked that Tauriel didn't die). Bilbo gets more screen time than he is given in the book, but not an excessive amount. He, Bard, and Gandalf work as the separate voices of reason. There are some other small characters like Bard's son and the dwarfs. Bofur's role is toned down in this film, while Dwalin and Fili's are increased.<br/><br/>The action was epic, as in all Middle Earth films. There are some big clashes of armies, but the majority of the action comprises of one on one fights. The choreography of the action is solid, though the CGI is questionable apart from Smaug. Most of the fight scenes are pretty spectacular, though Legolas defying physics in running up the collapsing bridge was a lot more amusing than amazing. However, the killing of Smaug in the opening scene is wonderfully done and stays true to the book. <br/><br/>The visual execution could have been better, but there were no other big executional flaws and the acting was solid along with the script. Howard Shore's score was good, though not his best. <br/><br/>To wrap up, I would recommend it to any Middle Earth fan, because as bad as some people consider the Hobbit films, it's still Middle Earth, so it can't be that bad. It's worth seeing in theaters, but save your money and see it in 2D. So while it worked for me, it could be disappointing for some viewers. Though Lord of the Rings was better, Battle of the Five Armies is a pretty good send off to a great fictional world. Overall Rating: 9.3/10."

I love the LOTR and enjoyed the previous two installment's's of this prequel trilogy but Jesus Christ mate this thing really is a piece of nothing. you can't take any of the battle sequences seriously and no one cares about that human (bard) and his family let alone Kili and Tauriels love thing. <br/><br/>The entire movie I was waiting, hoping for something good to happen, to redeem or even partly the filth that this was, but it never came.

"brent_or","5","2","5","23 December 2014"," Better Pacing, Same Problems
","This will no-doubt be one of the most-reviewed films of the year, but here goes<br/><br/>The Good: The Battle of the Five Armies is well-paced. It's still too long, but the story does not drag and there is engaging action almost all the way through. As always, there is some lovely set and costume design and beautiful natural settings. The cast is talented. The dragon Smaug is fantastically dramatic and riveting, in a carry-over from the previous film. Tauriel (more on her later) and Bard represent the best instincts of this trilogy.<br/><br/>The Bad: The majority of the action is nakedly CGI and resembles video game visualization, in some cases to a truly absurd degree. There is very little focus on the title character, Bilbo Baggins. Too much uninterrupted fighting in the latter half of the film. The matter of the mountain is not clearly resolved, likely owing to too many different sub plots and character motivations being in the mix. Too many of the would-be serious moments are unintentionally funny. There is a plethora of other issues, but many of them are more subjective in nature. Those that I have just mentioned are the more object problems.<br/><br/>Moving onto my subjective observations, the biggest problem with this film and the trilogy that it completes is that of identity crisis. Is it a folksy, personable adventure tale like the book, or is it a deadly serious epic like The Lord of the Rings? Is it an elegantly realized window into a poetic fantasy world like Peter Jackson's first Tolkien trilogy, or is it a wild 3D action adventure? Ultimately, it tries to be all of those things at once and so the whole is overly long and unwieldy, with a rotating sense of focus.<br/><br/>These films did get some individual things right. Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Luke Evens are wonderful in the roles of Bilbo, Thorin and Bard, respectively. The cast and acting were never problems, even with the meandering scripts. Smaug was a magnificent fantasy creation, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and brought to massive, fire-breathing life. It's no accident that the best scenes in the previous films were the ones with the dragon and Gollum, both of them taken almost directly from the book.<br/><br/>But I want to focus on the original character of Tauriel to point out how Peter Jackson's The Hobbit could have been a better story even if it didn't stick to the book verbatim. The book featured virtually no female characters. Fortunately, the films addressed that, but it is Tauriel (a made up character) who fits this story far, far, far better than Galadriel (a canon character and fan favorite on screen since The Fellowship of the Ring).<br/><br/>While Galadriel, Elrond, Saruman, Gandalf and Radagast are occupied with a story arc present almost entirely for the sole purpose of making The Hobbit resemble The Lord of the Rings in ways that the book never did, Tauriel's scenes are intimate and unpretentious, much like those of Bilbo Baggins. Say what one will about the Elf- Dwarf romance, but it was one of the most grounded and personable aspects of these past two films. Personally, I would have preferred a straight-up adaption of the source novel, in one film. However, I think that there was a missed opportunity here to expand the story into multiple films without losing the tone of the book, and Tauriel is the best example of how to do that in a way that is fresh and forward-thinking.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, these films were not for fans of the book. They were for fans of the Lord of the Rings films. In that sense, the failure of the Hobbit Trilogy is that it mistakenly supposes that those previous films succeeded on spectacle. In fact, they succeeded in the elegance of their execution, well-written stories brought to life by tasteful visuals. This time around, we were presented with an over-extended, thrown-together buildup to a full-throttle throwdown of unhinged action. Is that bad, in and of itself? It depends on the viewer. Not my thing, but I am not everyone.<br/><br/>If you loved An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug, then you will likely enjoy this one, as long as you can handle more nonstop action. That is the primary difference present in The Battle of the Five Armies."
"RforFilm","8","2","5","23 December 2014"," The Hobbit: Battle of the Fives Armies closes a clunky, but satisfying return to Middle Earth.
","I always hope that parents do their best to encourage their child to be an artist. All it takes is one good idea to expand into something big; something that's so masterful that the art itself becomes another world. This I refer to is Middle Earth of the Lord of the Rings books. J. R. R. Tolkien barley escaped death in WWI to start on The Hobbit, the beginning idea of something that was going to have life of it's own. The books have picked up cult status in the 1960's, but when the movies came out, the series had suddenly exploded into mainstream popularity. <br/><br/>The fan base has grown so large, then when The Hobbit trilogy was announced, the crowd was so hyped up that they assumed that they were going to receive more then a fantasy film; they were expecting something that was going to push what we call magic on the silver screen and even offer philosophical ideas we've never considered before. When the film consensus was good to just okay, I was surprised by much people have translated the idea of okay to really bad. That's certainly not that case; it's just that no matter what any Hobbit movie would pulled off, it was not going to match The Lord of the Rings. So let's take one last descent into Middle Earth with The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies. Beginning where the last movie left off, the dragon Smaug is now flying out of the Lonely Mountain to wreck havoc on Laketown. Two dwarfs are still down there while the rest and Bilbo are back within the mountain. Local townsman Bard manages to kill the dragon by striking it in it's one weak point, making for a great opening sequence. <br/><br/>Anyway, Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) has found the Arkenstone, the same thing that the dwarfs have been searching for among the dragon's treasure. The leader of the dwarfs, Thorin, has succumbed to the dragon sickness of greed and flat out refuses to share the treasure or even leave the mountain. This doesn't please the Elves, including Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom), and townsfolk of Laketown looking for shelter. At the same time, Gandalf the wizard (played by Ian McKellen) manages to escape his prison to warn the others of the incoming Orc army that also wants the treasure. It'll be hard to determine who will claim the mountain, but Bilbo may have a helping hand thanks to his new ring. <br/><br/>The Hobbit has finally ended and I think that this is that last time we'll venture into Middle Earth for a while (with Warner Brothers, of course it's never over). The road has been a bit bumpy but people seems to be satisfied enough with these movies, even if their not at good as The Lord of the Rings. Return of the King and Battle of the Five Armies are similar finales with a lot of action and plenty of goodbyes. Now which one is better?<br/><br/>It should be a no brainer that Return of the King did it masterful, so toping it was out of the question. But Battle of the Five armies really tries. For pure popcorn entertainment, I definitely got what I wanted. The action and look of the film all pay off is some CGI environments that Maleficent should have done. The cast here also continues to prevail, weather it's Bilbo as a conflicted coward, greedy dwarf Thorin, or a no nonsense wizard Gandalf. What's interesting is that Battle of the Five Armies shares the only flaw with Return of the King; and ending that takes too long to end. At least it's not as long, so it's not too much of a complaint.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Arkinstones out of ten. Desolation of Smaug was my favorite of the Hobbit movies, but this closes the book nicely as well. Those that don't like fantasy will not be swayed here, but I thin few people are going to hate this story. The Hobbit will probably not be as regarded as a masterpiece adaptation, but at most an interesting series of fantasy blockbusters."
"n_vasileiadis","8","2","5","23 December 2014"," So many negative comments for such a good movie...
","Since this movie has been released, I read many bad critics saying about the lack of plot, the attempt of Peter Jackson to extend the plot and to create 3 movies out of 1 book just for the money. Bu...it. The movie is great! The movie is as great as the lord of the rings movies with the only difference that the concept and the characters are not original anymore. So what? I had a great time watching this movie! There were no idle moments, no plot gaps, no other crap I was reading about. The battle scenes are great, there is drama, love, fear, greed and other states of mind when watching the movie. The acting was very good given the circumstances (you do not except shakespearean performance from Ian McKellen when killing an Orc...). It is unfair for this trilogy that the lord of the rings trilogy came first. It is also unfair for Peter Jackson to create such an epic movie and receive all this criticism based on prejudice. 3 movies out of 1 book? How can this be done? It can be done greatly when Tolkin is writing and Peter Jackson is producing."

","I rated the 1st and 2nd Hobbit movies a 9/10. They had slow parts and all, but they were visually stunning, fantastically directed and entertaining. Now, that I finally managed to go to my local cinema and watch The Battle of The Five Armies (in 3D ofc) all I can say: I can't imagine a better send-off to a really, really good trilogy. It has everything like the first two movies, but the most important thing is: it never takes it's time. The ending chapter is fast, and in some scenes, when you would think what the hell you just saw, the battle (And believe me, it's easily as good as the battles LotR had) takes another turn, with another -sadly- predictable twist that who or what will save Who.I won't even talk about the visuals and the musical scores, it's (like always in the Middle Earth saga) a 10 out of 10, and that's what's so catchy about this final adventure, besides the character development. 8/10"
"ad_upclose","9","2","5","22 December 2014"," Beautifully punctuates its association to the greater saga...
","The fifteen year middle-earth adventure helmed by Peter Jackson comes to a close in The Battle of the Five Armies. As an amalgamation of emotion and spectacle, this ranks high in the saga for me. The action highlight in the movie, as made evident from the title, is an immense climactic battle. But there is also a clash of a more mystical nature involving the older guardians of Middle-Earth, in Dol Guldor, that is short but spectacular. On a more human level, this final chapter features the profound tragedy missing in the LOTR trilogy. For the first time in a Middle-Earth movie there is no prologue as we straightaway witness Smaug the dragon's incredibly visualized assault on Laketown; an airborne dragon attack has never looked so magnificent. It is a brief but satiating appetizer for the adrenaline to get going. From there the movie changes gears to set-up a few things & allows the characters to take over. Bilbo (Freeman) and Thorin (Armitage) deliver some great moments. Looking back at all 6 films there is no doubt Bilbo will be remembered as the definitive Hobbit; he brings the character to life through copious expressions & mannerisms which add warmth to the role. In the previous films he shared great moments with Gollum and Smaug while here his notable scenes are in the presence of or in context to Thorin. The said dwarf king, consumed by greed, is also a memorable personification of an anti-hero. It's interesting to witness the trajectory his character goes through during the trilogy; from a single-minded steely determination to total disintegration. He manages to generate substantial empathy through this process. Most of the other important supporting characters get to shine in individual moments. Ryan Gage's role, as the cowardly Alfrid, was the bleak film's only comedic relief and he was unexpectedly excellent. Gandalf (Ian Mckellon) is incredible as usual and reinforces himself as my favorite character in all the 6 pieces of this wondrous adventure. Jackson also wonderfully weaves in smaller details & subplots in the film to connect the story to the world & time of LOTR. Gandalf's side-expedition, which was essentially nondescript in the book, gained traction in the middle film and now comes full circle with a brief but rousing finish. Some editing and missing through-lines suggest that fans will again need to rely on an inevitable extended edition for the definitive version of the film.<br/><br/>Aesthetically and in terms of scale, Peter Jackson forms a smaller but distinct looking final conflict from the two major battles of the LOTR films (Helm's Deep & Pelennor Fields). It is more logistical in nature and he captures it nicely using a floating virtual camera giving us appealing wide-angle shots. The chaotic clash takes place against the backdrop of the Lonely Mountain and on its snowy/frozen fringes making the battlefield an actual character. The amount of detail and individual heroic-character moments is abundant; for every over-the-top Legolas moment there are others that left me in admiration of the landscapes and battle-choreography on display. Also, the fact that there are tragic incidents in this conclusive chapter makes it leave an arguably greater emotional impact than any LOTR film. Looking back at the Hobbit trilogy it's hard for me not to look at these films through a haze of nostalgia. They are less complex and lesser as a result compared to LOTR trilogy. But they still feel transcendent & cinematic and the final delivers in terms of scale & emotional involvement.<br/><br/>Overall, Battle of the Five Armies beautifully punctuates its association to the greater Middle-Earth saga that follows. It also affectionately conveys a sense of completion to Bilbo's grand adventure. Jackson's ambition deserves to be lauded as he ends his Middle-Earth journey and for me, cinema will not be the same... well, at least December won't. <br/><br/>*I look forward to re-reviewing/re-grading the entire Hobbit trilogy after watching their definitive extended editions."
"squirrel_burst","7","2","5","22 December 2014"," Probably the weakest of the LOTR series, but still worth your time
","There's a lot of stuff I like in ""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"", and not just because it's another film set in J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful world of Middle Earth. There's also some things that make this a flawed film, perhaps, story-wise, the weakest of the three parts of the Hobbit movie. If you're not caught up with the series, you're out of luck because you won't understand a thing that's going on here. The story begins where it left off, with Smaug the dragon attacking Laketown. As Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is caught in the ensuing conflict caused partially because of Thorin Oakenshield's greed (Thorin played by Richard Armitage) and partially by the Necromancer's armies converging on the people of Middle Earth who are seeking refuge or riches in Erebor. One thing that shocked me with the advertising of the film is the amount of attention being given to Benedict Cumberbatch. If you're catching this movie to hear his terrific performance as Smaug you will be severely disappointed because he is not in the film a whole lot. This leads me into my biggest criticism of both this movie and of the trilogy overall. I reserved judgment on whether or not a single book could be split up into three movies until I saw all three films. Now, I'd say that there was enough material to make two films, not quite three. It's really obvious with the way the first half-hour this movie plays out that they really had to carefully choose where to put filler material in order to have three movies that ended on an exciting climax AND a cliff hanger. I can't go much into it, but you will wonder if some of the early developments of this film couldn't have been included in that second movie. BofFA, more than either of the other two films also falls into some of the trappings that plague prequels. I'm talking about people dropping names or pointing out locations just so you can go ""I get that reference!"" I've got just a few other criticisms, and then we're going to move onto what I liked about the film. My first complaint is because of the nature of this film's story, orcs are made to look like total chumps. Count how many battle-worthy characters we've got. Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Legolas, Bard, Tauriel, Thranduil, Dwaling, Balin, Kíli, Fíli, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur. If only half are involved in combat and given their time to shine, that's a huge amount of orcs that have to be killed solely to show off our heroes' skills. I thought that in many scenes, the legions of orcs were so easily dispatched that they might as well have been those idiotic robots from ""Star Wars: Episode I"". Finally, there's Ryan Gage as Alfrid, who is the most cartoonish, two-dimensional villains I've seen in any of these Middle Earth films. His role is pointless and should have been cut out to focus more on the main characters. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can talk about what works. What I really enjoyed is that even though this is the 6th film in the series, it still contains plenty of new sights. We've never witnessed what an army of Dwarfs looks like, or some of the creatures and locations in this film. I found that while some of the big battles in the story lacked impact, there was a lot of tension in the most personal moments of combat, particularly the mano-y-mano sequences with Bolg or Azog against our heroes. I found that the film really complimented the other films very well in terms of scale and spectacle. If you have the fortune of watching these films in chronological order, you will see a great progression in terms of sweeping character arcs and a real escalation in the threats of the opponents and in the battles that are fought. The visuals in the film are once again grandiose and it never felt like anything here was just a rehash of the earlier moments in the series. I found that there were more than a few really powerful and tense moments, even when no one was fighting. Particularly in the way that Thorin's character is focused on during the film, I was excited to see his character change over time and I was scared when his personality changed for the darker. There are some very nice subtle moments where you can spot the tiniest hints of where characters will ultimately go once the LOTR comes around and they felt very organic. I do feel like it is a satisfying conclusion and even more important, it makes you excited to watch both the previous films so that you can get the whole story of Bilbo Baggins in one fell swoop and that it awakened an incredible desire in me to marathon the other Lord of the Rings films. Overall I would say that this trilogy isn't nearly as good as the films that follow it, but it does a good job of tying together two stories that are widely different in tone. I had several problems with ""Battle of the Five Armies"", but ultimately I did enjoy it. My suggestion to really relish the film is to watch at least ""The Desolation of Smaug"" in the 24 hours preceding your viewing of this film. That high you get from seeing Smaug finally take flight will get you excited to see the big opening here and you will be able to fully immerse yourself in the best parts of BotFA, which are the subtle hints of what is yet to come, the personal moments between the characters we've seen evolve over time and the satisfying final showdown between the heroes and the villains. ""Battle of the Five Armies"" is flawed, but it's an epic fantasy film that wraps this larger-than-life series nicely. (3-D theatrical version on the big screen, December 18, 2014)"
"annalevit","7","2","5","21 December 2014"," Entertainment - Yes, Tolkien - No
","I think by the third time around it should have been clear to just about everyone that the Hobbit movies bear very little resemblance to the books. Hardly any character was left unchanged, and the concept of the world of Middle-earth itself and what makes it tick... though it did follow the main turning points of the plot.<br/><br/>As Martin Freeman said in his interview to the Empire Magazine, it was either psychological thriller or a slapstick comedy - and for me it was definitely slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>The prologue, which showed burning of the Esgaroth and the slaying of Smaug by Bard the Bowman was not slapstick - but then again, it was just the prologue. It did not set the tone for the movie, which had endless Legolas fighting laws of physics tricks, clichéd dialog and love triangles with an impossible love twist, unnecessary detours, and comic relief both as intended by Peter Jackson and where it was not, but grew naturally out of ridiculousness of it all. However, because I have taught myself to forget about canon when watching the films, I enjoyed it a lot my first time around. I laughed a lot, I applauded when Azog jumped out from under the ice...<br/><br/>If you liked Desolation of Smaug, I think you will like Battle of the Five Armies too - it has the same pure entertainment quality to it, like a video game or an amusement park ride, but unlike Desolation of Smaug, I never felt the movie drag and wasn't tempted to look at my watch.<br/><br/>What it does lack is the coherent plot development, and especially the closure of multiple plot lines. So we are left hanging as to the fate of Erebor, the fate of the Arkenstone, etc. In a way, it feels like LotR spin off/fanfiction in terms of not being able to stand on its own. More LotR movies than the book Hobbit on which it is primarily based. I highlight that, because tout as they might the ""Appendices"", there is hardly anything borrowed from there. It is basically the Hobbit book and the screenwriters' imagination."
"bakchu","8","2","5","21 December 2014"," Entertaining, though there's something missing...
","As a whole, Jackson's ""Hobbit"" trilogy suffers from over-stretching: From a book of 271 pages, you just can't create a three-part movie saga of a similar length as ""Lord of the Rings"" without quite a lot of stretching. Jackson does this with drawn-out battle sequences and adding some plot elements entirely of his (and the other scriptwriters') making. As a person who first read ""The Hobbit"" in childhood and is still very fond of the book, I think the first part of Jackson's version nonetheless is a beautiful adaptation, reasonably close to the book and well paced. I have criticized the second part, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", for going too far in its story-stretching approach. To some extent, that can be said of this third part as well. Still, I think it's better able to keep the viewer's attention and it has some astonishing visuals (as well as some that look rather like they belong into a video game...). The acting is fine, Howard Shore's music fitting as usual.<br/><br/>Yet: I wonder why Jackson, with all this need to fill a long film with content, left out an important scene from the book: After all, the Arkenstone story line is pretty central, isn't it? Thorin's yearning for the Arkenstone, treasuring it above everything else, and Bilbo's attempt to use it as a means of reconciliation. In the book, Thorin fittingly is buried with his Arkenstone - and Orcrist, the sword the Elves had taken from him. In the movie, not only is Thorin's burial left out completely (we just get a short scene of the dwarfs mourning at the dead body), but the viewer is also left to wonder what became of the Arkenstone. It's as if everyone has completely forgotten the wondrous gem at the end. I think that must seem strange even to those who haven't read Tolkien's book: Making much ado about that gem, only to never mention it again after the battle? I can only assume (or hope) that an extended edition of the movie will probably contain Thorin's burial, thus giving the story a better rounding. Also, some elements aren't used to their full potential, most notably the ""were-worms""... they appear to be quite a threat, but after a few seconds of screen time, we never see them or hear of them again. Having said all that, I think it's an entertaining movie and I even give it a star more than the preceding one..."
"KrazzyDJ","8","2","5","21 December 2014"," The last of Middle-Earth
","In a certain sense, The Battle Of The Five Armies could very well be to The Hobbit series what The Matrix Revolutions was to The Matrix Trilogy. With a battle occupying the center of the film and the title, chances of there being less story to tell abound. And after viewing the movie, I can understand why critics don't really like it.<br/><br/>From a critics' point of view, the movie has all that makes them cringe. It has an overabundance of visual effects in an attempt to recreate the epic battles of Jackson's prior trilogy. It has that clichéd love angle / triangle. It has deaths where every death appears a melodrama in itself. It has more connections to the Lord Of The Rings than you can count, effectively making it as a bridge film rather than a standalone one.<br/><br/>But then, I'm not a critic. And so, despite all of the above being true in a way, I still enjoyed the film. Yes the movie has a lot of visual effects and clichéd moments. But courtesy Jackson, the clichés manage to make an impact and the effects still appear spectacular. And this, in an age where CGI has made it notoriously difficult to please audiences is a great achievement. Yes, the deaths appear melodramatic. But having been with the characters since the last two films, they also touch you. Yes there are connections to the decade old Middle-Earth trilogy. But these connections only deepen the impact of every scene by making you realize what lies ahead.<br/><br/>Jackson was right when he said this film moves almost like a thriller. The editing is tight, the effects are a spectacle (it would be a shame to watch this first on a laptop / desktop and not on a big screen), and the music almost feels like the culmination of a six-film saga that began a decade ago. Howard Shore masterfully mixes different themes connecting this not only to the previous movies but to the Lord Of The Rings movies as well.<br/><br/>It was always my desire to see the first trilogy in theaters, something which I never got to do. With the Hobbit films, I have at least been able to witness Middle-Earth on the big screen. This may very well be Jackson's final foray into Middle-Earth and for this reason alone, if nothing else, it is worth seeing. Now let's hope Warner plans a Lord Of The Rings re-release in 3D."
"JTurner82","8","2","5","20 December 2014"," Uneven but overall solid closing chapter for Bilbo and company.
","The first thing I should mention about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, is that in order to truly enjoy this film you have to be prepared to come to terms that this is not meant to be a standalone movie, but the final act of a story. Because each of these movies are meant to be viewed together as a single unit, viewing this without seeing the first two parts is not recommended. Tolkien purists will also find plenty to carp at for the occasional additions and liberties Jackson chooses to take. If, however, you're prepared to accept all of that, then it's much easier to appreciate the movie at face value.<br/><br/>THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES starts off with a thunderously explosive bang as Smaug takes out his fiery rage on the village of Laketown. This spectacularly staged sequence is nothing short of visceral as we see buildings topple and others torched by the dragon's fiery breath. Everything about this scene all the way up to the climactic showdown between heroic Bard (Luke Evans) and Smaug (who gets to have several new lines) is magnificent, and arguably the highlight of the movie. The story takes a more slower but essentially darker turn, however, as the once proud Thorin Oakshield (Richard Armitage) becomes greedy and refuses to part with any share of the gold in his now reclaimed home. Naturally, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) doesn't take too kindly to this and, in an act of daring defiance, hands over the Arkenstone to the Elf King in order to prevent a bloodbath. This and Thorin's paranoia strain their friendship and ultimately build to what Jackson promised to be the longest battle ever committed to screen. And long the battle of the five armies itself truly is, taking up a good forty-five minutes of the film's 144-minute duration. (Ironically, this is the shortest of the Middle Earth movies!)<br/><br/>In between that and en route, there are other positives to this final chapter. The dynamic between Thorin and Bilbo is powerfully presented, with Freeman and Armitage both providing strong, emotionally charged performances. The chemistry between the two is very powerful, and arguably the real heart of the movie. Indeed, it makes the final parting scene between them all the more heartbreaking and misty-eyed. Armitage also does an expert job of portraying Thorin's conversion to an avaricious tyrant -- at some points his voice melds with that of Smaug's, providing for a rather chilling and frightening effect. This change of character culminates with Thorin having a nightmarish vision of being swallowed by the gold he craves; a somewhat surreal but nonetheless very effective scene.<br/><br/>The performances in THE HOBBIT have always been among the strongest points of this trilogy. Aside from Freeman and Armitage, Evans is a very charismatic and instantly likable Bard, and the addition of him having a family of similar strength provides the character with an arguably greater dynamic both for taking down the beast. He is easily another hero to root for, as are returnees Ian MacKellen as the wizard Gandalf, Hugo Weaving as the elvish Lord Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Christopher Lee also gets to show off some real fighting stunts in his return as Saruman. Billy Connelly, although mostly seen on a CGI-rendered pig and wielding an unrealistically huge sledgehammer, is a pleasant new addition to the cast as Thorin's uncle.<br/><br/>For all its positives, though, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't without its faults. Although most of it is just excessive nitpicking on my part, there were several bits that I felt could have been handled differently. Although the battle between the armies itself is dramatically staged for the most part, there were times when I felt disconnected from it, not necessarily because of the onslaught of CGI characters. Legolas' heroic action stunts such as catching a ride on the talons of a bat, slaying said bat with his arrow, and dodging falling bricks like Super Mario also border on goofiness. Even his antics in the LOTR trilogy weren't as ""cartoonish"". The climactic showdown between Thorin and the nasty Orc Azgog is also too drawn out to have any major emotional impact one way or the other. (That said, the final parting from Bilbo and Thorin that follows this showdown takes the movie's emotional heart back on track.) I'm also unclear about the love triangle between the she-elf Tauriel, the young dwarf Kili, and Legolas. Although all three actors involved play it well, and the resolution is indeed heartbreaking, it doesn't feel very necessary to the momentum of the story and I do question why Jackson thought to include it. Admittingly, Tauriel is a pretty cool character, but again, her presence feels extraneous at times, as if there needed to be a heroine. Probably the only really useless character is Alfrid, a corrupt town official who, aside from having a getaway disguised as a woman, is otherwise a fairly forgettable character.<br/><br/>But these are only minor negatives. Everything else about THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES excels; the production values are as top notch as you'd expect from Jackson, Weta, and company, Howard Shore's score is, as usual, magnificent, and as mentioned, the casting and performances are all spot-on. Aside from the opening and the dynamic between Frodo and Thorin, the other major highlight of this last chapter is the ending. It is brilliantly done and faithful to the book, concluding with a very clever lead-in to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING as the older Bilbo (Ian Holm) goes to greet Gandalf for the first time in years as the camera slowly trucks in on the map before the closing credits begin.<br/><br/>For all that, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, although sketchier than one might expect, is still worth a good recommendation and ranks as a solid final chapter overall."

","For a movie highly anticipated after a good build up from the desolation of Smaug i found this move to be very disappointing. I found the CGI poor the humor cringing. The beginning of the movie held promise but was a let down, the main event everyone was waiting for was lackluster and not enough screen time. As for the acting i felt it was fine except for the poor humor. In conclusion i feel the hobbit trilogy was bloated and lacking interesting scenes and would not return to this trilogy as often as the lord of the rings trilogy. Leaving the theater i heard i was not the only one who felt this, i spoke to another viewer who also said he was disappointed with the climax of a major blockbuster trilogy with a precedent that was lord of the rings as a comparison."

","I actually went to see it twice already, the first time at the premiere and the second time this week. The first time I thought it was hilarious, a great comedy - but maybe it was because I was affected by the overall emotion around me - so many happy people, meeting the actors, etc. I couldn't wait to see it again because I enjoyed it so much. The second time it was not bad, but not nearly as good. It doesn't drag, but it doesn't have the substance. And worst of all, it doesn't tie all the loose ends. It's basically one long CGI battle interspersed with gags and some dramatic scenes, some of which feel right, some are just plain out of place in this movie. And then it's over, with only two of the many themes developed in the three movies actually finding some closure. So definitely worth watching, but I wouldn't see it more than once, it doesn't have the substance for it, and jokes that are funny the first time feel kind of stale and shallow when repeated."
"daniell san","6","2","5","18 December 2014"," looks great, story not so...
","First off, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. I didn't think it was great, but it was enjoyable. I had problems with the second movie though. Especially the final scene in the mountain kept dragging on. And this is the first thing that bugged me of this third Hobbit movie. The entire Smaug storyline could have been wrapped up at the end of the second movie. The opening scene with Smaug only lasted a few minutes. They could have kept the final scene of the Desolation of Smaug shorter, thereby making it more interesting, and added the demise of Smaug to the second movie and even have time to set up things for this third movie as a cliff hanger of some sorts.<br/><br/>Now, about this third movie. Overall the movie had great visuals. I did have some problems though. In the first scenes with legolas his face looked like it was cgi or something. There was something very off with him. The same goes for the face of Dain. It kind of looked like bad console game cgi. Other than that, I really enjoyed the look of the movie. The landscapes were beautiful. The details in the armours looked great. <br/><br/>The story was lacking though. It really shows that the source material wasn't enough for 3 movies. The story could have been told in a better way in just 2 movies. I also had a problem with how the writers tried to connect this story with the Lord of the Rings, by mentioning the Strider to Legolas...That's just bad writing.<br/><br/>I also found that the movie was lacking in suspense. The battles looked great, but there wasn't really any feel of suspense in them.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't bad, but there are better ways to spend your time..."

No she ended up falling in love with a dwarf that was half her size. (Granted he was pretty good looking, but still. Irrelevant).<br/><br/>Secondly. The CGI. What? Why? Why so much? And why so bad? But then it occurred to me that this was made for 3D, maybe they need that much crappy CGI for 3D movies. I don't know. My area is in makeup and special effect makeup, not CGI. Now, that goes for all three movies. The dragon was the least crappy (I thought it looked pretty good!) They should have spent the same amount of time on all the other CGI, that they did on the dragon, to make it even more visually stunning. But no, they had to split this 300 page book into 3 decent looking movies (money of course, why not)=When they could have made one or two amazing looking movies. <br/><br/>The acting was wonderful as always. The actors they had were amazing and did a fabulous job, I'm so glad that they used great actors to redeem themselves of poor CGI. <br/><br/>The humor did not bother me too much, although I felt they could have had less of it. I think it lightened it too much. Middle Earth is supposed to be dark and dreary. It had its dark and dreary moments, like when Thorin had his sickness (done very well). It was the same director, I wish he had stuck with the same feel as the other movies. I don't know what was so different, but it didn't feel like middle earth. Felt like some other place. The orcs weren't as scary or gross (probably because they did CGI instead of makeup artists on people) It's a sad day when CGI is better than special effects makeup. *Sigh* Takes away from the art of movies. <br/><br/>I was very happy that they ended it with one of the opening scenes from the fellowship of the ring *applause*. Ties it together very well. <br/><br/>They didn't explain what happened to the Stone or to the Elf Kings Jewels. I mean why? Why didn't you elaborate on that? Instead you dwell on the annoying forbidden-romeo-and-Juliet type romance between Killi and Tauriel. Since when was the relevant? They aren't Aragorn and Arwen. Just stop trying. Nothing can beat them. Nothing at all. <br/><br/>Overall, great movie (and movies) If you don't compare any of them to the book and just look at them as separate-nothing-to-do-with-the-book movies, they are pretty darn good. Visually stunning and goose-bump worthy movies. Wonderful movie score as well! I got goose-bumps just watching them all and will watch them all again and again and again. But still not as good as the original three! I'm going to go watch a movie now. <br/><br/>Props to Peter Jackson for making three movies in three years that all pertain to the Hobbit book. I am shocked that he pulled it off and that they are all pretty darn great. Thank you for adding to the Middle Earth movies! My life is now complete! My favorite books on screen!"
"meg-gjevori","9","2","5","17 December 2014"," A worthy farewell to Middle Earth...
","I think the Hobbit BOFA was easily the best of the three, and captures the vibe of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This movie was the most ambitious of the 3 because it also has to be the bridge between the Hobbit and LOTR and in my opinion it did exactly that. <br/><br/>First of all the hobbit book was a beautiful child story but a child story nonetheless and without adding all the stuff that Peter did i think a decent movie could not be made. I mean in the book we only know the name of the dwarfs and not a single thing about their character(except thorin) to actually care for them, and that's where i think this movie shines, We know Balin is the wisest, Dwalin the best warrior, Fili left the company for his brother, Kili likes eleven maids, we saw that in Rivindell and in Mirkwood he fell in love with Tauriel which makes his death even more dramatic. <br/><br/>There were many awesome-goosebumps scenes, only to mention a few. Bard used his son as a crossbow (i mean how cool is that), reminding him that had he failed to hit the target, would result in his children's death. Elves passing over the dwarven phalanxes, that awesome troll that used a huge stone in his head to break down the walls, The dwarfs charging out of Erebor, Legolas being Legolas and most notably Fili, Kili and Thorin's death.<br/><br/>I think Peter displays his qualities as a director managing to always keep you at the edge of your seat, the beautiful battle choreography, (catapult trolls!!) but also manages to make the battle feel very intimate. There was in some cases too much CGI but it made orcs look more threatening than ever especially bolg's body guards, in Lotr they were too slow. Howard Shore does his job brilliantly with a soundtrack that deserves an academy award also the acting was as solid as ever especially Evans,Freeman, Armitage and also Graham McTavish as Dwalin.<br/><br/>Although the film left so many unresolved things like Dain's coronation (which will be in the extended edition, the soundtrack is proof of that), they couldn't have found a better ending than gandalf knocking in bag end's door at bilbo 111 birthday, it was very emotional.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie and the whole trilogy is better than the book and no other director would do it nowhere near as good as Peter did. It's a worthy farewell to Middle Earth!"

"Harhaluulo54","7","2","5","15 December 2014"," Someone here asked if this is what the fans deserve.
","Without actually reading any further of this comment, I concluded (with 96% certainty, mind you) that we are talking about fans of the LoTR universe. In which case, I have to say I don't consider myself a fan, but knowing fans, and hearing that this doesn't follow the source material accurately, I have to come to the conclusion that no, this is not what the fans deserve. If, however, we are talking about people who are fans of movies and TV series, the medium in generally, then my answer is a 100% yes. <br/><br/>There are two things in this movie which annoyed me. The character development of Thorin Oakenshield and the melodramatic writing. In all honesty, I can forgive these due the outcomes. Due the deaths. I have considered LoTR a children's book ever since Gandalf supposedly died, but came back alive after all. What a waste of a great death. The last Hobbit shows what I appreciate the most; balls. Balls to kill off characters, balls to out-write cast without any need for it, other than good writing, because let's face it, unneeded happiness is never memorable. <br/><br/>Now is the point where I say that I never actually even watched Hobbit for the story nor plot. I watched it for the cinematography, production values and simply entertainment. The landscapes are glorious, fight between the mountains was visually stunning. Same with tons of scenes, not just with action scenes, but simply scenes where camera is just moving and showing us the scenery. We got to see something exactly what a fantasy world should look like and boy it is prettier than ever. <br/><br/>The pacing gets my praising. It is even smoother as my awkward rhymes! 2.5 hours rarely go past this fast. There was not a moment that bored me, there was hardly anything that annoyed me, the ride was simply entertaining and that's all I ever asked from it. Since we got to see some good death too, the movie was simply a positive surprise from my part. Aftertaste; great. Worth every penny."
"PyroSikTh","6","2","5","12 December 2014"," A Worthy, if Flawed, Finale
","I put my hand up as one of the minority that actually supported the idea of three movies. More Middle Earth the better, especially if it's padded out with loads of extra background information and sets up the events of Lord of the Rings. By Desolation of Smaug, I had changed my mind. It was full of unnecessary scenes that could well have been cut, and the cliffhanger at the end needed resolution. So how did this extra third film pan out?<br/><br/>Still a mixed bag if I'm honest. The first ten minutes are the last ten minutes of what Desolation of Smaug should've been. It brings closure to that movie enabling us to carry on with this one. If I had good enough video editing software and skills, I'd seriously consider splicing it back into Desolation for future enjoyment, making it a complete movie with a beginning, middle, and end. Anyway, this means Battle of Five Armies has an end, a beginning, a middle, and another end. It's too much, especially seeing as it's already pretty much a two hour fight scene. Adding another fight scene in at the beginning means you're tired of the destruction by the time we actually get to the meat of the movie.<br/><br/>That's not to say there's no plot though. There's certainly enough, even if it does take up the whole first act. Thorin is driven mad by the riches he has won back, and his obsession with the arkenstone leaves him in a dark place. Meanwhile news has spread and the humans, elves, and orcs all want a piece of the mountain for one reason or another. Away from all that we revisit Gandalf and the White Council has they finally discover the identity of the Necromancer (spoiler, it's Sauron). This particular scene was probably the highlight for me as it teased much deeper concepts and mythology surrounding Middle Earth. Once all this is out the way though, it's literally two hours of these five armies fighting each other. Well all right, that's a bit of an exaggeration as the third act completely leaves the battle behind (and I mean completely, while it's still raging in the background) to focus on the more personal struggle between Thorin and Azog, and each of the entourages. After that's all dealt with, we rush to an end to bridge the two trilogies together, leaving more than a handful of loose ends (like, what happened to all the gold they were fighting over for the entire movie?)<br/><br/>There's a lot of other things that annoyed me about Battle of Five Armies as well. Unfortunately the cringeworthy Kili/Tauriel romance is carried over and reaches peak cringe. Why Jackson thought that was a good idea is completely beyond me. Similarly the movie is plagued by Alfrid, who you may or may not remember as the Master of Lake Town's right-hand man. Why he gets any focus at all is completely beyond me. He should've been forgotten, or at least saved for the Extended cut. The film's biggest sin, however, was the constant last-minute-saviour. Seriously, take a shot every time someone got saved at the last minute and you'd be paralytic by the halfway point. When I say it's constant, I'm honestly not exaggerating. Almost every one-on-one battle ends with one, and there's a lot of one-on-one battles, often happening simultaneously. To balance it out there are a few deaths of main characters, but they're shocking only because you've gotten so used to saviours swooping in all the time.<br/><br/>The visuals are unsurprisingly amazing, and in much the same vein as the previous Hobbit films. It can get a bit much here and there, but overall I didn't find it got in the way of enjoyment of the film at all. The highlight of the effects were undoubtedly the pre-Ringwrath bearers of the nine rings of men. Never have I seen ghosts/spirits put to film so believably. They're clear and see- through, and yet definitely present; they're detailed and identifiable. I think the 3D helped them come alive as well, not because of the 3D, but because of the side effect you often get where text gets a subtle blurred shadow behind it. In this instance it actually benefited from that side effect.<br/><br/>Acting was also pretty top-notch. Martin Freeman absolutely owns it. He's the same Bilbo he's always been, but he brings much more depth this time around, especially when he mourns the death of a certain character. I wasn't feeling particularly sad about it until his grieving, and then I was like 'damn, that's actually really sad. Poor Bilbo'. His extra little nuances are completely on point. Richard Armitage was also pretty great, especially as he got to play around with Thorin's darker side. We really did see another dimension, not just of Thorin's character, but also of Armitage's acting. I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot more of him in the future. Also Ian McKellan, Cate Blanchet, Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee, no matter how big or small their roles, show us why they're the veterans.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies is a worthy closure to The Hobbit trilogy, but that's not saying a lot. I'm not a big naysayer of the trilogy, as I quite enjoyed aspects of every movie (and have rated them accordingly), but none of them hold a flame up to even the weakest of the Lord of the Rings movies. As enjoyable as they are, there's just too many things wrong with them. I give The Battle of the Five Armies a good, but not amazing 7/10."
"vistheindian","7","2","5","15 December 2014"," Delivers only on the title
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After the events of Desolation of Smaug, the dragon unleashes his wrath upon the people of Laketown. Thorin reclaims his kingdom, but is consumed by an obsession for all the gold under the mountain. Meanwhile, rest of the Middle-earth races turn their envious eyes towards Erebor. Each of them aiming to exploit its riches, leading to an epic battle that will alter the future of Middle-earth. This movie is the epic conclusion to the Hobbit story, and the name is fitting. There is a grand scale to the battle, and the stakes are high. However, it did not quite strike the balance between action and drama. In the end, Battle of Five Armies is a fitting end to the series of movies and is a great cinematic vision, but as a standalone there is much to be desired in the quieter moments.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, sitting through a 12 hour marathon on more than one occasion. So when the Hobbit movie was announced I was excited to return to Middle-earth. Then it was announced that the movie would be split into a trilogy. I really don't like when a story is split, and the problems that come with that decision is most pronounced with The Battle of the Five Armies. Nevertheless I had an enjoyable time watching the movie.<br/><br/>When the title is The Battle of the Five Armies, it had better deliver on some epic battles, and it does. It's really interesting to see the motives of each of the armies (for some more in detail than others). Seeing how the battle unfolds, the uneasy alliances, clashing of dwarfs, orcs, goblins, humans, elves certainly had me at awe multiple times. This is a cinematic spectacle that should be experienced on the big screen. Also there was no weak link in the performances, but that is expected by now in the sixth film of this universe.<br/><br/>It is strange that I overall liked the film but my positives for the film only include the scale of the battle and the actors. Beyond those two aspects there are actually quite a lot of problems with the movie, and as I mentioned this is all because The Hobbit story has been split into the three films. You already know that all good stories have a beginning, a tension building middle, a climax, and then a resolution. Since The Battle of the Five Armies is the third movie of a singular story, we only get the climax and resolution. This means that the majority of the runtime is spent only on the battle. As beautiful as those scenes were to experience, I must say at one point it all becomes a cacophony of mindless sword slashing. As a result you start to lose any care of what is happening on the screen. I like the scale, just not the length of time spent on it. That leaves the quiet character moments in the movie to pick up the emotional weight to make us care again. Unfortunately these were also too few and far between once the battle starts. Especially if you haven't seen Desolation of Smaug since last year's release, these scenes might be even less effective because the wait between the movies depreciated the natural progression of the character relationships.<br/><br/>If I were to judge The Battle of the Five Armies just on its own merits, disregarding the two movies I'd rate it quite low. Yet I will admit that as a conclusion to the trilogy as a whole, this movie does a decent enough job. If you want to get the best out of the film I strongly recommend you to re-watch both An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"elwin_o","6","2","5","14 December 2014"," A mixed bag of feelings
","I came into this movie with pretty high expectations, after having liked the first one more than everyone else and really liking the second one apart from some goofy moments. However, when I walked out of the cinema, I couldn't help being disappointed in this movie. I've got the feeling Peter Jackson was like: ""But the movie still needs this, and this, and all that too!"", sometimes it pays of, but most of the time it just feels tacked on because he could. Also the amount of references this movie makes to the Lord of the Rings is just too much, as if no one knew about those movies and we needed to be reminded every few minutes. But the biggest problem I had with this movie is that, at quite a few occasions, this movie felt like a parody of the Lord of the Rings, and not like it's own movie. Like it didn't know if it wants to follow the dark tone of the Lord of the Rings or the lighter tone that the book has.<br/><br/>SPOILER PART: Alfrid pretty much sums up all that's bad about this movie: he's laughably bad and so irritating I wished he would just die in the opening scene. The comic relief in this movie was timed really badly in my opinion (or it was just bad and not meant to be funny). Thorin's death however, was a scene that really got me and saved the movie for me. The battle scenes aren't as good as the Lord of the Rings, but they're still pretty good a few things aside. The ending was also pretty good, with finally a good reference to the Lord of the Rings. So if you're a fan I would definitely go see it for yourself and be your own judge."
"adambattioui","7","2","5","13 December 2014"," Probably the worst of the trilogy but still a good film
","I initially had high expectations for this film, but I had seen a lot of reviews saying it was the worst and I refused to believe it. There were some good bits, like the relationship between Thorin and Bilbo. It also tried to be a bit of a comedy, it really shouldn't have been, yes it is aimed at a younger audience, yes here were some funny bits, but honestly no one gives a dam about Alfred. Also wasn't really the best ending, with the Return of the King they had multiple endings which explained what happened with the characters and was a satisfying end, whereas it sort of just ended. Also parts in the trailer that weren't in the film, really annoyed me. But I'm the extended edition will be better."
"nmanfredi","9","3","10","16 January 2015"," The jewel of the three. An outstanding closure.
","As far as The Hobbit's movies go, I would say this movie is by much the best one in the series. Not only it managed to catch the essence of Tolkien's most personal thoughts –the certainty of death and the pain that comes by watching a friend as he/she dies– but also introduced some lasting innovations that were not seen in the Lord of The Rings saga. I do not mean by this that Peter Jackson has in any way surpassed his previous take on Tolkien, being that the Lord of The Rings trilogy is my all-time favorite trilogy –and the same goes for many people–, but I do mean he has allowed his cast to express certain emotions and desires in ways that he could not achieve in the Rings' movies.<br/><br/>The first novelty would no doubt be the madness and ill-thoughts that overwhelm Thorin's mind. The close up to a sick man's thoughts and desires that are to his mind entirely reasonable –because of his being astray, of course- permits us to delve into that realm of fear, passion and anger. We constantly play sane. We feel we can control our lives and emotions, but more often than not we just lose it and become controlled by our own thoughts. Thorin's ""dragon sickness"" is nothing more than a depiction of one of those instances in which we shouldn't called ourselves ""sane"" or ""reasonable"", but one that has been constructed so perfectly that his reminiscence has come to last.<br/><br/>The second one would be the manner in which Peter Jackson portrayed Elves this time around. In The Ring's trilogy we saw them as guardians of the forest, as caring, loving protectors which, although they could be deadly if they felt threatened, as soon as that barrier was taken down they became pleasant folk. In Tolkien's books, this could certainly be said about Rivendell Elves and perhaps about most of Lothlorien's, but never about Mirkwood Elves. Never before were Elves represented best than in this movie. Tolkien always though of them as haughty, greedy, selfish and unforgiving folk, and Peter Jackson nailed it with Lee Pace's depiction of Thranduil. At the start of the movie, he does not care about matters involving other races –especially Dwarfs–, so he shows his worst face. But after the tragic events that follow he becomes somewhat reasonable, growing above his own true-self.<br/><br/>Last but not least, there is the character of Bilbo. At the beginning of the first movie, he was a shy ""forgive me"" and ""sorry"" hobbit who thought adventures were of very bad taste and never had dreamed about becoming an adventurer himself. This time around, and for the joy of those of us who love ""The Hobbit"" book, Martin Freeman has made a progression in his representation of Bilbo exactly in the way that Tolkien tells us in the book. He goes from shy to brave, and from asking permission to taking the initiative. Overall, he becomes the hero of the story, for the joy of Thorin's company and ours alike.<br/><br/>In a sense, every part of this movie felt exactly right –unless you are one of those who constantly complain about the three movie-one book stuff, and can't move beyond that scheme- while bringing innovation at the same time. The terrifying spirit of Sauron, the most feared foe of Middle-earth, vanishing from the reach of Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel and giving rise to a new era of chaos is one of those jewels the movie gives us for our own delight. And I only just revealed a glimpse of what the movie offers. By all accounts, if you are an all-time Tolkien fan or even if you are not, but you loved the Lord of The Rings trilogy, this is a movie you shouldn't miss. This is a movie that will make you watch The Ring's saga again because it constantly remembers us of whence it came. And that's just a joy to experience. Take it from me, go watch the movie and you will not be disappointed in the least."
"NEO-from-the-MATRIX","10","3","10","21 December 2014"," What we need next : Extended cuts and ULTIMATE CUTS
","On the HOBBIT BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES :<br/><br/>Great movie, but the third movie (Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies) is way too short! Really, incredibly, too short! The resolutions are too abrupt and the ending is too quick. It misses some key scenes : one important funeral, reconstruction of Lake-Town with Bard as it's new master (or some kind of ending for Bard), Thranduil's white jewels, more Beorn and more White Council (which is a cameo really, not a payoff). It clearly needs more character-driven scenes. Ah and what about the Arkenstone?<br/><br/>Also, Bilbo's departure from Erebor seemed cold and distant to me, as was the last scene between Gandalf and Bilbo.<br/><br/>I hope the 35 minutes of extended scenes Peter Jackson promised will solve that (but even 35 minutes seem insufficient to me). Hope PJ will inject some of the ''multiple ending'' style from the Return of the King to Battle of the five Armies. We NEED to have proper endings for the main characters like Bard, Thranduil, Thorin, Balin (master of MORIA) and also for Saruman,Radagast, Gandalf etc. <br/><br/>On LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY :<br/><br/>We want to see those deleted scenes, unused for the Extended edition of LOTR, be put back into the movies, in the next Ultimate Edition : <br/><br/><ul><li>Fellowship of the Ring :additional footage from the Battle of the Last Alliance (and maybe add Lee Pace's Thranduil into it), an extended Council of Elrond (dialogue from the Council of Elrond, such as Gandalf explaining how Sauron forged the One Ring) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Two Towers : Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothlórien, Conversation between Elrond and Arwen in a library in Rivendell, after Arwen decides to wait for Aragorn. Elrond leaves saying ""You gave away your life's grace. I cannot protect you anymore"" </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Return of the King : further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral. Also, to give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned Théodred. The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography.</li></ul><br/><br/>Peter Jackson already have stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future ""Ultimate Edition"" home video release, also including out-takes. Also, he recently had a great idea, namely to put some of the Hobbit's characters into the LOTR, as he mentioned in this recent interview: "" I actually think the young girls are going to start watching this 1, 2, 3 and they're going to start wondering where Tauriel is. We're really three or four years away from eight and nine year-old discovering these movies and watching them in this order and will be wondering why she doesn't show up in ""Lord of the Rings."" Maybe we'll get Evangeline down to New Zealand, shoot a bunch of stuff, chop it up and put it into a box set. "" <br/><br/>It would be great if he would be able to revisit the cut of all 6 movies in the near future, do an ""ultimate cut"" of the 6 movies and integrate those scenes I mentioned back in the movies (instead of bonuses or deleted scenes). Peter Jackson should also be able to re- shoot the ""Bilbo finding the Ring"" scene from Fellowship of the ring, remake Gollum from the shadowy scene from Fellowship, add more Balrog vs Gandalf fight, integrate Thranduil in the Battle of the Last Alliance, etc. Thanks!"

And this latest sequel concludes perfectly so that those of us who don't play offended with Peter's presentation will enjoy hours of re-viewing the whole in the comfort of their home in a not too distant future. Many of the reviewers tend to play experienced critics and their comments feel so unrelated to the actual fantastic presentation of any and all of the movies that I can only think that they can play the mortified to their heart's content but at least they mostly all paid to see this magnificent cinematographic experience and it serves Peter Jackson very well.

","After having read a little about this final installment of The Hobbit Trilogy and knowing that some liberties were taken with the characters and story line, I was setting myself up for some disappointment. Perhaps because my last reading of the books is so far distant, the faithfulness to the original story issue didn't didn't bother me all that much. Beginning with the defeat of Smaug and on to the epic battle of Dol Guldur, the movie kept my attention and in a state of anticipation as to how Thorin (Richard Armitage) would free himself of the dragon madness. Thorin Oakenshield was clearly the preeminent adventurer here and Armitage did a masterful job of brooding his way through the sinister side of his character. It's rather astonishing that with the word 'Hobbit' in the title, Martin Freeman didn't have a larger role here as the master burglar Bilbo Baggins. All the supporting actors credited themselves well, with special mention of the one character who shouldn't have been here, but was. Though Tolkien purists will refuse to accept the elf warrior Tauriel as part of the story line, I thought Evangeline Lilly did a nice job bringing an ancillary character to the action, and if you never read the books, it's not really going to matter much any way. So for good or not, with the Hobbit Trilogy of movies now complete, I think the series of films will probably go on to be regarded with more favor as time goes by. What they hopefully accomplish at the very least is to intrigue enough viewers to seek out the books by Tolkien, who created a wondrous universe of characters complete with unique races, places and languages, enough to thrill readers of all ages."

","First of all I'd like to say I didn't see any of the Hobbit films in the cinema. I've just recently sat down & watched all 3 on blu ray on my big TV. Secondly I was aware of all the mixed reviews they all got so I was expecting to be disappointed if I'm honest. Thirdly & most importantly I've never cared what others like, Its what I like that matters to me. That's why we have menus in restaurants.. we all have different tastes. A critics review in a paper is meaningless, its like a food critic saying Cumberland pie isn't good when millions like it. Fourthly now we have established criticism is a personal rant.. how can we tell how good a movie or series is. Money of course.. over 3 billion dollars the last I heard in cinema & DVD sales. Personally,I loved all 3 Hobbit films, I thought they were really fabulous. I'm not gonna sound like an art house nerd here dissecting every frame as if I were writing a doctoral thesis. I simply enjoyed each film, right from the start I could see how much love, thought & care went into each frame. The cinema photography was stunning..my big TV has never looked so handsome. Some of the finest scenes I have seen. The films were well balanced & had plenty drama & excitement in them, perfectly woven throughout. Yes it was not as enjoyable as the LOTR trilogy but there are not many films out there that are if you ask me. The LOTR book is a much better read than The Hobbit so in a way its fitting the films are the same. There was a much better musical score in the LOTR which accompanied more emotional melancholy scenes.. that's what I thought was lacking in the Hobbit. (Was Enya on holiday or something lol)Saying that, scene for scene The Hobbits cinema photography & CGI were superior. Scenes with Smaug in the 2nd film were just stunning. Well done Peter Jackson, the films were great. You will be laughing all the way to the bank."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","2","6","24 June 2015"," The magic is gone
","This is the third and final chapter of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. He directed the movie and also wrote the script. With the latter, he once again got help from his wife Fran Walsh, Guilermo del Toro and also Philippa Boyens with whom he worked together already on the ""Lord of The Rings"" movies. The film runs for under 2.5 hours and is thus the shortest of the three Hobbit films. While I at least mildly enjoyed the previous two installments, I have to say this one here really hasn't a whole lot of recommendable features anymore. This film came out shortly before Christmas last year, but it's not among the best holiday films of 2014.<br/><br/>It already started with a disappointment. The mighty dragon who really elevated the second movie with all the action in the treasure chamber was presented as a cliffhanger when he flew to the city to destroy it. And I was actually curious what would happen in the third film because of that ending from the second. I was really disappointed that the dragon was basically gone after roughly 20 minutes. I really wanted to see more of him. And also that it happened through a single shot from a bow was a bit ridiculous taking into account how huge and majestic the creature was. Oh and Stephen Fry was gone too at the same time which sucked as I really like him. Instead we get more of the ethnicity conflicts between Elves and Dwarfes basically for the entire film. I know people criticized that this was made as a trilogy and not as one single movie as Tolkien's original ""Hobbit"" was much shorter than his or d'oeuvre ""The Lord of the Rings"". If they make three satisfying films out of it, I will not agree with this popular criticism, but in my opinion they did not. Literally, I did not care at all what was going on the longer the movie went on.<br/><br/>Of course, you knew that Gandalf would not be dying for example even if it looked like that at times. He did appear in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy after all, which plays a lot later. But that's not a problem at all. The ending I am not sure if I liked it, it's obviously handled in a way that the ""Fellowship"" could be watched right afterward. I guess the big LotR fans will like it. Anyway, all in all about this movie, it's nicely done in terms of technical aspects, sound and visuals. The visual effects are good (BAFTA nomination), the sound work brought them an Oscar nomination and the makeup and costumes, art direction and cinematography are also nicely done. It's hard to find a flaw with this framework. However, the core of this movie, the story was just not interesting enough to attract my attention for clearly over 2 hours. Also I have to say the female Elf love story references, the heroic Bard parts and Bilbo who became a hero against all odds all became a bit annoying as stuff like this was done in the past and there was really nothing that somehow made a difference here anymore. Even Azog I perceived as far less interesting in this one here. The only character I still found somewhat interesting was Alfrid. But that does not change my perception of the entire film in any way. Not recommended."

","I'd somehow managed to miss watching the epic LoTR trilogy as I fell asleep every time I tried to watch the first one. As I got older, I started to appreciate more serious films, so gave it another go. I'm now a ridiculously massive fan and have watched all three numerous times. I had high hopes for the Hobbit films. <br/><br/>I was disappointed at first with the first, but gave it another chance. I loved the second one because of Smaug, I have a bit of a dragon obsession. But the third....wow, what a hideous insult and a waste of time. <br/><br/>The CG effects (most of the film) are shockingly bad, it looks like they had a severely limited budget, or just got lazy. The ""comedy"" scenes didn't belong, and I hated the characters who were meant to be funny. The only part I did laugh at was the troll with the battering ram on his head. He reminded me of Leroy Jenkins. <br/><br/>The only scenes I really liked were in the first 10 minutes, and that's because Smaug was the star."

","'The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies' was, it has to be said, one of the most pointless cinematic experiences I've had in years. The 'Lord of the Rings' films were events. People waited for them with genuine excitement and anticipation. Surely, Mr Jackson took certain minor liberties with JRRT's text (the linking of Arwen's well being to the destruction of the One Ring still strikes me as odd), but the narrative approach was consistent and the designs for the various peoples of Middle Earth astounding. The Hobbit films, though, have become an exercise in endurance - grafting on additional sub-stories which have no relation to and distract enormously from what should be a simple, fun adventure story. Structurally it is a great juddering mess: the first ten minutes belong at the end of 'Desolation of Smaug' (the ending of which lacked any impact because it was inexplicably cut short) - and the You Think It's All Over...But We'll Have Just ONE More Redundant Fight Scene...Then Do It All Over Again attitude sparks of a Director SERIOUSLY in need of a good Script Editor. As with the first two films, many of the additional scenes are there, it seems, because Jackson thought a particular image or location would look cool, and no-one had the balls to tell him enough is enough. Many of the CGI scenes looked a tad shoddy, and the invented Tauriel sub-plot really got on my nerves...Tolkein DOES really need to reprAzent da ladies more, but creating a feisty female character only to reduce her to the filling in an unrequited Elf/Dwarf love sandwich REALLY isn't an improvement. Pretty, pompous, predictable, over-produced...and two whole fricking films longer than it needed to be."
"annuskavdpol","5","2","6","21 February 2015"," Lots of action and fighting
","This movie ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" 2014 is a movie about groups of people that are all interconnected and through arrogance and self-righteousness many of the single armies seems to not want to join the other armies - even though it is clear they share similar interests. There is a pathos within the film, one of rivalry, negotiations and coming together. The evil forces, are like in the movie Alien, where the evil is so evil that there is no realm of sympathy with the monsters - and in this movie, like in Interstellar, all the good forces seem to prevail. This movie is a good distraction from everyday life, but there is a lot of action, special effects, army scenes and in a way it is like Inception with it's Escher-like maze building and high mountain vantage points - as well as this movie had features of The Matrix in it - like a magic character running along rocks while they were falling down dozens of meters to the ground and surviving. All round a relatively fun movie to watch."
"jfgibson73","Null","2","6","9 January 2015"," Reviewing the look more so than the story
","Seeing this film in IMAX 3D probably helped me enjoy it much more than I would have in standard format. I came away from the showing not focused so much on the story and characters, but what was accomplished through the visuals. Even the quieter scenes had something interesting to look at. With some of the other 3D films I've seen, the effect loses its impact after a certain amount of time. The Hobbit was incredible right to the end. As it happens, I enjoyed the action and performances as well. I thought all three of these movies were fun and full of the joy of both making movies and telling stories. Reading through the other comments people have made, I see that many viewers nitpicked on small details which then seemed to ruin their experience. I hope I don't allow myself to end up like that, because I could have missed out on one of the best movie going experiences I can remember."
"conor-dainter","8","2","6","5 January 2015"," Compared too much
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a film that I would consider to be very good when simply considered its own film, and I think if more people saw it as such they would likely agree, but as the majority of the people that see it and rate/review it automatically compare it (and the other films in this trilogy) to the Hobbit book by Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings films by Jackson they lower their opinions of it to make it out to be a worse film than it is. I agree that the film isn't the same as the book and that at times that is frustrating, but as well as the bad alterations some of the changes and embellishments within the film are quite good and actually add quite nicely to the story. As for not being as good as the Lord of the Rings films, I again agree, however I don'g think that the Hobbit allows for quite the same level of 'Epic-ness' as those books. In short, if people would simply look past the need to compare the film to other things they may actually be able to enjoy the film rather than just hating it for no real reason."

","I thought it was awful. It's like the worlds most expensive movie for children that was unsuitable for children: due to a body count of hundred of people dying violently it in the movie. I was a fan of the first three Lord of the Rings films so I went to see this one. I saw it in 3D on a screen that was too small to support a movie in 3D. It was so long that I left before it was finished feeling like I had just sat through a two hour kiddie film-one that didn't even work on the level of an escapist film for a number of reasons. Firstly it was so full of cheap monster special effects it came off like a remake of a cheap monster movie. Secondly: the acting wasn't very good-there were so many long looks the movie took on the tone of a life insurance policy commercial somewhere in the middle. That they were dealing with 'big things' was lost in the muddle that defined this films plot line. Really a titanic waste of time even for viewers with open minds willing to check out anything out there. For over twelve dollars I think that pretty much sucks. I give it no better than a four out of ten."
"cjscahill","4","2","6","1 January 2015"," A Poor End to an Overly Disappointing Trilogy
","I'm at a loss at trying to understand what was running through Peter Jackson's mind as he directed the Hobbit trilogy. Having thoroughly enjoyed TLOTR trilogy, I'm in disbelief at how disappointing these three recent films are. I have just sat through the whole 140-odd minutes of The Battle of The Five Armies, and this final outing has confirmed my suspicions that Jackson has well and truly abandoned his filmmaking skills, having been seduced by the big budgets and apparatus of Hollywood; a path I hope will be rescinded upon with the release of his next film. <br/><br/>The sweeping establishing shots of green screen on steroids, coupled with the gormless, slow motion close ups of the lead protagonists, became painfully tiresome within the opening hour. Maintained throughout, this aesthetic façade was not enough to hide the quality of script and directorial ingenuity that the film completely lacked. <br/><br/>The one potential saving grace of Thorin's psychological battle against the corrupting and obsessive powers of the Arken Stone is bitterly disappointing, as we are shown only glimpses of his conflicted personality, before a a CGI mess posing as a climax, devoid of emotion or psychological exploration, envelops the hero and great hall he walks in. The cheesy group reconciliation that follows, as they enter the battle accompanied by tiny hoofed, giant headed goats that appear under our heroes from nowhere, is the cherry on top of a rather sickly and bloat-inducing cake. <br/><br/>As the final chapters of the book were stretched out over what feels like a marathon viewing, these last few hours were solely focused on milking out as much money from the franchise as possible. I must stop before I truly get into my ranting stride. How this trilogy has managed an average 7.5 on IMDb is beyond me."
"adamscastlevania2","7","2","6","31 December 2014"," The end of an imperfect epic
","(66%) The very last chapter of this middle-earth based saga is one of mixed emotions. On the one hand it was nice to get a second bite of the cherry and have the likes of the greatness of McKellen's Gandalf, the charm and detail of the characters and locations, along the impressive action adventure of it all back again; but on the other this clearly shouldn't have been split into three long movies, as there is an even better two chapter movie swamped in there somewhere. Issues of the over use of CGI also hamper the series as it feels too much like a technical showcase, or a video game, with the decision of making the orcs almost entirely computer based being the more questionable and wrong footed. This though is still very much something worth a watch. Martin Freeman, despite him playing second fiddle in his own movie, is great; the action is plentiful without becoming overblown, and the ending is an almost perfect, funny conclusion. Now Mr Jackson, please make a gory horror movie."
"evathequeen","7","2","6","30 December 2014"," EXACTLY AS EXPECTED. That's what disappointed me.
","So this is it, the last part of the hobbit trilogy and whilst being enthralling and vibrant throughout the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes, it did not blow my mind. Not because there wasn't enough blood or enough emotion but because all of it was expected.<br/><br/>As soon as the second sequel ended with the dragon flying off the mountain, it was evident that it would set the whole town on fire and most probably be killed by Bard who will finally fulfill his descendant's unfinished work (not being able to kill the dragon with the arrow.) As the movie progresses, it is expected that all the armies will join in battle together for the commonwealth of protecting the world against the orcs and whatever else Sauron put in his army. Also anything regarding Thorin, couldn't have been more anticipated. The fact that he gets ""the sickness"" and gets over it after a few days is almost prophesied. Thorin is my love so at least he died like the heroiest of heroes; which was also expected.<br/><br/>Walking into the cinema, I had a small hope it would exceed these expectations. Again, it could have been more mind blowing and less rushed after Thorin's death. LIKE HOLD THE F*** UP for a second THORIN THE SON OF THE TRAIN THE SON OF THROR dies and we mourn his death in the movie for about 5 minutes and then the movie's over. I felt like they just wanted to end it as soon as they could, but when your king dies you don't just smoke pot and smile after it. Moreover regarding the magic... SAURON's and Galadriel's part in the whole movie lasts at most 10 minutes. I feel like the narrative there could have been developed so much more, as well as the part with the ring. I know that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is meant to do that but still.<br/><br/>Just to conclude, the last movie of the Middle Earth Saga could have done so much better and could have had many more twists contributing to a remarkable end, but oh well. I still enjoyed it, teared up throughout it and still would recommend watching it to anyone and it still has a better love story than Twilight."
"Josh_The_Third","4","2","6","30 December 2014"," Boring and overbearing
","This movie is just battle after battle with very much little in between, no interesting dialogue, the script is so transparent you will fall asleep. Gone are the surprise, anguish, and humor the trilogy had. So much graphics yet it feels colorless. There's no character growth; Bilbo's once charming character is not in the center of the movie anymore. What exactly did he do here? Feels like he was replaceable. Even Gandalf was just kind of THERE and that's it, being a caricature of himself but not doing or saying much. <br/><br/>In a more general critique, what makes this movie overbearing might simply be the fact that it's not an adventure anymore. There was no journey to *anywhere*! And maybe because of that the plot devices were poor to non-existent. The only interesting conflict was with Thorin and his mental state, but the writers seemed to not know what they wanted out of it. BLAH! To sum it up, this movie is comprised of 70% violence that becomes pornographic and redundant very fast, and 30% poor dialogues that bury you with exactly the cliché's and tired musical cues you expect. We should be glad LOTR was not handled like this. Just a bad movie. Not interesting."
"seghers","4","2","6","29 December 2014"," Like Bad Popcorn
","Like bad popcorn with too much ""golden liquid"" added... this movie is fun for awhile, but ultimately leaves you with a sick, bloated feeling. And, bloated this movie is. Smaug dies early on in the movie, and the whole movie is basically one prolonged battle scene. While the battle starts out well, with lots of promising buildup, it rapidly descends into unbelievable nonsensical coincidental freakish stunts, each meant to outdo the previous ones. It's like the battle for Middle Earth from LOTR3 on steroids, stretched out for an extra hour and drained of any real dialog, emotion, or character depth. One example: gigantic earth-eating worms are introduced before the big battle. I guess the orcs are happy about that, because maybe these worms like the orcs better than the men/dwarf/elf team? I'm not sure how or why, since they don't seem to have eyes. Anyway, the worms show up and dig up some dirt and the men/dwarf/elves are like OH NO! WORMS! and then... nothing. They don't appear again, and they serve no purpose. Did they create holes for the orcs to travel secretly? Did they kill anyone? It's never made clear. It's as if Peter Jackson expects us to just marvel at the sight, and be satisfied, as if we don't deserve logic or motivation. We walked out of the movie discussing how ridiculous it was that the whole third movie seemed to have very little with the book, and what a rip-off it was to stretch THE HOBBIT into so many hours of unnecessary, brainless and completely unbelievable fight scenes. In my opinion, this movie is good looking, and partially watchable, but then descends into an embarrassing, smelly, gigantic pile of troll droppings."

","Let me first say that I was a huge fan of the original trilogy ""Lord of the Rings"". While I was not a huge fan of the Two Towers, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Fellowship"" and ""Return of the King"". Furthermore, I enjoyed the second addition to ""The Hobbit"" trilogy ""The Desolation of Smaug"", which was a huge improvement over ""The Unexpected Journey"". Which brings us to the ""Five Armies""...<br/><br/>I was very hopeful that the 3rd part of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy would bring the same grandeur as the 3rd addition to Rings (ROTK). I was very disappointed in the ""Five Armies"". For some reason, I just feel like it missed the mark. I found myself bored at times during this movie. Peter Jackson's style can be a little tiresome at times, but I feel like it really brought this film down. The film did not focus nearly enough on the Bilbo Baggins story and focused on things that simply did not merit attention. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was a much better film considering its pace, storyline and its focus on Bilbo. Evangeline Lily was one of the highlights of the film (and in Smaug) as Tauriel.<br/><br/>I was concerned when the film changed titles from ""There and Back Again"" to ""The Five Armies"". In my opinion, this was a fatal mistake as the focus was taken away from Bilbo and placed more on peripheral stories. ""There and Back Again"" should have remained the title. To me, this was the central focus of the previous 5 films and would have been a very fitting end to the story.<br/><br/>I gave the film a 5 out of 10. While the action sequences were great, the film itself falls flat. Overall, I was very disappointed in this film."

","To start with, I want to give the movie a little bit of credit, that the special effect was pretty awesome and graphic sophisticated. <br/><br/>However, the story plot was almost non-existent and the movie, being the last of the trilogy, felt unfinished. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie looked promising, especially with Thorin indulging in the gold pile and defining his character, as the rest of the cast were basically drifting along. The movie turned into a mess the second the battle of the five armies began and ironically, this is the title of the movie.<br/><br/>The actors barely moved in the fighting scenes. The effects were to be blamed in a way as you were basically watching human VS. computer generated images, which is the new Hollywood standard, but when this was extended for 60 minutes - it was dull.<br/><br/>The ending was flawed. It did not tell you what happens with the Arkenstone and the group of Eagles who flew over to rescue. In the book apparently the Arkenstone was placed in Thorin's chest in his tomb deep inside the Lonely Mountain. How can the movie ignore this important fact?<br/><br/>Overall, I am disappointed but meanwhile my expectation is quite low, especially knowing someone's trying to split a short book into three big, long movies."

I also had great issues with the big battles. They are good looking mostly but with the cutting between action scenes and the very very long dramatic scenes you never get the sense that the battles are that important. If the armies really fought on the battlefield during the time of the dramatic scenes the movie wouldn't been quite as long, not by far.<br/><br/>During the first two parts of The Hobbit I really enjoyed myself and was sad when they ended, this third part actually almost made me leave the theater for the first time ever.<br/><br/>It is a nice movie but its flaws are way to many to really enjoy it."

","Technically I cannot call myself a nerd, though my good friends are. I guess I am 'nerd adjacent', to paraphrase Hal Sparks. And I use 'nerd' in the most respectful sense. I was a Tolkien fan, had read LOTR more than once and of course the Hobbit. But my friends were sci- fi/fantasy fanatics. Knew all the kings of the realms and the histories and actually read the Silmarillion, which I thought was a freekin snoozefest. Decades before the first LOTR film came out, we used to sit around and hypothesize how it could be made while we were playing D&D. What would the Black Riders look like? Rivendell? Would they screw up and show Sauron? Would Bombadil be cut again, like in all the radio adaptations? Who should play what part etc... Our biggest fear was that someone would create another Ralph Bakshi nightmare. So when Jackson finally made it happen it was like a dream come true. Midnight shows on opening night became a household tradition. The stories and characters were truncated and contemporized and most of the plot changes and omissions were understandable. Overall it was a magnificent experience. Someone actually did Lord Of The Rings, and they did it justice!.... Then came the Hobbit, which started off very nicely. But it but quickly turned into a weird sort of LOTR knock off. The music, the tone, the scene cadence... it was all the same. The best parts of the Hobbit series are where they honor the lore and tone of Tolkien; those quiet moments of character and plot development in between all the over-the-freekin-top fight sequences. IMO, the action instincts which served Jackson so well in the LOTR series, detracted from this film. But I understand that after such a huge win, he really couldn't change the formula. I guess he got trapped by his own success. Of course there are unforgettable moments, Smaug being the high point. I mean a talking dragon could have failed, like a talking tree. But Jackson made both work. But with a few notable exceptions, imo, Five Armies is just more of the same. The best moments are dramatic and character driven, while 'The Battle of the CG Armies' gets tedious and predictable. They even use the same music crescendo for every climactic buildup. Like they cut and pasted all Shore's bits from the other films. And the dialogue was barely a step above exposition. It was almost like they were tired of it all too, and just wanted to get the damn thing into the theater so they could get to work on something else. Not to mention the fumbling last minute segues into the Fellowship. They could have just left that out. It was goofy and defied the story logic of LOTR. Whatever. I loved the books, of course. I loved the LOTR films. Have all the extended versions and we still watch 'em occasionally. But The Hobbit series was like listening to Yngwie Malmsteen. Sure he's awesome.... but didn't he just do all those riffs on the last two albums? In conclusion, LOTR series, absolutely! Magnificent. But the Hobbit... Good. For the most part..... But I'm just glad it's all finally over.... I hope."

","When you have unlimited cash (or so it seems) to make a movie, is it too much to demand that some of it be spent in getting things ""right"" so that the viewer isn't jarred out of the immersive experience by things that don't make sense, or things that assume you're stupid? Apparently, for this final Hobbit movie, the answer is yes. In addition to that, there were a number of scenes where rapid cuts left the 3d viewer bewildered.<br/><br/>Of the ""unblievable"" elements, three stood out: first, there was a CGI of a beast being ridden, but there was no natural ""flow"" to the creature, and instead the movement looked like a claymation rendering. Second, there were several instances where masses of soldiers performed actions in unison. The result was extremely robotic and totally unlike a real military formation. Further, the soldiers were deployed with no apparent chain of command -- no platoon leaders, sergeants, captains, etc. -- no logistical support (how do they eat?), and no archer units (who would have totally destroyed the bad guys). Jackson would have done well to have reviewed actual historical armies, such as those of Ancient Rome. Finally, the love interest plot line simply didn't work for me and seemed contrived. The final remark at the end of this plot line -- ""because it was real"" -- could have been a moving testimonial to the wretchedness behind the elfin outer elegance, but instead fell flat.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed that there was so little personal connection between the characters. For me, there was a sense that the actors were speaking their lines in front of a blue screen, without other actors actually being there.<br/><br/>In short, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies was, to reference Shakespeare, full of sound and fury, but at the end of it all, leaving the viewer bloated and unsatisfied."
"sushant0406","6","2","6","25 December 2014"," Too convoluted.
","The idea of not sticking to the novel; seemed to impress me till the end of the last movie. However, the way they ended it disappointed me. In this last installment, the final Middle-Earth movie, Smaug,the dragon who was such an important part of the storyline till the second movie, was killed off within the first 20 minutes, which seemed absolutely ludicrous. They could have shown that at the end of the previous installment and set up the stage for the battle then. But, what they did kind of ruined Smaug for me in this third movie and seemed to belittle his part in the storyline that preceded it.<br/><br/>This also made the love triangle between Legolas-Tauriel-Kili seemed to be unnecessary and incapable of rousing any emotions in the movie. This could supposedly have been replaced by many crucial scenes, that the director had decided to show. <br/><br/>Azog's back-up plan seemed like a last-minute thing, as it was all to brief and convoluted. The fight at the end was well shot and was the only good part of this story.<br/><br/>Amongst the actors, Richard Armitage got to display his potential as a man who has lost his mind on acquiring an insane amount of wealth. Martin Freeman was as usual,very good in his role too. Sir Ian McKellen was good in his, surprisingly, very short role in this movie. Many other important characters seemed to have been wasted.<br/><br/>Disappointing, but still, the feeling that you got of having witnessed everything, before Gandalf enters Bilbo's birthday, and actually getting to witness their exchange at the door that fateful day(from The Fellowship of the Ring) left a smile on my face at the end. <br/><br/>Hope this last part would have managed to do the same,throughout."
"oskar-577-424102","7","2","6","25 December 2014"," It is what it is, a decent action movie partly based on Tolkien's ""the Hobbit""
","I remember back in 2012 when I first saw the trailers for the Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey, I had very high expectations, since the cast was similar, the new actors were great(I love Martin Freeman) and it was still Peter Jackson's! And after watching the movie I was...overwhelmed. I really thought that it was a flawless film, and I ranked it 9/10(Ironically enough due to some flaws). However, a few weeks later, after the hype had settled here in Sweden, I realized that it didn't really meet up to the bar which had been set by the Lord of the Rings saga, and it left me feeling rather unsatisfied and disappointed. So when the Desolation of Smaug was released, my expectations were lower, yet I still managed to get disappointed.<br/><br/>My point with this is that this time, I knew what I'd get. I wouldn't get an epic ending to an epic saga, I wouldn't get an heart warming reunion(such as in the Return of the King) and I wouldn't feel happy and really care about what actually happened. All this I knew, and so the movie delivered the best aftertaste. It is NOT a bad movie, but to expect it to be as well as the Lord of the Rings saga, is like expecting Butter substitute to be butter. No matter how much you try to advertise it as butter, it's still only going to be a substitute. <br/><br/>There for I was not disappointed, simply because I did not expect anything great. It had a decent story, cool action and effects, and an okay ending. I would go so far to call it above average, because it never got boring, which to me isn't very common. 7/10. I would recommend it."
"antoinemrad","6","2","6","24 December 2014"," I tried to shed some tears... but I couldn't!
","Hey Everyone<br/><br/>First I want to say that I'm a big Tolkien fan. Watched LOTR, red the Hobbit and other middle earth references...<br/><br/>I have some critics in mind concerning BOTFA,: <br/><br/>1- The movie was shot on Red ""digital cameras"" which are meant mostly for commercials and Sci-fi movies. it captures more highlights than film cameras... the detailed imperfections of the props, makeup, fake hair, chromakey would be more apparent in the movie... All these factors make you aware that you are ""watching a movie"". <br/><br/>2- The 48 fps ruined the cinematic (epic) look that we were used to in LOTR. Believe it or not, the LOTR still looks more realistic then the Hobbit trilogy. More organic, epic and ,middle-earth like.<br/><br/>3- The script is....Reckless and fast... There's a lot of funny moments but in the wrong spot of the script. where you would expect to cry on the climax, you feel stoic. Where you would expect to rest and ""contemplate"", you are led to disturbed scenes. everything is repetitive and happening so fast. I expected to see more of Beorn... you get to see him only 5 seconds...<br/><br/>4- the movie has a lot of CG-scenes which makes a lot of scenes look unnatural and uninteresting. <br/><br/>5- Many actors do not ""pull you in""... You just feel they are faking it. <br/><br/>6- You kinda conclude that the whole production was rushing to save money and focusing more on CG instead of the script.<br/><br/>7- The score was great, but the music played on every scene and didn't give you much time to rest. This is very important in editing; Scenes that are without music could be more appealing than those with the underscore.<br/><br/>8- The color palette and lighting of the locations looks the same. (Saturated warm colors with blue kickers)- unlike the diversity of soft colors in LOTR.<br/><br/>9- Bilbo looks like he's playing baseball... running and informing others without fear or caution. <br/><br/>Overall: I expected a lot of the third sequel but I was left disappointed. It was an entertaining soulless CG movie. I have to admit that I liked a lot of scenes, but I disliked the overall hierarchy of the script."
"dragokin","5","2","6","23 December 2014"," better than Hobbit, Part 2
","After the previous installment of the Hobbit trilogy my expectations were rather low. Since i've seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was beyond doubt that the final movie about Bilbo's journey would be an endless battle scene. Basically, the title summarizes the script in six words: The Battle of the Five Armies.<br/><br/>However, the authors proved me slightly wrong. There has been some character development, in particular Thorin (Richard Armitage). But even those moments are mere distractions from the aforementioned battle of the five armies.<br/><br/>However, my main complaint is of pure technical nature. I've seen the movie in 3D, more precisely described as 3D HFR 48 HPS which, in turn, should convince the moviegoers about the quality of material displayed. And it turned out that during the first half hour all shots with Bard (Luke Evans) were of visible lower quality. Where everything else has been in proper 3D, his shots were almost as from an early 3D simulator. Not sure whether it was due to the equipment in the theater i visited or the producers decided to save some money on shooting with Luke Evans.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie follows in it's predecessors' steps and you'll get your money's worth of CGI. There is also a hilarious homage to Frank Herbert's The Dune, courtesy of Peter Jackson, but i'll let you guess where and what that might be."

","First, I don't like 3D movies. Second, I never stay through the credits.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is the Apex of the 3 Hobbit movies. I inadvertently purchased 3D tickets to the final chapter dreaded the thought once the film started and completely forgot about the 3D factor once the opening scene kicked into gear. When it was over, I wept silently. I stayed through the final credits wondering to myself if there will ever be another chain done so eloquently. <br/><br/>Granted I do have biased view due to my own journey over the last 16 years running parallel in many ways to both series of the Tolkien's books and Jackson's movies. It is true, you can never go back. And if you do somehow make it back to where you were before you started, nothing will ever be the same, especially yourself. <br/><br/>All that needs to be said is that you need to see this in theaters. I understand that there are purest that have a problem with some of the additions that weren't in the book. However, this is an incredible movie and finishes so completely that you will return home to begin the Lord of the Rings all over again. <br/><br/>Please go see this movie in the theater, not for numbers or sales, but for yourself."
"Rickting","7","2","6","22 December 2014"," A good but not great end to the Middle Earth saga
","It's been emotional. After 6 films, we presumably leave Middle Earth for good. However, while The Lord Of The Rings is the best trilogy of all time, after 3 exhausting prequels I think that's for the best. The first Hobbit film is a long slog punctuated by some exciting adventure sequences, while the second overcompensates with loads of big set pieces. This one is half character study, half epic battle. I'm not the biggest fan of the Hobbit films although I respect certain aspects of them. Battle Of The Five Armies is a good conclusion, although the second film is better. It's still too long and suffers from pacing problems, likely as a result of the blatant padding out of the source material. While the drama in the original trilogy felt well rounded and real, here some of the dramatic stuff such as Thorin's character arc is only powerful some of the time, while at other times feels constructed from clichés. There is definitely a sense that 2 films would have been absolutely fine.<br/><br/>BATFA is weighed down by a going the motions script, but some of the character deaths are still emotional. Special effects are mind blowing as usual, and few can film chaotic fantasy action as well as Peter Jackson. The film is desperate to get to the event of the title, but it delivers on the orc smashing, barn storming, scenery destroying, blazing battle we were all expecting. Other elements are neglected, but that doesn't harm the film. It finds just enough emotion to anchor the sweeping spectacle, and therefore this tale is an emotional one as well as a thrilling one. It's a poignant farewell to Middle Earth, and this time at least it doesn't take 45 minutes to end. The first half is slightly slow, but the second half delivers on the promise of the story. A good send off overall, though not a great one. The acting also elevates it. Ian McKellen isn't as striking as he was before, but Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman are great and Orlando Bloom manages to get away with his lack of acting ability. Despite its flaws, BATFA ends the trilogy on a high note.<br/><br/>7/10"
"tangojazz","7","2","6","22 December 2014"," Reader's Digest version of ""Lord of the Rings""
","What the heck. I'm giving the ""Five Armies"" seven stars. Why? Because I was riveted to my seat the whole movie, anxious to see what would happen next. The opening scenes of Smaug the dragon attacking the village was among the most spectacular scenes I have ever witnessed in the movies. Coming in second to that scene was Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond fighting the ""ghost"" soldiers. Truly spectacular. Unfortunately, after that, ""Five Armies"" changes into something like a video game. The plot is compressed (like the articles and stories of Reader's Digest). The presence and gravity of the original LOTR is absent. And the whole movie is CGIed to death. The whole thing feels ""rushed"". If only the ""Five Armies"" had continued the momentum of the first two exciting action scenes, we would of had a different movie. But I guess, the people involved in making ""Five Armies"" wanted to end the ""Hobbit"" series real quick(and make a lot of money)."
"david-meldrum","8","2","6","22 December 2014"," Flawed, but wonder and awe-inspiring.
","I saw this film in IMAX 3D HFR format.<br/><br/>Some people are never satisfied. Granted, there's not a single one of Peter Jackson's six Tolkein adaptations that isn't in some way flawed. To listen to some talk about the Hobbit films you'd think, however, that he was guilty of mass murder of at least the Transformer films. I remain convinced that from the perspective of history this set of six will be widely-loved and cherished. Frankly I want him to keep making films like this for the rest of my life. <br/><br/>If the first Hobbit was a film that spoke to me of grace and the second was one that spoke to me of joy, then this third instalment induces in me somewhere between childlike wonder and awe. Like the rest of this trilogy, it's too little narrative stretched over too much screen time. Like The Return Of The King the large-scale battle sections overwhelm character and nuance. Like all the other films, Orlando Bloom is still phoning it in. Unlike the 3rd LOTR film, this one decides that one ending will suffice, and it's a beautiful, funny and entirely apt ending that moved me to a slightly moistened eye behind my annoying 3D glasses. <br/><br/>Like the other films, and true to Jackson's film-making roots, there's some tough stuff in here. Picking up right where the previous film left off, it opens with Smaug laying waste to the nearby city; the attendant action scenes are fantastic, and the footage of ordinary people turned to refugees in fearful panic is chilling and contemporary. There then, essentially, follows a series of sequences of various characters being foreboding about oncoming war, plus a little sneaking around and double-dealing. Richard Armitage as dwarf king Thorin takes centre stage wrestling with 'gold sickness' as much as Frodo will later wrestle with the Ring's power and temptations. It doesn't quite have the Ring's chilling relevance but it's powerful stuff nonetheless and still a fine performance.<br/><br/>It's all marking time, to be honest, for the titular battle. A masterfully presented battle it is too. There's a few moments where there's too much CGI (Legolas running up some falling bricks sticks in the memory in a bad way); other than that, it's stunning. There are five armies, and for us to be fully involved in personal skirmishes as well as large scale conflict and still be able to keep a handle on the story and who is fighting who and why is no small achievement. There are moments of liquid beauty too - elf armies aligning, especially; and some truly memorable weapons and creatures ... a large troll-thing with a stone thing round his head being a funny but still powerful highlight.<br/><br/>As mentioned, occasionally the computer imagery takes over too much, which is an unusual fault in these films. Mostly the human wins through, but here the artifice is occasionally too obvious. For me this was exacerbated by the artificiality of HFR; all be it that IMAX remains the best format for large-scale films like this. By movie's, however, it was only my diary and the late hour keeping me from diving straight into the LOTR trilogy."

","The third Hobbit movie is upon us,the last middle earth movie for quite a while. I was skeptical when I heard they were splitting The Hobbit in 3 and I still feel 2 would have been enough. Are the hobbit movies a tad long? Yes. Are they as good as The Lord Of The Rings? No way. Is there some nostalgia going on in the Hobbit that makes me enjoy it? Sure. Nonetheless I really liked this movie. It was an enjoyable time. It felt like coming home. I did have some unanswered questions but hopefully those will be answered on the extended edition. Martin Freeman is really the perfect Bilbo,he captures him perfectly. Watching all 6 movies together will a wonderful experience. It will bring everything home.<br/><br/>I did feel Bilbo was kinda pushed to the side when it's supposed to be ""The Hobbit"". The final scene was just perfect and brought tears to my eyes."
"joshuaiyer","8","2","6","21 December 2014"," Another epic conclusion.
","After seeing the first two Hobbit films for the past two years, both released around Christmas, it was nice to see the final Middle-Earth adventure. And what a film it was! ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" was an epic way for Jackson's franchise to end on a grand note. The visuals were all built upon large, open areas, especially in the fighting scenes. I really enjoyed the opening scene with the epic destruction of Lake-Town by Smaug, probably my favorite. The music and constant ringing of the town bell and the fiery visuals made the scene an intense way to begin the film. The various emotional bits in-between the large numbers of armies fighting gave the film a little breathing room. And at the very end, when we return to the Shire with that familiar atmosphere, it lends us back home, as the film comes to its conclusion.<br/><br/>The music in this one was again written by Howard Shore and played by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, which did a great job. We again hear several leitmotifs from the first two Hobbit films, such as the violins' creepy theme for Smaug, Bilbo's variation of the Shire theme from the original films, and a heroic piece for Thorin built on brass. Several pieces from the original series return as well, such as music for the Orcs, the famous violin melody for the One Ring, and for the Shire. All of this allows the listener to latch on to musical knowledge from previous, which makes the scene ever more powerful; and as this is the final film, it is imperative that Shore does this. There were several sections with chanting choir, to add to the battle effect, and as Thorin begins his solo battles on the mountain, the choir becomes ever more intense. The music does a good job of flowing with the movie, which aids the transitions. There were some times that felt right omitting music, and some where I felt something more was needed, however. Overall, it was a pretty epic score that did a lot for the film, and I wonder if Shore will do anything more with his music for these films.<br/><br/>Overall, the visuals and everything were of a fantastic quality. The allusions to the original Lord of the Rings in terms of plot were really nice as well. Overall, it was an epic conclusion to finish a six-film collection of The Lord of the Rings."
"captainmike-michael","9","2","6","21 December 2014"," BotFA Worths the One Last Time for Middle Earth Saga
","Being the final installment of The Hobbit's franchise, the film itself does leave some nostalgic impression to the audiences; and having to split it into a long trilogy to build up everything seems to be fine even though the last part is a bit lacking of sub-plots to support the main story. It is the shortest chapter of 144 minutes, starting off straightforward from the happening at the end of Desolation of Smaug, moving immediately to treasure conflicts at Erebor, the not quite strong love triangle between the Elf and Dwarf, and then the unstoppable wars with thrilling action scenes of Legolas and Thorin that last for almost half of the running time. The performance of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins is still promising as his fear, courageous and emotions are strongly inspiring across the trilogy while Richard Armitage also portrays well with his change of behavior as Thorin, the visual effects are undeniable dazzling and stunning, but there is a few part that seems to be just semi-real, not to miss out Howard Shore's scores are awesome as always for all the six entries. While the story line moves in an extreme fast pace with short conversations and it may seems somewhat diverts from the usual tradition of the middle earth saga, The Hobbit trilogy is pleasing at it is, serves a decent connection bridge to Lord of the Ring and the ending with theme song ""The Last Goodbye"" drives audience's emotion to feel reluctant for farewell. Overall, The Hobbit franchise is worth for one last time although it loses some of the magic compared to Lord of the Ring Trilogy."
"neyony345-33-475119","7","2","6","20 December 2014"," A Charming End to the Hobbit Trilogy
","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies continues where the Desolation of Smaug left off. It uses some of the best modern technology available to create some really fun, entertaining, and over the top action scenes. In this movie, friendships are measured, alliances are forged, and grievances are opened, as the tension builds up to a final battle, and conclusion.<br/><br/>In this movie, the role of the dwarfs, with the exception of Thorin, diminish. This gives Thorin's character, (played by Richard Armitage), a chance to shine as a dark, brooding king consumed by greed, conflicted with loyalties, and losing his mind. This wouldn't be a Hobbit movie without Bilbo, (played by Martin Freeman). The quirkiness, appeal, and charm of the movie rests with Bilbo, and he has many great on screen moments.The crux of the movie is in the battle of the five armies, and the CGI parts of the film are filled with great detail, and set an epic atmosphere unmatched by the other two films.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Hobbit Trilogy, the final movie, isn't really a disappointment. It wraps up all the story arcs, leaving all questions answered. Though it doesn't match my expectations for being a great movie, it is a good popcorn action flick, and should be seen in IMAX 3D. If you are looking for a great, grand concluding film which matches the other Lord of the Ring films, you might be disappointed. But if you are looking for an entertaining conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy you won't be disappointed."
"Bottlebrush","8","2","6","20 December 2014"," Absolutely breathtaking – possibly my favourite of the ME films
","I've seen this film twice now and intend to see it several more times. I find the acting and character moments truly outstanding – notably of Richard Armitage as Thorin and Martin Freeman as Bilbo. (I swear Richard Armitage can speak with his eyes!) Thranduil, Bard and Balin are all given great moments. (I did feel that such moments were lacking in DoS, especially in the cinema edition, but this film is very satisfying in this respect.) <br/><br/>The beginning of the film is absolutely stunning – I simply cannot believe what has been done to produce such a fabulous Smaug. The fire reminds me of the Great Fire of London, and the bell is a great touch. I also like the 'visions' of Smaug that both Thorin and Bilbo have after the dragon had been killed.<br/><br/>Even Alfrid doesn't particularly bother me, since he provides an additional dimension to the film – showing a type of character that is found all too often in war situations. He provides a bit of light relief to lighten the darkness following Smaug's destruction of Lake-town.<br/><br/>All round, the visuals are absolutely amazing. (I've seen the film in both 48 HFR and IMAX 3D, and both were brilliant formats to watch the film in.)<br/><br/>The last part of the film is heart rending for me, right into the credits with Billy Boyd's lovely song.<br/><br/>I would have liked more Beorn, since I love that character, and a few more things – I can't wait for the EE for this film.<br/><br/>Well done and thank you PJ (and cast and crew).

","It was just a good movie. It wasn't bad. It wasn't mediocre. It was just good, that's why I see a 7 for this movie. Why? Let's start from the beginning of the movie, with the dragon. The beginning of the movie started off excellently, where the second movie left off with the Dragon heading to Lake Town. We see the citizens of lake town fleeing for their lives as they see the Dragon. Of course, some citizens didn't make it out alive. We see Bard's children heading out with Tauriel and the dwarfs, but are worried as to where their father is. Their father was still imprisoned, but escaped by sending a rope out the window, and having the so-called king of Lake Town getting trapped, but surviving being in that rope. He climbs atop a tower and shoots arrows at Smaug. He figures out he is immune to those arrows. His son decides to do something dangerous and goes to help him. With him, he has a metal arrow. Bard shoots it and it hits the dragon in the weak spot. This is the part I find a bit over-dramatic; his death. Really? THAT'S how a dragon is going to die in this movie? REALLY?? Come on, that was just over-dramatic. He falls on top of the so-called king of Lake Town, but his death. I can't get over that enough.<br/><br/>Other than that, there were some cheesy elements throughout. Kill trying to get Tauriel to go with them. Tauriel being banished from her home. OH! and Alfred being a big baby. HE was ""assistant"" to the ruler of Lake Town??? HAH!! What a coward. The fight scenes were definitely the best part. There were also some heartfelt moments in there. The last movie has a good setup for The Lord of the Rings, I guess it just wasn't what I was really expecting."

First off, it takes a while to get to the actual battle which isn't necessarily bad, but there's a lot of scenes where people are just talking. It can get stale, but it's not too bad. Some acting isn't as good as it was in DoS, but it isn't bad either. A couple pacing issues here and there too. There's also a character that has a CGI overhaul, and I think it actually looks kinda bad. But other than, it's a pretty good flick, great even. The music is once again, very nice to listen to. Some tracks are epic, some are beautiful, and some are just fun. It also looks the best. The colors are much better than the last movies. While An Unexpected was too saturated, Desolation of Smaug was a little too muted, especially when you see the gold in the mountain. The action is also well-made here. You can kinda tell it's choreographed, which takes you out of it a little. The characters are still likable, especially Bilbo. And a few dwarves have more screen time.

"ryanh-00630","9","1","2","12 September 2019"," Witness the defining chapter of the Middle-Earth saga.
","Rousing, muscular, and theme-rich, Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a triumphant final chapter to his second Middle-earth trilogy. An action oriented spectacle replete with heart and soul, Jackson's film soars and easily finds a place in the canon of fantasy greats.<br/><br/>Adapting and expanding on the final chapters of J.R.R Tolkien's ""The Hobbit,"" Jackson's film tells the story of dwarves, elves, hobbits, orcs, and men as they collide in an epic battle over homeland, riches, and, eventually, freedom. While Jackson and company's script takes liberties with the source material, adding characters, subplots, and adventures that go unseen in the literature, these liberties are reverent. The screenwriters steward Tolkien's world and words, fleshing them out in exhilarating and meaningful ways.<br/><br/>The story, here, is lean and packed with up-tempo action beats. Underlying it all, however, are the themes of Tolkien's core narrative. Through dialogue and deed, Jackson weaves a tale of individuals wracked by destructive greed yet emboldened by legacy and the promise of reclaiming lost homelands. He tells a story of the importance of allegiance and the utmost need for friendship. As with the five films before, this is a story that promises even the smallest person can make a difference and that love and friendship are life's imperative driving factors.<br/><br/>Jackson, once again, creates a world that is immersive. His Middle-earth is dangerous, cold, and murky; but it is also vibrant, robust, and alive. The film is a symphony of fantastic designs and beautifully rendered landscapes, sets, props, and costumes. Every artist and technician working on the film has a hand in molding something memorable. Jackson's camera swoops and stalks, capturing a world that is brilliantly rendered.<br/><br/>Jackson's cast build characters that are just as well rendered. They are fantastic beings of all shapes and sizes, yet they are recognizably human. From Martin Freeman's put-upon Bilbo and Richard Armitage's glowering Thorin, to Ian McKellen's wizened Gandalf and Evangeline Lilly's powerful Tauriel, these are characters ideally communicated by their actors. They breathe life into Tolkien and Jackson's now-iconic creations.<br/><br/>The film is swift and never sags. It moves from bold heights of heroism to moving moments of quiet sacrifice. It is whimsical, moving, and inspiring. Though its plot beats cover only a handful of pages from Tolkien's tome, the beats never feel over-stuffed or unnecessary. Jackson, guided by the essence of Tolkien's work, creates something thrilling, entertaining, and meaningful.<br/><br/>It is with a heavy heart but tone of good cheer that Peter Jackson ends his excellent second Middle-earth trilogy. Though the events of these films may be trite compared to those of Jackson's first venture into Tolkien's realm, they are just as stunningly realized. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a fully engrossing, fully enchanting, and fully spectacular experience. It is an ideal and bitter-sweet send off for Tolkien's beloved characters and a stellar end-note for Jackson's six-film magnum opus, narratively dovetailing with effortlessness back into Jackson first cinematic journey to Middle-earth and creating an amazing fantasy saga."

","One of the best trilogy I have ever seen, in sum it's a masterpiece, composed of a blending action and humor - and even a bit of romance - to create a well-paced tale that ends up being almost as satisfying. ""The Hobbit"" is visually stunning in all its three-parts, beside the Oscar-worthy performance by Freeman as a Bilbo (Freeman was born to be a hobbit), also I couldn't ignore the great performance of all cast, the amazing music by Howard Shore that reprised from the previous trilogy and the genius director Peter Jackson who gave us this masterpiece trilogy.<br/><br/>The disadvantage of ""The Hobbit"" is the ending of part 1&2, where the film ends with ellipses rather than a period, we know the story will be continued, but with a little effort and some clever writing, Jackson could make each chapter feel like its own complete story.

It wasn't even a side-story. It was there for the sake of being there.<br/><br/>There are other couple of stupid things such as ponies being able to climb a completely vertical wall of mountain. Like actually run up it at a ninety degree angle. This also includes the completely random addition of eagles who come out of nowhere and one of the characters shouting out randomly ""Look! The Eagles are coming!"".<br/><br/>Seriously, if these silly things weren't added in the film and they stuck to the treasure they were all fighting for this would've been a good film.<br/><br/>It was entertaining, but for the wrong reasons and I'm not surprised by the low ratings fans have given this movie."
"chaostheory6682","5","1","2","20 March 2015"," J.R.R Tolkien: An Amalgamation of Works with Some Stuff We Made Up Thrown In
","Eh, it was alright. They kind of did what they wanted with the storyline, which was give and take as far a quality goes. They stray off from the book pretty far, almost to the point where it has nothing to do with the book that Tolkien wrote. Which I have found disappointing throughout this trilogy. And the special effects can be inconsistent and unrealistic. Some of them are amazing, but other special effects throw any idea of realism out the window. I found myself visibly cringing at several scenes, to the point that I wasn't sure if I wanted to set through the rest of the movie or walk out rolling my eyes. Another example of a big budget that can't seem to find the time to be burdened by any of the rules that govern the physical world--and not in a good way. There is one character in the movie, specifically, that they use an abundance of CGI on (and I'm not sure why) and it looks absolutely terrible, not at all believable, it is distracting. Not to mention that many of the battle scenes take things way over the top, to the point of cringe. In a movie like this, with such a huge budget, you would think they would have the time and money to focus on creating a top quality production from beginning to end, but the over the top special effects in many battle scenes, and the outdated and unrealistic manner that the characters move, made me sigh--I expected better, and I am not sure why, especially after the last two movies they made. I did wait for the price to come down before going, and even then, I still feel kind of cheated. This is a rental grade movie; watch it once or twice and move on--definitely not a classic."
"charliep14","6","1","2","7 January 2015"," A little anticlimactic
","This movie didn't really work as a stand alone movie: it's just the final act in a saga that was obviously stretched out too much. As a third of a two movie Hobbit saga it would have been a much different thing. As a movie in and of itself, it's just too drawn out. Add to that the fact that we have now seen 12+ hours of elves, orcs & trolls fighting each other, it was unsurprising. Though beautifully shot, with great effects, and the cast & characters arguably more likable than the Lord of the Rings saga, it has good things going for it, but ultimately this third Hobbit movie is probably the weakest of both JRR Tolkien / Peter Jackson sagas."
"AkelaLoneWolf","7","1","2","4 January 2015"," Slightly idealistic but visually pleasing
","As the final chapter of the prequel to The Lord of the Rings, I find this movie satisfactory. It was fairly faithful to the original fiction, though of course Tauriel was added to appease the audience who longed to see friendship-love between the feuding Elves and Dwarfs. As expected there was lots of fighting which was realistic but the bloodshed wasn't overwhelming. I have reservations at the idealistic victorious outcome, which should have been impossible given the state of matters. The coming of the Eagles, so essential in turning the tide, should have been more stunning and powerful. Otherwise it could convince no one that the latter would win a battle between two swarming armies of fighter Orcs against an assorted alliance of dwindling armies consisting of untrained villagers, reluctant Elves under a selfish Elvish Lord and biased mercenary stubborn Dwarfs. The sudden change of mind of the King of Mirkwood felt staged; so true love between a subject he banished and disliked due to Legolas' infatuation would convert the cold and hardened Thranduil to a loving and feeling Elf like that? The awakening of Thorin Oakenshield was much more natural, perhaps because Tolkien wrote the transformation. The little twist in the tale when Bilbo returned home to find his belongings being auctioned off as he was missing presumed dead provided the comic relief one needed from the heavy hearted farewells from the battlefield. Fortunately, despite all the fabricated bits, there remains the main theme unaltered - true friendship and never-ending resistance against evil."
"laughinggiraffe0","6","1","2","3 January 2015"," Emphasis on visuals
","I've never read the books or seen the previous movies, but I still expected to understand the movie because I assumed each movie in the franchise would stand on it's own. Well, that's not the case. I couldn't understand the first 25% of the movie. It got better after that but the emphasis was on fighting and visuals. The plot and character development was weak, and for most characters, non existent. There are a few scenes that are just so ridiculous they're stupid. For example, the hobbit (whatever his name is) was killing orcs by throwing rocks at them. One rock was all it took to knock down a giant monster. Seriously? lol. My only other minor complaint is the hobbit's feet, which kind of grossed me out. It seems the costume designers went out of their way to make his feet look as big, as gnarled, as hairy and as filthy as possible. I kept hoping he'd put socks on or someone would throw him a pair of shoes. Anything."
"jafdip","7","1","2","29 December 2014"," Great action but too long
","At least some of the magic of Lord of the Rings series is recaptured in the final of the Hobbit trilogy but its length meant we were in the cinema nearly three hours. At least 30 minutes of forbidden elf-dwarf love and weeping over dying dwarfs could have quite easily been edited out, and it would have been a better movie for it. No doubt Peter Jackson was told, ""Yes, its awful, but we Have to Appeal to a Female Audience"". Which is why the last two Hobbit movies are stuffed with Hollywood schlock. And there is some serious miscasting of the characters involved in the elf-dwarf love sub-plot, which left me totally unconvinced. And was it really necessary to kill so many characters> And what was with those worms anyway? If the producers had stuck more to the book and not tried to pad it out with silly love stories what is merely an interesting movie could have been a classic."
"agmoldham","6","1","2","29 December 2014"," The journey comes to an end (or a start)
","It's probably fair to say that the Hobbit trilogy hasn't ever reached the heights of the Rings trilogy. There's no doubt that there are a number of reasons for this. The awe of the visuals on the Rings movies is just as impressive in the Hobbit movies, but it is no longer original. There was also a lot more source material in the Rings books than the Hobbit book.<br/><br/>The final part of the Hobbit trilogy is action all the way and starts (not unsurprisingly) from where the previous film finished. Don't go and see the Five Armies without seeing (or at least knowing about) the previous Hobbit films. <br/><br/>You probably have the greatest interest in the Hobbit movies when the scenes are related to plot lines of the Rings movies. That's definitely the case with me and consequently I love the final scene of the movie. Martin Freeman is fine in the lead role of Bilbo although you never quite get the sense of joy that you got from the Rings cast. The Five Armies is definitely the best of the Hobbit movies and is definitely worth a watch."
"glennmeerten06","7","1","2","29 December 2014"," Too epic to conclude properly
","So I haven't reviewed ""An Unexpected Journey"" and ""The Dessolation of Smaug"" because I felt like The Hobbit should be considered one big movie divided in three parts. But now I've seen the finale I feel like I should focus on part three...<br/><br/>I loved it! It's an amazing motion picture. Visually stunning and epic. The themes of brotherhood, friendship and courage are well worked out. They have been build up in part one and two though. Some themes though, were build up but never paid off! Like what happened to Thrain? Why even bring it up if you never get the answer (you have to watch the extended version of part two to get the answer).<br/><br/>And that's the problem: part one and two build up these themes and portrayed the inception of the Lord of the Rings and part three continues this trend. BUT, in doing so, it fails to conclude the story of The Hobbit in a satisfying way! The Lord of the Rings had a lengthy ending (and that's with Jackson cutting a lot of stuff out of the ending) but it needed that! It demanded it even! After three 3 hour films IT NEEDED THAT! The Hobbit needed that as well! Especially after such a dramatic battle with some heartbreaking events within this battle! I literally had to catch my breath when the battle was over. I was waiting for an ending to comfort me. Plus there's the fact that they made a big deal out of ""the defining chapter"" and the hash tag ""onelasttime"". Nobody wanted the middle earth saga to end. They HAD to play that out IN THE MOVIE! They didn't...<br/><br/>So why then did I love it! The battle scenes are amazing! Seeing the five armies brawl it out while actually seeing the strategy and difference in culture for each army is just such a thrill to watch. The individual fight scenes are equally as stunning. Legolas proves why he is such a fan favorite! <br/><br/>However... I never had that epic big goosebumps moment that the storming of the Fields of Pelennor by the Rohirrim gave me. That scene gave me the kind of goosebumps that even hurt a little! And I wondered why it didn't happen here. The answer? The music. I love Howard Shore's work! I love it so much I went to TLOTR in Concert, just to experience the music live! Who doesn't remember the Shire Theme. Or the Theme for Rohan with those northern violins and I could go on and on... With the whole Hobbit trilogy there are two original themes that I can remember: the theme of the eagles when they come and save the company in part one and the theme of Laketown. I remember these because I know that each place and culture got there own musical theme. However, the one of Esgeroth wasn't as good as the one for Rohan or Gondor... <br/><br/>So in conclusion. Part one was great, part two was amazing but part three was just good. Some choices made me scratch my head, like why focus on a love story with a character that isn't even in the book and leave out a part in part two where Gandalf finds Thrain in Dol Guldur which is in Appendices of TLOR! When you watch the extended edition of part two all you can think is: ""why isn't this or this in the theater edition!"" And I fear that is the case now. All those scenes you wanted to see will probably be in the extended edition which is a relief as well as a annoyance! <br/><br/>Though, as a fan of this universe, I urge you: go see it..."
"ayoreinf","9","1","2","28 December 2014"," Kudos for tying all the loose ends nicely, even those that shouldn't have been there
","Let me be clear - this is not a whole hearted 9, it's more of 8.5 at times and 8.8 at others. But 9 is the closest the rating system gets to my personal rating. It's obvious that the closing installment of this Jackson made trilogy is much better than the middle one, mostly because it does return in a manner of speaking to most of the original themes of the book. Even the subplots that were added to the original story and gave it its bloated trilogy form, didn't get in the way too much. Can't explain exactly how and why without spoilers, but if you did read the books and saw the films, I'm sure you'll see my point. Thing is, some of these additions are still out of place, but since the whole thing does return to the tone and nature of the original, I'm once again more forgiving. I'll accept the Azog story line - it's a Jackson invention, but it goes along with the characters in the book. I'm also seeing the point of the Dol Goldur fight, though I like it less as it pushes the boundaries further than the Azog sub-plot. The Bard sub plot is also within the boundaries of the original story, other sub-plots are really too far-fetched, and I won't even mention them.<br/><br/>On the other hand I can't ignore the superb job most of the actors do. Especially Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage, but I also want to mention the performance of Lee Pace and Luke Evans. The other aspects of movie making are of the highest quality, the cinematography, the special effects (in which Jackson always shines)the editing that keeps the battle going and going without losing the audience. But these were never the issue when discussing the Hobbit's trilogy, or when discussing Jackson's work."
"StriderRanger","7","1","2","28 December 2014"," Well done for the LoTR and the first two Hobbit's movies but...what happened to you guys in this defining and last Chapter?
","As a big fan of Tolkien's world, The Lord of the Rings is my favorite movie of all times, it's by this fantastic trilogy that I came across Tolkien's world, and that all his works were fascinating me for years.<br/><br/>When I read the books and noticed some (if not major) differences between the plots of the Lord of the Rings movies and the book, I was a little disappointed. But I was saying to myself: After all, Peter Jackson did a very nice job with his crew bringing Middle-Earth to life, the cast and the whole team is perfect, and the ideology behind Tolkien's works is preserved, so for me the first trilogy deserves a 10/10. When the making of The Hobbit as a movie was announced, and knowing then that Peter Jackson take back the direction of the trilogy, I was very pleased and I was eagerly waiting for the coming movies.<br/><br/>""An Unexpected Journey"" and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" were well made. Even if they lack a little of the attraction that was felt in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was a great work though..after all, we got the chance to discover the dwarfs realm, encounter Thorin Oakenshield's company, visit Dale and Esgaroth, see the elven city of Thranduil, the lay of Sauron with his Nine in Dol Goldur, feel the might of the fearsome dragon Smaug, and lay an eye upon the endless wealthy treasure of Erebor.<br/><br/>The third part of the Hobbit's trilogy was originally named ""There and back again"", and once it was changed into ""The Battle of Five Armies"" I was saying to myself that I must be prepared for a surprise. And what a surprise Peter Jackson really makes in his 'final and defining chapter'. The last thing that I was expecting is a CGI movie. Tolkien's works are far beyond that...So much time was invested for the battle when we could see much more interesting things in the last hour of the movie: <br/><br/><ul><li>Thorin, Kili and Fili Funeral. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Make a descent goodbye between Bilbo and the dwarfs. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Find a way to include Aragorn ""in person"" in the last moments of the movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Even if the last minute of the movie was good, the end could be better if Bilbo didn't jump in 3 or 4 minutes or so from Erebor to the Shire. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Avoid a love story that it never meant to be in place. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why Azog has to live after Moria's war? The grudge that Bolg has against the dwarfs wasn't enough for a good ""climax"" for the movie?</li></ul><br/><br/>To conclude, my question is: 'Why did they invest so much time for one battle?' this part could be better if just a little much effort was made for a reasonable script.<br/><br/>I gave 7/10 just for respect of Tolkien's work, and the effort that was made for the other movies."
"anchoreddown","8","1","2","26 December 2014"," Nice finish!
","Picking up where we left off with The Desolation of Smug, this film plays out in the same format as any other Middle Earth film does. Less than ten minutes into the movie, the audience is back in the saddle for the third adventure of The Hobbit. This may not be the best rated epic from Peter Jackson, but I wouldn't say it was a disappointment. Some elements were missing for a proper epic piece, however the feel of the film speaks of conclusion and war. This seems to fit this reality. Lots of directors and writers speak of getting the feel of the film right. It's a departure from the last two films in The Hobbit, but when you cut it up into three sections of film, I say there's no need to add any more. Making line to the original LOTR trilogy, that part of it had to be in there. Ultimately The Hobbit should have been done in two films to better appease the fans, but I am not saying every chapter in a series of films has to do that. The third X-Men film was that way,......so I've heard,......."
"labeopictures","6","1","2","26 December 2014"," Good movie, but...
","When I watched The Fellowship of the Ring, I felt in love with the atmosphere of the Shire, a mix of comfort, beauty and simplicity. I had just finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy of Tolkien and Jackson seemed to have understood the wonderful world which Tolkien created. Then, the epic quest of the Ring began and never had enough and watched many times the extended editions. <br/><br/>Some years later, the adventures of Bilbo the hobbit were going in cinema. When I learned it would be three movies, it seemed really strange, but I gave it a shot. Since the first movie went out, I was disappointed. The hobbit is one of my favorite book : it is charming, simple and it is an incredible adventure. But I never had the feeling of adventure which I link with the Hobbit. I found the first two movies were very good, but it was missing some ingredients. The last movie was a bigger disappointment. The first half was good, but after that, it was just battles after battles, with a supersonic Legolas and a Super Saiyan Galadrielle, with bosses which seemed to be created for video games. But the feeling of adventure was absent, and it ruined the movie for me. <br/><br/>In the Hobbit, the charm of the book, which is not reflected in the movies (particularly the third one) can be resumed with the end : <br/><br/>"" ""Of course!"" said Gandalf [...] ""You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little follow in a wide world after all"" ""Thank goodness!"" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar""."

There are few book to movie Titles that I think are good, and none that are perfect. This one in my opinion was good. My point is I agree some directors just ruin a book to movie idea but this one does not fall into the What were they thinking category. It was entertaining and I enjoyed the story greatly. We all enjoy our books, so its hard to control ourselves when we here one of our favorites going to be made to movie, we expect a lot, and its hard to pack the book essence in perfect movie form. Could I do better, no if I had to choose aside from making someone sit for 8 hours of a movie , how to decide what to cut, or put or leave out, or change in making one myself.

","Background: <br/><br/>I saw all of the LOTR trilogy, and read all of LOTR books. I saw the previous two entry's of the Hobbit films, and read ""The Hobbit"" book. <br/><br/>I do not have a great memory of the books as I read them in middle school, and watched LOTR trilogy in high school. <br/><br/>My favorite previous series entry was ""Return of the King"" or part 3. <br/><br/>In this instance I thought the 1st entry of the Hobbit series was good, but not fantastic.. and I thought the 2nd was OK (interestingly enough I felt the 2nd film in the last series was OK too), but I thought this film was great.. maybe really great.. and I would watch it again. <br/><br/>I do not think this series lived up to the standards of pushing the film industry the same way with the ground-breaking series that was the first LOTR trilogy, but I do think it matched and succeeded in following up in every way a great series/ trilogy as a stand-alone, and in given new technology, film, and evolution in film making.<br/><br/>I would give the LOTR series an A and this series a B.. but nothing to be disappointed about. <br/><br/>Given the evolution in visuals, film, and so forth this film is one I would probably watch just as quickly as the old ones. <br/><br/>============================================================= NOW for details about THIS FILM SPECIFICALLY (spoilers): <br/><br/>Some cliché story elements/ characters.. but that's not always a negative.. sometimes it's a good cliché. As the story develops there is plenty of organic and new material. <br/><br/>Interesting character interaction between the Hobbit and Thorin the king of dwarfs. <br/><br/>Tauriel was slightly annoying, but a beauty, and I really loved the way the elves were done and portrayed, lead by the Elf king (who really brought the acting effect of a larger empire), and Legolas our beloved un-aging elf. <br/><br/>Some nice battle scenes, but never over-the-top focus on battles. The battles and art direction/ CG did not match what was done in the LOTR series relative to their times. That film pushed ahead in those respects for atmosphere. This film just met expectations.. however some of the scenery, especially at the tomb + town/ sets were really well done. <br/><br/>Overall: some very heartfelt moments. really good, sometimes great acting, and a worthy final film. The ""boss"" guy wasn't as cool as the ones in LOTR !! <br/><br/>I really would have preferred if this series was a 2-part series instead of a trilogy."

This 3rd part was a big disappointment and disgrace to The Hobbit and LOTR series. Not up to that standard at all.<br/><br/>What was wrong with Jackson when he wrote so bad script, the characters's roles were stupid and the poor actors tried their best to cope with the characters. I am so disappointed what Jackson did to this movie, like he was in hurry and didn't find time and some child directed and prepared it. No emotional aspect just things happening, Just like B Grade movie.

What I saw was a good movie, but I did not expect it to hew to the story. And that's not bad, even though it's what the purists are getting offended about... but folks, Tolkien was a linguist, not a novelist. His books are not easy reads even though they are filled with complete worlds and amazing stories. The addition of Tauriel as a character bothered me none. The only true fault I have with this particular installment is the additional script work to tie it to the LOTR trilogy, that felt cheap and unnecessary... but it WAS entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I paid for a spectacle, and I got one.

","I am going to start this off like everybody else seems to start their reviews for these films. However, I am going to have to say that I hate the LOTR trilogy, the 2 previous Hobbit films and have never read the books. In my opinion, it is the most overrated film franchise to ever grace the cinema.<br/><br/>Firstly, the main problems with these films are the shear length of them. It seems that all fantasy films have to be over 2 hours. Now, I enjoy a three hour film as much as anyone else, but these films can easily cut 40-45 minutes out of each of them. In the 2 hour 24 minute BOTFA, there are 45 minute battle scenes and 10 minute monologues for every character, which make the finale incredibly tiresome and somewhat tedious. These are also the main problems I have with the LOTR franchise and the previous 2 Hobbit films. They take so much time faffing around and talking to each other for extended periods of time, that the ""adventure"" only starts in the last 30 minutes. It builds and builds through the film to a point where you think it's going to climax and then they decide to end it and then shove another 2 films after them. <br/><br/>By my understanding, the main character is meant to be Bilbo Baggins, which is why I gathered the films are called The Hobbit. However I think Peter Jackson, the director of this monstrosity, has forgotten this. The whole film hinders on what Thorin says or does, not Bilbo. Mr Freeman has a battle of his own in order to try and get some screen- time off Richard Armitage, who hogs the screen like a baby with a toy. Bilbo Baggins has some important things to do in the first 30 minutes of the film, but then seems to just fade away as the battle commences. Throughout the battle as Thorin has his 30 minute fight, Baggins is just thrown into a few scenes, as if Peter Jackson was trying to remind us that he actually is in this film. <br/><br/>My next problem is, actually something Peter Jackson is normally good at in the other films, the battle itself. The battle is all about the gold and how all five armies want it, pretty simple. However, the principle is lost somewhere along the long 45 minute winding road and eventually doesn't really conclude on anything. Maybe it's the ridiculous point where two of the characters start hugging and have a little catch up in the middle of the ""blood shed"". In all seriousness the principle of the battle is completely lost when Legolas and Thorin decide to wonder off and have a little scrap with the opposing leaders. Tragic death after tragic death occurs every ten minutes, making the scenes incredibly tiresome and a little repetitive. In fact, I actually found myself laughing at the ridiculously theatrical death of, the new main character, Thorin. After Killing his counterpart and getting stabbed in the process, he nonchalantly manages to get up and walk over to the cliff edge to see that the war is ending, this is where I questioned myself in whether I actually saw him get stabbed, but then in a very classic cliché style he collapses to the floor and dies. Hilarious. Meanwhile, Mr Baggins is running about heroically killing a shed load of soldiers by throwing stones off their heads, the very soldiers who seem to only die when either getting viciously stabbed and/or crushed. As for the forgettable main battle, the enemies seem to retreat back into their worm-holes, go home and that is all she wrote. However, the whole reason of the battle isn't answered. Who gets the gold? How is the gold separated? What happens to the shiny necklace and sparkly stone? Peter Jackson decides to breeze past these fundamental answers that are needed to be addressed and focuses mainly on The Hobbit getting back to the Shire safe and sound. Phew. <br/><br/>Lastly, I want to briefly mention the CGI, which is particularly awful. I don't know much about CGI, but it was incredibly noticeable and made the box office ""smash"" look cheap. <br/><br/>Even though it may not seem that I liked any of this film, there were some positives. The casting is very good; Martin Freeman makes the role of Bilbo Baggins his own and acts well throughout the trilogy. In addition, Richard Armitage and the dwarfs were exceptional. Sir Ian Mckellen is and has always been a fantastic Gandalf, however not even his finest could save this film. <br/><br/>To conclude, for people reading this review, save yourself £24 in cinema fees and over 7 hours of your life on these films. Go out and watch something a lot more worth your while. Some people may say that because I haven't read the books my opinion may be rendered useless, but as the average movie goer I urge you to listen to me and take my advice. I believe that many LOTR fans are stuck in this Peter Jackson bubble that whatever money making tripe he puts out has to be good, when in fact to burst the metaphorical bubble, they are not."

","What in god's holy name was this? I mean holy god it abandoned all pretense of being a serious hobbit movie. The minute Galadriel busted out her weirded up zombie magic to beat Sauron back, I got confused. When enormous earthworms burst out of the mountain to let the goblins through, I was even more confused. When Dain told the elves to Sod Off, I gave up and started laughing. I mean, holy god, what bad From-Outer-Spaces were the screenwriters on when they wrote this masterpiece? Azog stabbed Thorin in the foot through like a foot of ice, for Fegelein's sakes! They then concluded the hackneyed romance plot with three elves who will never love again and some From-Outer-Space chosen one implication of Aragorn, with From-Outer-Spaceanduil or whatever his name was telling Legolas to go find someone called Strider. I couldn't follow the plot and I do a lot of From-outer-spaces, guys. I loved the From-Outer-Spaces out of this movie and would not change a thing. Ten out of Ten, will watch again. Preferably From-Outer-Space."
"armyofrichard","Null","2","7","21 December 2014"," Poorly created elves&storyline, excellently acted out characters
","This was by far the worst of all of PJ's Tolkien series. How much should the filmmakers compromise in order to pander to the cheap sentiment that they so condescendingly attribute to the theatergoers to the point it is utterly painful and bizarre to watch? For the most part, the elves that PJ decided to put in to the Hobbit series were a sheer disaster and nothing more. Besides the fact that Tauriel would in fact aim an arrow at the Elven King while crying and yelling, ""there is no love in you"" and the Elven King furiously slashes only the bow and angrily lectures on what a true love is...oh wow. OH WOW. ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDIN ME? I was not informed of the change of the genre from a classic fantasy movie to this cheesy fan fiction kind - and know what? There are fan fictions written way better out there than what I saw in this movie. I could only laugh over the oddly devised jealousy that Legolas shows toward Kili and Tauriel and the distasteful obsession with romance in the movie climaxed when Tauriel cried over dead Kili, ""why does it hurt so much? Please let this pain go away"" or somewhere along those lines and the Elven King responds sullenly ""Perhaps the love was real"". Oh and do not forget all the other parts where the movie keeps on trying so hard to remind the audience of the LOTR series and does it so obviously and unappealingly. I wanted to scream STOP the film NOW. Somebody make the elves STOP TALKING out of their character or against the Tolkien world or just against good sense and taste in general. And so much time was wasted on the unnecessary character like Alfred. He was probably attempting to lighten up the battle scene with some humor but it was a miserable try. Look PJ - we do not care what he does with his fake boobs, stop wasting our time. Why did PJ or whoever else tried to exert control over the direction of the film kill it so badly? And this is my farewell to the Middle Earth in cinema. That is the worst part. The revolutionary creator of Middle Earth film a decade ago who still makes my heart beat with the LOTR series is not the same person I saw with this series, and definitely not with this finale. That was as bad as a bad break up.<br/><br/>What was even worse was that the actors in general devoted so much of their passion and did it so well to make the characters come to life. I can mention a few, but among them all, Thorin Oakenshield was exceptionally captivating as a character and it was exciting to follow his transition from the mad king to a heroic figure at the end. It was incredibly well acted out by Richard Armitage and I actually could understand a widely hated character like Thorin despite his stubbornness, greed, petulance, and all the flaws that made the character that much real. Martin Freeman was a natural Bilbo and a very great selection for the role. I wish the film could have focused more on the development of these characters and dwarfs rather than the elves who were not even there in the original story or the Tolkien world. I see how WB might have thought the elves are the eye candies that easily attract the general audience, and I am not sure but maybe it might have succeeded to some extent. However, the apparent compromise has disillusioned me as a fan of LOTR and the Middle Earth series. You might have earned more dollars, but only at the cost of long held respect. I've lost faith in PJ as a director and anyone in charge of directing this movie. What a pity.<br/><br/>I am so glad at least they had a good sense not to bring in Aragorn to the film - Seeing how Legolas's character was destroyed in this series, it would have been the worst nightmare to see that happen to our Strider."
"zachary-potratz","9","2","7","21 December 2014"," Great way to sum up the Series
","Peter Jackson did a great job summing up The Hobbit in The Battle of Five Armies. He also did a great job tying the hobbit into Lord of the Rings. There was a lot of great action and battles along with a great story behind it. Out of the three Hobbit movies this is my favorite to watch. I also liked how they added an extra story line in the movies besides just what happens in the book. I was impressed with how great the graphics were in the movie. Even if you have not read the book you would still love the movie. One thing that I believe wasn't needed was the three part series. I think it could have been filmed in two parts and still have been a great movie series. Overall though it was a great movie and I would definitely recommend it to people who love action packed movies and adventure. I also recommend you read the book The Hobbit if you have not done so."
"japhetaguirre","8","2","7","14 December 2014"," There and Back Again...
","Battle of Five Armies is the conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy - the book that should've been a single movie. The movie starts just after the events of the second film, Smaug heading to Laketown. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is just OK. Not awesome. What kills the film for me is that it relies too much on CGI. Yes, the Battle is great but would've been awesome if is not CGI-heavy. Upside? The acting of course. They may have change the title to ""BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES"" due to marketing purpose, but the story still centers around Bilbo, played again wonderfully by Martin Freeman. He is the heart and soul of the film. Thorin is also wonderfully acted. As for other like Gandalf? Well, he's just there.<br/><br/>It may not be the best send-off, but it still did justice to the book. Some part in the book may been left out, but I'm hoping that it would be in the extended edition. Hail, Tolkien fans."

","As a huge fan of The Lord of the rings and the first 2 hobbit films I was slightly disappointed by this film but still a very good film defiantly worth watching. Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are both still awesome in their roles as Bilbo and Gandalf as expected. Richard Armatidge also very effectively shows Thorins descent into madness and Legolas is still a badass, however there was one character that was completely overdone and I feel had no place in the movie, this was the masters assistant Alfrid, he was the main problem with this film. The battle scenes where great and epic but slightly over the top and forced at times especially the CGI trolls and I think the battles would have been slightly better without them. The ending scene to this film in my opinion was spectacular and beautifully done Sad to see middle earth go Overall a good final send of to middle earth with mostly good performances and characters, but not quite on par with the other middle earth films"
"sesht","Null","2","7","13 December 2014"," There...and back again
","Well...it's finally over, though it did not show the embodiment of Sauron pre-Mordor. 3 more movies await us, I suppose, and it's all so tiring. <br/><br/>However, the action, and the CGI, along with the 3D augmented cinematography, is consistently spectacular, though not as real- seeming as the first LOTR movies were, and I love my action movies gritty and earthy, not as squeaky-clean as Jackson makes Middle Earth look.<br/><br/>The LOTR movies are much better than this Hobbit series and its still sad to note all the padding that has gone into this that went into extending the planned 2-movie series into the 3 that finally turned out, but in spite of that, these are deffo better than the Harry Potter works, and I bring that up since they eschewed most of the aspects that were in the books to bring us edited-yet-bloated works, in spite of their quality improving with the 3rd work.<br/><br/>Another thing that struck me was that the stupid cliffhanger-ending in the 3nd one was completely unwarranted, esp. since this one continues right after, and the climax for that could have been the prelude that this one made it as. Everything on that aspect screams 'cash-grab' loud-and-clear, and I almost wish I had denied Peter Jackson and WB/New Line the moolah they'd planned for, but they'd have gotten it anyway.<br/><br/>Another grouse of mine on this series: the sword-and-sorcery aspect of this entire series, including the LOTR ones, though those did it better, is muted, and this is due to the PG-13 rating that they have to work with. Now, I haven't seen the extended editions of the LOTR movies, and my friends promised me that they had 'fixed' the rating aspect on those, but no one got to watch that on the 'actual' big- screen now, did they? Nope. So, though this one has exactly 3 set- pieces that are beautifully choreographed and wonderfully shot, the 'muted' aspect takes the impact, and dare I say, the fun, out of the proceedings completely. Something that did not saddle a movie like 'Gladiator' or 'Centurion', and those movies were the better for that.<br/><br/>A hard-R rating would've been the way to go on this one, and no amount of footage on the extended edition/s is gonna fix that for the big screen.<br/><br/>Something else that bothered me this time: Gandalf's sorcery - nada. Zilch. Not a single instance of the great wizard's sorcery is on (dis)play here, despite the so-called stakes that the 4 armies (yeah, 2 Orc armies - Azog and Bolg from Gundabad - really, 'Gunda'bad, lake-town humans - not very substantial but there nevertheless, 2 dwarf armies - merge the fellowship/company with the actual ones that Thorin's cousin brings along, and the mighty Elves: math deffo ain't a strong suit with Jackson, but he's laughing all the way to the bank, and you can bet he can count those pennies). Strange, considering they had that aspect covered with Cate Blanchett, Chris Lee and Hugo Weaving being conveniently on hand to spring Gandalf out of Sauron's clutches.<br/><br/>Yeah, so no Sauron, no Gandalf sorcery, no R-action, and bloated run-times. I'd probably recommend not watching this one or the ones that came before, but you're gonna do so anyway, and honestly, it has its moments, like the ones before did (curiously though, I remember 'Smaug', but am unable to recollect a single scene of the first one - probably a statement on the stretching they had to do to make the 2 movies into 3)."
"roman-velitskiy","7","2","7","12 December 2014"," Peculiar aftertaste
","I'll try to be as impartial as possible and though I'm a huge fan of LOTR universe I look from the point of view of an average viewer who hasn't read any book by Tolkien. <br/><br/>First things first. I really enjoyed the movie. IMAX technologies and the movie's special effects were stunning. At the certain moment I found myself cowering on the chair when Azog was smashing ice with his giant chain. Still I want to mention two things that caught my eye and became rotten apples of the movie. <br/><br/>Number one - (some) dialogs. It's not about matching the original, it's about the distinctiveness of LOTR universe. The Hollywood dialogs kept me thinking I was watching a fantasy movie with common fantastic characters but not the prequel to LOTR. The last straw was Tauriel holding her beloved and dead Kili saying ""Why is love so cruel?"" and the following reply of Thranduil. <br/><br/>Number two - (some) kills. There are basic means to make the moment as dramatic as possible. Like to make a villain watch his prey suffering and waiting for death for a couple of minutes before actually killing it. This works once with the main bad guy. Now let's count these ones in third part of The Hobbit: Smaug talking to Bard conveniently giving him the possibility to load the only weapon that can kill the dragon (1), Bolg holding Tauriel and waiting for Kili to save her (2), a Gundabad orc standing in front of Torin and waiting for Legolas to pierce him with the sword (3), and Azog waiting an eternity before killing Torin (4). And many more!<br/><br/>There were many more strange inexplicable things that could have been avoided. But then again I want to thank Peter Jackson for letting me dive into this big beautiful world ""one last time"". The movie leaves a peculiar aftertaste like you have eaten a good old strawberry ice- cream with a piece of bacon on top of it (not sure if it's the best allegory ever but it's the first thing that comes to mind)."
"tlotr_tloz","7","2","7","11 December 2014"," A bit more enjoyable than the second movie
","If you have accepted the direction the trilogy has taken the Hobbit, then this movie will entertain. The Battle of the Five Armies (TBotFA) fixes some of the problems of the previous titles, but introduces a few of its own.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the scene that should have been the ending of the second movie. TBotFA has no introduction, no flashback, not a single word on the story of the trilogy: it jumps straight into action. This type of opening works only if people have watched the second movie very recently.<br/><br/>With a bit over 2 hours, the movie sits at a much more comfortable length than the first two. TBotFA does not focus on irrelevant details, but sticks to the main story, resulting in a more satisfying pacing.<br/><br/>Now that the Dwarfs are stuck in the Lonely Mountain most of the time, the movie relies on many new characters. Because these characters were introduced in the second or even in the third movie, it is difficult to care about them. Several of the newer characters are just plain unlikable. A few fan-favorite characters do return, but sadly they only get between 5 seconds and 5 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>With so few female roles, the focus on Tauriel is understandable, welcome even. But the Dwarf-Elf romance continues to feel forced, uncomfortable and now even childish. This would not have been a problem if the relationship was not so prominent in the movie, but unfortunately it is.<br/><br/>The acting is not the problem here, the performances are top notch and are often a joy to watch. That is until the characters make unlikable decisions, giving the scenes an uncomfortable undertone. Often one does not know who to root for in the film. Although that may have been the purpose, it can be unsatisfying.<br/><br/>As for action, the bar has been further raised with TBotFA, basically turning the main characters into super heroes. For some viewers it may have reached the point where the action is unrealistic, unbelievable and therefore not enjoyable. Dwarfs killing armored Orcs with simple head-butts, or defeating whole battalions single handedly. Legolas' scenes are very guilty of this (and the question begs if he really deserves to be in 5 of the Tolkien films, one less than Gandalf). The one-on-one fights manage to make a huge deal of very little content.<br/><br/>The actual Battle in the second half of the movie is definitely fun to watch. 'Sit back and enjoy the show' seems to have been the idea here. Some scenes do tend to get messy, illogical and stretched out; new races and whole armies are introduced, but then hardly do anything of effect. With the movie named after the Battle, it seems the producers had to use a lot of filler material to keep it going for a while.<br/><br/>Once again the movie features breath-taking sceneries and everything looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. Finding a cinema that runs the movie in this quality is recommended.<br/><br/>Like the previous movies, TBotFA tries hard to be like Lord of the Rings. Sadly they still could not make it work. The decision to stray so much from the Hobbit tale that has proved itself for over 75 years will probably stay a topic of debate during the coming years.<br/><br/>If Lord of the Rings rules king, then its son The Hobbit is not the prince it should have been. It tried too hard and then barely made it to knighthood."

","I'll make this short, the movies were long and to be honest although I read the ""Lord"" trilogy when I was a teen, many times by the third movie I had enough. I was only mildly interested in the Hobbit. My eldest daughter though had the bug and we saw the Hobbit series.<br/><br/>I was a passably good movie, the sets elaborate, the acting excellent, the fight scenes predictably too long and the ending somehow almost too soon.<br/><br/>I think that it was important for Jackson to wrap this up on a high because although his movies are spectacular in every way there is only so much high fantasy that one can take, only so many Orc's to kill and only so many hours that one can devote to a series without becoming worn and jaded.<br/><br/>It is an enjoyable indulgence but in the end I think I'm glad that it's all over."

","i cannot easily compose all my thoughts and feelings and make a proper review so i will write down some random thoughts. But before i start writing anything else i have to say this:Congratulations to Richard Armitage for giving maybe the best performance of the whole Middle Earth Saga. He was fantastic and with the most mature navigation of Jackson so far,as far as the actors are concerned, he elevated Thorin in an unprecedented high level of an overall awe- inspiring performance.Such a dramatic power and charisma. Despite reading some spoilers i was still amazed.The absolute highlight of the film in my opinion. <br/><br/>Random thoughts: <br/><br/>1)Smaug's attack in Laketown.The whole sequence was great and very tense with the moment of death being the highlight of it closely followed by the Bard/Bain interaction. <br/><br/>2)The whole first 2/3's of the film are the most mature minutes of Jackson's career as a director with the exception of Alfrid. As much as i loved him in DOS,i believe his constant invasion in some scenes was detrimental in an otherwise almost perfect first 90 minutes. Besides that misstep every other single character moment really shines during all the politics and negotiations and the ""dragon sickness"" of Thorin. <br/><br/>3)The Dol Guldur sequence was amazing and it did not feel short at all.Galadriel vs Sauron was a visual feast and the sword fighting of Elrond/Saruman against the Nazgul was a very pleasant surprise.Something i had not seen before in any Middle Earth film. <br/><br/>4)Martin Freeman:my favourite Hobbit and again one of the most mature performances of the whole Saga and on par with the sweeping performance or Armitage in BOTFA.His character transformation was so visible in this film.My two cents.Lee Pace,Evangeline Lilly(tremendous surprise),Ken Stott , Luke Evans and Ian with stellar performances.Actually, the acting in the Hobbit films is much better than the one from the LOTR trilogy. <br/><br/>5)Some battle sequences are spectacular with Lee Pace and Lee Pace with his elk being the highlights of them.The arrival and characterisation of Dain Ironfoot was a very welcome surprise as well.I liked it very much but i wanted more of him.The moment where Thorin and the Dwarfs charge outside Erebor and join Dain and his clan in the battlefield with the words of Gandalf ""They are rallying for their King"" was very chilling.Made the hairs of my neck ""dance"" . <br/><br/>6)Ravenhill and the Fate of Durin's Sons:This is the sequence that had the most heartbreaking and thrilling parts but on the same time,the worst parts of this film.(Fortunately the worst were only two).And no,i do not refer to the deaths.All of them were greatly executed especially Kili's one which was the second most heartbreaking moment of the film after Thorin's last words to Bilbo.Aidan Turner and Evangeline Lilly nailed it. The mute pain in their faces during the inevitable death of our young Dwarf brought many tears in my eyes.The worst parts of this sequence were some overproduced moments during the two major duels,ThorinvsAzog and LegolasvsBolg which i found distracting and completely unnecessary since the build up of the tension was satisfying. <br/><br/>7)The relationship between Thorin and Bilbo. Enough said.It was perfect and better than i had imagined it to be. <br/><br/>8)The ending did not feel so rushed to me.Sure,some scenes are missing but it was fine for a theatrical edition. <br/><br/>All in all i can safely state that the 2/3's of the film- with the exception of the distracting Alfrid- and the ending are probably pieces of Jackson's most mature work.Everything worked out so fine. Some of the best character moments and acting performances of the whole series can be found in there. The main battle itself consisted of some spectacular sequences but it was more than obvious that a pretty heavy editing was done there.I honestly expect 7-8 minutes more to feel more complete. Ravenhill sequence was definitely a highlight as a whole but as i previously stated,the overproduced duels diminished the power of it and i honestly cannot think of a good reason for doing so since the build up of tension after Fili's tragic and shocking death was appropriate. Kili's death was probably one of the most heart breaking moment of this film if not the most. Even if i was expecting it, it came across as a very poignant scene with Turner and Lily truly nailing the expression of their mute pain plus the single tear coming down from Turner's eye made my eyes water very much. <br/><br/>Some goosebumps moments:<br/><br/>1)Thorin and company charging out of Erebor,Dain shouting ""For the King"" and Gandalf's line ""They are rallying to their King"".Great moment <br/><br/>2)The Horn of Dale playing Thorin and Durin's folk theme at the end with the Laketown men devastated by their loss. My two cents. <br/><br/>3)Galadriel's words towards Sauron during his banishing from Dol Guldur. <br/><br/>4)""Bain! Look at Me"" <br/><br/>5)Thranduil using his both swords and fighting alone the Orcs after the death of his elk. <br/><br/>6)Kili's tear and Tauriel's reaction <br/><br/>A very emotional film slightly diminished by -""really trying to be more spectacular than anything else""- some individual scenes. I am really looking forward to the extended edition of 30 more minutes that will clear some unresolved matters as well."

","As for me, this film is the best one in the entire Hobbit series. It's not because it's the last film, just because it has some exciting fight scenes. The Hobbit series gives me a different taste. Mostly because the main character and his peoplr are shorter than normal people and so, they are cute. Just kidding. 😁 The main reason is it has a lot of awesome things.<br/><br/>As the title says, the five armies. The elf army is the best. I can't believe that Legolas' father is such a coward. I can't even distinguish whether he wants to protect his people, he doesn't want to be part of the other people's businesses for no reason or he's just simply afraid. No matter what it is, he seems to be a coward, so, I don't like him that much.<br/><br/>What I love is those awesome scenes where Legolas fight with the Orc. The scene he walks up by stepping onto the bricks when he's falling down is the best in the entire film.

The Battle of the Five Armies started as it intended to end, the action sequences were again excellent and creative. There were many memorable moments which were both intelligent and spectacular. I never found it slow and the battles were indeed dramatic however it seems Peter Jacksons ideas have become a little more predictable when you constantly know whats coming at big moments.

","Warning: May contain plot spoilers for people unfamiliar with the story.<br/><br/>The version I watched was only 2 hours and 10 minutes, a reprieve from the 3 hour marathons of bladder hell and missed scenes. The film picks up right where the other one leaves off, although it would have been nice to have included the last couple of minutes of the second one. After the defeat of the dragon, the film goes into about 40 minutes of badly scripted drama, which included lines used in previous films, making it a bit trite. I was looking forward to the battle which unfortunately consumed most of the remainder of the film. I reached a point I was wishing the battle scene to end, although the title of the film hints at what to expect.<br/><br/>The use of characters not in the book creates some plot continuity issues as well as creating those that weren't. Peter Jackson creates personal drama in the film which was not in the books. His fight scenes which consume much of the film series are typically one line or paragraph in a four volume series. Clearly some aspects of the books have to go like a chapter dedicated to the care and feeding of Shadowfax. Personally in the middle of battle, I don't think that ring would have left my finger.<br/><br/>As far as purchasing, I am a true fan and will patiently wait for all the series to be out on a special edition extended Blu-ray at an outrageous price I won't think about twice."

A shroud that covers the west of Middle Earthbut we'll leave that for the sequels in the Lord of the Rings movies to tell that side of the story. This movie deals with the battle that ensues between the forces of dark and the forces of the good of those who have hope for Middle Earth. I am glad Peter Jackson went back to tell the story of how we begin our journey into the land of Middle Earth and how we came upon the One Ring. This movie was the breaking point between the gap of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It brings that fresh depth of how we know the story. So what happens next?

Though the book and movie were very different due to the added scenes that weren't written in the book, like the scenes, that helped complete the movie and create romance and drama that brought this movie to the modern era of viewers, but I can tell you the scenes added won't disappoint you. By how the movie turned out compared to Tolkien's wonderful book it is a credit to Peter Jackson for cramming such a great book in just 3-4 hours because viewers will get bored but he did the best he could to fit all of the book in. While The Anticipation For this movie was tremendous because you have to wait a year between the Desolation of Smaug To Battle of Five Armies, as their was lots of pressure to Peter Jackson to make the conclusion live up to the movies potential that the viewers would like to make a box office hit and a movie to remember with fans and it is a movie to remember for years to come like the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that all of the cast played their role very well and Martin Freeman was perfect for the role of Bilbo Baggins, He showed a reluctant warrior (or Burglar) that persisted and showed courage to get the dwarfs back to their home. From start to finish this movie is full of action drama with a dose of romance which leads to a conclusion to a great story which will be know to the next generation of Middle Earth Enthusiasts."

","I can't say that I was anticipating this film a whole lot. After the first two films I felt this third installment was in that same vein in terms of level of entertainment. <br/><br/>I don't know why, but this movie didn't capture my imagination like the fantasy films I grew up with which were by far more primitive in the technical department, but seemed to have a bit more heart than Jackon's take on Tolkien's Hobbit tale.<br/><br/>This movie opens with the battle between Smaug and the people of Laketown. To me it was somewhat anticlimactic, but I understand why it was put in the opening of this film, and not as the climax at the end of the second film, but it still feels like a bit of an odd fit.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the climactic battle at the end of ""The Hobbit"", and it's done a-la Peter Jackson; lots of action twists and drama.<br/><br/>And I guess that's my only real complaint about Jackson's films (including the Rings movies), and that is that they do seem to be a bit over dramatic, full of angst and pathos where perhaps there wasn't any in the original tale. And I guess that's why that in the end, even though I can accept and enjoy the films for what they are, I really didn't connect with them as such, and still have a kind of detached like for them.<br/><br/>Hey look, I won't come down on the films. I think they're okay. I do think they're a bit over dynamic, overwrought in the drama department, but good technical explorations of how far a good competent director can take a beloved myth cinematic-ally.<br/><br/>However, when all is said and done, I think I still prefer the primitive Rankin-Bass animated special that aired all those decades ago (now on DVD). For some reason there's a bit more magic in that version than I found in these films.<br/><br/>The Battle of Five Armies, again just my personal opinion, seemed a bit over the top in the action department, but that's Jackson's style. There wasn't much in the way of explaining how and why some of the powers got to be where they are, and it did seem very much like the people of Dale / Laketown were under-represented, and given a rag- tag fugitive look than what came across in the book.<br/><br/>All in all these are competent movies, but I think they're made for a myth savvy younger generation, and perhaps not quite for kids or adults who would have also liked to have enjoyed the tale on a more basic level.<br/><br/>Enjoy or watch at your own risk as you see fit."

","The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies offers one of the most exciting beginnings in a film I've seen in a while. With the ending of the second film I was excited to see what more the dragon Smaug, was going to do. And for the first 10 minutes of the film I was on the edge of my seat and shoving popcorn in my face. I was having a blast, the dragon was doing really cool and evil things that made up for the boring first film. I was relieved that finally there is some real excitement and fun. However, that was short lived as something happened that made me very upset and ruined everything for me. The dragon gets killed in the stupidest and lamest way possible by being speared by the Black Arrow. I was so upset that they killed the coolest character in the entire franchise in the worst way possible. And this character had a lot of build up making me pumped to see him. But what a horrible way to kill such a great character. So, after Smaug is killed the film carries on and its only 10 minutes into the movie and I went from really excited to being upset, with that it just brought the movie way down for me. The film just fell flat. The battles weren't very gratifying, except for the first one with Smaug, but thats it. I think they should have kept Smaug in the film longer, because we just didn't get to experience him enough. If you think about it he was only in the franchise for 30 minutes before he is killed. We see him at the end of the second film for about 20 minutes, then in this one he is seen for 10 minutes before he gets killed. As a whole this film was a disappointment, and there isn't much else to say about it other then what I said, which is the main attraction to this franchise in the first place. Smaug is the only reason I wanted to see this film, and he himself didn't disappoint, but the way he was handled not so much. Now to grade it.

","I was a huge fan of 'The Lord of the Rings' movies and, for once, I actually read all the books when I was young – including the 'prequel' – the Hobbit. Therefore, I was always looking forward to the Hobbit movies. And, I think I was pleased – somewhere. The first two films were just long. We all knew that because The Hobbit was a small book, split into three looooong movies. Even though I've seen both previous instalments, I can't actually remember much about either of them. There were a couple of memorable moments, but, in between Parts II and III, I've managed to pretty much forget almost everything I'd seen (apart from the fact that there were too many CGI scenes and situations where the heroes could never survived!).<br/><br/>However, here we have 'Part III' and, in my opinion, it is a bit better. Granted, most of the movie is one loooong battle scene. It's like the 'Helm's Deep' battle from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, only stretched out for the entire film. Yes, there was as much computer-generated stuff, but it felt slightly more polished than its predecessors. I never really went for the CGI in any of the Hobbit movies. Even though they've been made over ten years after the Lord of the Rings trilogy ended, the CGI seems to have gotten worse over the years.<br/><br/>Even though there was probably the least story in this film, it actually came off as the best – or most realistic. There were no ridiculous barrel-chases crashing down rivers, or gaggles of dwarfs bouncing down mineshafts and just getting up again without a scratch.<br/><br/>Once again, the titular Hobbit (played – again – excellently by Martin Freeman) is not in it enough, despite the film being named after him. Instead, the film focuses on characters who have been shoved in to pad it out, or the ones we just don't care that much about.<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing about The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, was it was actually the last one in the series and had a sense of resolution about it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I loved the Lord of the Rings films and I loved the Hobbit novel. I sort of enjoyed the first two movies, but definitely need to watch them again as I can hardly remember anything about them. At least this last one seems to have stuck in my mind a bit more and I don't reckon that I'll need to re-watch it quite so soon to remember what's happened. Yeah, it held my attention more than the others."

","I questioned the decision to make 3 movies out of such a short book. It could have happily been done in one, or at the most two. I blame the studio for pushing for a repeat trilogy, but Jackson seriously mishandled this opportunity. <br/><br/>The Battle of Five Armies covers approximately 5 pages of The Hobbit. To drag it out into a two and a half hour movie was asking way too much of the source material. To flesh out the story, in addition to making copious use of apocryphal material, Jackson made up a completely unnecessary and ridiculous love story. A useless takeaway from the original story. <br/><br/>No, there are no women in The Hobbit. But that's the way the story was written. And Tolkien is a damn literary genius. This is a gorgeous story and Jackson completely screwed the pooch with it."
"Marblebees","4","1","3","21 April 2015"," Sigh
","I'm gonna start off by saying that i loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy to death. When i heard Peter Jackson was returning with the hobbit i was excited to death. However i have now got nothing left but a bitter taste in my mouth. <br/><br/>First the good:<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo. Simple as that. Perfect. Every scene he is in he raises the movies enjoyment level, even given the weak material he was given.<br/><br/>The entertainment factor of seeing thousands of orcs/dwarfs/elves fighting is undeniable. It may be cheap, but honestly it is one of the best parts of the movie (And that really says a lot when it doesn't even come close to LOTR)<br/><br/>And those are pretty much the only positive points i have.<br/><br/>Now the bad:<br/><br/>Horrible, horrible writing ruins all tension, and turns cheesy and laughable way way to often. It's not OK for this kind of movie to go into the same kind of comedy you could expect from an Adam Sandler movie. It's just not. Where the LOTR humor never felt like it broke the atmosphere and seriousness of everything, it's just insane how much it ruins any connection you have to the movie. And it's laughable when the movie takes itself so seriously and yet throws so cheap jokes in your face. It gives me a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>CGI priorities the shiny above the believable. Why does everything look like it's had an instagram filter put over it? The color grading in LOTR was perfect, always changing to a new shade of color with every scene - and it always looked perfect. Here it just looks overexposed and cheap. And i know that since the hobbit is more of a children's book its supposed to be a little more colorful and cartoony or whatever - but honestly it looks horrible.<br/><br/>The plot here is beyond convenient. It's a combination of Peter Jackson doing everything he can to connect this movie to the LOTR trilogy, and stretching so few pages of the book to much film time. When a character is saved at the last minute, 10 times through the movie it just ends up being laughable. This script could seriously have been written by a twelve year old, and it would have been the same.<br/><br/>Spectacle > Logic. Legolas apparently has the ability to defy the laws of physics. Honestly i'm not gonna spoil what happens, but you'll know when you see it. I don't think i have ever laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be cool or bad ass.<br/><br/>No emotional connection to any characters at all. It just makes everything much worse when you can tell the movie wants you to get sad, but you just don't. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CONNECTION TO ANYONE.<br/><br/>SPOILER: Smaug dies 10 min in?!??!?! WTF, he was the BEST dragon to ever have been put on any screen EVER. He was the best part of the desolation of smaug, and cumberbatch was perfect as him. And then he just dies after a year of build up after the ending of the last movie.<br/><br/>All in all i don't think i have ever sighed so much in a movie before. It's just pathetic how badly this movie was handled."
"leonblackwood","5","1","3","19 April 2015"," Epic with loads of action! 5/10
","Review: As I didn't really remember the last movie, I honestly didn't have a clue about what was going on throughout this movie and it really did seem like a right mess. Some of the fighting scenes were quite impressive and the attention to detail was quite good, but I got lost halfway through the film and I didn't know who was who and what was what. The whole Hobbit franchise was a big disappointment for me and it was know way in the same class as the Lord Of The Rings franchise, which also got a bit confusing towards the end. There is a awful lot of action scenes, hence the title and some of the one on one epic battles were great but I really couldn't get into the whole story. Maybe if I read the books or watched each movie back to back, I would enjoy it much more but I don't think that I'm that interested to spend hours watching it right from the very beginning again. Judging by he box office takings, I doubt that many people will agree with my comments about the film and I'm sure that the true fanatics will be cursing me for saying anything bad about it but no matter how hard I tried to get into the movie, I just didn't find it that great. On the plus side, the costumes and cinematography was great and the CGI was top class, which wasn't that surprising, and I liked some of the characters like the obvious Gandalf and Thorin but Bilbo Baggins was completely useless in this film. Anyway, although the film nearly made a billion dollars at the box office, I didn't think that it was that great but it is an epic movie that has some impressive action scenes. Average but epic!<br/><br/>Round-Up: The dragon scene at the beginning was a great way to start off this epic 2 hour movie but I got lost after a while. I also liked the fighting scene with Thorin on the ice but the outcome was a bit obvious. Peter Jackson obviously wanted to stay away from the whole ring aspect of the storyline, as it really wasn't mentioned that much but it could have done with a break from the constant battles. As I didn't know any of the characters names and what side was what, the script sounded like a load of gobbly gook to me so I just concentrated on the action scenes most of the time. It was good to see some of the old faces like Gandalf, Galadriel, Lego last and Elrond but it's mostly based around Thorin and Bard who are fighting for the greater good. Anyway, I can't say that I will miss this franchise or that I would want to see a reboot in years to come but it is a massive achievement for Peter Jackson who took on the massive task of bringing these books to the big screen.<br/><br/>Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $955million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Hobbit franchise and who love there full blown action/adventure movies. 5/10"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014) is good ending to a trilogy and a fine link to the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. It's spectacular, big, involving and etc. There are a lot of CGI in this movie, and although they weren't really special, they were OK. This is the first movie which wasn't nominated for Oscar in special effects category and you can see why, some of the CGI is not the best that we saw in series, and some shoots are even poor. Nevertheless, they don't distract from the movie - without them it would be impossible to create such a vision. The movie which runs for 2 h 17 min is superbly paced and never drags. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a heavy action oriented installment - there are plenty of action scenes and fights and they pretty spectacular and involving, especially that wight at the end one on one. The end of the battle kinda felt rushed a bit, with no real ending of the battle shown. Nevertheless, this movie is a very fine installment and it delivers. The last scene is love letter to all fans."

Despite Jackson's best efforts, this entire trilogy feels totally and completely inconsequential."

"tomgillespie2002","5","1","3","20 March 2015"," An underwhelming finale to an underwhelming trilogy
","In Tolkien's book, the line goes ""and so began a battle than none had expected; and it was called the Battle of the Five Armies, and it was very terrible."" The slim-line novel is very much anti-war, which makes Peter Jackson's decision to turn a short chapter into a 160-minute battle sequence all the more perplexing. The comparisons you can make to 2003's The Return of the King are almost endless, but The Battle of the Five Armies fails to achieve the same level of excitement as the multiple Oscar winner as it forgets about its characters. This is essentially Bilbo's story, but once again he is lost amongst the indistinguishable dwarfs, CGI fighting and frequent detours linking this franchise to Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>It starts off where The Desolation of Smaug left us, with the super- p****d dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) about to lay waste to Lake Town. Inside the Lonely Mountain, dwarf Thorin (Richard Armitage) obsesses over his newly-found treasure, but becomes increasingly paranoid at the disappearance of the Arkenstone, which was taken by hobbit Bilbo (Martin Freeman) during his face-off with Smuag. Meanwhile, wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is helping rid Dol Guldur of Sauron, an evil force who is increasing his power. Elves Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) ally themselves with human Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans), while Legolas's father Thranduil (Lee Pace) arrives with an army of his own, seeking to claim an elven necklace from the Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>The main problem with The Hobbit trilogy as a whole is Jackson's failure to spend enough time with any of it's huge cast. Bilbo is all but left out of his own story yet again, and the extra attention paid to Thorin's struggle with his own blind greed comes across as a hypocritical parable to Jackson's own decision to stretch out a thin book into three blockbusting movies. So while the film is undeniably entertaining, it is little more than a collection of clashing swords, sweeping CGI and badly timed comedy, loosely strung together by scenes of awkward dialogue, unconvincing romantic swooning, and Christopher Lee beating up baddies with a staff like Chuck Norris on steroids.<br/><br/>It's a shame that The Hobbit trilogy has been so underwhelming, and quite surprising too. Given that Lord of the Rings was so successful in bringing Tolkien's mythology to life, with action scenes that seemed so innovative and such a strong grasp on its characters, you would expect more of the same. It feels like Jackson simply expected the audience to warm to Bilbo, Thorin et al because they are part of the same world, so didn't put his heart into it. The humour is off too, with a horrendously CGI'd Billy Connolly turning up as a head- butting dwarf, delivering cringe-worthy lines you would expect from a pantomime starring Christopher Biggins. A few exciting moments save it from disaster, but after almost 9 hours of this story, I'm just glad the whole thing is over.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"gsparks07","7","1","3","12 March 2015"," An Unexpected Disappointment
","So what did I think of The Hobbit Trilogy? Well, disappointing to say the least. Poor character development, uneven GCI quality, bloated runtime, zero emotional investment, etc. The Hobbit had it's fair share of problems, and I think I know why.<br/><br/>First of all, nobody wanted to make these movies to begin with. As far back as the mid 90s Peter Jackson, director of what's now coined The Middle-Earth Saga was interested in making the LOTR films and expressed that making a movie for The Hobbit would be much more challenging due to the wealth of characters that had no development in the book and thus wouldn't translate to film very well. For those of you that don't know, The Hobbit was in development hell for years. Right after the final film in the LOTR trilogy came out in 2003, everyone was wondering if we would ever see a movie based on the prequel story, The Hobbit. The details are a bit fuzzy now but Guillermo del Toro was set to direct it in two parts but pulled out of the project just months before filming began for unknown reasons. To everyone's surprise though, Peter Jackson swooped in to save the project. Needless to say, fans of the LOTR films thought this was probably the greatest thing that could have happened, but I can't help but feel some of that past reluctance was still with Jackson. Maybe the studio had to pay him an incredible amount to come back. Just a theory mind you but consider this...<br/><br/>After Jackson came in, the movies changed. Though we didn't know much at this point, we did know that it was gong to be two films based on The Hobbit. Then the planned pair of Hobbit films became a proper trilogy. Yeah, this is where things got messy. So the reasoning behind the extra film is that they wanted to tell the story of the white councils (consisting of Gandalf, Saruman, Galadriel, and Elrond) actions during Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfs. It would take an entire third film to do this as all of this took place on the other side of Middle-Earth (or a few hundred miles south at least) and was not in The Hobbit but explained later in a different Tolkien book. This eventually leads to Bilbo standing in the background for the majority of the third film but that's a relatively minor gripe. Where things simply didn't mesh in all of this is when we are introduced to a brand new original character as well as the return of Legolas from the LOTR trilogy for no reason other than to pad out these already bloated movies with a love triangle that goes absolutely nowhere. We also briefly see Ian Holm and Elijah Wood as Old Bilbo, and Frodo Baggins respectively. I imagine this was the studios idea to constantly remind us of the LOTR trilogy to create buzz in an attempt to replicate the first trilogy's success. It backfires by wasting too much time on these unnecessary glorified cameos. Speaking of time management...<br/><br/>It's all made worse by a tight production schedule that had these movies being delivered under-cooked. I'm talking mainly about the special effects here. In LOTR the effects were pretty impressive for the time and CGI was used sparingly. All the Orcs were real people in makeup, sets were bigger with less green screen, and wide shots of miniatures were used to great effect in making all the locations look real, and grand in scale. In comparison, The Hobbit trilogy is bad with this stuff, like, Star Wars Prequel Trilogy bad when it comes not just to the abundance of CGI, but to the flux in quality. It just looks like crap at times. I mean, at least by Episode 3 the effects on Star Wars had been polished to the point of believably. It's the opposite here. While Gollum, and Smaug look great in the first two films respectively, there are points in the final Hobbit film that look about as photo-realistic to the live-action characters as an early Xbox 360 game. Not once was I fooled nor was I impressed by the third film visually.<br/><br/>So what The Hobbit Trilogy basically is, are three bloated films with bad GCI living in the shadow of a trilogy of equally long, but well paced and expertly crafted films in every conceivable way.<br/><br/>What's the worst is that I can see a pair of films worthy of the Peter Jackson pedigree here. Take out the forced love triangle, the Bowman's story and the White Counsel plot threads and you have two films worth every bit of recognition shoehorning Legolas and Frodo into these movies would have gotten them. Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo. Gandalf, and the dwarfs are more or less what you imagined from the book and the humor of the first film sits at just the right place to remind you that this story was based on a children's book, but takes place in an adults universe. The heart is there too. Themes of a people longing to return to their lost home, vengeance for fallen loved ones, and the lesson of what it means to put others before yourself in times of need are all present but never brought full circle. These films never stop to subtly point out the deeper meaning of things the way the Lord of the Rings films did, and it's disappointing."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","3","11 March 2015"," Toyworld
","By now it's clear what they needed to do here, to wholly reinvent the story as prelude to the apocalypse of LOTR. Then we could have momentum, imports, deep orchestration, destiny as foreknowledge of inevitables. The book was not originally so, it was modestly conceived as a standalone with the mythology expanded and embellished in later years up until Tolkien's death and beyond. Instead we have tacky interjections of LOTR and the thin book blown up into a funpark ride. A failure.<br/><br/>But this lets me talk about something else. Why LOTR worked so well is because we had an immersive story, or marvelous stretches of it, seen through kids' eyes (hobbits) as they encountered ancient beings of unfathomable power, and we had a map of the larger world that we flitted back and forth to keep up with the journey, an inner view we explored and one from above that we had at our fingertips. We were swept.<br/><br/>Of the three films this is the one that perhaps comes closest to having some resemblance, with distinct armies coming from all four directions and converging on the same valley for the epic stand. Nearly the whole film takes place there. There is a sense of larger machinery beyond these horizons, one of which is Mordor. But there's also no sense of real adventure in a world we explore, at one point we travel up north merely to see an army advancing from there.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say; the whole is a giant toyworld. The best these can be is a pile of material for someone to edit into a single film that serves as introduction to LOTR marathons, I hear this has already happened online."
"adlion944","5","1","3","10 March 2015"," Peter Jackson channels George Lucas with his prequel trilogy
","Committing almost exactly the same sins as George Lucas, Peter Jackson utterly fails with his prequel trilogy. Bad plotting, weak characters, dumb plot sequences, bad production design/art, and an ugly distracting CGI sheen. Spoilers be ahead...<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that The Hobbit is a children's book with character whimsy and plot lightness. Jackson misses that tone entirely and instead makes an inferior LoTR retread. This film needed to be charming and lovable with some swashbuckling and puzzle-solving. The book was impossible to put down when I read it at age 13. Darn. What a miss.<br/><br/>The second problem is that this is cinema bloatware. 9 hours of cinema from a 300 page book when LoTR was 9 hours from 1,500 pages of 3 books. And it even skipped entire sections and themes from the source material, inventing characters and jamming Legolas down our throats, looking creepy and far too blue-eyed. GREED, not love of Tolkien or the craft of movie-making, led Jackson down this path. Wasn't he rich enough? <br/><br/>The third problem is that this film is plotted strangely and poory planned from a screen writing perspective. Story arc is non-existent from movie to movie. The hero is the Hobbit, not the drawf. Smaug was a brilliant CG character, but was ultimately a sidetrack, not the main event. The troll scene in the first film was just awful. And the barrel sequence in the 2nd film was straight out of Nintendo. Attack of the Clones droid factory bad. The finale of the BotFA was a retread of the white city. Orcs go down far to easily. They are not menacing when 3 foot dwarfs and hobbits can slaughter them by the dozen. The ease with which orcs go down was eye-rolling. Except when the plot requires a double-bill boss fight at the end, then all the sudden orcs are tough.<br/><br/>The last problem plagues the film on a superficial level and is the icing on the cake. It looks like 9 hours of gooey HDR photography. Too much saturation, too much Adobe Lightroom luminance. Everything is too crisp and looks wrong. If you thought LotR was vivid, this is dripping syrup. It's a bad fantasy painting come to life. The creatures have realistic clothing/skin and have never looked more fake. There are new creatures and new looks for existing creatures that break canon with the first trilogy. Ugh. These films just don't look good.<br/><br/>What we have here is an utter failure. Phantom Menace quality stuff. I just don't understand how Jackson lost his mind and made these movies other than greed and arrogance. I suppose he was surrounded by sychophants while planning this project. No Jar Jar Binks level idea was shot down. At least we have the original trilogy."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","10 March 2015"," It works, but that's about it
","Once again we return to Middle-Earth, this time to bid our farewells for now. The final Hobbit film improves upon the its immediate predecessor by focusing on the battle scenes and leaving much of the silliness out, but by now we've grown weary of the formula and this film doesn't quite reach the atmosphere and mood of the first Hobbit film, let alone the grandeur of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>I truly think Peter Jackson tried too hard to reach the golden middle road with this trilogy. This final installment being no exception. We do get the grand battles and splendid visuals that appeal to the fans of the original trilogy, but we also get dwarfs riding battle boars and speaking with funny Scottish accents, which probably appeals to those that liked he lighthearted tone of the original book. The first film managed to juggle these two contrasting tones, at least as long as the story stayed in Shire, where there is a place for lightheartedness yet somber conversations can happen by the fire. But now Erebor has been retaken and war is brewing on the horizon. I don't think we need battle boars or Legolas doing stunts that would be more at home in an anime. And yes, The Return of the King had similar problems, which is why it's the weakest of the original trilogy. But it didn't do it to this extent.<br/><br/>That being said, this is substantially less ridiculous than The Desolation of Smaug, which is a huge plus in the movie's favour. When it's time for battle, the battles are suitably epic and great to look at. And when the characters need to be serious, they can be and you feel bad because the odds are stacked heavily against them. I'm also grateful that Jackson decided to stick to the original ending. I sort of knew he wouldn't be that much a sellout, but the second movie had seriously shaken my resolve. Sorry for doubting you, Peter.<br/><br/>I also still like the additions from Tolkien's other works, such as Unfinished Tales, dealing with the White Council. They're cinematic beyond all believe and neatly tie the two trilogies together. No complaints from me, though I know some people don't like them at all.<br/><br/>As a whole I'm glad this movie and the whole trilogy exist. They're still great films and they suffer only by being compared to the original trilogy, which has become one of the cornerstones of fantasy film genre. The Hobbit films have their flaws, but it's still Middle-Earth and I'd watch these over most other films there are."

","A confused succession of battles with random computer generated explosions. Ridiculous low and deep voices prophesying additional dramas, primarily consisting in the screen flickering in black, white and red. In short, a rough and noisy chaotic mess. The mixture of grotesque costumes and clumsy computer graphics regularly distracts us from the narrative. Poor dialogs, declaimed with theatricality, between exploding stuff, do not help to follow the story. The characters are soulless and frozen caricatures. Those guys should have had a look at Tolkien's writings, instead of watching Saint Seiya manga series, but they probably can't read. To be honest, I lowered down the volume and played crosswords after 30 minutes. I got much more excited..."
"vanassechris97","3","1","3","8 March 2015"," The Title is the only adequate thing about this movie
","First off let me say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are my favorite movies of all time, and I love all of Tolkien's work. Unlike many other harsh critics of the trilogy, I actually enjoyed the first Hobbit movie and liked the second. I thought the changes to the story line of the book to these movies (and the Lord of the Rings at that) were inevitable and for the most part tolerable. However, I am not at all rating and holding this movie to its faithfulness to the novel. As a motion picture, it was nothing but over-the-top, action crammed, CGI garbage. Lets start with the beginning: -First off, this movie doesn't truly have an exposition, climax, OR resolution: and although it tries desperately hard to pull each of these off, it miserably fails. The entire script was pretty much this: Smaug destroys Lake Town then dies, a bunch of random armies group together to fight each other, orcs attack them all, a bunch of people die, then the battle ends and Bilbo goes back home. These are only a few things that made this movie terrible: -The Dragon Smaug is in the movie at BEST for maybe 15 minutes. The movie starts when he attacks the town (kudos to the brilliant screenwriters who would end the second movie and start this movie at such a ridiculous point in the story) and he dies immediately following the beginning. Not only does he die so soon, but he gets killed by some guy using his son as a makeshift bow, which is apparently as powerful as a giant crossbow that couldn't even pierce the dragons hide the first time (the entire ""black arrow"" crap was just a recipe for plot-holes in the first place) -It seemed like more screen time was given to an incredibly ugly and annoying made up character named Alfred (no, not even speaking about Tauriel yet) than most of the Dwarfs in Thorin's company. -The battle scenes were pathetic and boring (compared to Peter Jackson's former work in making gritty yet epic battle scenes in Lord of the Rings), and this movie had PLENTY of them, full with rehearsed Elven Kung-Fu fighting, Hog- riding Scottish-accented dwarfs, and a lot CGI orchead decapitations. These scenes were all over the place, a mess of random cuts of footage. In order to keep up, you have to focus on what was left of the storyline. No epic charges, battle speeches, or moments of glory were actually included in this movie (And NO, that scene of Thorin conveniently regaining his sanity, rushing out of the mountain to give the other dwarfs ""backup"" to apparently make them ""regroup"" was nothing but an epic cesspool of bad scripting). This movie is truly a perfect example of the classic action-packed, CGI, fan appeasing, anti-profound movie. -What exactly are the Five Armies you ask?? I in fact don't really know. Well I guess I know of four: There are the dwarfs, the Elves, the Laketowners, and the orcs. What's the fifth? Forgetting about the book since apparently that's what Peter Jackson and the other filmmakers did, we could possibly include the other orc army that showed up after the first one, or maybe the random convenient Goblins, or maybe the bats ""bred for war"" that Legolas RODE on. This actually is never concretely explained in the movie. Obviously the filmmakers intended on the second orc army to be the fifth one, but with all that jumble of random plot items going on, it's a little hard to comprehend. -(Spoliers) At the end, Fili, Kili, and Thorin all die. Although this part of the story was actually in the book, the two brothers died for such stupid reasons, (and no, God forbid they die to defend their uncle, which was in the book and would make way more sense): Fili died because he's too stupid to figure out what an obvious trap is or something like that, and Kili, over a freaking Elf girl who's part in the story was for no other reason than to give it a little extra length and add an annoying and completely unnecessary romance (plus, the romance completely undermined Legolas and Gimli's relationship in LOTR, and the weird kiss she gave to his dead corpse: creepy) -Some more things that made this movie disappointing and less than mediocre: -Legolas defying gravity by running on falling rocks and riding on bats -A bunch of characters appearing then disappearing during the movie (Beorn, Radagast, Gandalf, The White Company) -Nothing but CGI, CGI, CGI everything -Thorin giving his cousin a hug during the middle of a battle -Thranduil being such a jerk throughout the entire movie -No funerals shown for Fili, Kili, or Thorin -No resolution for the Dwarfs of Erebor, or for the Laketown people Overall, I hated this movie, and I'm starting to feel that Peter Jackson has turned into another George Lucas, it's all about the money now I guess. No inspirational or epic moments whatsoever. Nothing like Lord of the Rings. I was infinitely disappointed. I gave it three stars because I liked the very end, and I liked Ian Mckellen and Martin Freeman. Other than that, I'm sick of all these fans adoring this weak fluff."

","To make myself feel better and to vent my now overmastering irritation with this director I shall offer my august reviewal of this movie, yes I know that is not a word. If you are reading this you should stop immediately as I am not a trained critic and I am horrible, ill tempered and unjust in all my actions. Actually those two are contradictory, maybe continue on.<br/><br/>(Very minor spoilers relating to scene progression)<br/><br/>As everything has already been said, I will share only my outrage with the first 10 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The movie begins strangely, directly into a battle with no introduction whatsoever. Minutes later the battle ends, awkwardly with an injection of overly emotional interaction between two characters that have been on screen for less than 5 minutes. A generic relationship is applied which apparently is supposed to supply all the depth we need to be immensely moved. Directly after the battle we are escorted to three different settings in less than 60 seconds, none of which follow the storyline of the book - our only reference to understanding this film even though it is the third in the series. After being blasted through a roller coaster of cut scenes, or three separate roller coasters, we return to the aftermath of the initial battle and are immediately introduced to an annoying, artificially hideoufied gentleman (like Wormtongue, a fine character in a fine movie) who is screaming and rolling around in shallow water for no discernible reason. Continuing from there we come to another very emotional scene between two characters who, while being main players, have yet to be re-introduced into this continuing story. There follows an emotional parting involving further main characters who have been on screen for less than 30 seconds which is not granted even an attempt at setup or context. At this point I left the film to write this review. I will continue to watch it because I know there will be magic, explosions, etcetera and I'm hoping the epic, overused music will be at a minimum or will at least be overpowered by epic, overused sound effects.<br/><br/>I've said enough. Peter Jackson is masquerading as a hyper-inflate and is horrible now at what he is doing. I suppose it can be argued that the relative circus of screenwriters let him down but no, it cannot be argued this way. Please, somebody, force him to create his own material before he butchers to break-even another legendary literary plot line."

","Compared with some others I have enjoyed the recent Hobbit trilogy that some fans of the novel have absolutely hated. I'm different though I love the book itself I feel the movies capture more of the Middle Earth that we wanted and showed it well. Although I was initially excited for the 3 part series this one I found was unnecessary even though I absolutely loved the action sequences in this.<br/><br/>The battle itself is phenomenal but even with its 45 minute runtime it still feels rushed somehow and I wanted to see more of the other characters like Dain who we see for no more then maybe a few minutes in battle. But otherwise this film was rushed Smaug's purge of Lake town was too short and far too rushed and maybe should've been concluded in the previous adaptation. Dol Guldur was clearly blitzed through which left a much anticipated confrontation a little sour in the end. <br/><br/>A much awaited conclusion and much loved series come to an end. Yet a few characters were made up and some side lined for a much smaller role the Battle of Five Armies does not fail to capitalize on the battle sequences but otherwise doesn't offer up much in terms of enjoyment. But even with the flaws and all the changes made from the source material the Battle of Five Armies is still an adventure worth finishing and fighting for.<br/><br/>Rating: A Comments: Best of the trilogy"
"meglio1989","6","1","3","5 January 2015"," The timing was right to end the trilogy
","I read all of Tolkein's books and own the LOTR's trilogy on DVD. Jackson did a great job with those three films in the early 2000's. It was like the original Star Wars Trilogy of the new millennium, people and fans went crazy with joy. The Hobbit trilogy has not had the same fate, don't get me wrong I own the two Hobbit films on Blu-Ray. I wanted to have these films in digital format,plus I love audio commentary and all the special features. The part that hurt these films is the ""story"" details that were not in the book were added in. This film the Five Armies, I believe was the weakest, it was very convoluted and some of the visual effects were so unrealistic involving the characters, I shook my head. You will see what I'm talking about when you watch the battle sequences in the film. I probably will go out and buy a Blu-Ray copy of the film to complete the trilogy and watch all those cool special features. I still respect Peter Jackson, no one's careers were hurt during the release of these films, and for the most part the acting was done very well, especially from Martin Freeman. I believe 2014 was a great time to release this film, because this film would be forgotten in 2015's line up of future blockbusters."
"keyos27","7","1","3","4 January 2015"," Lack of detail leads to two different opinions pronto
","As an avid fan of fantasy genre, I am fond of a fierce one-on-one combat, fighting neck and neck to the hilt. Not to mention the massive and fast-paced brawl that consists of jumbled armies scuffling with their spearheads leading the way. Thus I give this final film of the ""Hobbit"" trilogy, seven out of ten for captivating and scrambling sequences. However, the score might get reversed by those who are very passionate and keen about Tolkien's LOTR and Hobbit because even I could tell that this movie seems rushed by subliminally negating and compressing all the important events and elements that could have emblazoned the wonderful trilogy that has potential to lure people to buy the Blu-ray of LOTR series in order to complete the whole adventure.<br/><br/>It is truly a no-brainer since almost most contexts happen within a specific vicinity along with the duplicated CG armies in the widespread field. The highlight of the movie is surprisingly the emotional love tale between an elf and a dwarf which has its moment to make a lot of female audiences move. Sadly, the number of the characters seem redundant as only a few of them get a spotlight through ample cut scenes, which make them look somewhat underperformed.<br/><br/>As the outset kicks off strong with pep and whooshes to the nicely crafted battle scenes that are capable of keeping the audience entertained from various immersive angles and feisty actions that happen on thin ice as both actors and CG creatures are in unison, everyone will find out why the title of this movie is indeed ""The Battle of the Five Armies,"" Although, it is kind of hard to see how every soldier gets knocked out due to a constant camera moving left and right without enough close-ups. Other than that, it is worth watching in 3D and heed when it gets down to the wire."
"cathalokane","6","1","3","2 January 2015"," LOTR minus a coherent plot
","* Contains Spoilers * This is what you get if you take all the elements of the Lord of the Rings films, put them all together, but then forget to weave it all together with a convincing and coherent narrative.<br/><br/>What a disappointment! I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy but the Hobbit trilogy has really struggled to recreate the type of epic magic of LOTR. It was always going to be a difficult task, as the LOTR trilogy is epic to begin with - the plot lines are clear, and there are three books to neatly transform into three films.<br/><br/>Someone... somewhere... along the way, decided to stretch the story of ""the Hobbit"" out over three films - no easy task. When they realised there really wasn't enough content for that, it seems that they just decided to make lots of stuff up. In my opinion, that's fine, as long as it works (some people will understandably seriously disagree on this point). Sadly, it doesn't quite work here.<br/><br/>Return of the King has the type of once-in-a-generation film scenes of the Riders of Rohan charging into the fields of Pellenor, for example. This is the type of film moment we all remember but it wasn't just plonked into the film out of nowhere. This moment was carefully set up over the three films (books) to such an extent that it is one of the most exhilarating moments in any film ever. In this film, we have the ""Eagles"" arrive to save the day along with a load of erm... animal/people things, but at no stage do we understand why any of this has happened. It just does, and the day is won. And it falls a bit flat. It's as the narrative that got us to this final film wasn't quite right. And this is explainable, partially by the fact they strayed so far from the original story.<br/><br/>The character development is also sadly lacking across these films. I think we were supposed to fall in love with the seven (or however many there were) Dwarfs throughout these films, but I can barely remember a name of a single one of them apart from King Thorin. The makers rely heavily on transplanting established characters from LOTR into this picture to move things along, to such an extent that I am astonished they didn't toss ""Baby Frodo"" in right at the end. It all feels a little contrived and almost reminds you of the Star Wars prequels where much loved characters were shoehorned in for the sake of making the audience say ""oh yes, I know that face"".<br/><br/>Legolas, Saruman, Galadriel, the guy from the Matrix. They could all have just not been in this film and it wouldn't have made much difference. Oh actually, that's wrong I nearly cried my eyes out over the heart wrenching side-story about Legolas' mother. Not. (Or was this a horrible set up for a new film based on Lego? Ugggh).<br/><br/>This was not a terrible film, but it hardly comes close to the lofty standards set by Jackson himself."

Just for entertaining purpose, to whom like the kind of violence and ancient fantasy. <br/><br/>The character developing is not too bad, but a bit rushed. Tauriel and Kili: that escalated quickly. Just like teen crush. And ended with Kili's death. Too much death. The epopee needs to be woeful and majestic, and glories also mean many soldier perishing. The things come next is the sorrow of wars. Families break, and Legolas got friendzoned. <br/><br/>The scenes are so fake, generated by computers. Too shocking and dazzling, not as both imposing and mild as like in LOTR.

","If good ol' badass orc killin' is your thing, then you'll love this film. I definitely did. The beginning scene with Smaug is perfect, and the visual quality of the film is superb. There are many times in the film where you are on the edge of your seat, as there are many heroic and all round awesome/badass fight scenes which ultimately make the film what it is i.e. the scene with Elrond and Saruman fighting the mortal men. However, I could not help but laugh at some points in the film, where continuity and physics in general just went to pot. Firstly, Legolas jumping on the the falling stones on the bridge, just no. Secondly, the battle mountain goats, WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?! Did they store them in the mountain? In which case they would have to be fed, and it certainly wasn't the dragon who did it. Did they bring the goats with them the whole journey? I didn't see them. Thirdly, the white orc, who is in a horizontal position, with a sword stuck in Thorin's foot, about a metre below incredibly thick ice manages to leap and break through the ice and land upright. Where did he get the power to do this? He would have to get a ""run up"" or whatever, which clearly he did not get. Finally, LEGOLAS RUNS OUT OF ARROWS! This never even happened in the LOTR. Clearly there are never enough arrows in his quiver for the amount he actually uses, but we as the viewer just accept this. But when he runs out at a point where he most needs an arrow, it just isn't there. These are just 4 of the stupendous moments in the film which I could not hesitate to laugh at, purely because they make no sense. Nevertheless, you will still enjoy this film, because it is great."

"zanghi_james","9","1","4","28 September 2019"," A Great and Satisfying Conclusion to a well-done Fantasy Trilogy!
","(This is a review for the Extended Cut)<br/><br/>I don't know why some people don't like this film. Saw it in theaters, and I loved it. Watched the extended cut, loved it even more. I do have to mention that I think that the studio taking the film away from Peter Jackson and 'beefed it up' was unfair, especially since he is such a great director. However, I actually enjoyed the Kili-Tauriel romance and I think it works for the story.<br/><br/>Having read the book (The Hobbit) several times before watching this film (and seeing the animated film several times as well), I knew what would happen at the end in regards to certain characters, especially Thorin. Yet the way the film was shot and scripted, it gave me the (albeit brief) idea that Thorin and his nephews would survive, adding extra emotion to the film for me. I thought that Smaug was also killed off too soon, especially after his spectacular iconic performance in the previous film. But his performance is still pretty brilliant.<br/><br/>While Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are great, as usual, in their swan songs as Bilbo and Gandalf, Richard Armitage is fantastic as the tormented and troubled Thorin Oakenshield. I felt bad for Balin, though, since if you have read the books or seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know what his fate is. But he kind of wraps his role up with a blaze of glory in the Extended Cut. Orlando Bloom gives his character of Legolas much needed depth in this film with his performance as well, while Lee Pace is thoroughly detestable as the arrogant Thranduil. Evangeline Lily is great and kicks butt as Tauriel, and the story-arc with her and Kili is a nicely-done tragic love story. Luke Evans is enjoyable as Bard the Bowman, who gets a few great action scenes. Billy Connolly is, like Smaug, woefully underused in his performance...especially since he looks so freaking awesome as Dain Ironfoot.<br/><br/>The titular battle of the film is incredible. As other reviewers mention, it is a little similar to the Battle of the Pelannor Fields/Siege of Minas Tirith sequences in Return of the King, but it fortunately is able to stand on its own as well. After a couple of times watching, I think the Extended Cut's R-Rating is justified with the iconic battle. There is a lot of gruesome blood splatters and arterial sprays. Especially when those goat chariots come out.<br/><br/>Besides the battle itself, the other action scenes are breathtaking, most prominently the Rescue Mission to save Gandalf at Dol Goldur. The Nazgul are quite terrifying and demonic in appearance with their awesome-looking armor and it is a great choreographed battle. I enjoyed the climatic clash between Azog and Thorin, as well, despite knowing how it would end. I kind of wished Bilbo would have had more action scenes in the film, though...<br/><br/>At any rate, this film is a great conclusion to the Hobbit Trilogy. I hope that the upcoming Amazon Middle-Earth series will live up to what Peter Jackson has accomplished, also, since there are so many other stories in the History of Middle-Earth to be told either in a streaming format or a cinematic format."
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","1","4","7 July 2016"," Too much is too much
","The psychology of the characters is very often reduced to some simple sketches that are more part of the costume the actors wear, part of the characters and not something having any depth, any contradictory inner voice. Even the Hobbit himself is rather sketchy. He is predictable. He is in no way moved by deep sentiments that are expressed in a way or another on the screen. He does not have time to do this since he is absolutely all the time taken in a wild action that has no pause whatsoever, reducing the dialogue to nothing most of the time, grunts and growls most of the rest of the time, and here and there a few words often spoken in vain. <br/><br/>And that is the main characteristic of this trilogy. <br/><br/>It all starts with a Rune written on the Hobbit's door by the wizard on his first visit. This Rune is ""Fehu"" under its Germanic name or ""Feoh"" under its Anglo-Saxon name, and it is not reversed. But we are not explained the meaning of this Rune. The basic meaning is ""cattle"" which relates it to the post ice age agricultural evolution, the domestication of the wild bovines and thus the evolution of that new species that will provide food and comfort to human beings. It is easy to understand then that it means ""wealth"" and all that can be derived from that concept, such as '""fulfillment,"" not only the satisfaction of one's hunger, but also the satisfaction of all basic needs and further on the satisfaction of one's call to the wild and adventure. This is basic in the whole vision provided at the beginning, though it is not explained clearly and it is not explained again at the end when the Hobbit arrives home and finds out all his accumulated wealth has been sold to everyone who wanted it. Satisfied in adventure and fate since he fulfilled his destiny, he is totally ruined in his material possessions and his house has been legally and commercially looted. That's the kind of meaning we do not get and that's how we can say that this rune represents this motto: ""Every beginning has within it the seeds of its own end."" And the seeds can be the negation of the beginning, or its reversal because a Rune can always be drawn upside down, reversed.<br/><br/>In other words it is perfectly representative of the ambiguity of runic culture, the very culture Tolkien is looking for in his novel. This ""fehu"" rune is the symbol of the call to some fate that leads to a dragon through fire, seas, storms and all other dangers from armies and other species and the ""fehu"" destiny is to kill the dragon. The killing of Smaug was contained in that rune written on the Hobbit's door by this visiting wizard. I did not find one moment when this was explained. You can tell me that's the whole story. Sure. But in Tolkien's mind and in his creations, there had to be some pondering and understanding of the ambiguity of these missions and of their greatness in their being ambiguous, hence requiring at any moment, at any step a resourcing of oneself into the power of the mission, into the blood of the dragon. <br/><br/>But my main criticism is that action is made dominant. There is nothing but action, meaning danger and violence. Even the Orcs must have a mind and must have some psychology. They are reduced to an army of brutal and brutish automats, the perfect killers who cannot die, though on the screen quite many will die at high speed.<br/><br/>This insistence on the warlike aspect of the story erases the magic of the wizard and even the courage and imagination of the dwarfs and the Hobbit. Then it is all special effects that are supposed to be so striking that we are stunned into deafness, which explains why there is no dialogue. Why should there be in a story that is reduced to calamities and military fighting with in-between all types of other fighting, always for life, always to death. And the thirteen original dwarfs, squared up by the Hobbit who makes them fourteen, and the wizard who makes them fifteen, will only be ten left squared up to twelve by the Hobbit and the wizard. And that dozen is of course so symbolical of perfection that we cannot in any way hesitate: we have reached salvation though there is no prophet, no God, no Son of God, no Holy Virgin either. This parable of Christianity does not find the religious and ritual dimension it could not ignore in Tolkien's world. This film is alas absolutely deprived of any religious and spiritual dimension.<br/><br/>If you like special effects, that's your trilogy. If you like spectacular battles, that's your trilogy. If you like simple people who do not question the universe too much, that's your trilogy. And to make it square: if you like films that do not contain anything erotic, sexy or even simply fleshy, hence if you like puritanical human beings, that's your trilogy.<br/><br/>It does not matter if Tolkien is betrayed in this trilogy, since Tolkien's son made a tremendous amount of money. To defend himself he explained that he had donated a lot to various charities. Good for him. But Tolkien, his father, deserved a better service, more spiritual, more inspired by love, friendship and empathy instead of the light sprinkling of these seven and a half hours with rare and extremely superficial and evanescent references or simple allusions to such human feelings, certainly not actions or behaviors. The dragon is beautiful but he is absolutely unlovable, and actually unhatable because one cannot hate something one does not love.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

Despite stretching the book for so long and so many deaths in this one, I really didn't care for any character except Bilbo; whether it was the weak character development or poor writing, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>So much money spent and a book dragged out for three movies, I'm still not sure what's the overall message or story it tried to tell. And whatever themes it does cover, they're so paper-thin.<br/><br/>With the trilogy now over, I can safely say, 'The Lord of the Rings' is a far superior trilogy and will be remembered for ages to come.

"halavurta","6","1","4","17 February 2015"," The Argument of the Five Mobs
","The Battle of the Five Armies is even worse than The Desolation of Smaug and at the bottom of Hobbit Trilogy. It seems that Peter Jackson didn't want Hobbit movies to outcompete the LOTR Legend same as he didn't want to make it as trilogy. This movie literally fell short of the expectations. Real reason of disappointment is not only related with this movie but with all the series. First movie was promising but after disaster of second movie, expectations were even higher for the last one because it was a good opportunity to save the trilogy with the all epic stories in it. Comparing war scenes and choreographies of one to one fights with the ones in Lord of the Rings would be unfair. They were botchy and far away of being magnificent as we expected. We can call the movie The Argument of the Five Mobs more than a battle of armies. Low class and unnecessarily long one to one fights are covering more time than they should. I would watch an old Van Damme movie if I wanted something like this. Nothing is enough to describe how much I felt disrespected. Love scenes, stupid comedy element which you all understand without saying, blockbuster movie tricks, absence of big battle and ignoring some important characters are not as awful as the worse part. Thorin's scene when he understands golden's power on him and fighting against it should be a joke. For Peter Jackson who filmed Boromir almost in same situation in LOTR it was unbelievable and he own an explanation to us. This was the funniest scene I have ever seen this year and it took the all dignity away. I understand the concerns of producers and I accept that Peter Jackson shouldn't stick to the book but mocking with us in this way and making a movie for box office just ruined the Hobbit image in our minds. Fortunately we had Galadriel."
"shadowyx12","6","1","4","31 January 2015"," There was so much potential, but it just turned out to be mediocre.
","SHORT REVIEW (SPOILERS):<br/><br/>For me, this movie is on the same level as the first ""Hobbit"" movie - too long and boring. Replacing the yawn-inducing (boring) set-up scenes are yawn-inducing (exhausting) action scenes (though VFX are top-notch). Smaug appears for less than ten minutes. If you cringe at the Tauriel/Kili love story, then don't bother watching. Finally, this movie leaves FAR TOO MANY loose ends then it has to... Fans of the book will probably be the most disappointed.<br/><br/>Verdict: RENT IT (or buy the Ext. Edition if you don't care).<br/><br/>____________________________________________________________<br/><br/>LONG REVIEW:<br/><br/>Even when not being compared to 'The Lord of the Rings', the 'Hobbit' films still fall short in many departments other fantasy films have succeeded. 'The Battle of the Five Armies' is no exception.<br/><br/>While most of the cast does give excellent performances, the script they're given to work with is a different issue. Splitting a short children's novel into three 'over-two hours' films was a bad idea from the start - and 'TBotFA' is the last testament to that fact. Watching the film, I can honestly say that a good 2/3rd of the movie was just a really long and tedious battle sequence. It was nice to see nearly everyone in the previous movies come back in the end, but at this point, the story just became hard to follow (it jumps around a lot). And just like the trilogy itself, the pacing in this film feels REALLY unbalanced. If certain characters (such as our main dwarfs) were given more focus, then I might have given this film a seven. But alas, the conclusion just got too big and ambitious for its own good.<br/><br/>For those who don't like loose ends - just be warned, you're gonna get a lot of them (but maybe this it to make up for 'Return of the King'?). Anyway, Peter Jackson does a fine job of transitioning 'The Battle of the Five Armies' into 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.<br/><br/>There will also be points in the battle sequences where you will notice inconsistencies about certain characters' strengths and abilities. At times, these inconsistencies can make you scratch your head, and at other times, they can fly right over your head. If you tend to notice these things in movies, then you're going to be rolling your eyes a lot and thinking 'OH, COME ON!'.<br/><br/>Although I don't consider 'The Battle of the Five Armies' to be the best in its trilogy, I would say to just check it out if you're curious to find out what happens after 'Desolation' - just prepared to be disappointed. If you still hold the notion that this movie will 'redeem' the entire trilogy... No, just drop it. That's what I thought before going into this movie."
"mandaG_11","7","1","4","15 January 2015"," CGI Overkill
","Since The Fellowship of the Ring came out, I have loved everything LOTR/Tolkien related. But the Hobbit lost the magic with me. Turning the book into three movies was risky, but I don't mind some of the added content, such as were Gandalf went off to. Some of the other added content that was no where close to what Tolkien wrote was a little hard to watch, but it's forgivable. What I really struggled with was the CGI. The overall look of the film was just off. I wasn't in Middle Earth anymore. The orcs/goblins looked funny. Compared to LOTR, the Hobbit was a cartoon. <br/><br/>Despite all that.... The movie still brought aspects from the book to life that made me feel like a kid again when I first started reading Tolkien's work. I was happy to see this story on the big screen. It's worth watching, even though the CGI is overkill."

"Seraphion","7","1","4","9 January 2015"," Less epic moments than the other movies
","Third and last installment in the adventures of Bilbo Baggins first we find the dragon Smaug wreaks havoc in Lake Town, angered at Bilbo's intrusion. Bard freed himself and manages to kill Smaug, shooting a black arrow at Smaug's exposed weak spot. Devastated, the Lake Town people head to the ruins of the former city Dale next to the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor. News of Smaug's demise travels fast and soon the Elven King Thranduil arrives with his army, uniting with the humans in demand for fair share of Smaug's gold. Thorin barricades Erebor's gate, refusing to share the gold as he's poisoned by 'dragon sickness', the lust for gold derived from the plunder which has so long been the bed of Smaug. At the day the elves march to Thorin's gate, his cousin Dain arrives with a dwarven army. Suddenly, the orc army under Azog reveals themselves and begin their attack. Humans, elves and dwarfs unite against the common enemy.<br/><br/>But Azog cleverly divide his army to also attack Dale, forcing the alliance to also divide their forces, weakening it. With Thranduil, Gandalf and Bard in the city, the alliance manages to defend Dale. But Legolas and Tauriel returns with sore news, The second batch of orc army from Gundabad is arriving. Meanwhile, Thorin finally wins his own fight against the lust for gold and goes out to help in the fight. He then aims to hunt down Azog with three others at a watchtower. But the place turns out to be Azog's trap where his ambush costs the lives of Fili and Kili. Bilbo arrives to warn Thorin of the Gundabad army. Azog suddenly appears and attacks Thorin, knocking Bilbo unconscious. Azog's men corner Thorin but Legolas helps him by shooting down the orcs for a far. Fortunately, help arrive for the alliance as Beorn, Radagast and the eagles come to help. Legolas then defeats the orc second in command Bolg. Thorin manages to drown Azog beneath the frozen river but the orc returns to launch at him, pinning him to the ground. Thorin accepts Azog's stab but then quickly returns the favor, killing the orc. Thorin dies of his wounds while Bilbo goes with Gandalf's company back to The Shire.<br/><br/>The story in general feels very much lacking since the movie altered the single book novel into a trilogy of movies with this installment in particular focuses mainly on the last battle of the five armies. With the way the trilogy splits the movies, Smaug's death looks only as a sweetener as it's placed very early at the very starting point. Adding in characters not in the book like Tauriel feels like a waste for me as they dilute the real story. <br/><br/>But the action scenes fortunately retains Peter Jackson's nice feel for it. Although I should say that this movie sure lacks epic moments in the battle scenes. I personally only find two instances where the battle scenes look cool. First is the whole sequence of Smaug's assault on Lake Town, and the second is when elven troops jump over the dwarven phalanx to assault the orcish army's front rows. Having to much emphasis on the on-on-one fights sure reduces this movie's epic battle scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is good in overall. Sir Ian McKellen and Orlando Bloom kept their characters well for this third in the trilogy and sixth in the Tolkien adaptation. Martin Freemen did well enough in portraying the more lively hobbit of Bilbo as to compared to the more sad looking Frodo. Richard Armitage plays it very well, nicely encompassing the right expressions on the good and bad sides of Thorin. Evangeline Lily plays out well enough for an added role that doesn't exist in the original novel. Lee Pace also adds nicely as Thranduil gets more focus than on any of the other movies.<br/><br/>My say for The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies (2014) is that the movie deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is unfortunately just a so-so from me considering that while it's still a good part and ending to the trilogy, there's less epic moments than on any of the other Tolkien based movies."
"DragoonKain","7","1","4","4 January 2015"," The Unfinished Edition
","It's funny, because each year that there's a Peter Jackson Middle Earth film released, I find myself less excited by the new December theatrical release, and more excited by the November Extended Edition release. That has never more been the case with these new Hobbit films. The second film, The Desolation of Smaug, while enjoyable in theaters, felt like tiresome action schlock that cut out some of the best parts of the book in favor of exhausting nonstop action. The extended edition bluray released last November rectified and fixed pretty much every major issue I had with the theatrical version of the film.<br/><br/>So, when the less than stellar reviews for The third and final installment of The Hobbit came out, a part of me wondered if it was even worth seeing it in theaters at all. Should I just wait for the extended edition next November? Well, curiosity got the better of me and I went out and saw it and ... yeah you're probably better off waiting for the extended edition. Let's just call this the Unfinished Edition.<br/><br/>It's no secret that there was a lot difficulty getting these Hobbit films made. First there was all the difficulty getting the rights to the film, then there was the New Zealand actors strike, then Del Toro's departure during pre-production leaving Peter Jackson holding the boat, and lastly, there was the last minute decision to turn this from a duology into a trilogy. Keep in mind also Peter Jackson had 3 years of pre-production time on the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy. On The Hobbit, he had less than one year. When you watch all the behind the scenes footage on the appendices of the Extended Editions, you can see that they really are working themselves to the nub right up until the very last minute to get everything done in time for release.<br/><br/>As a result, The Hobbit movies just don't measure up in comparison to the Lord of the Rings movies. They look and feel rushed. They rely a lot more on CGI, and just don't have that polished finish. I think the decision to go 3D was a mistake too, because it forced Peter Jackson to abandon a lot of his practical effects techniques to get his forced perspective shots since he had to use two cameras in all scenes. This resulted in green screens in nearly every scene.<br/><br/>The Battle of Five Armies, in particular, feels the most like a CGI cartoon or video game cutscene. Billy Connolly's character, Dain Ironfoot, looks entirely CGI in some scenes. Maybe he wasn't available for reshoots or something. Again, more evidence that the film was rushed.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem with the film was in what was left out. They focused on the battle, which is actually just one chapter in the book, but left out pretty much all of the aftermath of the battle, which is actually a pretty large chunk of the book. I was surprised by this because I thought that if they were going to devote a whole movie on the last quarter of the book, you'd think they devote more time to more than just a couple of chapters. I suppose Peter Jackson didn't want people complaining about ""too many endings"" like they did in Return of the King. But without those resolutions, the movie really feels incomplete, and truly does feel unfinished. There are too many loose ends.<br/><br/>All that negativity aside, I actually do think this is a really good movie and I did enjoy it quite a bit. There were a lot of great moments. When Peter Jackson stayed true to the source material, he nailed it. There were some great duels in the battle itself, some of the action sequences were stunning, although I could have done with a few less Alfrid hijinks and a bit more Master of Laketown's hijinks (he was a better character and his character's hijinks actually WERE in the book, whereas Alfrid was made up for the film).<br/><br/>I also am happy he adapted parts of the appendices of Lord of the Rings for these movies. The Dol Goldur scenes were a welcome addition and I was really happy to see them. It was great seeing Saruman (Christopher Lee) in action with the White Council.<br/><br/>Overall, yeah, I enjoyed it, but there were a lot of things that bugged me. I'm holding out hope that the Extended Edition will fix a lot of the problems I had with it. Since they have 11 months to tinker with the film before it comes out, maybe they'll have time to properly finish it."
"fredschaefer-406-623204","7","1","4","4 January 2015"," Time to bring some other fantasy epics to the screen.
","THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is the end of the line for Peter Jackson and Tolkein's Middle Earth, which is just as well because with this third installment of his adaption of The Hobbit, he has finally run out of story. As everyone points out, Tolkein's book is actually a rather modest children's story, stretched until it breaks by Jackson for the silver screen, with epic battle scenes and a dwarf/elf love story shoe horned into the narrative. The result is a great looking fantasy whose effects and action overpower the story completely.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit of the title is relegated to a supporting character, leaving Richard Armitage's Thorin, the leader of the dwarfs who succumbs to his lust for gold now that they have taken Erebor, the most compelling person on the screen. The story picks up where THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG left off with the dragon laying waste to Laketown, it is also the moment when Luke Evans's Bard steps up and proves himself the hero; a thrillingly done sequence. But once the business with Smaug is done with, the movie settles into a siege with the Elves, Laketowners, Dwarfs, and Orcs squaring off for the mountain filled with gold. Along the way there is betrayal, suspicion, spite, grudges, envy and greed; all of which leads to lot's and lot's and lot's of fighting, before we get to a finale filled with changes of heart, regret and redemption. We also have to spend some time picking up where we left off with a vast cast of characters, some of whom may leave the casual viewer scratching their heads as to who is who and why they matter to the story.<br/><br/>And while the final scene may be satisfying to Tolkein fans, you can literally count on both hands all the plot threads left hanging: what becomes of all that gold that everyone was laying claim to? What becomes of Bard and the good people of Laketown who suffer so much in the course of the movie? So too the fate of Evangeline Lilly's Tauriel and Lee Pace's Thandriel? Where'd those big worms go? (Their appearance made me think of TREMORS and took me utterly out of the movie) Is the dwarfs homeland Scotland? (Billy Connolly's accent suggests it is.) Not to mention the cohort of dwarfs who have followed Thorin through so much? And does that despicable Albert get what is coming to him? Then there is the Arkenstone? We don't even see a proper funeral for Thorin; no Bilbo just walks off with the Ring in his pocket, heading back to the Shire. <br/><br/>The CGI is terrific and is the main reason why this film should be seen in on the big screen; Jackson has truly succeeded in bringing Middle Earth to life, a universe like those of Star Wars and Star Trek which has become a truly real place to its many, many fans. The acting is first rate, although I can never see Martin Freeman now and not think of his devious Lester Nygaard of FARGO. All the old favorites from LOTR show up: Ian McKellan's Gandalf; Orlando Bloom as Legolas; Cate Blanchett as Galadriel; Hugo Weaving as Elrond; and it is always something special to see Christopher Lee in anything. This man who was a great Dracula long ago, and was also in Star Wars, he reprises his Saruman portrayal here; unfortunately some of them are barely in this movie, only punching in on their way to the bigger story yet to come. But for us Manu Bennett fans, his Azrog gets a lot of time and is one more of his great villains. <br/><br/>I think the ultimate flaw in THE HOBBIT is that for all the sound and the fury, there really is not that much on the line, that real epic story will come later with LOTR, and for this reason this movie just does not resonate like it should. There are so many other great fantasy worlds that should now get their chance at the silver screen now; how about Stephen Kings's THE DARK TOWER series, they could easily get a half dozen epics out of that one."

"rwatt92","6","1","4","1 January 2015"," Epic Conclusion Stretched to Two Hours
","To be fair, I have not read ""The Hobbit"" but I don't think 300 pages can easily translate into 8 hours on the silver screen. While ""Battle of the Five Armies"" delivers in spectacle and action, it officially proves once and for all that there was no need to make a trilogy out of a story that could have been a good two and a half hour blockbuster.<br/><br/>The film picks up where Desolation of Smaug (the best of The Hobbit trilogy) left off, with the titular dragon reigning fire over poor Laketown. The dragon voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch was by far the best thing about the previous installment, so much so that I kind of wished Peter Jackson fudged the story a bit to give him more screen time. <br/><br/>Once the beast has been slain, the massive amount of gold at Erebor is now up for grabs, making the Dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield greedy to the point of insanity. He would rather choose war over peace if that means keeping his gold and title he feels rightfully belongs to him. It is during these scenes, particularly this one hallucination sequence that work the best during the film.<br/><br/>For the most part the film is just one massive climax of battle scenes that are well done, though I can't say I haven't seen better. Like in any climax of the movie all the characters and subplots come together, particularly romances. This particular one between Tauriel and a dwarf feels a bit out of place in the saga like it exists just because Jackson felt that there needed to be a romantic subplot. It also gets in the way of the story's main focus.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, looking back I was amazed a little Hobbit there was in the actual movie. What exactly does Bilbo do in the final chapter? Not much really. The film has other characters to focus on.<br/><br/>While watching I was reminded of Game of Thrones episode ""Watchers on the Wall"". That was an action-packed hour of television that somehow felt much more emotionally satisfying than this movie. And that wasn't even the series finale. <br/><br/>The film of course looks impressive but while the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was filmed on location in New Zealand (and looks like it) the Hobbit trilogy uses so much CGI that at times it actually looks like a Pixar film. It's like Jackson believed that the first trilogy was burdensome enough to make, so lets just use CGI. <br/><br/>I will certainly give the movie this however, Peter Jackson made a smart decision not to bombard us with a half hour of false endings like in ""Return of the King"". The series is already long enough as it is."
"Laakbaar","6","1","4","1 January 2015"," Left me restless and irritated
","It's now too late for me to make peace with the fact that the LOTR and Hobbit movies are just not my cup of tea. I've seen them all, out of a sense of duty more than anything else. I didn't really enjoy any of them, to be honest with you. I want to like them, but I just don't.<br/><br/>I don't want to upset anyone with the details, but it's just all too arcane and fast-paced and artificial and filled with stalwart men and noble armies, noble causes and unexpected turnarounds. There were too many characters. It was too busy. New things kept popping up out of nowhere. I don't want my movies to be like video games. I'm not into video games. I don't need constant stimulation and sensation from my entertainment. Stimulation and entertainment are two different things.<br/><br/>I also cannot abide the schmaltzy heroic speeches. GMAFB. It just felt staged. The bowman (whatever his name was) runs into a square and calls out ""where are my children"". Then out of this panicked mob, a woman stops and says, ""I know where they are'. Yikes. <br/><br/>Thank god there was a bit of humour in the film.<br/><br/>Was I moved at times? Yes, strangely. They do their utmost to elicit this in you. I felt manipulated.<br/><br/>These movies require some kind of interest in this artificial fantasy world. There are so many ""universes"" to keep track of out there now. What's the point? Who cares? <br/><br/>The scenes they can show on CGI now are mind-boggling. I can't deny that. Maybe that's why I keep coming. However, isn't it being grossly overused? Not everything has to be spectacular. I think CGI is more effective if used in moderation.<br/><br/>Once again, there is a huge disparity between the apparent fierceness of the orcs and how easy it is to kill them. I mean, c'mon. At times, I thought that the filmmakers were even parodying this. Like a child throws a stone -- boom, the orc is dead. Tauriel flicks her wrist - whoosh, the orc flies through the air. This is like a bad video game, isn't it? Why the gross disparity? It's just not believable. This ruined the action for me. This was also a problem in the second movie. <br/><br/>I laughed aloud when the 12 dwarfs come storming out of the mountain, ready to face the horde. Heroic music swells --- yes, yes, these twelve dwarfs will save the day. So they rush into the formed satanic legions -- and nothing bad happens to them. The terrifying orcs scatter like marbles thrown on a floor.<br/><br/>I did like Hobbit I (surprisingly), so I guess I was bullshitting there a bit. Hobbit III is better than Hobbit II, but not as good as Hobbit I. I'm sure this movie will satisfy many. <br/><br/>Throughout the whole dreary series I tried to find meaning. Is this an allegory about defeating fascism and totalitarianism? Is this it? Or is it all meaningless."

Once word is out that the dragon has been driven from the mountain, armies from all over the land come to battle for the treasures that lie inside. It is a fight unlike any before and Bilbo must find a way to make peace before it is too late. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. From the very beginning it is full of action, epic battles and suspense. The graphics in this entire series are stunning. The Hobbit never fails to impress me with its immaculate visuals and special effects. The soundtrack to this film is beautiful, as expected, since the rest of the series is filled with wonderful music. I think that this film is the perfect closure to the series that so many have fallen in love with and been loyal fans of over the years.<br/><br/>I'm also very impressed with the fact that this trilogy of films is adapted from one, relatively short novel and every film is so packed full of action and adventure, there is never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The cast is marvelous as usual. Martin Freeman is the perfect actor to play Bilbo Baggins because he embodies his personality so well. It's been wonderful to watch Bilbo's character develop over the course of these films. He starts off very timid and unsure of himself, but by the end of the final film he has so much new found confidence from all he's been through and is a completely different hobbit than he was at the beginning of the journey.<br/><br/>I'm very sad that the series has come to an end and that the journey is over, but I'm glad for the closure and amazed at how well this film turned out. Lord of the Rings fans will clearly love this film, but I think anyone who enjoys action, adventure and fantasy will love this film as well. There is a considerable amount of violence since the majority of the movie is an epic battle, so I suggest this film be viewed by ages 13 to 18-year-olds. If you have seen any of the previous films from The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings series, then this film should be suitable for you.<br/><br/>I give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 5 out of 5 stars.

","I can understand the difficulty in picturing someone else's vision on Armaggedon. However difficult, the question remains why would one need over two and half hours to do so.

The form has overtaken the message of the story, which, in itself, is worth telling. <br/><br/>Why do I vote 6 out of 10? I really like the acting. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is much more satisfactory to watch than Elijah Wood as Frodo, for example. The CGI is outstanding (Although I don't like 3D, because of the flatness in depth. It is just not enough). The story is great, especially when you consider where the inspiration came from.<br/><br/>Let just say I can not wait on the final chapters of the Narnia Chronicles on celluloid.

","It was cool. I noticed many conveniences like in the other films. There are film rating guide lines and regulations that I know filmmakers must follow in order to keep the rating they desire upheld to their film and that lead me to believe that was why only Orcs were be headed and not humans which seemed dark but the humans weren't which took me out of it a bit. Whenever a human or ""light"" character would be killed they would be saved or some type of ""Dues ex Machina"" would happen to keep them alive. In relation to that I noticed some scenes had a ton of effort for conveniences. An example would be the hobbit in barrels knocking/defeating all the like 15 Orcs away while staying alive.<br/><br/>There were times where the movie wanted to be dark, then funny, then slap stick and dark again. But only horrific and brutal with chopping heads of the ""bad guys"" not the protagonist or ""heavenly like"" character like Legolas.<br/><br/>Legolas is annoying invincible and flawless and still wants to be Fred Flint stone whenever he can. When Woody from 'Toy Story' declared ""falling with style"" Legolas perfectly fits that phrase. This guy is untouchable to the pint where I want him to loose some and I shouldn't feel that way. He even took Rey Mysterio's wrestling love using his legs to clamp down on an Orcs neck and swing himself across to take the Orc down. I was like that's WWF ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜‘ lol, I liked it a lil bit. This lead me to enjoy when the Head Orc beat him or ""roughed him up some"" and made him ""bleed his own blood"" ha ha haaaaaaaa..... That's goes with other characters too that unreasonably beat and over powered these strong Orcs with brute physical force with thin brittle arms (That lady Elf who had ""the hots"" for the one elf who almost ""took an arrow to the knee"" and had Legolas salty and jelly).<br/><br/>There were some funny moments and I liked some of them. I could see the film was about friendship, trust, journey and acceptance while conflicting with greed, race war, and power. <br/><br/>I really liked the boss scene at the end which caught me off guard for a bit. It was recalling good.<br/><br/>Overall I could nit-pick the film a lot and point out a ton of minor things that would make sense for the individual characters motives but I liked it. To counter argue the plausibility of characters not doing what would make sense is to keep the suspense going because if they didn't then the story may not be that compelling or thrilling in tense moments, like when the lead hobbit could've slice the head orcs neck when he was behind him as they were looking at the Eagles. It's all for the sake of Storting telling and I keep that in mind as well."

","I enjoyed this movie, but I am so glad this saga is over. I am exhausted from all that ridiculous and unnecessary scene-stretching for cash. Every stinking scene was longer than it had to be. One three hour flick might have been too short for this story, but three parts, really? I cannot believe it took so freaking long to finish off that stupid talking dragonÂ…sheesh. His tiresome narrative was so irritating he should have been silenced early-on. And what about them fancy long winded fight scenes? Oh can I have some more â€“ please? NOT! Never ending slashing and chopping and hacking, ohÂ…theÂ…humanity. I actually did like all the stuff previously mentionedÂ…but just like everything else in this trilogy, there was just too much of it. If only the theater came equipped with a fast forward button. Oh, and while I am whining about the few items that irked me, when it was time for characters to be hacked to pieces and wander off to Valhalla, why did it take so stinking long for them to die? Why? ""Spoiler Alert"" The demise of Thorin took up way too much time. At this point, The director should have embraced the traditional Hollywierd attitude towards death and killed the king, forget about him and move on. With all my griping and complaining, I have to admit I had a blast watching this flick. I feel Part III of this too long of a tale was very well done. It was not as well done as Part I, but pretty close. And it was so much better than Part II. In closing, the entire movie was very skillfully directed; the scenery was spectacular and breathtaking; the endless CGI was superior and the acting was beyond commendable. A job well done. I will get the DVDsÂ…and ensure my fast forward maintained at peak performance and is always operational."
"miwz-khan","9","1","4","27 December 2014"," A good movie but not exceptional as expected
","Just a brief review. The story was adapted from the book okay enough to make it into a three movies but could have been better as there were various deviations. Characters added and removed from the original story, not much details on what happened to most characters after the battle like who becomes the king under the mountain. The CGI was not as impressive as expected. Tried to to end the trilogy on a high note but failed. It just doesn't do justice to the middle from Tolkien's world. The Desolation of Smaug did a better job and set a high bar to which this did not live up to. Having said all that, if you watch the movie on its own without comparison with the books and Tolkien's world, it is a rather enjoyable movie. It doesn't bore you and most times keeps you very much into it."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","26 December 2014"," A fitting end to a great series
","Well, this is the final of Peter Jackson's epic series based upon Tolkien's famous fantasy epics. Okay, the Hobbit was a much smaller book than the sequel Lord of the Rings, but The Hobbit was one of the very first fantasy novels that I read and I loved it. It wasn't until I was much older that I managed to struggle through the Lord of the Rings (it took me 10 years to finish the first time, though the second time through was much faster because I read each of the books after the corresponding film was released). So, once the credits started rolling the first thought that entered my mind was 'is he now going to do the Silmarillion?' I suspect the answer to that question will be no because while it has some brilliant stories within its covers, it simply does not sit up there in the popular mind the way Tolkien's other books do.<br/><br/>My first thought was that I really did like how Jackson fleshed out the story to create something that was akin to his previous trilogy. Okay, I am really not a big fan when film makers butcher books, but Jackson managed to flesh the story out without undermining the original book. By adding the two orc generals to the film it created an antagonist that was forever pursing the luckless heroes, and the way the battle evolved worked really well (especially with the generals standing on top of the mountain directing their army through the use of flags, which demonstrated that Jackson did his research in the way battles were fought before telecommunications).<br/><br/>Thorin's character was also brilliantly created, especially with his greed consuming him to the point that he was accusing his faithful friends of treachery. If there was one thing that ran through this film it was the destructive nature of greed. There is the leader of Laketown who, while the town is being attacked by the dragon, takes all of the town's gold out on a boat, and when the boat gets heavy, he pushes Alfrid off rather than allow any of the gold to go into the water. We also have Alfrid, who does survive, prefer to take what gold he finds and flees from the battle rather than fight, despite the fact that the men, women, children, and even the elderly, pick up swords in a last desperate fight. Yet it is Thorin that steals the show in this regards, sealing himself into the mountain so as to protect the gold, and denying any of his companions to go out and join the battle.<br/><br/>Yet there is also mercy shown in the film, such as when Bard steps in and prevents Alfrid from being lynched, despite the fact that he probably deserves it. We can see in Bard the true elements of leadership in that he turns down the role even though it is offered to him, and even then takes that role anyway because there is nobody else whom anybody will follow (and we note that Alfrid tries to take the role of leader but is soundly rejected).<br/><br/>If there is one thing that I didn't really like it would have been how the movie opened. I am not sure if having the opening of the movie with Smaug flying towards Laketown worked well. The previous movie simply ended when Smaug left the Lonely Mountain and to me it seemed to be rather sudden, almost as if it were a cliff hanger (and it would have been despite the fact that I knew how it ended). Also, from what I remembered from the last movie, there was a large bow that was sitting upon one of the buildings in Laketown, but that suddenly vanished in this film. Okay, maybe I don't expect 'Chekov's Gun' to be used all that often (that is the idea that if you are going to show something in a movie/book/play then you need to have a purpose for showing it) but I was expecting that it would be used to kill the dragon. However, I suspect that Jackson did remain faithful to that 'rule' because even though the bow wasn't used, the arrow was."

","First off, I want to make it known that I am very, very, very lenient in writing this review. In fact, I'm not even writing this from a critical viewpoint, but from a fan of all things Tolkien. Since this would be the last time we're visiting Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, treat this as my farewell gift.<br/><br/>With that said, let's start with things that I won't talk about.<br/><br/>I won't talk about how the beginning sequence with Smaug clearly demonstrates the pacing problem in the Hobbit series, where whatever character and emotional development with Smaug and Bard failed to carry over from Desolation of Smaug to The Battle of the Five Armies. With all the heavy duty scenes that follows, you'll forget Smaug was even in the film when you leave the theater.<br/><br/>I won't talk about how plot points Peter Jackson introduced in the previous installments (for the sake of increasing runtime, no less) completely fizzled out, with Beorn, Radagast and the Arkenstone fiercely competing to have the least screen time.<br/><br/>I won't talk about how the forbidden love story between Kili and Tauriel, which was actually quite promising and brought a new perspective to Middle Earth, dropped the ball and could be summarized in The Battle Of the Five Armies as followed:<br/><br/>Fili: ""I love you, Tauriel""<br/><br/>Tauriel: ""I love you too, Fili, but I can't say that or be with you now because Legolas is looking at me."" <br/><br/>Fili: ""Oh well, I'll look back lovingly at you while I leave then""<br/><br/>(Fili dies.)<br/><br/>Tauriel: ""Oh Fili, I really love you. I really do. Also, there was the part where I almost shot Thranduil because he said I didn't love you, but we're cool now.""<br/><br/>(Side note: I'm not even joking here. Fili and Tauriel spoke with each other only in the beginning)<br/><br/>I wouldn't talk about Alfrid, Laketown's very own annoying Grima Wormtongue, who clearly overstayed his welcome with humour that ran dry the second time we saw him on screen. I was rooting for some orc to run him through with a sword. Honestly, this guy got more screen time than Radagast, Beorn, Elrond, Saruman and Galadriel combined. Even worse, Bard makes the same mistake as Aragorn in The Two Towers by letting this human slime live.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the good stuff.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson began this film really strong. They finally showed us what it's like when Middle Earth's finest gets serious and head off into battle. Seeing Elrond wielding his huge sword and Saruman with his staff pulverize the wraiths in actual combat is easily one of the greatest sequences of the franchise. Even head honcho Galadriel herself finally does something badass by going apeshit and besting Sauron himself in magical combat. It's beautiful. That scene alone is enough to convince me to watch the movie again.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the way they portrayed Thorin's descent into madness and subsequent redemption. I like how they interwove scenes of his obsession with gold with the remaining bits and pieces of his humanity, namely his friendship and trust in Bilbo. This made his eventual return to glory believable. Of note, the acorn scene shared by Bilbo and Thorin is a touchingly simple scene that manages to tease viewers that at that point, maybe Thorin can get back to normal before ultimately pulling away. The sequence when Thorin drowns in the sea of gold also impressively done. It was surrealistic and brings a psychological thriller vibe to the arc, which makes sense because Thorin's conflict is all in his mind.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the battle scenes get an honorable mention. Yes, they did run overly long, but at least we finally see a battle in the Hobbit Trilogy, with dramatic moments like when the elves jumped over the dwarfs to engage in battle with the orcs and Thranduil and Dain having their respective badass moments. Yes, the fight scenes between Azog, Bolg, Thorin and Legolas did stretch the limits of my imagination, but it was nice to see Thorin finally get his hard earned revenge and Legolas run out of arrows. Yes, the battle did end quite hastily after Thorin died, but with Azog and Bolg dead, it was quite clear that the leaderless orc army would ultimately be defeated by the more experienced dwarf, elf and men alliance. Could the battle have been better? Sure. Is it good enough as it is? I'll let it slide. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this really is the last time we will ever step foot in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. There is no waiting 30 years and filming an episode seven. The next time we visit Middle Earth, it would be in the hands of a new director, with a new vision, perspective and things to bring on the table. Some things will be done better than Jackson's, some no doubt worst. However from now until that time, we will be looking back at Jackson's films with a nostalgic tear in our eye, reminiscing all the amazing sights and scenes we will forever treasure."
"drystyx","6","1","4","24 December 2014"," That still only counts as one!
","One film in three parts. Which is best? Which is worst? Hard to say.<br/><br/>I think I speak for the consensus when I say this trilogy is weaker as a whole than Lord of the Rings, and I'm guessing Jackson did this on purpose for the simple reason he knew it couldn't compare to what may be the most awesome trilogy that will ever be made. So he simply made a ""good"" trilogy, not opting for the ""special classic"" effect.<br/><br/>The fantasy story of Bilbo's journey among mightier beings in Middle Earth is told in this trilogy with some trivial changes, but none of the changes are ""drastic"" changes, including the romance between the dwarf and the she-elf.<br/><br/>This part of the trilogy is the most superficial, by far. The others had some bits of innovation. There is almost no innovation here. It's strictly hard core action.<br/><br/>The only strength of this film is that a few things happen that aren't the usual ""predictable"" things. These three involve the coward, the elf king, and the she elf. Everything else is very mundane.<br/><br/>The weakness of this film is the lack of humor. There is almost no comic relief. No ""the big one, the big one!"" No ""what about second breakfast?"" No ""that still only counts as one!"" The closest we get to comic relief is the coward character, and that is at best a scant comic relief, and not well done. The coward is so much like Worm Tongue of the ring trilogy that we already know there is a connection there. So much is the resemblance that Jackson would be appear more imaginative if he didn't make them related.<br/><br/>The lack of comic relief makes this seem like more of an ordeal, especially with the long drawn out battle scenes, the long drawn out musings of the dwarf leader, and the long drawn out tragic scenes of the romantic couple. Those who read the book, and probably over half of the others, know which three dwarfs will die, so it isn't much of a spoiler to say which three, but I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>Another huge weakness is the overkill of the super power bad guys. They loom like giants and appear too much like the Greek demi gods who can only be killed by other demi gods. This movie is much too classical Greek in that respect.<br/><br/>The characters are well drawn, though, especially the minor ones, and that is a strength. Indeed, that's what keeps the movie from being on the low side of average. It is strong on character, but weak on the very action it overkills on, an overkill necessary to please the geeks and dorks, of course.<br/><br/>In the long run, I call it the slightly weakest of the three because of the lack of comic relief. Jackson tried too hard to make this too harsh, to please the Hollywood hate cliché loving dorks. He sold out on this one big time."

","After a disappointing first installment, and a much better second one, I was hoping this last middle-earth voyage would at least be average. <br/><br/>Sadly, it didn't deliver. <br/><br/>First of all, while I understand that the book needed some plot ""adjustments"", this really goes way too far. There are moments when Jackson seems to have completely forgotten Tolkien's work.<br/><br/>But my main concern isn't the story itself. It's the overwhelming feeling of cheesiness one can feel throughout most of the film's runtime. Everything just feels goofy, like trying to shove standard spec go-to movie feelings and clichés into an average film. The dream sequences are awful and seem to be straight out of an 80's horror flicks. The dwarf-elf love story would make a 12 years old girl want to hurl. Some shots would make a 90's remake of the ten commandments look classy and polished.<br/><br/>The only things left to save this movie are New Zealand's landscapes (already seen a million times), and some OK fights. <br/><br/>Ultimately, that's just not enough."
"lightbringer82","4","1","4","23 December 2014"," A complete train wreck devoid of anything Tolkien
","I once had respect for Peter Jackson, before this abysmal Hobbit trilogy. Now I can see he has fallen from grace, much like the Ringwraiths, once great kings of men who were corrupted by greed.<br/><br/>Sure, parts of the movie are entertaining. I enjoyed MOST of the Laketown scene with Smaug. Then it's on to the title ""Battle of Five Armies"" where the movie starts to go downhill...fast. Action scenes are so frequent, with the characters performing feats so physically impossible, that I found myself saying (and often out loud) ""Give me a break."" These fight scenes are so poorly choreographed, and utterly unbelievable, that the audience quickly loses touch with any sense of reality in the film. The computer effects, while occasionally quite good, are also pretty bad in other areas, particular in some of the more ridiculous fight scenes with Legolas.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with the film is the utter desecration of Tolkien's beloved work. Jackson has piled on so much CRAP: Giant earthworms, giant bats, giant mountain goats, Tarial (or however the hell you spell her name), Azog, a terrible romantic subplot, etc, etc, etc. He devotes so much more time to ADDED parts of the story than he does to contents that actually happened in the book. And on top of that, after this horribly tedious battle sequence, the movie doesn't even have an ending! Gone is the scene where we see Thorin buried under the Lonely Mountain with the Arkenstone. Jackson over-rushes the ending so much, we see no resolution whatsoever. What happened to all the treasure? Who became king of Dale? Where did those earthworms even go after the start of the battle? There were way too many plot holes.<br/><br/>Strangely, the only thing that worked was the acting, particularly from Bilbo and Thorin. Most of there scenes together were solid, though Bilbo was treated like a minor character even more so than Legolas (who wasn't even in the book and is annoying as hell in this movie). I could go on and on about what a failure this is, what a Michael Bay like piece of Hollywood crap, but I won't waste anymore time on this travesty."

Whole movie looked like stitched clips. The great smaug died in minutes and there was a lot of talking through gates and repeating of lines in the whole movie.<br/><br/>The war looked like child's play the visual effects were great though i though the direction for the war was somehow misjudged even by peter Jackson. It did looked like the great war but it didn't also, the setup for the war were great but the battle that was supposed to be great ended up with dwarfs talking with each other and orcs taking orders.<br/><br/>In many ways the movie was great but it could have ended up being something much more. It didn't lived up to my expectations but it was so bad either.<br/><br/>I liked the previous hobbits more than this one.

","The Last and Final installment of the Hobbit trilogy, is one remarkable movie that really made me cry. Peter Jackson really gets into the depths of the human emotional complex. The Battle of the five Armies only took up 14-16 pages of the whole Hobbit book, which is a tricky state for Peter to make the movie as long as 3 hours. I read the book and because Tolkien, isn't really the type of guy who usually puts into an emotional conversation with all of his furry and gritty characters, Peter made it clear of the gist of what has happened. The movie had the best fight anyone could possible imagine. When i was watching it, i really felt the want to be part of their world ( Middle Earth). I wasn't expecting drastic changes in the characters, but a more slow paced one. Bilbo and Thorin's friendship, the love between Tauriel and Kili, Father and Son relationship between Thranduil and Legolas, things that many people would agree depleting in our society. The movie is perfect for anyone and everyone and basically good for the family. <br/><br/>conclusively, i still can't get over the feeling of saying goodbye to Middle Earth and all of it. I can't accept that the Hobbit series is completed, and i should move on into the LOTR trilogies. But then again, nothing is permanent except for change. Everything must come to an end."
"williampsamuel","8","1","4","22 December 2014"," Though far from perfect, Five Armies makes a fitting farewell to Middle Earth
","More than a decade after his Lord of the Rings trilogy began, Peter Jackson now takes us to Middle Earth one last time for this, the final installment of the Hobbit. For some this will be a sad thought, marking the end of an era. For others less enamored with the recent films it will be cause for celebration. For me it brings a sense of satisfaction, for while they haven't been as good as I or others might have hoped, the Hobbit movies have been worthwhile entertainment, and this is the most entertaining of the three. Faster paced than Unexpected Journey and more serious than Desolation of Smaug, Battle of the Five armies comes the closest to the epic scale and excitement of the Lord of the Rings, even if it doesn't quite reach it.<br/><br/>After a fiery and suspenseful- if rather abrupt- opening, the film slowly builds over the next hour as tensions between men, dwarfs and elves grow to their breaking point and Thorin succumbs to the ""dragon sickness"" of greed. Though a tad slow and perhaps longer than strictly necessary, this section is buoyed by Richard Armitage's acting. Where he formerly gave off an aura of nobility, fearlessness, and unfailingly loyalty as Thorin, he is now cold, near paranoid, and constantly on the verge of exploding into rage as the lust for treasure drives everything else from his mind. His steady decline and ultimate moment of clarity are fascinating to watch, and the standoff his actions create sets the stage for what we really came to see: the titular battle.<br/><br/>Occupying fully half the run-time, the battle scenes are everything viewers could have hoped for. The Battle of the Five Armies presents a truly grand spectacle, with thousands of soldiers and towering beasts clashing across plains and through the ruins of Dale. The action is almost nonstop, alternating between sprawling shots of entire formations battling it out and the individual heroes' desperate combat against their more numerous foes. Thorin's duel with Azog is spectacular, and Legalos's fight scenes are equally breathtaking, though at a couple of points they did stretch believability. I also greatly enjoyed Gandalf and his allies' earlier showdown against the forces of the Necromancer, though for once I wish this part of the film had lasted a little longer.<br/><br/>The effects are generally on par with the action, the costumes and CGI producing monsters as convincing as they are gruesome. The set pieces are also impressively imposing, though there are a few scenes in which it's too readily apparent that the actors are in front of a green screen. While I'm on about thing's I didn't like I'll also say that the events of the first ten minutes would have fit better at the end of the last movie. On a more positive note the comic relief scenes were side splitting, especially the later ones with the cowardly Alfred whatever his name is.<br/><br/>Regarding this installment's faithfulness to the book, I must admit it's been a few years since I last read it, but I don't remember any trolls being mentioned, or fighting spilling into the city ruins, and I'm fairly certain there was a giant pack of wargs that are oddly absent here, and I'm entirely certain that Legalos and Azog weren't there. So yes, some rather significant liberties have been taken with the story, perhaps as many as in the last installment. That said, I've come to accept that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is a very different experience from the source material, with its own strengths and weaknesses. One is a charming if occasionally frightening children's tale, while the other is a sprawling fantasy epic. Not all of the changes are entirely necessary or helpful, but purists will always have the old animated version.<br/><br/>Having seen all three films, I believe that the Hobbit would have been just as good as a single movie, and best as two. But even stretched out across three long installments and padded with many scenes of the director's own invention the trilogy works, both as prequel to Jackson's earlier trilogy and as epic fantasy entertainment of its own. This final installment admittedly doesn't match the awesomeness or majesty of Return of the King, but Battle of the Five Armies makes a suitably grand finale to the Hobbit trilogy and is one of the better films in a holiday season with many good options."

"lilgrasshoppah","8","1","4","21 December 2014"," Uncomfortable mishmash.
","I love Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's Legendarium. In the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, he generally managed all of the various story-telling elements quite well; there was a good balance of humour, excitement, romance, and even gravitas. He made the right cuts, preserving the flavor of the novels, while trimming bulk.<br/><br/>The Hobbit was a different kettle of fish.<br/><br/>The fact that the source material is a scattered stew spanning the length and breadth of the Legendarium with the Hobbit on one end, and the Appendices on the other, makes for a terrible mess. The Troll scene worked as a stand alone piece, but when you fold in the Lord of The Rings trilogy... The sequence comes across as silly and childish. The trolls of LOTR are not cockney buffoons... They are inchoate, blundering, malformed, monsters.<br/><br/>I deplore the additions of Barrie Humphries, and Stephen Fry and Billy Connelly. Humphries especially. It's very hard to see him playing a character, and not see Dame Edna Everage. Especially since the orcs of Moria are not so eloquent or broadly comic. Stephen Fry, too. The character was too broad and slapstick. And the whole time I was reminded of the urbane Mr. Fry, and how cleverly he can play a boor. Billy Connelly was the least sinful of the casting... But by then it was too late. The disbelief, no longer suspended, crashed the show. The ultimate cause of the casting woes was the wholly unnecessary, and unwelcome, addition of one elf.<br/><br/>No, not Tauriel: Legolas Greenleaf. Because Legolas is developed as a character, in the Lord Of The Rings, he is essentially immortal. Thus, every moment he spends on screen becomes an abuse of the audience. He cannot believably be killed. Therefore, he can't believably be imperiled. You thought his stunt with the Mumukil at Pelennor Fields was ridiculous? Observe the zany antics he gets into on Ravenhill. I kept expecting him to whip out a carrot and sarcastically chortle, ""meeeeeh, What's up, Doc?""<br/><br/>Which is sad.<br/><br/>I think that Legolas should have had a much reduced role. I really like Tauriel, would like to see more of her. Also, I missed Beorn, and felt his --- and to a lesser extent, Radagast's --- arcs were incomplete.<br/><br/>Still, not a horrible film. Just unsatisfying, and unfocused."

","This review was originally published on 12/21/2014 at ObsessiveViewer.com.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies is more enjoyable and better paced than The Desolation of Smaug. I will give it that credit right off the bat. However, this conclusion to the trilogy is not without its orc's share of faults. It's a definitive end to The Hobbit story but it stumbles along the way as Jackson and his team attempt to satisfy a wide range of audiences while sacrificing cohesion and engaging storytelling.<br/><br/>The movie picks up after Desolation's cliffhanger and resolves the second movie's storyline in its prologue. Given how Desolation ended, this was a given going into Five Armies. Yet, I was left genuinely wondering why the sequence I just watched wasn't used to end the second movie. This peculiar feeling of disjointed storytelling and ill-fitting story lines never left me as the movie pressed on.<br/><br/>Thorin (Richard Armitage) spends much of the movie corrupted with Dragon Sickness by the gold he now has as the King under the Mountain. His greed becomes unquenchable and he becomes unhinged. Armitage performs the role well. The problem I had was that even though I've followed him through two movies before this, I just couldn't connect to the character. His dark turn in this installment felt forced and precipitated by plot necessity rather than organic characterization. I haven't read The Hobbit, so I don't know how this plot development reads or if it's even in the book. But the way it's depicted in the movie is completely unearned and feels like filler.<br/><br/>Thorin's bout with Dragon Sickness is but one narrative detour the film takes along its rocky and inconsistent storytelling. Gandalf's (Sir Ian McKellan) side quest run-in with Sauron is incongruous with the rest of the movie and irrelevant to every other storyline in The Hobbit movies. The way it plays out on screen reeks of a misguided attempt to connect The Hobbit movies with LOTR. The result is a mess in a movie that was already well on its way toward besmirching the saga.<br/><br/>The most egregiously ill-fitting storyline in the movie was the love story with Evangeline Lilly's elf character Tauriel and her star-crossed dwarf love interest Kili (Aidan Turner). Like in Desolation, it relegated Legolas (Orlando Bloom) to a third wheel role in the love triangle. This alone is bothersome since the audience has more emotional investment in the Legolas character than Tauriel and Kili, yet Orlando Bloom is barely a featured player in the story.<br/><br/>Worse than Legolas' status in this movie is the feeling that the Tauriel and Kili storyline simply doesn't fit into the narrative. I don't know what the motivation for including the storyline in the franchise was, but it feels overwhelmingly like someone in the production interfered. It felt like the storyline was written at the eleventh hour in order to make the movies more marketable to a broader demographic and fill out the runtime to fit a hastily decided 3-movie structure.<br/><br/>That's how a lot of the movie feels, actually. Ryan Gage's Alfrid was the defacto source of comic relief throughout the movie. The cowardly character was written to bring levity to the violence and fighting that takes up a good portion of Five Armies' runtime. It works in that Alfrid is good for some laughs, but a severe script problem arises when you realize that it is his sole purpose for being in the movie. The comic relief felt shoehorned in and juxtaposing it with the fighting made it stick out in a bad way.<br/><br/>Of course, being that the title is ""The Battle of the Five Armies"", the movie's most redeeming quality is that it is rife with jaw-dropping action set pieces. A considerable chunk of the movie is devoted to all out war. The violence is very stylish and the choreography is some of the best in Peter Jackson's movies. However, there are a handful of blemishes in the visual effects throughout that can cause a bit of distraction. Close-ups of the dwarf army's leader in particular, veers into uncanny valley territory while Legolas running as a makeshift bridge collapses is awkward at best. <br/><br/>Aside from the battle sequences, this movie deserves a little more credit than I've been giving it throughout this review. The resolution of Thorin's arc (and, by extension, Bilbo's) is touching. Martin Freeman is so absolutely terrific as Bilbo that it made me wish there was more of him in this already somewhat bloated movie. The climactic fight between Thorin and Azog is handled really well and pays off their conflict in a satisfying manner.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies somehow manages to be paced well enough despite its shortcomings in the storytelling. I wasn't bored during it thanks to what felt like most of the movie taking place in the midst of the massive titular battle. The action was exciting but it came at a price as the movie failed to develop key characters and included a halfhearted attempt to connect with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, The Hobbit proved to be too different from The Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, Five Armies makes it clear that the discrepancy isn't just one of tone, but overall quality alike."

","Yes, they did laugh at me when I was the only one who clapped at the end of the movie. They would look at me as if I were crazy when I could perfectly lip sync at some instances specially the scenes from the previous movies. The staff would stare at me with scorn in their eyes. In their opinion, a homeless drunkard with nowhere better to go on a Saturday night who would even be glued to his seat five minutes after the credits, the last to leave the theatre. Oh well, What would they know of a sixteen year old who would hide his 50th anniversary edition of the Lord of The rings under his history text book, trying to trace Frodo's journey from Bag end through East Farthing on the map that was on the last page, while he was supposed to learn to mark the Panama canal on a world map. I can still mark the maps of the western lands of Middle Earth, Shire and Gondor better than any ""real"" map. I have read the book so many times that I could afford to make a bet with my mother on a page number and I would precisely turn to that particular page within 3 tries. Maybe I must tell my mother to send me my book or to bring it when she comes to see me. Knowing her, she might say its way cheaper to buy a new one. TBH ""The Hobbit"" wasn't great, they stretched it too much. They tried to make too much money out of a movie which portrayed greed as the ultimate cause of destruction. Maybe my standards are too high. Maybe I never liked The Hobbit. Maybe I know nothing about movies. The Hobbit series never gave me the raw emotions that the lord of the rings movies gave, specially The Battle of Five Armies. But nevertheless, thirteen years, that's how long it has been from 2001 to 2014. Peter Jackson might still make one more movie on Tolkien's work. It's been often said that thirteen is not a lucky number."
"dfranzen70","7","1","4","21 December 2014"," Fun to watch, just not too provocative
","It's here; it's finally here. As the end of a trilogy, The Battle of the Five Armies doesn't have the emotional impact that The Return of the King, but it's still fine movie-making. The titular battle is a sweeping epic worthy of turned-up speakers and rattling high definition. It's an entertaining film; it just doesn't carry with it that sheen of instant classic, as its predecessors did.<br/><br/>The movie picks up where the previous installment, The Desolation of Smaug, left off. Right away, we're helicoptered into dazzling action, as Smaug is attacking the floating village of Lake-town, burning homes and people alike with only revenge upon his intelligent but lizard-like brain. But it's when the monster is slain - not a giveaway, as it occurs so early in the movie - that things really get going. That's because although the Dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) lay claim to the vast treasure, previously guarded by Smaug, beneath the Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, others want to get their beaks wet as well.<br/><br/>The refugees of Lake-Town, led by Bard (Luke Evans), had been promised some of the treasure in exchange for harboring the Dwarfs - and now they need it, what with no homes and few possessions and all. Meanwhile, the Elves, led by Thranduil (Lee Pace) wish to reclaim a particular artifact for themselves, as it was reportedly stolen by Dwarfs eons ago in a different battle. Oh, but that's not all. It seems that a new race of Orcs, led by Azog the Defiler, is intent on taking the mountain as a strategic stronghold. And these are no ordinary, mindless Orcs, either. These guys have skills, more than just brute force.<br/><br/>Thorin and his crew are in the mountain, looking for the Arkstone (a stone meant for the Dwarven King that makes him even more powerful), when Lake-Town falls. But there be madness in the mountain, madness that everyone in the party can feel is seeping into the skull of Thorin himself. As you might imagine, this makes our hero Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a little uneasy.<br/><br/>And what to make of these new Orcs? It's a situation that both puzzles and worries Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Saruman (Christopher Lee) - yep, all four appear in this movie. And, what's more, what they discover has direct ramifications for the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy to follow. Another connected subplot is the burgeoning romance between Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), with protective Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) looking on concernedly, although it was not part of Tolkien's original work.<br/><br/>So why isn't this a stunning spectacle on par of the LOTR movies? Because of a lack of emotional punch. The Lord of the Rings books were long and detailed, and director Peter Jackson slipped as much detail into the movies as possible. Much of the journey that the Fellowship undertook was seen on screen, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters and really empathize with them. There were also dynamics within the group (Gimli/Legolas, Frodo/Sam, Boromir/Aragorn) that are missing here. Really, many of the Dwarfs are interchangeable - as their similar-sounding names indicate - and the only real dynamics are between Thorin and Bilbo and between Thorin and Everyone Else. A lack of empathy for the Dwarfs' plight makes them less protagonists and more just regular participants in the sweeping plot.<br/><br/>To be sure, the battle is a terrific scene. Dwarfs, Elves, Men, Orcs, perhaps something else that may not have been in the original book - they all come together in close hand-to-hand combat. For some, it's a fight to reclaim treasure; for others, it's a fight to gain the upper hand in a larger, upcoming war. And for still others, the fate of the whole of Middle-earth rests in who takes the mountain. Knowing the ultimate resolution to the battle doesn't diminish one's appreciation of it, either.<br/><br/>And when the movie does end, the final scene is a fitting coda. It doesn't pack the punch of the end of Return of the King, and couldn't - because readers know already of the events following The Hobbit and leading up to The Fellowship of the Ring. Jackson does a fine job with the tale, even if The Hobbit was just one short book and even if he had to invent characters (Tauriel). He did the best with what he had, and he was the right choice to direct the trilogy all along. Even his doppleganger, Guillermo del Toro, wouldn't have given us as much of a thrill ride."
"Ovidium80","7","1","4","21 December 2014"," Could have been so much more
","The movie was OK, but not the epic movie one would expect as the final movie of the trilogy. A lot of CGI, and not the best CGI you could see in a movie with such a budget. The movie felt short and a lot of things were left unexplained, not to mention that the journey back home was cut completely. Compared to the LOTR trilogy it felt simply cheap. As a fan of Tolkien's books I enjoyed the movie but I think that Peter Jackson could have done a better job with The Hobbit trilogy. The love story between the elf and the dwarf was not needed and a lot of other important things were left unexplained, like what happened to the gold or with The Bard. Too much fighting scenes, mediocre CGI and many important characters with very few lines in the movie. Maybe the extended version will be better."
"Imaculata","7","1","4","21 December 2014"," Entertaining, but clearly shows this was meant to be two movies
","I came out of this movie feeling entertained, but also a bit underwhelmed. It was fun, but it never really succeeded to connect with me. Plus it is a movie that has to exist in the shadow of the previous movie, and also one hugely successful older trilogy. Its not a bad movie, not at all. But you can clearly tell that this story was never intended to be stretched out to three movies, especially since the dragon dies before the opening title. So it comes as no surprise that the rest of the movie is just armies fighting, and a lot of fan fiction being thrown at the screen. A lot of cameos and references feel horrible forced, especially when the movie tries to throw an Aragorn reference in (Thank the gods that Vigo said no to a cameo). This movie did not need this many cameos. But it's kind of like the writers were shrugging at the audience, while saying ""That's all we got"".<br/><br/>So while the movie is a decent entertaining fantasy flick, it doesn't really resonate, or hit any real emotional notes with the audience. It tries desperately to throw in some drama, but this only reminds us that we still don't know most of the dwarfs by name, nor have they gotten any character development. I also suspect there are quite a number of missing scenes, because some things literally pop up out of thin air (such as a bunch of mountain goats that appear completely out of nowhere).<br/><br/>The acting is good though, and everyone delivers a decent performance. The special effects are great, and the creature designs and costumes are all very well done. And the movie closes with a smooth transition to the Fellowship of the Ring, which I think was well done. But this movie is definitely not as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Thankfully, unlike Return of the King, the ending to this movie is not drawn out. It ends exactly when it needs to."
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","7","1","4","20 December 2014"," Enjoyable, but an overkill if there ever was one
","6.5* <br/><br/>The Battle of the 5 Armies proves there was no need for three films to tell this tale. The entire film revolves around, well, a battle. With a couple of minutes of Smaug and another couple of minutes of Dol Guldur, this film really doesn't justify its purpose. I will not dwell in the departures from the original material - it's not necessarily bad, and it's been many years since I read the book to pretend I'd notice most of them. But some inconsistencies between the Hobbit and LotR films are evident and a little too obvious.<br/><br/>Ultimately, as it is, the three films could have easily been converged to two. The battle doesn't need to last that long - it's not like we haven't seen it before. Overwhelming odds, last minute reinforcements, hobbit interference, Legolas being a poser to impress a redhead, really bad strategy on the orcs' behalf (the dwarfs and elves are about to fight each other, but they don't let them do that, why exactly?), miraculous salvation: Peter Jackson, you should have cut the Eagles. Please. For once, perhaps the good guys could get away with a victory not due to supernatural help?<br/><br/>Since they wanted 3 films, I think they should have just gone even more astray to make it work. Thranduil is an intriguing kind of antihero - give him more depth! He's interesting! Tauriel used to be in love with Legolas, but this seems more or less forgotten. You already bothered to reveal the Necromancer as Sauron, use him! He's freakin' Sauron. He steals the show. I'd sit and watch an hour of his epilepsy inducing Eye am in my own Eye trick. More Nazgul! Or give Christopher Lee two more lines, he is reason enough to watch anything. His thunderous voice can bring down the bloody mountain!<br/><br/>I mean, it's worth watching, but I can't withhold a 'meh'. I would advise against watching it at the cinema. Watching it back to back with the other ones on DVD or something would probably be more enjoyable."
"assman200","Null","1","4","19 December 2014"," Unremarkable in every way but not bad
","It may be that I've grown jaded to CGI ""epic"" and sweeping tales but I found this movie to be almost completely unremarkable in every way. There's nothing wrong or bad on display it's just that I felt no real connection to any character even after three long drawn out films. I also was never awed by any single action scene with one exception. That exception being Legolis' dispatching of a rather nasty Orc on the crumbling bridge. The effects and computer generated images all played rather false and shallow mostly because of overuse. Everything felt CGI unlike the original trilogy. Overall, I'd label this movie tolerable but severely lacking in entertainment value. The lack of emotional depth given run times is baffling but one exchange at the end of the film does hit a chord ""Why does it (love) hurt so much?"" Answer: ""Because it was real."" The movie needed more lines and writing like that and far less CGI monster beheadings."
"bridle15","6","1","4","19 December 2014"," The weakest link
","I was really excited for this movie especially when I found out about the 45 minute battle sequence. But all there was was a over use of CGI that got annoying, characters that weren't supposed to be in the film defining gravity and such and also the acting wasn't anything special either.<br/><br/>It was hard to get into, unlike desolation of Smaug which I thought was really good (the first time anyway) and Unexpected journey seemed to take you to middle earth in a more efficient way than this movie.<br/><br/>Despite the many battle sequences involved non of them seemed to grip you and you didn't really care about the characters because the orcs and goblins weren't anything menacing that could harm anyone. Not a 'creature bred for war' at all. They reminded me of the battle droids from the Star Wars prequels that are just there to make the heroes look more impressive which they do at times but can get quite repetitive.<br/><br/>The movie constantly attempts to be the LOTR but generally fails. However some moments are entertaining to watch that relate to the style such as the vast armies of evil and their chants whilst they march. The references to LOTR are quite impressive but we have seen them before so nothing really new. I did however like the fact that Christopher Lee made a awesome appearance although he wasn't in the book I don't mind to much as he's one of my favourite actors and favourite villain from LOTR so it was interesting to see him fighting for the forces of good- 'leave Sauron to me'.<br/><br/>Overall though I give it a 6.8/10 which really does kill me inside as I am a huge LOTR fan and I did enjoy the first two hobbit movies but this one just isn't there. It makes me sad that Peter Jackson kind of rushed this movie just to make the linkage with LOTR. From all of the hard work that has gone into the previous films seems to have been neglected for this ending (probably due to there being 3 movies) to the final installment of this partly epic saga."

","Originally subtitled ""There and Back Again"" (just like the book), but when this concluding chapter deals with pretty much nothing but warfare, you can understand why the change was made. Easily the most violent installment, not just of THE HOBBIT trilogy, but of all six films in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth series. Fans of the book will be shocked by some major changes. With a drawn out ending in THE RETURN OF THE KING to ensure all doors were closed, FIVE ARMIES' conclusion feels like the blink of an eye in comparison. However, even with terrible acting from the extras, the main cast is still spot on in an overall exciting outing. Bill Boyd, who played Pippin in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, sings the closing theme song.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"
"vasmuth88","7","1","4","15 December 2014"," Surprisingly entertaining movie-A fan review
","First of all I am really a fan of the hobbit book. Have read it at least 5 times in my life and probably will continue to do so in the future. The first hobbit movie was pleasant but in my opinion the 2nd one was very bad. Pacing issues and completely new story. Everything from the book was changed so it fitted (I am sorry to say so) Peter Jacksons very small perception of causality and fun (at least theatrical perception, I don't know him in person). Because of the groundwork of the 2nd movie this one had no chance to follow the source material even one bit. The new story was a mess and had almost no connection to the book anymore. Many dialogues got me almost bursting out laughing. So much cliché and dumbed down talking. Then I realised suddenly that I was really enjoying the movie. It was a free for all in middle earth. Imagine a rather silly fight focused anime mixed with shakespearean moments. It was awesome for the most parts. In a particular sad scene Bilbo acted completely like a toon character. The fight scene before was straight out of a looney tunes short story and the dwarfs went 100% warhammer meets scots. If you are a fan of quiet moments, slow pacing and want a movie true to tolkiens legacy this one is pretty bad but as an action flip it really gave me a lot to enjoy. Delightfully cheesy from a director who went out to give us a compilation from all his clichés while mocking them himself. Only thing that bothered me was the really well written end. It was very very good and reminiscent of the best the lord of the rings had to offer. It was breathtaking and had very well slow emotional moments. This did not fit the tone of the movie and made me wish more of the movie would be that way. Movie was enjoyable B-Movie Action spin of off Lord of the Rings but the ending was truly magnificent. I would actually be happy to see the hobbit interpreted again with a mor serious tone so you can choose what you prefer. Another small complaint is that the movie clearly is cut in a few parts which definitely need the extended cuts. Some scenes were extremely rushed."

Another legolas piece that I thought was out of place was when he was running up the blocks which were falling at the same time. The cgi was off or was it slow mo... anyway... The interaction with Bilbo and Thorin when Trorin died I felt was a poor scene. I didn't feel Billy Connelly added anything to the film. Thranduil was pretty cool. Legolas grew on me.

Tolkien and his stories much more made into film. I am no purist and the like but the skipping screenplay is absolutely forgivable for me. In particular with this film The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a little bit flimsy for me to decide if this should be worth spending time to muse out yourself of fine CGs and stuffs. No doubt awkwardly speaking this is somewhat a good family movie to go to...literally I heard a little girl scream out due maybe to some of the scary scenes...surely this movie will not make you sleepy or the tendency to doze off to lalaland. If you are anticipating for the next Hollywood blood bath I recommend this movie. But if you are into or otherwise content oriented fellow read the book instead. Truly I felt that this movie the way it is played on the screen is a little bit wayward departure from the books it's stories are based from. I fairly noticed that there unresolved stories that would make one wonder...would there be another Tolkienese movie in the works???.

","Enough has been made about the decision to cut The Hobbit into three movies. Instead of examining what is or isn't necessary here (which is irrelevant unless you've read the books anyway, something that doesn't pertain to the actual quality of the films themselves), we must look at this a movie as a whole. The battle with Smaug at the beginning is thrilling but also lacks any emotional investment. It was drained at the end of the last film, an ending that did work there but doesn't work as a beginning here. <br/><br/>There's a lot of action in this Battle of course, probably too much although it is all pretty to look at if a bit too CGI heavy (enough has been made of that too). <br/><br/>Side note, this is the first one I saw in High Frame Rate and I must say it was distracting, took me right out of the movie most of the time.

","Oh, Middle Earth. You and your orcs, elves, magic rings, and dragons that sound an awful lot like a certain detective I know from the BBC. It's sad to see you go but, after witnessing a decline in quality from your predecessor trilogy, maybe it was time. Yes, this is where the epic saga that has been Middle Earth, from its first epic fantasy masterpieces that were The Lord of the Rings, to the slightly less epic and slightly less masterpiecey Hobbit trilogy, ends. It also wraps up the greatest display of ""how to turn a 300 page book into 9 hours worth of film"" ever conceived.<br/><br/>It's been a long journey to get here, one that dragged on perhaps a little too long, but still delivered us quite the fantasy adventure. This is why The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies had a big duty to fulfill, and the trailers certainly made it their duty to promise us the most epicy of epic finales to the most epicy epic saga of epicness ever made. And you better bring the tissues too, 'cuz this one's gonna' bust out all the feels. Take THAT Tolkienites!<br/><br/>OK, all jokes aside, The Battle of the Five Armies is too much fun not to enjoy. Is it over-the-top? Yes. Do the epic dramatic moments sometimes come off way cheesier than intended? Yes. Does the CGI make you snicker every once in a while? Yes. But dammit if it's not the three hour long battle that you didn't know you needed but totally did need. You have a three hour movie here that is literally probably 80% killing stuff and 20% talking about what stuff is getting killed next. <br/><br/>The film opens with the Laketown battle against Smaug, which is then followed by the title card. Yeah, I hope you got your dragon fix in the second film because our scaly friend is offed within about ten minutes (sorry to spoil it for all twelve of you who thought the dragon would actually survive). What follows is the battle for the dwarven halls that Thorin and friends did all the work to reclaim just so everybody could then pop out of the woodwork claiming they deserve a piece of that pie. It's a battle that pits dwarfs, elves, and humans against a massive army of Mordor orcs and goblins who are bred for the sole purpose of killing stuff, but can also be killed by a bunch of farmers. I don't have enough fingers to plug all of this film's plot holes, but I don't want to spend time doing that either. I just want to see more heads chopped off. <br/><br/>A lot of people have criticized Peter Jackson for this Hobbit trilogy. Sure he turned a simple little fantasy adventure novel into a three picture cash cow, but in the 70+ years since this book was written Jackson has certainly brought it to life in the most exciting, spectacular, and accessible way ever. The grand scale of these novels and the world that Tolkien built is one of the greatest feats of literature of all time, and it deserved to be brought to celluloid in the biggest and flashiest way possible. <br/><br/>Yes there are a lot of liberties taken here, but that's why it's called an adaptation. Yes, some liberties are more sinful than others; the Kili/Tauriel love story is one of the dumbest things I can think of in this whole trilogy, and putting Legolas in was silly and unnecessary, and creating the character of Tauriel just because Evangeline Lily looks smokin' as a redhead also warrants a roll of the eyes. But at the end of the day I can only crap on this movie so much before I admit that I had a hell of a great time watching The Battle of the Five Armies."
"atlasmb","7","1","5","15 January 2015"," A Spectacular Battle
","First of all, I would not recommend this film for anyone who has not seen any of the other films in this series (including the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). Knowledge of the characters is critical to fully understand the action.<br/><br/>This film is a spectacle. When Peter Jackson decided to make ""The Hobbit"" a trilogy instead of a two-part story, it meant that this episode would be primarily a battle. So it is well named. And the battle provides what most viewers want to see in a battle--hordes of formidable warriors, with the ante constantly being upped.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" not only because the action is spectacular, but because the sets and scenery are creative and awesome. Also, the story of the battle is multi-layered, with a number of confrontations between foes.<br/><br/>Lastly, the CGI--which is responsible for most of what I have mentioned--is clean and convincing. I did not watch in 3-D or on the IMAX screen and they were not necessary for an entertaining experience."
"quincytheodore","7","1","5","21 December 2014"," It may not rise to legendary prestige, but it is a fitting, and quite spectacular end to the trilogy.
","Like the prequel, The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is rather long, some scenes are deliberately prolonged to buff the movie's length. However, it does so with crisper action sequences and slightly faster pace. There are many characters in play, each taking turns for their moments in spotlight. They are not the fellowship, yet they mash together sufficiently well to ensure a dynamic cast. With good choreograph and special effect, even though it's longer than it needs be, the movie will still entertain till the end.<br/><br/>Story revolves around a recently dragon plagued mountain, the valuable gold residing there and its strategic position attract many armies to fight for its claim, hence the title. It gives some intricacy and politic maneuvering for the backdrop, none too overly complicated and they push the plot nicely. The movie switches attention neatly between Ian McKellen, Luke Evans, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom and Martin Freeman, all capable of leading a movie on their own. The prequels often had a character running in circle, thus wasting ten to fifteen minutes. Fortunately, this one divides the scenes with more focus, while it doesn't solve the plodding pace entirely, it ensures smoother transition between characters and their respective battles.<br/><br/>Visual is splendidly done. Both the large scale shots as well as the skirmishes have fluid motion to them. The orcs look pretty humanoid, the slimy giants are convincing as they nudge bricks and stones in their path. Some scenes do look digitized, but considering the height difference and intricate details involved, the movie does a good job of portraying the mythical battle. It doesn't rely too much on CG for closer combat, one of the better aspects it has over the predecessors is the scale of combat differs and it simply has more. Choreograph for these scuffle look good since it mixes CG and real stunt efficiently, it also utilizes 3D effect better.<br/><br/>The main issue is the same persisting one, it's too thin a script to divvy into two and half hour movie. There's bound to be some padding here and there, like how Thorin wallows in the mountain or shenanigans of some comedic relief, although it's not as bad as forty five minute soiree on Bilbo's house or needless hide-and-seek with Smaug. It fortifies the playtime with incredible feat of acrobat or destruction, few of them are quiet the reminiscence of Lord of the Ring. As half of the it consists of heated battle, it manages to not be dangerously tedious.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies can be faulted for not delivering what it's promised on the title. It certainly could trim some of its unnecessary dawdling, yet it delivers a marvelous enough last act for The Hobbit trilogy."

","1. A little bit disappointed that Smaug died so early and easily. So...please enlighten me, what is the second Hobbit movie all about? But can I say I like Smaug's voice? haha 2. Never figured out why ""five"" armies: elves, human, dwarfs, orcs, and what? Eagles? 3. Not surprised when Thorin sacrificed himself to kill the disgusting monster, but really surprised that he didn't realize Azog was pretending to be dead. After all, Azog appeared to be so difficult to kill. 4. Could someone just kill Alfrid? Or at least lock him up? Don't call me cruel, but isn't he the kind of character that might screw up everything when you don't pay attention? Still don't understand why Bard treated him like an assistant. Come on, did you just know Alfrid yesterday? 5. If they didn't kill Kili, perhaps I'll give it a 10. I know he had to die because the book said so, but the love between him and Tauriel just made it more difficult to accept. I cried tons and tons."

""What?"" ""For war..."" - more than once - Legolas cockblock/love triangle - Legolas jumping on a bat? Was cool when he shot it in the head though - Every dwarf soldier/orc soldier looks the same - no diversity - copy and paste/red shirt - A few lines were just dubbed over action when you can obviously see that the characters weren't saying them - Beorn hardly in it - Not enough originality - Azog has a morning star/mace like the Witch King in RotK, eagles kill a whole army like Fell Beasts in RotK, - Thorin's death was stupid - Skipped Erebor ending - what happens to the dwarfs now?

","Just came out of Imax cinema, Hyderabad, India where the film released a week ahead of USA's schedule.<br/><br/>I have watched LOTR numerous times just like many of the fans here. The Hobbit, that started as ambitious project fails to deliver what LOTR does, but that's fine with me as all the elements that a film need are done in right amounts.<br/><br/>This movie starts off just where it left and is about the mentality of the dwarfs (mainly Thorin) and the Men, Orks, Elves and yes BILBO.<br/><br/>Acting is the prime aspect of the movie. Every actor gave their hundred percent. Visual effects and the war scenes are marvelous.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect I feel is the direction department. There was too much of experimentation with the screenplay. Peter Jackson tried hard to get the charm of Lord of the Rings to this movie, but in vain.<br/><br/>Overall it's a super fun movie to watch, which transports you to a different world. <br/><br/>A Definite watch for lovers and Haters!!!!<br/><br/>Rating 7.8/10"

Because she had never seen the hobbit I wanted to explain her the movies and I found this video.<br/><br/>This is a small recap of the two last hobbits within 2 min. It was kind of funny and that's why she agreed to come with me. So if you have never seen the hobbit and you want to watch the last one. Watch this video.

"lasttimeisaw","6","1","6","6 October 2015"," THE HOBBIT trilogy dutifully conducts its task as an overlong prequel
","Not intentionally, I missed the final episode of Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT trilogy in theatre, now a belated BluRay viewing can finally give a not so satisfactory closure to the Middle Earth adventure, 15 years, 6 epic-length features, although THE HOBBIT can hardly match the height of THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, still, it is hard to say goodbye to the mythical terrain where all the fantastic creatures reside, a toast to an end of an era.<br/><br/>The prologue of THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is immediately continues where THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG (2013) finishes, in about 10-minutes, a ravaging Smaug (voiced by Cumberbatch) again fails to overcome his bad habit of verbosity, exits the scene thanks to Bard's (Evans) last arrow. Then, almost inclusively, the film embarks on a prolonged battle in the Lonely Mountain, involving dwarfs, elves, men, and two armies of orcs. The only conflict is Thorin's (Armitage) obsession with all the treasure in the mountain (you don't need a magic ring to be delusional, treasures can do the same trick), which intrigues him to obstinately block the entrance of the mountain, refuse the survivors from Laketown and an elf army lead by Thranduil (Pace) to share the astronomical fortune, while they remain still and wait for the succour from his cousin Dáin's (Connolly) dwarf army. All is set to be an internecine war, yet orcs are too imbecile to know when a snipe and a clam grapple, it is the fisherman who profits. Thus, their impetuous arrival instantly unite elves, men and dwarfs as allies, together, after Thorin finally gets his senses back, they engage a final bloodletting battle to defend their common enemy.<br/><br/>The action sequences seldom best its predecessors, a rehash of the grandiose battle array, soon retreat to the main combats, after dispatching two dwarfs to evoke pathos, all eyes are on Legolas (Bloom) Vs. Bolg (Tui) and Thorin Vs. Azog the Defiler (Bennett), one pointer for dwarfs, if you're rather good-looking, the odds of being massacred by orcs are pretty high. Yet, for the main battle scene, surprisingly Jackson is quite frugal in letting us witness how the battle is won on a grand level, Beorn (Persbrandt) is only seen in one glimpsing scene when he turns into a gigantic bear and hurtles to the orc troop, so is the Great Eagles, really there is no budget for that? Who can buy that?<br/><br/>The cast looks jaded, not just Gandalf (McKellen), Bloom's Legolas, as swift as a jumping monkey, completely loses his knockout vitality, Bard is never seen shooting another arrow after killing Smaug, quickly retreats to be a second fiddler while Alfrid (Gage) is given too many scenes as an unrepentant nuisance, Thranduill is habitually putting on airs whereas Tauriel (Lilly) is not agile enough to save her love. Also the main anchor of the film is not Bilbo (Freeman), the master of burglar, anymore, it is Armitage's Thorin, carries the brunt of the flimsy narrative, it is his inner demon to grapple with, his hard-earned redemption to fight for and his sacrifice to tip the scale, despite compared as an inferior analogue of Aragorn, Armitage gives Thorin a full-blooded rendition in his last combat to win his dignity and honour back. As the ending intentionally circles back to the beginning of THE LORD OF RING with nostalgic bliss, THE HOBBIT trilogy dutifully conducts its task as an overlong prequel, to evoke that the next chapter is far more competent, intriguing and intricate, that's what every qualified prequel should do, just like STAR WARS."
"obiwankenobean","8","1","6","21 January 2015"," Didn't reach the heights of LOTR
","I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. The CGI is perfect, as you'd expect (although Legolas jumping up falling rocks was a bit OTT), but I wanted the film to be darker. The acting is awesome, can't take anything away from that. However Bilbo is pretty much a side character in this instalment. <br/><br/>After the film I thought ""wow, that was amazing"" & then an hour or so later that all changed. There are so many unanswered questions that easily could have been tied up at the end.<br/><br/>1. What happened to all that gold? 2. What did Bard & his community do? 3. Did the Elf retrieve the jewels he was after? 4. Why did those giant worms turn up for 10 seconds & then not be seen again? 5. What happened to the Arkenstone?<br/><br/>I did really like the 45+ minute battle though, that was really good, but overall I didn't feel the peril &/or attachment I had to the character of the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>A generous 8/10 from me - but it missed the mark."
"Kop_Reaz","8","1","6","17 January 2015"," Pure Hollywood Blockbuster Material
","The title ""The Battle of The Five Armies"" summarizes the film. It's 2 hours of fantastic battle scenes and 10 minutes of silly morality fight.<br/><br/>Now people complaining that it's all battle, they never should have made a trilogy from a single book. I completely agree with them. But where were these people when HP7 Deathly Hallows were made. How come Avengers and Deathly Hallows part 2 make IMDb top 250 and Hobbit is called utter sh**! I mean How on earth Deathly Hallows part 2 achieved 87% metascore! And Avengers was called the ultimate nerd fantasy. Quality wise this Hobbit film is way better Harry Potter and Avengers. Let's not forget the summer blockbuster ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", which is in my opinion the real sh**.<br/><br/>Honestly The Battle of The Five Armies is the best Hobbit movies among the three. Trust me this is the coolest fantasy movie of the year. The battles are awesome. The visual effects are excellent. The sound mixing is super.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: If you are a fan, you are gonna watch it anyway. If not don't bother unless you are open minded. It's no where near LOTR, so don't expect. And I don't think this film deserves 8/10. I'm just trying to balance."

The first time I thought it was decent. Then it got amazing after 5 watches of this movie. The thing I hate only about the hobbit prequel trilogy is that its a trilogy. I have the book and... I have no idea why peter made it a trilogy like lord of the rings. I know he made the lord of the rings series a trilogy. Because there are 3 books and the hobbit is one book. I don't like that. Anyways it has amazing action lots of fire and creepy looking Orcs. Creepy looking Orcs. Anyways also ITs weird how Kili dies in the end and Tauriels like ""If This Is Love... I Don't Want it!!! Boom. 2nd movie you love him now you don't want him. Punk. I personally laugh at Smaugs death. Its amazing. Smaugs death is so bad its good. Smaugs Like colicky Celka Calli.... so. Moving on, what I'm trying to say is don't go over the top with this movie. Its fun. Its there to make a pretty good and emotional addition to the middle earth movie saga. The reason I say emotional is because of the deaths. Its basically the fantasy version of jack don't let go in titanic for Kili and Tauriel. Except Tauriels like I Don't Want Love Boohoo!!!!!! Good for you. I give this movie a 7/10 see? Im being generous!"

","It's not so easy to watch a film and write a review when you have seen so many bad reviews before. In the most cases written by people who have reed the book 'the hobbit'. I didn't read 'the Hobbit' and I didn't read the 'Lord of the Rings'-trilogy. But yes, you can see the difference in the two film trilogies clearly. One is based on three books and the films are full of action and really long...the other one is based on one book and they tried really hard to fill the gaps...but the films are shorter, less actions, sometimes boring. Nevertheless, I enjoyed 'The Battle of Five Armies'. It's entertaining and you don't have the feeling that it won't end like 'The Return of the King'. If I would have read the books I would be angry too because of characters like Legolas who doesn't appear in the book. But if you want to see a film and be entertained, you can watch 'The Battle of Five Armies' and enjoy it. It's possible."

","In the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT trilogy, I was expecting a lot; merely because I was a viewer that has faithfully seen the Middle-Earth movies without ever reading a page of the books. By the time the movie was over, I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>To start things off, I understand that Smaug was not as big of a key-point in BOFA as much as he was in DoS, but to kill him off about twelve minutes into the movie left me feeling a bit discerned. I was hoping for something bigger, I spent almost three hours watching the previous movie, I wanted something big!<br/><br/>The second matter was how the Five Armies were all introduced much similar to a Domino Effect; Person A introduces Person B, Person B introduces Person C, and so forth. The pacing was extremely rushed, it made me feel as though the editors stopped caring (I will admit, after spending almost a decade on six three-hour movies set in New Zealand, I would stop caring too).<br/><br/>Speaking of the pacing, it was all action-packed. There was barely any time to breathe and take in all of the sequences going on. I was extremely pumped for the beginning of the actual Battle of the Five Armies for so long that it turned into a dud.<br/><br/>All in all, I type this review knowing that I sat through two hours and twenty-four minutes wanting to go to the bathroom, only to realize that I could've left the theater for a good twenty minutes without missing anything."

","Peter Jackson almost nailed it, God damn he was almost there. I'm not a film critic but in my opinion, BOFA was wonderful, up until the first character died. I have many issues with the ending, which sadly ruined the whole film for me.<br/><br/>Why oh why oh why was it so rushed? It is the shortest film in The Hobbit trilogy, just another 20 minutes would have even perfect. <br/><br/>⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️SPOLIERS!!!⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️<br/><br/>I feel as though none of the characters were given a proper send off. Fili died, it showed his body once, Kilis brief reaction, and then he was gone. Then boom, Kili died too. I loved the scene between Thorin and Bilbo, but again, it showed Thorin once and he was gone. Why on Earth didn't any of them get a proper burial for us to see? A scene back in the mountain in some kind of memory for the fallen was missing desperately. It didn't even show the dwarfs reactions, who by the way were almost forgotten throughout the film. There was more focus on the irritating Alfrid than the dwarfs of Erebor, what a tragic idea that was. Also, what happened to Bard, Tauriel or Dain? The battle ended so suddenly and everyone just sort of disappeared. It is such an awful shame that the film was missing just a final few scenes, such as a burial, the crowning of a knew dwarf king of a breaf glimpse of Bard and his family. The battle was epic, but the ending was disappointing. Let's pray there might be some extra worthwhile scenes in the extended edition. Overall, Middle Earth will always be in my heart and I thank Peter Jackson and the incredible casts for bringing these films to life."

","There should be an asterisk in the credits after it says ""Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien"" that says *loosely. The only parts that were in the book was the first 5 minutes. After that it went in an entirely different direction and did its own thing. The whole movie is essentially a 3-hour battle sequence and it looks like you're watching somebody play a video game, and it gets tedious very quickly. That being said, I'm kind of sad that the world of Middle Earth is finished. After ""Hunger Games"" ends next year, what other book franchises will there be left to adapt other than ""Maze Runner""? Nothing. It will force Hollywood to think of original ideas for once. Which I guess is a good thing, but at the same time I'm going to miss anticipating these movies and seeing them in a theater with like-minded fans.

","I thought the first Hobbit was a little too long, number two picked up the pace with story and such, but this one really did it for me. Maybe it's not the best film, but it sure is awesome. Maybe it's because I was younger when it came out and my little brother and I would spend hours rewatching the main battle on the DVD. I just think that for a movie with such grand scale with so much happening during the entirety of the film, densely packed with fantastical action, it is particularly well executed and choreographed. The LOTR franchise does emotion better than these Hobbit films, but I think Peter Jackson succeeded here at creating a good movie for escaping to outlandish lands of grand mythical violence."

","...should have been better.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, binge-watched the whole trilogy, I have seen and read LOTR. I'm flabbergasted.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the trilogy as a whole quite a lot. It was an entertaining action fest set in LOTR-like scenery. I was even treated with quite a few characters which I recognized from LOTR. Story was easy to follow, and not too much shakycam or fast cuts were used. Several of the actors performed well enough, nothing really drew me out of story, untill last installment started unfolding right in front of my eyes. That's when it all came tumbling down.<br/><br/>Now I'm sitting here wondering what went wrong? Was it the tone of the movie? Death and mayhem were treated quite humorously through the whole trilogy, important character deaths were dealt swiftly and efficiently. Movie was as violent as the trilogy as a whole, yet general tone felt almost comedic. Wasn't The Hobbit written for children?<br/><br/>Characters representing good were god-like creatures, able to shrug off any injury except when plot required someone to die. Legolas and his love intrest were an unstoppable force of nature which put Matrix and its ilk to shame. I had to try to come up any excuse why any other characters were even fighting, just hunker down and let immortal terror-twins save the day? Dwarwes were faring just as well, kicking and head-butting armored orcs to death from left and right. I couldn't help wondering why they bothered to carry weapons at all. Rest of the elves, their superficial, greedy and vain king included were mere cannon fodder, as were the village folk. Maybe 10 years old Superman fan had created the script?<br/><br/>Worst offender however for me was the last part of the trilogy. It felt like it was completely cgi. It felt like I was watching the last part of LOTR through a filter that switched the original characters with those taken from The Hobbit-trilogy. So, was this 10 years old Superman fan also some sort of computer geek, and told Jackson he could do all the work for the last part of the trilogy?<br/><br/>Six stars for the reasons mentioned at the beginning of this review. Four stars missing because of the reasons mentioned at the latter part."

","After watching the first two parts in the extended versions the time has come for the third one to close up and it disappointed greatly. By the end of the movie I realized that the authors just wanted to bring their story as close to the Lord of the Rings as possible (taking in consideration movies are prequels) but they executed it very poorly. The most powerful and strongest villain gets killed within the first fifteen minutes with a spear. The bravest and most selfless dwarf suddenly turns selfish and greedy only after a small talk to realize he got confused and turns good again. The elves who wanted to start a war because of the necklace only to end up helping everyone else and not getting the necklace after all. The armies that come to the battlefield at just the right time. The stones that pile up so perfectly while falling that the hero can jump on them and save his life. The immortal that falls in love apparently for the first time in god knows how many years she lived already and feels its pain. And the snowball goes on and on. In a word, the whole Hobbit trilogy is absolutely unnecessary to watch because a) its story is NOT interesting one bit, b) the authors simply parasitize on the legacy of the superior movies and c) three movies can be easily turned into one three hour movie without the loss of quality but it still won't be a good movie. The Hobbit is just another cash-grabber like any other sequel/prequel/reboot that's coming out nowadays and doesn't bring anything knew or meaningful to the cinema world whatsoever."

Now to say it is bad would be a disservice to the effects team and the actors but there is a lot this film leaves to be desired. Let me just get right into it by saying Thorin is at his best in this movie, I felt in the first two instalments he was a little too broody and whiny and although he still is it works a lot better in this film. His struggle with power and living up to the expectations of his family and friends is fascinating here due to no small part Richard Armitage's performance. Once again Martin Freeman is excellent but is most underused in this one. The opening sequence with Smaug decimating Lake town is thrilling, beautiful and as good as the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings gets but it is the height of the film in my opinion and the rest feels a little underwhelming in comparison. Azog vs Thorin was satisfying as we've been waiting for the rematch since the first film even if it's conclusion is bitter sweet. A little side note is the extended R-rated version of this film has a lot of gory extras which are a nice change of pace for the series and if you're old enough I recommend this version. The last thing I'd like to talk about is fittingly the end, this film does the goodbyes a lot better than Return of the King did, my biggest critique of that film was always its overly long endings and this film is very to the point and I like that, it also perfectly links up with the Fellowship of the Ring for all the marathon men and women out there. This film is all over the place in almost every aspect, tone, writing, pacing, ect. but I think the things I mentioned earlier in my review stop it from being a complete disaster. For now I'm going to give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies a (very) generous score of 7.2. See you in my Lord of the Rings reviews!"

","There's a lesson for filmmakers in the fact that Peter Jackson's best foray into Middle Earth was also his smallest.<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring introduced filmgoers to hobbits and the shire, elves and Rivendell, wizards and balrogs. But it did so on a smaller scale than that of later films, focusing on the journey of a few protagonists. Ironically, restricting the characters and locales magnified the sense of drama, and heightened the tension. We actually cared about what happened to the fellowship.<br/><br/>As the films grew in scope and grandeur, as makeup and models were replaced by pixels, that sense of precariousness (preciousness?) was lost. The climactic battles in Return of the King involved, first, a computer-generated horde of ghosts swarming a computer-generated horde of orcs, and then a computer-generated horde of orcs being swallowed by a computer-generated earthquake.<br/><br/>Jackson has ignored the lessons he should have learned from making The Lord of the Rings. His Hobbit flicks are comically overstuffed, a seven-hour epic drawn from the shortest of Tolkien's Middle Earth books and filled with plotlines that appeared nowhere in the original text. With Battle of the Five Armies, the series culminates in a multi-hour depiction of violence that in the novel takes up just a few pages.<br/><br/>Many have likened the action of this battle to a video game cut scene-the portions of a game in which there is no actual gameplay, just animation revealing a piece of the plot or a bit of adventure taking place elsewhere. This is both accurate and overly generous. At least most cut scenes are a minute or two in length."

","I m fanatical with Tolkien, i would never consider even the first trilogy faithful to the books or good enough, except the depiction of the evil characters, but on the Hobbit i think Jackson really messed up everything, i agree completely with all the low star reviewers, there is no connection with the book at all, the book compared to Lord of the Rings is short (not even a trilogy), and Tolkien wrote it for his children. But let me tell you why all this ovestretching had happened, it happened because the producers know that the general public does not have a clue of the book, they never read it, or even cared about its existence, so they thought, who cares if the movies are not faithfull, just make three out of it, they re going to watch it anyway, thats the simple truth."

"Tweekums","7","0","1","23 November 2017"," An action packed conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy
","After the events portrayed in 'The Desolation of Smaug' the dwarfs, under Thorin Oakenshield, have taken control of the mine under the Lonely Mountain and searching for the 'Arkenstone', not knowing that Bilbo Baggins has already found it. Meanwhile the dragon Smaug has attacked and destroyed Lake Town before being slain by Bard the Bowman. After this Bard becomes the leader of the survivors as they head to the Lonely Mountain expecting the dwarfs to help them. Thorin, affected by Dragon sickness, refuses and barricades the entrance. Soon a force of Elves turns up hoping to retrieve their own treasure from the mountain; they ally with the human forces and prepare to attack. Just as they are about to strike a large army of dwarfs arrives to help those in the mountain. That is the least of their worries; Orcish forces are also attacking and soon men, dwarfs and elves are fighting side by side.<br/><br/>This is a solid enough conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy which goes some way to link this trilogy to the 'Lord of the Rings'. The story is pretty simple and there are few real surprises just lots and lots of action. This action is pretty good for the most part although occasionally the CGI is a little obvious. The characters are mostly 'more of the same' with familiar characters battling the evil orcs. Alfrid Lickspittle, a character who lives up to his name, was a fun addition as the cowardly sidekick to the late ruler of Lake Town although why Bard trusted him for most of the film is a mystery as he shows his true colours at every possible opportunity. The cast does a solid job bringing the characters to life and the various CGI creatures look believable. Overall this film provided plenty of action although I'm not sure it was really necessary to turn a short book like The Hobbit into three films with lots of new material."
"destinylives52","7","0","1","29 July 2017"," Entertaining Despite A Mediocre Script
","Part 3 of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy shows the fate of the dragon Smaug, Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman), dwarf king Thorin and his band of dwarf followers, the ""lonely mountain"" and the enormous treasure hidden within it, and the five armies that will do battle for the mountain fortress and its riches. But more things are unexplained. Perhaps in the extended cuts more will be revealed; but it's still inexcusable for a theatrical cut to omit so many answers to so many questions.<br/><br/>Multiple story lines play out in rapid fire sequence — this movie has probably the shortest running time of all six ""Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" movies — resulting in a very fast paced movie that sometimes feel a bit rushed. Of course, the usual shenanigans are here: characters that defy the laws of physics — or maybe physics are different in Middle Earth — and able to take a great amount of battle damage without being truly harmed. Hey, if a character is fairly invincible, it kind of takes away the element of suspense that he or she may be killed. Granted, a few of the characters get killed after killing millions of the enemy, but at this point it becomes a bit silly and the impact of those deaths are greeted with a shrug and another bite of the hotdog.<br/><br/>Now, my most memorable movie moment of ""The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies"": the scene when Thorin (played by Richard Armitage, who looks a lot like Mel Gibson's Braveheart in his dwarf look) has an internal struggle, realizing what his greed has done to him and the choice he has to make if he doesn't want to follow the dreadful path his ancestors took.<br/><br/>Although full of problems that would be deserving of a much lesser grade, ""The Five Armies"" was still an enjoyable, entertaining feast for my eyes.

","I am of the opinion that if Peter Jackson and a quarter billion dollars couldn't satisfy a viewer, you are probably insatiable. Rather like complaining about living in the best country on the planet, during the greatest age of mankind, and doing nothing to improve it. Guess what? asking for the insurmountable and vindicating your self fulfilling prophecies went out with the millennium. The one where they had to start counting digits. This movie made contrived source material and undeveloped technology as close to modern mythology as one can. Fairy tales are not famed for character development. The nature of fine story telling is working with what you have at hand to pay for your dinner, and being asked back instead of driven out."

","Version I saw: UK cinema release (HFR 3D IMAX)<br/><br/>Actors: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 5/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 7/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 7/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>I was a defender of Peter Jackson as the Hobbit films released to disappointed audiences, but it now seems clear that he didn't know what he was doing with the story. The Dol Guldur/Necromancer plot line really was tacked on for no good reason, adding almost nothing except opportunities to foreshadow the events of Lord of the Rings. The over-abundance of characters is a nightmare to manage, and yet they still get corralled into one place at the climax for the battle of the title. Smaug gets killed off before the opening credits. It's all a bit messy.<br/><br/>And yet, the film remains very enjoyable, and I think, very good. The absolute orgy of scenery porn photographed by Andy Serkis' second unit combines with the master craftsmanship of Weta Workshop in both CGI and physical props/costumes/set dressing to make a sumptuous feast for the eyes. I honestly believe that if a viewer spent the whole movie focusing exclusively on the backgrounds, they would come away satisfied.<br/><br/>And the acting is not bad either. Admittedly, none of it (and nothing else in the movie either) has a shred of subtlety, but the cast do a good job of portraying those big, blunt emotional arcs. Thorin's (Richard Armitage) operatic descent into madness and then redemption, Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) fear, suspicion and ultimate bravery, Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) pointless romantic sub-plot, all are implemented with gusto, and come across about as well as you could reasonably hope.<br/><br/>As a die-hard Tolkien fan, I am happy to spend as long as I can in this Middle-Earth that Jackson has created. If the films had been 9 hours each, I would be fine with that. With more rigour at the screen writing stage, all three films could have been considerably better, but I am very happy with what we have."
"bilbobrick","7","0","3","6 December 2016"," Worst Middle-Earth Film- But Still Pretty Good
","Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies is the final chapter in The Hobbit trilogy. Packed with fighting, CGI, creatures, and set pieces, this film picks up right where the previous one left off, so don't go in expecting a bunch of exposition or recapping. This is the only Middle-Earth film that does not begin with a flashback, which I find quite interesting. However, it's made all the better for it, because, despite being the worst Middle-Earth film overall, the opening scene is one of the best scenes in the whole series, including the Lord of the Rings. These first 10-15 minutes are some of the most exciting moments I have ever spent at the cinema, and I was sad to see them end. <br/><br/>The film never again gets as good as this scene, but still remains a decently competent and enjoyable movie. Even though the eponymous mini-war takes up a very large portion of the movie, the filmmakers still find time for most of their characters, humor, and even some genuinely compelling and saddening moments. Richard Armitage gives a great performance as Thorin, and Peter Jackson shows us he still knows how to stage an epic battle-- even if it's not as good as the famous fights at Helm's Deep or the Black Gate. One could also certainly say that it succeeds at transforming a few pages of a children's book into an exciting cinematic experience.<br/><br/>As for negatives, there are definitely more here than in any of the other Middle-Earth films. As stated previously, the movie opens with its best scene, which may not be a wise choice. There are also many, many changes and additions to the book, some of which are fresh and interesting, and others that are not. The cheesy, creepy romance from the previous film is expanded upon; however, it is made no more intriguing or touching. There is also a brief scene which shows gigantic, terrifying Were-Worms burrowing through the ground, allowing the bad guys to get to the Mountain. These creatures promptly go away, leaving audiences to wonder how stupid Azog and friends (or the writers) were for not utilizing them more. The film also ends very quickly compared to The Return of the King, and leaves just a couple of loose ends (however, the extended edition ties up a couple of these). <br/><br/>The Battle of the Five Armies certainly isn't a masterpiece, but it is an important and entertaining chapter in the Middle-Earth cinematic universe. Fans of the book may find it bloated and changed almost beyond recognition at times, but it is still a fun, action- packed spectacle. I would definitely recommend checking out the extended edition, which ties up some loose ends, and adds more action, depth, and humor to the story."

","Bilbo is forced to be a mediator in a war with an array of opponents as Gandalf and his fellow sorcery friends push back against a rising evil.<br/><br/>Again without comparing it to J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy novel Peter Jackson brings the Hobbit trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. The returning cast are once again on form, Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen,Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Ken Stott and James Nesbitt to name a few. It also features The Lord of the Rings actors Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>Surprisingly Benedict Cumberbatch's excellent Smaug is killed off early in the first act bringing the dragon's story-line abruptly to a close. Also Luke Evans' Bard while great in the action scenes feels like a sidekick to the Elves and Dwarfs and is given little to do. That aside, it's an engrossing dark episode that stirs emotion with some surprise deaths. Bilbo forges friendships and is torn between duty and the greater good. There's more Legolas and Tauriel, giant bats, magic spells and sword fights. Jackson's offers epic battle scenes (where Billy Connolly show up as dwarf Ironfoot) and stand offs along with a tense romance and friendship climax. As with the previous outing the special effects are at times a little iffy but it's still colossal technical achievement. Again the production values are high, the costumes, props and sets are outstanding topped off by a magical Howard Shore score. <br/><br/>In amongst the visually stunning set ups Peter Jackson agreeably connects it to the second (filmed first) Middle-earth trilogy."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","7 June 2016"," Epic entertainment!
","The final installment in Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy is two and a half hours of non-stop action without any real plot points of character focus. That's why it works. Peter Jackson knows what kind of audience he hit with this trilogy adapted from a single 250 page book. He's reaching the ""popcorn"" audience who just want to have fun and be visually arrested for a bit. Bilbo and Company are forced to engage in a war against an array of combatants and keep the Lonely Mountain from falling into the hands of a rising darkness, leading into non-stop action sequences. This film has gorgeous CGI and wonderful visuals that embrace everything about this type of fantasy. While it doesn't have the beauty or complexity of the visuals in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it does have more fun and more ridiculous action to keep you consistently entertained from start to finish. Starting with a dragon attack, ending with the last orc kill, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a joy to watch even though there's way more than five armies and even though this could have been the last twenty minuets of a stand alone hobbit film."
"paul_haakonsen","8","0","3","16 May 2016"," The conclusion to the sequel trilogy...
","As an avid fan of the fantasy genre and having playing Dungeons & Dragons for about 30 years, I oddly enough never really took Tolkien that close to heart. Perhaps because I never read the books, and only have seen the movies by Peter Jackson. But still, I have seen all of his films set in the world of Middle-Earth. And yes, I have been adequately entertained by the movies and their glorious special effects galore.<br/><br/>However, I will say that ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is somewhat of a mixed roller-coaster. There are some really nice aspects to the movie, but there are also so very disappointing aspects. First of all, I was more than thrilled about the amount of action in the movie; lots of really spectacular fight scenes and impressive choreography. And the whole thing to have that special unique touch to it, which makes it very life-like and vibrant. There is a lot of nice touches and details to the characters, costume designs and set designs. But then on the other hand, then there are some really bad things in the movie as well. Here, I am of course referring to how anti-climatic the scene with Smaug was. And the scene where Legolas was running and jumping off of Falling debris on the bridge, then I was just about good and ready to get up and turn off the travesty that I was witnessing on the screen. And it was also painfully bad to witness how the main villain came back through the ice, once he was bested. It was just such a bad cliché and so predictable it hurt to witness.<br/><br/>The acting in ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" was actually quite good, as it had been throughout the previous movies as well. And a lot of credit for this goes to Martin Freeman (playing Bilbo), Ian McKellen (playing Gandalf) and Richard Armitage (playing Thorin).<br/><br/>The character design in the movie was good, and there was a good amount of character Development and growth, which made it all the more better to watch. If the movie had been without this, it would have been nothing more than an impressive CGI display.<br/><br/>Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow with the elves in the movie, as they were basically just a bunch of stuck up prudes who believed themselves better than everyone else. It was difficult to take them serious, because they came off as being kids trapped in grown-up bodies.<br/><br/>So was ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" a worthy conclusion to the sequel trilogy? I believe so. But bear in mind, of course, that I haven't read Tolkien's books, so I have nothing to compare it with."

","The battle of the five armies suffers the lack of stuff remaining to tell. As I said, including the whole encounter with smaug in this movie would have been better for this movie. Again, I'm considering the extended edition of the film.<br/><br/>While saying that it's the worst in the middle-earth film saga might make this sound a bad movie, it isn't. It's an enjoyable movie, manages to keep you excited at watching an almost 2 hours long battle (the remaining 40 minutes are the set-up and the ending).<br/><br/>What I noticed is that the extended edition makes two things with the movie: adds some much more gory scenes (really pulpy ones), which I particularly don't like, but also makes you care more about many of the 13 dwarfs. What some people always complained about is that you can't know and love all the 14 main characters of the hobbit trilogy the way you loved the members of the fellowship of the ring. There are various additional scenes that feature some of the dwarfs (including my favourite, the largest dwarf Bombur), some scenes make understand the outcome of the hobbit trilogy better, and so on. The complaint that I heard about the hobbit trilogy being not emotional is nonsense. In this movie I saw many of my family members cry being touched by the ending. <br/><br/>Now ultimately, the finale of the film is again, just as with the desolation of smaug, the reason I didn't give a further high mark. The last scene just doesn't make feel as conclusive as, for instance, the ending of return of the king did. I do understand that it's only the last few minutes of the film that I'm considering, but those weren't conclusive. What gave a bigger feeling of conclusion was the sing in the ending credits instead."

","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the third and final film of the prequels to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It was a fitting finale that I very much enjoyed. This film makes everything in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth stories come full circle.<br/><br/>Picking up right where The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug left off, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the Dwarfs are forced into combat to protect the treasure of Lonely Mountain from falling into the wrong hands. Many of the different races of Middle Earth (Men, Elves and Orcs) are now marching toward the mountain to either do battle or resolve the whole thing peacefully.<br/><br/>This is easily the most action packed of the three Hobbit films. The final battle scenes are very well shot, although they still pale in comparison to anything in the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Martin Freeman is once again great as the young Bilbo Baggins who really shows his courage and determination this time around.

When you see movies like this, often with characters not in the books, or scenes shifted around, it takes away from the childhood memories of my reading this books for the first time.
I remember finding The Hobbit on the shelf of my sisters room and borrowing it, reading it every day until I finished then reading it several times again.

All the while, the Orcs are secretly closing in on the argumentative bunch.<br/><br/>Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that these movie series need 'Previously On' segments. In this movie, the plot is pretty simple and recounting it is not an absolute necessity although a refresher would be helpful. What is truly needed is a section to rebuild the dramatic tension. The story just plop down right into a battle. It's an abrupt start and not in a good way. I also dislike the silly villainy of Alfrid Lickspittle. It's not particularly funny and rather insipid. Also the Orcs are nothing more than cannon fodder. It doesn't feel scary when they are mowed down Rambo style. Nevertheless, this is a fun adventurous ride. Tauriel continues to be a good addition providing the only feminine touch and some needed heart. Almost everybody has their fair shake.

","Thirteen years. That's the time gap between 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and the release of 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'. It is impossible for the Hobbit trilogy to avoid comparisons with its book written by J. R. R. Tolkien and 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy.<br/><br/>Since the age of six I have had an investment in this series in particular; its characters, story and world. As time passes by I feel my attachment lessen not for 'The Lord of the Rings' (my love only grows) but for 'The Hobbit'. I consider 'Rings' to be a flawless trilogy and one of the best, which stands alongside the original 'Star Wars' Trilogy and 'The Dark Knight' Series. So let's discuss 'The Hobbit'. The book written in 1937 is little more than 200 pages in comparison to 'Rings' which is over 1000. This extension from one book being split into three films is almost heart-breaking. But I do not hate the films.<br/><br/>'An Unexpected Journey' is a slog, but it does have its moments. It is without a doubt far too long, although we do see the return of Bilbo, Gandalf and Gollum. For me this is enough, even if we catch only a fleeting glimpse of the Dragon Smaug. I consider it adequate, but still partially a let-down.<br/><br/>'The Desolation of Smaug' raises the stakes and is just a black arrow shy of the masterful trilogy that preceded it. The characters are better realised, the action is more cohesive and the scene between Bilbo and Smaug is one of the greatest confrontations in cinema history.<br/><br/>'The Battle of the Five Armies' is in fact an altogether different beast. A strong start only makes it so much more of a shame, when the whole story comes cascading down into fiery oblivion. In this instalment we continue the story mere minutes after the last film ended. This is disorientating as Smaug has already begun his destruction of Lake Town. While this scene could have easily been the ending of the second it still works. Benedict Cumberbatch is aggressive and his temperament matches Smaug's wit and skill. However, the first fifteen minutes is not enough and cannot single handedly save the film from betraying its origins.<br/><br/>This film sees a massive Battle of the Five Armies. This includes the dwarfs, elves, eagles and orcs; so even the title is misplaced. Instead a Battle of Four Armies takes place. Bilbo is stuck in the middle of all of this, whilst Thorin Oakenshield upon acquiring the Arkenstone loses his mind faster than you can say ""my precious"". The battle can be described using these words; convoluted, repetitive, long, drawn out and no fun. It drags for over an hour and contains more CGI effects than you can shake Gandalf's staff at. But all of them save for Smaug, look tacky and worse than they did in 2001.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman as the anxious Bilbo tries to steer the film away from badness. You can tell he is trying his best. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee have less to do this time around, but they are at least never less than captivating and draw our attention on screen when the battle sequences cannot.<br/><br/>The score sounds suitably epic by series regular Howard Shore. The film looks neat, when CGI is not filling the screen, granted this is rare. What is most unforgivable though is the direction Peter Jackson takes with his limited source material to work from. In the book, the battle happens, but Bilbo is knocked out and therefore we only see how it starts and ends. Roughly 75% of 'Battle of the Five Armies' is Jackson's imagination. We find ourselves lost. Character development is thrown out of the window. We can no longer tell who is fighting who; elves defy physics worse than Neo in 'The Matrix' and a plethora of characters are killed off without the audience shedding a single tear. You end up rooting for the orcs instead; especially when Alfrid is on screen in supposedly comical scenes. Amounting to cringe inducing awfulness. That provides no function for the story. Alas, the love story here is worse than before and shows that Jackson should have stuck to his source and not have become high off of fumes of his own imagination.<br/><br/>'The Battle of the Five Armies' acts as a conclusion to 'The Hobbit' Trilogy and brings the Saga full circle. If 'An Unexpected Journey' was 'The Phantom Menace', 'The Desolation of Smaug'; 'Revenge of the Sith'. Then this instalment is certainly 'Attack of the Clones' with further unthinkable flaws. I advise you watch the previous two films and stick to the book. It is exciting and not at all painful like the film."

","I am a fan but was disappointed with a few things: (1)More English translation for the unique language of the Elves and Orcs needed.<br/><br/>(2)Battle scenes were confusing as to what was going on and who was fighting whom. How the major battle progressed and ended was not clear---at the city and mountain. Bloodless combat was well done.<br/><br/>(3) At one point Elves were ordered to draw their bows by their king during the battle and the flight of arrows and their effect was not shown. I would guess it was cut out. How they (the Elves) originally joined the battle, after not participating, flying over the dwarf line, was not clear. Elves brought the humans supplies but the king said he didn't come to help them even though he just said he had heard they needed help. Confusing and at times unsatisfying.<br/><br/>(4) The hallucinatory gold scene with Thorin was weird and unconvincing.<br/><br/>(5) A clarification epilogue should be made addressing the above and I bet it would be well received. Would certainly rate this last episode below the others, and apparently so did others. Needed more clarity as to what was going on and what was being said. Relying totally on cutting off heads left one unsatisfied. But entertaining anyway."

"tine-bresan","5","0","1","14 March 2015"," Unediquite ending of the trilogy
","I haven't read the books but I liked the first two movies as it had good storyline, character development, visual effects etc. The third part started right from it left us, a bit too much actions at the very beginning. In previous part the last scene of Smaug going after the city left me in anticipation, but in this movie it didn't have that ""flare"".<br/><br/>I was expecting more dramatic scenes of Smaug flying over the city, but he was just going vice versa and spitting fire, with no words or anything. Only at the end he started speaking but mostly gibberish and how come he didn't see that spear? Surely he can spot one thing that could kill him. Also, when Bard fired that arrow, I was expecting that his son would be hit by that rope after he fired the arrow (as it usually bounces back), but no, the rope just fall down as if hadn't any tension at all.<br/><br/>The later fighting was OK but it was too long and with poor CGI. Everything was clearly computer made but lacking in authenticity. I was also missing any notions of blood. I mean, those were some violent fights, but no blood or anything was spilled. I was expecting seeing men and dwarfs bleed red and orc something black or gray. But instead, there was practically no blood, heads of orcs were cut off as if they were held on by glue. Orcs also had some armor and although it was heard as they struck their shield, they killed them.<br/><br/>And another thing, orcs being killed by throwing stones? Seriously? Or put unconscious, whatever, what kind of warriors are they if they can be put down by a lousy stone? That really annoyed me. Bilbo was throwing stones as a sissy and he managed to put down some orcs.<br/><br/>And the last thing, why the heck didn't Thorin kill Azog when he had the chance? First he fought so hard to hit him good, and when he can, he puts down his blade. Like what the heck? Any reasonable person would kill him as he had the chance. And then watching him float under the ice, we all knew what will happen.<br/><br/>So movie was OK, nice entertainment but nothing special. I was expecting more but oh well..."
"Monkey-D-Luffy","3","0","2","9 March 2015"," I didn't hate it
","I've seen this movie and now I can say I was surprised a lot of times. I was surprised how good the CGI was and how well the orcs looked. I also had no issues with the newfangled camera and the resulting cinematography of this slightly mundane movie.<br/><br/>However, I, who have not been watching many movies recently, was laughingly stunned at how flabby Legolas's featured looked. It was quite distracting, with everyone involved pretending that Legolas looked about as same as in 2003. I'm looking at you Peter Jackson, casting directors, make up artists.<br/><br/>Bilbo aka Martin Freeman made a good impression whenever he appeared. His acting was as if a famous painter had made a paint by numbers job. You can only work with what you're given and I wonder whether Martin was thinking how wrong a direction this Hollywood film was taking and how many of his roles in English, small budget movies were better than this sleepwalker's dream career booster. His tics and mannerisms were too put on and repetitive to escape notice, if not criticism. Despite everything, I think some thought had gone into the Hobbit's role and Martin appeared with enough regularity for me not to understand the protests against him being underused.<br/><br/>The dwarfs had their moments. The best of the actors was Balin, whose one scene with Bilbo was better than even the capable Richard Armitage. The unexplained - but explainable - use of Elvish, and Orcish dialects provided a few funny moments, and to me, served little purpose. Galadriel's draining clash with Sauron smacked of the ridiculous. <br/><br/>Now I'm going to take a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book(not Tolkien's) and finish quickly without rounding on all the aspects. Bard and his people(and Alfrid) were cut off from the movie abruptly. There was no focus on the distribution of the treasure. Kili and Tauriel romance deserved one eye-roll or ten. That's about it.<br/><br/>PS - For the first time in my life I'm finding reviewing movies not only fun but also easy. Much quicker and easier than reviewing books, where one really has to put one's memory to work. I'll think about possibly reviewing regularly. I thank whoever found my review useful. Cheers."

"armandopi","4","0","5","22 January 2015"," Worth Seeing but Mediocre at Best
","(SPOILER ALERT: I suggest that you don't read this review if you haven't seen the movie.) The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies is a total let down. Yes, there are some great special effects, animation and sequences, especially the battle to free Gandalf, in which Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman, before he went to the dark side, fight Sauron—the villain. As great as this sequence is, however, it is misplaced in the movie. It should have taken place as part of the climax. This failure exemplifies the huge problem of the movie—misplaced sequences and scenes, causing a fragmentation of the film, not allowing the story to jell into a whole.<br/><br/>Also, the misplacement of this great fight sequence created another major problem. With Saruman out of the way, the primary antagonist—the character who was driving the plot and the conflict of the story— who are the heroes fighting against? The lizard dude, Azog? Huh? This doesn't cut it. All of the Lord of the Rings and the two other Hobbit films that precede this movie clearly establish that Saruman is the enemy that must be defeated. But now we have Lizard Dude. And Thorin, the dwarf king, is the one to defeat him. What? What happened to Bilbo? He's the main character but doesn't play a significant role in the climax of the film. Actually, there is no climax in the film, other than a big fight between Azog and Thorin, reminiscent of a saloon brawl in a poor Western. Why? Because Saruman was defeated early in the movie, which ended the story established by the five previous films.<br/><br/>The telltale sign that the movie is in trouble is the slaying of Smaug, the dragon, early in the film. This segment should have led to or been part of the climax. Perhaps, running parallel to the fight with Sauron. Nonetheless, the dragon is killed off very early in the movie—an action that made the rest of the film anticlimactic.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a critically important part of the story that is glossed over and forgotten: Saruman the White's betrayal. In the Lord of the Rings, we learn that he was once a strong ally of Middle Earth and defender of goodness. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies clearly illustrates that Saruman, along with his allies, Galadriel and Elrond, fought the evil Sauron. So, how and why did he abandon his friends, his calling as a White Wizard, and join forces with his archenemy, Sauron? Peter Jackson simply didn't address this rich story element. As a result, we have an incredibly important story thread unresolved. Actually, the whole film is a collection of unresolved and misplaced story elements.<br/><br/>The spectacular animation, special effects and some magical sequences are not enough to make this movie a good one. It's mediocre at best—an example of how animation, special effects and $250 million dollars cannot and will never replace the great importance of a good screenplay. Also ""fixing it in post"" doesn't work at all. The old technology of the written word is and will always be the cornerstone of good storytelling."
"thomas-w15","6","0","8","21 January 2015"," It's good enough...
","The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies- As we come to the conclusion of not just the Hobbit franchise but to the Lord of the Rings universe as well, Peter Jackson's final installment has a lot to live up to. If you have seen the trailer or just look at the title, you can tell a lot of war will take place in this film and in turn, an enormous amount of CGI. The CGI was average at best, and even though it was eleven years ago, The Lord of the Rings had much better CGI effects (again, it is a lot to live up to). The acting was solid by every member of the film, which is saying a lot considering this is a very large cast. The story could have been better, but it was still entertaining. All in all, The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies may not be as critically-acclaimed and groundbreaking as Return of the King, but the film was satisfying enough to conclude the franchise.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is the lack of story involved. The movie is basically just constant fighting and battling and unlike the last Harry Potter film, there is very little depth taking place in the two-hour long battle sequence. All of this battling then forces the special effects department to CGI the hell out of the film in order for the battling to be entertaining. There is never really any build up in the fight, it is just the same thing one after the other. This makes the final battle sequence of the film to be far less dramatic than the director intended. The abundance of main characters in the film was also not handled well. They either needed to make the movie longer and give the characters more screen time, or cut out other characters. By doing so, the audience would actually be able to feel for the characters much more and get a sense of their development over the course of the film instead of just a couple of them.<br/><br/>The acting definitely carried the film for me. Everyone gave a terrific performance and you could really tell the cast was having fun while they were filming. Martin Freeman was nothing short of spectacular as Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen definitely gave it his all as this was his last time at playing the legendary badass wizard Gandalf. The one who really surprised me though was Lee Pace who plays Thranduil, King of the wood Elves and father of Legolas. His performance was nothing short of masterful and without a doubt stole the spotlight in every scene he was in. All of the actors have also by now, come to develop great chemistry with each other and it showed on screen. Overall, the acting was the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Even though this film was not 'in my standards' great like the Lord of the Rings franchise, it is still wildly entertaining. When it comes down to it, that is all a movie has to be. I still very much enjoyed watching this film and I recommend you see The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies at some point while it is in theaters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"sixstringsofheaven","5","0","2","20 January 2015"," Fun Film - Read the Book Instead
","I've been a LOTR and Tolkien fan since I was a kid. Probably longer than your average fan. I was thrilled at the idea this great book was going to be made into a film. I was less than thrilled to learn that it was going to be turned into a 3 movie trilogy. After seeing all three films, I was not wrong to think that way. So much substance of the book that made the story what it is was either stunted,simply glazed over or left out altogether. The decision to include Legolas in these films when he otherwise does not exist was a poor choice. The invention of Tauriel's character was also very poor. If that was not bad enough, the impossible romance between Tauriel and Kili was a violation of all things Tolkien. If you like a good pop corn film, this is the one for you, as is the case the 2 previous installments. The only thing that saved this film was the top notch performances by the entire cast. The CGI was good, although some would debate this point. In all, this film (and the others) leaves me with the feeling they were not put together with the same enthusiasm that went into the LOTR films. They seemed hurried and rushed. The truly sad part is if there was ever any glimmer of hope that the Tolkien Estate would release the rights to the Simarillion, that possibility was certainly extinguished by the way Mr. Jackson chose to present The Hobbit. The Simarillion would have most definitely been a great series to watch on one of the pay channels in the tradition of Game of Thrones, The Borgias etc. I cannot give these films more than 5 stars and retain any semblance of conscience."

","There were so many things this movie had to be. An end to a trilogy, an end to a saga but also, its own movie. Its a fantastic send off but lacks some of the core elements of being its own movie. The romance, for example, could have been handled much better. But other than that and a few other things, this is a great action and saga ending movie. I tried but I can't go through this review without mentioning the thing it will inevitably be compared to, The Lord of the Rings. There's one thing I have to say and thats: The Hobbit is, in scope and presentation, different from LOTR, even the books are. LOTR is a dark fight between good and evil, The Hobbit is an adventure across Middle- Earth. All in all, it doesn't match the scope and emotional punch of LOTR but it is a great send-off and action movie in a brilliant and near perfect saga."

"HeydtHousehold","6","0","3","5 January 2015"," The Battle Scenes were great, the SFX was great, but the Script sucked butt glands dry
","Their were parts in this movie, such as Thoren popping out of Erebor with his men, elves leaping over the dwarfs while unexpected, etc. that made this movie worth while, kept my blood boiling in inspiration and much more, then there were the scripts and the overly fast pace and the beginning half of the story that will haunt me forever. The Smaug scene I thought couldn't be any cheesier, Smaug's script in this scene made me think Smaug as a Dragon of high intelligence and fine words, to an average faq trd drake which I wouldn't mind see die any day, then there was Thoren's scripts which honestly couldn't be any cheesier either, while your expecting him to say something, perhaps something a little interesting or something out of the norm in his illness, he not only says it badly but the words are so basic and dull and boring and cheesy I can't even just ugh. Alfrid, should have died with the master in the boat in the beginning so that he wouldn't fvck up everything in the movie he just should have never even been added, he's not funny, he makes no positive existence in the movie, he just should die, like the actor in real life should die, so he won't ruin any more movies after this one. Now when Fili dies in front of Thoren his eyes water as if he was going to cry, but nothing comes out he is like choking on a clock or something then finally after 20 wasted seconds of the movie he spits out a ""geh"" and that's his reaction to one of his own close kin, just a ""geh"" not ""nooooo!"" or ""FILI!!!"" or something that would have been a so much easier and much more natural to do just a ""geh"" that right there will make me not able to function rightly for a long while. Then Kili's death wasn't as bad but was pretty close to it, Tauriel's reaction was similar to Thoren's except she cried a little and showed a tad bit more of emotion in her, yeah I can probably assume after all those Orc's beating the shxt out of you would probably make you weak, but damm th0t your only real love just died and you didn't even cry for his name or nothing you had no resent towards his killer, That's fvcken horse shxt, Peter Jackson is the worse director when it comes to sad scenes like holy shxt he is bad anyways moving on. Thoren fight Arzarch (too lazy to look up his name and spell it correctly sorry) then Thoren dies, of course Thoren continues on with boring cheesy crop coming out as his last words but he showed a little more improvement on that speech skill, just a tad bit anyways Bilbo Baggins reaction to Thoren's death was surprisingly not bad compared to the past ones, (seems like Hobbits are the only race with emotion) anyways it makes up for one of those horrible acting death scenes but not near enough to make up for both. Then mainly rest is all good. Overall great SFX except Legolas jumping on collapsed tower, that was pretty shxtee, some good parts but a lot more shxtee. Honestly the only successful Hobbit out of this series was the Second One, without the second one this series is absolutely shxt. Also guys don't bully me too hard for being sloppy typing this is my first review and therefore does not deserve to much brutal beating upon."
"leondzajac","4","0","4","29 December 2014"," Not worth it unless you are a fan
","Where do I begin? The Hobbit series has gotten mediocre. The beginning portion really made me angry. Smaug's destruction of Laketown was extremely short. They could have done so much more to this portion of the movie, and made Smaug have more dialogue, but sadly it wasn't. Smaug was literally killed within the first 5 minutes of the film. Not only that, the way he was killed was very ridiculous. Bard uses his son as his bow to kill the dragon. Smaug's death sequence was also laughable. Moving forward, the battle itself was not that bad, but once again, they made Legolas, who isn't even supposed to be in the film to begin with, do ridiculous moves while fighting. I'll be honest though, as much as people hated the love shown between Tauriel and Kili, I actually liked the addition. While I didn't like most of the film, I will tell you, it is definitely a tear jerker. After seeing the deaths of Fili, Kili, and Thorin, I actually cried a bit. Also, the scene of Bilbo and Gandalf returning to the shire could have been much better. At the end of the book, Gandalf and Balin return a few years later to check up on Bilbo, but in this film, it is nonexistent. In conclusion: Is this film worth seeing? It depends. If you are one who liked the previous Hobbit films, then it is about the same as those. But if you are like me, who liked the book better, than I would honestly skip it."
"ohashmawi","Null","0","2","28 December 2014"," Visually striking with powerful emotional performances, the final Hobbit is held back by inconsistent dialogue and a dragging subplot, nonetheless it's a good finale
","I was really excited for this movie, like insanely excited, the first Hobbit was bit less than expected, the second one was great, so I thought this one would be great, and when I left the theater I was pretty satisfied, it was entertaining and a good finale. A lot of people are saying it's worse than the Lord of The Rings, I don't get that at all, I seriously think people are only saying that because The Hobbit trilogy wasn't groundbreaking, it's something we've seen before, in the form of TLOR, that series was majestic, there had never been anything like it before, so that's why people like it so much, it's the same with the Sam Raimi Spider-Man, it's kind of a bad film, but people think it's good because it was the first time they saw an awesome superhero like Spider Man on the big screen. Of course this is all my opinion.<br/><br/>The film ends the quest of the company of Thorin Oakenshield of trying to reclaim their homeland, The Lonely Mountain, which up until the last movie was inhabited by the dragon Smaug(epic), who left to go ""discipline"" the people of Lake-Town in Desolation's cliffhanger.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie continues to be incredible, just like the first movies, Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo, he nails every scene, especially the emotional ones. Perfect casting choice for a great character, seeing Bilbo's journey as a person was great, one of the high points of the trilogy. Also, Bilbo is WAY better than Frodo, in every single aspect, Frodo is completely useless! He just sits there with a constipated expression like a little p****(pardon the language), whereas Bilbo is the salvation of the dwarfs, remember Mirkwood? The Woodland Realm? One word, salvation. <br/><br/>Richard Armitage once again gave a great performance as Thorin, the leader of the company, his best portrayal in the three movies of course, because in this one, he actually had proper development, and that was very interesting to see, and Armitage really captured the fragility, the internal conflict, top-notch acting. His performance is brilliant, it hit me to my core, and the last scene almost made me tear up. And the exchanges between these two were excellent. The supporting cast is great too, they did the best with what they were given, Ian McKellen, always great to see him as Gandalf, very useless in the movie though, Luke Evans was very good, Orlando Bloom and the rest as well. Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show as Smaug once again, despite not having the screen a lot this time around.<br/><br/>The film has many breathtaking sequences, the battle of course, the great event, but what I was most anxious to see was Smaug going beast mode on Lake-Town, which was dazzling. The effects of everything burning up, Bard struggling to break free and fight the dragon, great stuff. However, it kept cutting away to the Master of the town and Alfrid, his dumbass assistant, yes they were comic relief characters, but they should have just died from the first fire blast, such foolish and useless characters, especially Alfrid, who unfortunately sticks with the film until the battle. The titular battle was also thrilling, well most of the time. Peter Jackson has not lost his extraordinary talent when it comes to large-scale battles, all technical aspects were first- rate in this part of the film, although it would have been very cool if all the orcs were real people with make-up, but you know, kind of impossible. It's mind-blowing at first, then drags on a bit, then an event happens with Thorin and it becomes exciting again, but again it begins to drag, and it becomes way over the top (I'm looking at you Legolas). But overall it's a good fight, visually striking of course, but the duration is too long, especially when you consider that a lot of the subplots which conclude in the battle are filler, 45 minutes is very long. <br/><br/>About the script, most characters in the film were under- developed, 7-8 of the dwarfs get no screen time at all, I think the fat one doesn't even talk, really the only ones who are characterized are Thorin and Bilbo. The elf-dwarf romance carries over to this film, which was already the biggest mistake of the second Hobbit, such a stupid subplot, makes no sense. Gandalf's side quest also ends in this movie, with a very cool fight scene with a few of the badass characters in the first trilogy. Oh yeah! There's a new subplot in this movie, just what it needs! And what's more, this one doesn't even have any meaning or resolution! There are many continuity issues, for example the worms and the goats, also the film lacks closure involving the fate of quite a few characters, the dialogue most of the time makes up for all these problems but there are some clichÃ©s that make you cringe, all that because of the romance between Tauriel(she-elf) and Kili(handsome dwarf). Come on, nothing's perfect.<br/><br/>I was satisfied with this film, it has very good action, great performances and it's not even very long, however the multiple useless plot lines made it seem a lot longer and less enjoyable. As a popcorn flick it's awesome, very entertaining, but it kind of lacks in a few aspects that make a film good. Overall I recommend this movie, it's very enjoyable, and the visuals are exceptional, just don't try to think too much about it during the film and after the credits roll, it'll make you dislike it more and more, and enjoy it less and less. 7.8/10"

","These are my thoughts on The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies after seeing it last night.<br/><br/>The story of The Battle of the Five Armes takes off right where the previous installment ended. Smaug flees from the mountain and tries to destroy the city of Lake-town. As expected, Bard succeeds in killing the dragon with the help of his son. The addition of Bard's son gives more emotional weight to the impressive first five minutes of the movie. During the attack of Smaug, the mayor (who tried to make a run with the city's gold) gets killed but his servant Alfrid survives and receives much screen time later on, probably for comic relief between the long action scenes, but his jokes were nothing special and I think that he took too much attention away from the heroic Bard. I don't understand why he got more screen time than poor Beorn. I only saw a glimpse of Beorn in this movie and he only got a few minutes of screen time in the previous installment. <br/><br/>After Smaug's death, more groups (humans, elves, dwarfs, orcs) try to lay their hands on the treasure that is stored under the mountain, but Thorin does not allow anybody to go near his gold. He becomes madder by the minute and that process visualized in a beautiful scene where he is absorbed into a liquid golden floor (looks like something from the hand of Del Toro?) Armitrage did a very good job in portraying Thorin's madness. His acting is sublime. After speaking with Bilbo and dwarf Dwalin, Thorin realizes he has to participate in the battle and with the help of his fellow dwarfs (suddenly without wearing heavy armor), the army of dwarfs (under the leadership of a CGI!? Dain Ironfoot) are able to defeat the first orc army. I have no idea how dozen dwarfs could turn the tides, but the battle of the five armies does not make any sense at all. Gigantic dragon worms, trolls with weird arms and other creatures show up to help the orcs even though there is no mention of those in the book. <br/><br/>The battle itself is visually impressive and maybe a bit too overwhelming, but I sometimes had the feeling of watching a massive cut scenes of a video game. Most of the events in the fight are similar to what we have seen in Lord of the Rings, so the fight was not a great addition to the Middle Earth saga. At times, the battle even looked like a parody of The Lord of the Rings. For example, Legolas was able to transport himself with evil bats like Kratos did in God of War. He even defied the laws of gravity. In his duel with Bolg, he was able to step on flying stone blocks of a torn floor to prevent a deep fall There was no question about Legolas inhuman agility in Lord of the Rigns, but The Hobbit took this a step too far. During the battle, there are more implausible events, like the sudden occurrence of goats that the dwarfs use to transport and a suddenly wiped out orc army. Furthermore, Bilbo is able to take out dangerous orcs by throwing rocks at their skulls... <br/><br/>Concerning the 'freckled' elf Tauriel, it is nice to see a strong female character, but she was clearly added as motive for Kili's emotional death during the fight with Bolg. After Kili's death, her story is finished. Fili dies a few moments earlier by the hands of orc leader Azoc. Fili and Kili both die while defending Thorin in the book. The strong bond between both brothers in the book was unfortunately not exploited by Jackson. And of course, Thorin kills Azoc after the giant orc floats quietly beneath the icy surface of a lake before finding his death. Thorin and the other Fili and Kili do not get buried and there is no further mention of what happens with the treasure in the mountain, Bard, Tauriel and the people of Laketown even though that it is written in the final pages in the book. So despite stretching out for 8.5 hours the trilogy still has some loose ends. That is very sloppy of the director. The story ends with Thanduils' message to Legolas that he should look for Aragorn (is that even in coherence with Tolkien's writings?) and Bilbo returning to his home in the Shire after a last few words with Gandalf. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Peter Jackson failed in setting up a trilogy that is a worthy prequel to the Lord of the Rings. The amount of dialogue and character development in the book was too little to spread over three long movies. This resulted in poor emotional bonding with the characters. The frame of the original story was too thin and by adding new stuff to fill it up, Jackson lost track of some important chapters and details in the book. I think what happened to the Hobbit is similar tor to tuning a cheap car. You can try to upgrade it by adding and replacing parts, but it will never be as cool as a Ferrari or Lamborghini. However, I liked the part where Galadriel,Saruman and Elrond save Gandalf and Galadriel scares the eye of Sauron to Mordor. I thought that that was pretty cool. <br/><br/>A moderate LOTR fan"
"Bruce722","7","0","2","27 December 2014"," Worst of the series.
","Unfortunately each successive installment of this Hobbit trilogy not only failed to build on the previous film but actually left even more to be desired. Yes, this is the film where the resolution finally comes to fruition. Yes, they did a fantastic job connecting this trilogy to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy through this film. Yes, the action sequences, the special effects, and the acting were all top notch. But I can't help but feel like this movie just missed in a few key areas. The characters, for example, feel less authentic than in the previous films and, being that this is the movie where a lot of death and tragedy occurs, you're not connected or attached to them because of that. It also didn't have that key character who carries the movie. While Bilbo was this trilogies Frodo and they carry the narrative, neither actually carried the film through the action. In the LOTR films, Aragorn and Legolas did that. The problem with this trilogy is that Thorin is no Aragorn and Legolas isn't featured enough to compensate for that. You end up with Dwarfs without sufficient development and essentially faceless elves and humans and none of it connects to the viewer on an emotional level. That being said, I think this movie, when marathoned with the previous installments, will resonate better. I just don't think it stood alone enough to live up to the epic standard already established in the universe."
"pennyelenabooks","6","0","2","26 December 2014"," Not as good as the Lord of the rings final movie
","The final chapter of the Hobbit trilogy ends up in a battle of five armies, all fighting to get control of the mountain and the gold after the dragon's death. As a fan of the Middle Earth, I was a bit disappointed. However, I had already experienced the blow of not having the book as it is from the previews Hobbit movies, so I wasn't disappointed on the plot briefly based slightly on the book, but at the movie as a whole. What bothered me most was the endless battles, that made me feel that they were trying to copy the battle at Minas Tirith on the Lord of the Rings the return of the king movie. Yes, there were some great man to man battles, however, as the war was unfolded, more and more weird creatures arrived, like the giants at the city, which I found unrealistic, if that word can be used to describe these creatures. Of course I liked some of them, like the bats and the worms, and maybe the pigs and the goats the dwarfs used as horses, but the too many trolls and goblins tired me off. What I also didn't like was the feeling that was all over the movie, the feeling that this was the end and there will be no more. You know what is going to happen next, as you have seen the Lord of the rings, and you know that Biblo is not going to die or loose the ring, and that spoils the plot a little, but I guess that that wasn't intensionally made. The performances were great and the scenes were amazing, as were the small dialogs and comic moments. The set and the costumes were good also, the make up not so much. Finally, an error that could have been prevented was the dream stage that the heroes tended to get into. One time, it's okay, but there were too much of those moments. But I assume that they needed something to fill in the plot. In the end, I think that the Hobbit, the battle of the five armies was made on the shadow of the third Lord of the rings movie, and there for it didn't thrive. So 6 out of 10, because the previews ones were much better."
"tinovalkki","5","0","2","25 December 2014"," Reprise from L.O.T.R. just collecting more money from audience
","Peter Jackson's Hobbit has been gorgeous to watch, even it has been too recursive. I think it would be better if studio would change director to Guillermo Del Toro as they first intend to do so. It should give a little bit different angle to story. Now Hobbit seems to be a reprise from Lord of the Rings. Also to cut up a quite short book to three chapters feels like just making more profit out of it. Now Battle of Five Armies feels just over length end battle and main character, Bilbo Baggins stay more like a statistic in this movie. HFR brings staging out brilliantly, but the same time it feels more like a theater staging and it doesn't look any more realistic. Most of film is just digitally effect rumble and that left the story too lame. 3D works well as it should be in any animation filming. Beautiful to watch but too over length story telling. It is shame that studio wanted to collect money too much from the fans of movie series. I don't wonder why the heirs of Tolkien's don't want to give any more stories to film, especially if Peter Jackson is involved with it. Hopefully they give rights to some another studio to film more stories from Middle-earth and audience will get more and better stories to watch."
"jboothmillard","6","0","18","24 December 2014"," The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
","The Middle Earth films, based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien, finally come to an end, the first of the prequels to The Lord of the Rings films was good, the second was just as good, I didn't know what to expect from this final instalment, directed by Peter Jackson. Basically the film picks up where it left off, the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) has escaped the Lonely Mountain and starts to attack and destroy Laketown, with Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs devastatingly looking from above, but it is Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) who, after breaking out his prison cell, kills the dragon with the black arrow, and the beast falling to its death kills the fleeing Master of Laketown (Stephen Fry). Survivors of Laketown praise Bard and choose him as a new leader, the dwarfs reunite in the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo, Balin (Ken Stott) and the others see Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is afflicted with Smaug's ""dragon sickness"" searching for the Arkenstone, Bilbo stole it but knows he must keep it hidden, meanwhile Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) had Kili (Being Human's Aidan Turner) confess his love for her, she goes with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) to investigate Mount Gundabad. Meanwhile Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) rescues the wounded and caged Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) from Dol Guldur and the Ringwraiths, including the appearance of Sauron, with the help of Saruman (Sir Christopher Lee) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving), while Bard and the Laketown survivors shelter in Deale, with supplies and aid brought by an elf army, led by Thranduil (Lee Pace). Gandalf arrives at Dale, and Bilbo hands over the Arkenstone to Thranduil and Bard, who have formed an alliance, the allied armies gather at Erebor ready to battle against the oncoming Orc army, once his sanity is regained Thorin joins other dwarfs in the fight also, battle eventually begins between the evil beasts and the adjoining human and elf armies, there is a point when Bilbo has to use the Ring of power to become invisible and warn the others of the danger coming. During the battle the Eagles come to bring reinforcements, Kili is killed and Tauriel realises she may have had similar feelings like he had for her, antagonists are defeated, Bolg (John Tui) is killed by Legolas who leaves to meet a ranger named Strider he has been told about, and Azog (Manu Bennett) is killed by Thorin who is mortally wounded during their fight and makes peace with Bilbo before dying. In the end Bilbo bids farewell to the remaining dwarfs and journeys home to the Shire with Gandalf, the wizard warns him that he knows that he has the ring and cautions that he will be watching him, Bilbo finds that his possessions are being auctioned, everyone assumed he was dead being gone a long time, he clarifies his identity and returns home, sixty years later Old Bilbo (Sir Ian Holm) is reflecting on the past journey as he starts to write his book, There and Back Again, he gets a knock on the door and is happy to be visited by Gandalf. Also starring Sylvester McCoy as Radagast, Billy Connolly as Dain, James Nesbitt as Bofur, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Dean O'Gorman as Fili, Mark Hadlow as Dori, Jed Brophy as Nori, Adam Brown as Ori, John Callen as Oin, Peter Hambleton as Gloin, William Kircher as Bifur and Stephen Hunter as Bombur. I agree that Freeman is more a supporting character in this one, McKellen is still majestic as the wise wizard, Armitage is good, Lily and Bloom play characters not featured in the original book and invented for the film but they make their parts justified, and the other supporting stars do well also. To be honest, these films for me are like the Star Wars prequels all over again, the three Hobbit films can't compete with the outstanding original Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but director Jackson does still do a good job, the action is paced well, the fight sequences, especially on a collapsing bridge and a frozen waterfall, are great, and the special effects for the big battles sequences and many creatures are fantastic, a most worthwhile fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Good!"
"shivamt25","7","0","2","23 December 2014"," the grand finale.....! Not that grand.
","Obviously it is a Peter Jackson movie, it has to be good. It has amazing special effects, emotional stuff, out of the world action sequences but then i don't know why i do not feel satisfied with the way this series has come to an end. The series ending movies has to be the best so that the greatness of the series will stick to people's mind. For example we remember Breaking Bad as an exceptional series and its smashing ending that is in our heart till now, but we remember Dexter not because of its amazing 7 seasons, but the season that came afterward, a total waste and unsatisfying finale. Same trend can be seen when it comes to movies. Now this Hobbit is surely less deserving then its predecessors. It loosely connects us with start of LOTR. May be it was lack of story as they have to make 3 movies out of 1 book or those long never ending battles scenes, something was not up to the expectations. But as i said earlier, it is a Peter Jackson film. It is surely watchable and enjoyable, just not as much as the other two Hobbits."
"davidjr2008","7","0","4","16 December 2014"," It was a good movie that got dragged out
","The movie was amazing seeing it IN imax 3D definitely helped it score higher , probably would of gone with a 6 if watched on regular screen. There were moments in the movie that made me feel what the characters were feeling rather it was pride , anger , sadness or happiness. One thing I noticed it lacked was blood , you would see someone get it's head chopped off and no blood. I don't know if that was because they wanted to appeal to a broader range of viewers but it was a disappointment to me. The final fight scene could of been shortened it did drag on a little . Though it was still entertaining none the less, should have been cut down some. The opening scene was great I really enjoyed it. I also would of liked to see more magic from the Wizards during the final battle there wasn't any. Don't go in with high expectations , which you shouldn't with any movie. Don't compare it to lord of the rings either. I would recommend going to see this movie only if you enjoy these types of movies. It's not for everyone, and by the way to the people who score a movie a one out of ten , they are being very over dramatic and probably had unrealistic expectations. To give a movie a one is kind of harsh , that means you did not enjoy one second of the movie , you didn't think the graphics were good , and you all together didn't have one second of entertainment . Come on guys be real."
