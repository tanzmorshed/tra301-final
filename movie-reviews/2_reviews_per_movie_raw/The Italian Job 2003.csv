"philip_vanderveken","8","118","164","26 April 2005"," Maybe not the most original movie, but a very good one in the genre of the heist / action flicks
","A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.<br/><br/>The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...<br/><br/>The story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10."
"iwatcheverything","7","64","90","23 November 2003"," Highly entertaining
","If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place.  It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters.  It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark.  That image is burned in my mind forever.  As an actor though he is pretty good.  This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns.  I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it."
"Barky44","8","88","128","29 June 2005"," Great, fun, caper flick
","The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.<br/><br/>Special kudos to the background music. They truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the classiest part of the film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10. Not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.<br/><br/>Barky"
"lemon_magic","7","58","87","11 December 2005"," Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack
","My reaction to this remake of ""The Italian Job"" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of ""Italian Job"" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. <br/><br/>Still, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. <br/><br/>What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like ""Rumble Fish"". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from ""all right"" to ""inspired"". For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. <br/><br/>On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest ""major"" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character ""Wrench"", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the ""late walk on"" nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen...<br/><br/>Production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the ""Wrench"" character, see above). <br/><br/>The dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross, and then asks him, ""Were you surprised??"" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there...) <br/><br/>Of course the movie requires a certain level of ""suspension of disbelief"" to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride. <br/><br/>""The Italian Job"": it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an ""8"" but I'd give it a ""7.5""."
"iohefy-2","8","56","89","26 June 2003"," FAST PACED EXCITING MOVIE
","I went to see THE ITALIAN JOB with mixed reviews in my head.  I was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours.  I thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects, with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight.  If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see."
"ccc950","9","91","153","23 February 2005"," non-stop action film
","I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job& is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I do love this kind of movie."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","55","93","20 January 2007"," Very Entertaining Heist Movie & A Big Plug For MINIs
","I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.<br/><br/>This is a very, very entertaining heist-and-chase film. It features a ""cool"" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham.<br/><br/>The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as ""the good guys."" How many times has this happened since the days of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. In here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. Also Theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug, smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool. <br/><br/>Despite these hindrances, it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool. Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it."
"extravaluejotter","1","53","93","27 March 2007"," No Sauce, just Plain Boiled Pasta
","This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original ""Italian Job"" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie ""scripted"" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly ""directed"" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40-odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.<br/><br/>The humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron's implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:<br/><br/>(1) Three Minis (the modern BMW-made versions, but Minis nonetheless)<br/><br/>(2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters<br/><br/>(3) Disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.<br/><br/>(4) Er, that's it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible American by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. Believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. The cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly British flavour has survived being fed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. It's a wonder that Noel Coward hasn't done an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.<br/><br/>Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie."
"hitchcockthelegend","7","15","23","14 June 2008"," Ocean's Five.
","John Bridger's gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice. The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold ... the job is on!<br/><br/>This could have been a complete disaster, I'm British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; ""how dare they remake a British institution"" was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film's release by main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...<br/><br/>Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn't. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the ""Italian Job"" of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that's maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.<br/><br/>I have jokingly titled this film ""Ocean's 5"", but that is in no way detrimental to ""The Italian Job"", it lacks the jazzy coolness of ""Soderbergh's Ocean's 11"", but it's a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10"
"Ibsen3","1","42","75","20 January 2008"," A sickening travesty of a classic film
","I must admit, I was against this movie from the outset but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.<br/><br/>People in my house were watching this so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (I have studied them at Uni after all).<br/><br/>As expected for an American film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. Indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.<br/><br/>Yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.<br/><br/>Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly nauseating. Her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre I've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.<br/><br/>If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity of watching 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have declined. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).<br/><br/>Sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'Wow! He's smart!', 'Coo! He's cool!', 'Hey! What a tough guy!'. Then there's the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows (or should).<br/><br/>This is where I have to come clean. I didn't manage to make it to the end, so I couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if I'd seen it at a cinema, I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.<br/><br/>So, if you are expecting 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then DO NOT WATCH! I don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs!<br/><br/>P.S. Some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing."

"petri-leppala","1","27","47","7 March 2007"," First 15 minutes are OK..
","Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do.<br/><br/>After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs ""AWESOME"".<br/><br/>Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever B-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing.<br/><br/>I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before. Apart from Donald Sutherland's ""look, I'm here too"" appearing in the beginning I'd say this movie ought to have a ""pass if you're above 18"" all over it."
"evilasahobby","3","19","32","15 August 2003"," Caper by numbers
","""The Italian Job"" is a caper movie done by the numbers. Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that ""The Italian Job"" possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine  the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.<br/><br/>Let's tick off the cliches:<br/><br/> - ""old-school"" criminal father figure and his protege<br/><br/> - another gang member jealous of protege<br/><br/> - a double-cross<br/><br/> - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to<br/><br/> - good criminals always outwit the bad guys<br/><br/>And that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.<br/><br/>For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or ""just because"" moments. Parts of ""The Italian Job"" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.<br/><br/>The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the ""nice guy"" hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.<br/><br/>Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent ""Ocean's Eleven"" outshines the non-event that is ""The Italian Job"".<br/><br/>
***SPOILER***<br/><br/>At the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? He didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.<br/><br/>***END SPOILER***"

There are other things which should be take in considerings, like: characters. The character typology was standard: the beautiful, dangerous woman, the impulsive leader, the computer genius, not to mention the handsome skilled driver. It wasn't something new, and surely wasn't fortunate.<br/><br/>The simple alignment of a title, to action genre doesn't or shouldn't undervalue important aspects such as originality and authenticity, which are clearly neglected here.<br/><br/>Not bad but still lacking originality and authenticity.

Product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.<br/><br/>The direction seemed off, too. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start. Every time the camera would pass over him, it would linger too long and Norton would grimace or something. C'mon, Hollywood, give us a little credit!

","I was really looking forward to this movie.  I like slick heist movies (Ocean's 11, Good Thief, etc) and i think this is a great cast.  But be warned -- there's a reason that Ed Norton didn't want to do this movie and it is very obvious about 2 minutes in.<br/><br/>First off, the dialog is terrible.  very few ""funny"" interactions are actually interesting (Seth Green imitating Jason Statham is a notable exception).  The director (who has done nothing noteworthy since Friday) clearly didn't care if there was any chemistry on screen or if the words coming out of the actor's mouths actually fit their characters.  He just wanted all the words in there.  At one point, a Ukrainian does a whole routine about how the CIA rigged the 2000 election -- why even keep that in there?<br/><br/>most of the characters have cute nicknames, which just makes the whole script seem even more forced.  in the first 20 minutes, you are hit over the head repeatedly about the relationship between Marky Mark and Donald Sutherland so that you know he'll be dead before the second act. obviously there is a romantic relationship that suddenly blossom's between Sutherland's daughter (Theron) and Marky Mark.  Like you couldn't see that coming before you even walked into the theater.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Theron clearly filled in for Angelina Jolie, playing exactly the same role that Jolie played in Gone in 60 seconds.  there are several points in the movie where she is vulnerable (maybe trying to show more range than Jolie?), and in each of those scenes, when Wahlberg comforts her or says ""you can do it"", i thought i was going to puke.<br/><br/>worst offender of all is Norton who sleepwalks thru one of the least complex characters he has ever played.<br/><br/>there are all sorts of continuity problems with the movie and several characters are introduced and then grossly underused (there's a 400 lb somoan looking dude who may have been an interesting character if we saw him for more than 2 minutes).<br/><br/>every plot twist is predictable 30 minutes ahead of time, every ""funny part"" is given away in the trailers (except some of seth green's screen time), and everyone is dragged down by the poor script and direction.

","Sometimes remakes are a good thing, sometimes they're not. This one is very loosely based on the film of the same name in the 1960's starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward with Benny Hill as the comedy relief. That film was a so-so farce, but this one is a runaway hit. The action starts at the beginning and keeps the pace throughout the film. Mos Def and Seth Green are our comics in this film, but their abilities to shift from comic to dramatic are well played. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are well suited to their roles and come off with a very reserved but appropriate sexual tension to add interest to the already interesting hi-tech portions of the film. Sutherland's role, while brief, is the perfect set up for the remainder of the film. Statham does what he does best, and his character is a mix between The Transporter and The Mechanic, with a splash of smooth to balance it out. As always, whether good guy or bad guy, Ed Norton's presence is perfect to create the correct tension in the movie. Good plot, great scenery, and exceptional photography make this a film the entire family can enjoy together, despite the PG-13 rating. Collectible if you like action adventure, although you will probably pull it out as an afterthought."

","Over the last few months, I have seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). Granted, ""Ocean"" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialog may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert meets Gene Shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!! My advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing The Italian Job. But, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see Ed Norton get jacked by a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my fellow moviegoers, is: Lighten Up and Have Fun, Dammit."

The film scores big time, mainly because it entertains you from start to end. Stylish and Accomplished, filmmaker F.Gary Gray pays homage to his favorite film and has done his job exceedingly well. He's a fan of the film he's making, and that's quite visible throughout. The action sequences are amazing. The climax, is spell-binding.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is fantastic. The actor lives his character from start to end. Charlize Theron looks a billion bucks, and delivers a truly fine performance. Seth Green is terrific and provides comic moments. Jason Statham is perfect. Mos Def is good. Edward Norton is a bore this time. Donald Sutherland is okay in a cameo.<br/><br/>Watch this heist remake... it entertains and has it's moments to leave you talking and thinking about it. Thumbs Up!"

","I am utterly amazed by the comments that have been left by other people who've seen this movie.  My college was presenting a free preview screening of The Italian Job, and I STILL left feeling ripped off.  The film is utterly absurd.  The dialogue is among the most atrocious that I've ever seen.  ""You can do it"" serves as inspiration.  A single moment together is supposed to make the ""subplot"" of a love story believable.  Even the car chases, which I'm told are what made the original stand out, are completely cookie-cutter and uninteresting.  I haven't fallen asleep in a movie since I was a little kid, but it took several pokes from a friend to stop it from happening this time.  Overall, the plot was ludicrous on all counts, there was absolutely no character development, and even the action scenes were mediocre at best.  Hearing the praise that some have chosen to give this movie boggles my mind.  It is perhaps one of the worst movies that will be released in 2003.  Save your money.  I didn't even pay any to see this tripe, but I still regret it.  I could've gone bowling tonight, blast it..."

","Having not yet seen the original The Italian Job that Michael Caine I have no frame of reference to compare it to. Still this version is fast moving and fun and you got to tip your hat to a bunch of professional thieves who know their business and steal without it being bloody. <br/><br/>Donald Sutherland has assembled a crack team of thieves all with special skills that include Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Stathem and Seth Green. The six pull off a well timed heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion bars. But then Norton gets real greedy and in turn steals the bullion from the rest, killing Sutherland and nearly all the others. Of course they're out for revenge, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Still they're all a little emotional on this one given the circumstances.<br/><br/>New on the team is Charlize Theron who is Sutherland's daughter and she brings safe-cracking skills into the mix. They will be needed before the film is over.<br/><br/>Edward Norton in his career has done a nice variety of sociopathic types from The Score, Primal Fear, and American History X. He's some piece of work in The Italian Job, but Norton is an actor who creates a peculiar fascination with the evil he does.<br/><br/>The key man as the team attempts to heist the bullion again from Norton is Seth Green the computer hacker. What he does I can't say, but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.<br/><br/>This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet."

","Crafted with all of the style and grace of a 70's TV movie, this smelly turd of bowl flotsam might be an interesting movie in about 100 years, as the movie that first featured the new (current) Mini. <br/><br/>I urge you to wait.<br/><br/>Besides time capsule value, there is nothing else to recommend it.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the producers thought Donald Sutherland and Ed Norton would give their movie gravitas; boy were they wrong. I hope they got paid well, cos this is something they are sure to leave off the C.V.<br/><br/>Perhaps the producers were tasked with making the car the star, but in heavily edited scenes which defy credulity, it does more to make a joke out of a vehicle that since this was released has quickly lost much of its luster- and I put it to you that this movie is responsible.<br/><br/>
Marky Mark breathes really convincingly, but doesn't have more than one sentence of dialogue in any scene, leaving one to wonder if his lines were cut back- cos he's barely in the movie. Conspicuous by his presence, he _appears_ in most of the scenes, but you start to notice he adds nothing, and lets the others around him carry the weight. Since he is male lead, top-billed, it is odd when you, as a viewer, notice he simply does not pull his weight and decides to sleep walk through his ordeal and get that paycheck. One cannot help but wonder 'what is the deal?' Based on his 'work' here, I can't see much of a future for him as an actor in movies.<br/><br/>
Nobody plays a weasel like Norton plays a weasel, and he is at his weaselly best here. Marky Mark's anonymity is such that you want Ed to be the victor and smash him to pieces. It would have been a lot more enjoyable- and interesting- had they seen to that. I'd pay $1 to see that.<br/><br/>So to sum it up, see something else, don't waste your hard earned $4 to rent this, you'll regret it, and wind up breaking either the teevee or the dvd, or angering your mate. Or both. <br/><br/>Play it safe."

The original was a classic crime caper, had a strong sense of national pride (red, white and blue and Union Jacks everywhere, a crime lord who puts Queen and country above all else), beautiful Italian vistas, lovable characters and, of course, the wonderful Michael Caine. This production has none of those things - it's clear the entire movie was contrived around an attempt to repeat the ""Mini Cooper chase sequence"" with no effort to make it believable.<br/><br/>In summary - these people shouldn't have bothered."
"screenman","5","7","14","20 January 2008"," You're Only Supposed To Rip The Bloody Title Off.
","Like many people, I was prejudiced by the title. It betokened yet another hammy Hollywood re-make of an earlier and far more engaging movie, but with the dubious improvements of a bigger budget, more pyrotechnics, and some inevitable CGI.<br/><br/>And - that's more or less what we got.<br/><br/>It began slickly enough with a tense little heist episode set in the back-waters of Venice. This served as entrée to a boat-chase that was so clearly ripped-off from 'Puppet On A Chain' and a couple of inferior Bond movies that the makers might have borrowed one of their less iconic titles instead (Oh gosh; surely that wasn't another gondola being chopped in half!)<br/><br/>The gold they made off with was actually Ukrainian. And that was were the 'Italian Job' ended.<br/><br/>What followed was a needlessly violent double-cross, a bout of self-indulgent grieving that I thought would never end. And, of course, revenge - a very long revenge. There were one or two occasions when I was genuinely bored.<br/><br/>That initial heist in Venice was simple, self-explicit and therefore quite involving. <br/><br/>However, the rest of the movie was played out in San Francisco (yawn) which is obviously a much cheaper location, being just down the road from Hollywood. There's no obscure, crooked bureaucracy or foreign language to get your head around either. But I've seen it in so many movies by now that I could surely draw a street-plan from memory. <br/><br/>And it was here that a presumption of audience stupidity set in, and things began to happen with practically no explanation at all. It was high-technology, you see. Viewers had to be computer whizz-kids. You either understood it or you didn't. I lost count of the frequency with which I saw fingers deftly running-over keyboards with little or no explanation. And likewise there were brief shots of data flashing up and across screens, but again with no additional clarity. Basically, the message was that a laptop in the hands of big enough nerd could work miracles. I wasn't convinced. Then, without the least introduction, new characters just popped-up to fill plot gaps, including one huge fat 'fixer' like Jabba the Hut. Fifteen seconds of fame for him (and perhaps a crash-diet to follow). <br/><br/>After the 'Puppet On A Chain' chase rip-off, we were next treated to a 'Bullit' chase rip-off through the streets of San Francisco, and finally a rip-off from the original 'Italian Job' with mini-cars chasing through storm drains. I also spotted a number of other little out-dated and stolen clichés, but frankly - just one day after viewing - I have already forgotten what they were.<br/><br/>Memorable, this isn't. Since 1969 I have seen 'The Italian Job' many many times. I know how it goes and how it ends. But it's such a fun feel-good movie that it still entertains me today. This? I don't expect to see it again.<br/><br/>'Story' I was once told, is something that happens to somebody you have been moved to care about. And there's the rub. Like so many other modern movies; I couldn't care a hoot about any of these implausible two-dimensional plastic characters: not them, or what happened to them. The standard Hollywood 'pouting totty' was the least plausible of all. Though naturally; she wasn't just a pretty face; she also happened to be an expert safe-cracker and rally-cross driver too. A sort of latter-day Lara Croft. Quite. It's no more than I've come to expect in this age of emancipation.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should have called it 'All The Crime Caper Movies You've Ever Seen Rolled Into One Job', or maybe 'Ocean's Eleven Clichés'.<br/><br/>There are worse offerings to watch, but you could pile-up a much bigger stack of better ones - unless perhaps you're a computer-nerd.<br/><br/>Nice title - shame about the film."

The mini chase to honest was rubbish, over way too quickly with no where near as much fun and excitment as the original, and the ending of the film.............well it just ends, with no suspense or anything coming close to the originals cliffhanger, it just turns out all nice and Hollywood.<br/><br/>My advice is, if you haven't seen the original, watch it, if you have, watch it again."

","This soulless piece of drivel ranks amongst the worst of American excesses. Apart from a very clever opening this film has none of the lightness of touch, ingenuity or charm of the original. In this way the film is a paragon of Hollywood film-making in the 21st century  all beginning, no middle, no end.<br/><br/>Compare this to the less than clever opening of the original, which is ostensibly some guy driving around Turin till he hits the bulldozer planted in a tunnel by a waiting mafia. We the audience have no idea who the man is, or the significance of the whole scene. This flies in the face of what we are now told is good screen writing  firstly, the man in the car is NOT the main character, and secondly we haven't actually established what's going on. We only find out who he is about half an hour into the filmand yet it works, and wow, the whole of the film is really great.<br/><br/>Which begs the question 'is it salient to compare this to the original?' Salience notwithstanding this is a remake, or rather one of those films that both seeks to define itself from the original and separate itself from the original. The original was a caper film, and consequently had the requisite hallmarks of that genre. Things such as wit, clever writing, clever characters, and so on.<br/><br/>This remake is a revenge film - Mark Wahlberg seeks to exact revenge upon Edward Norton because he killed Michael Caine  an act so symbolic it's meaning becomes ironic to the extreme. It says we're killing the original, make way Michael Caine, your day has ended. Unfortunately for the makers of this insipid piece of garbage they spake too soon, because even with the passage of time Collinson's film remains impressive in its wit, style and execution.<br/><br/>I once had a discussion with a film guru about 'From Here To Eternity' in which I asked why if great films aren't about dialogue they're about 'showing', that FHTE remains one of the truly great films of all time. His conclusion, which I think is correct, was that nobody these days has the ability to write films like From Here to Eternity. It's obvious that no-one can make films like the original 'The Italian Job' either.<br/><br/>I took the trouble of hiring out the original, just to see if I had been romancing the past. I hadn't. The original should go down as one of the great British films of all time, the remake will go down in the vast pool of mediocrity that has become American film-making.<br/><br/>Awful. Just awful."

"Buddy-51","Null","6","12","1 July 2003"," slight but moderately entertaining caper film
","Urbanites who spend half their waking hours stuck in non-stop traffic jams may get a kick out of `The Italian Job,' in which one of the characters finds a way to bring almost the entire metropolitan LA area to a gridlocked standstill.  <br/><br/>The film, a remake of a 1969 vehicle starring Michael Caine, is an entertaining caper tale that provides all the elements we expect to find in a film of this sort: the elaborate heists, the high tech gadgetry, the inevitable double crosses and the benevolent thieves who would give Mother Teresa a run for her money in the pure-of-heart sweepstakes.  The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million.  But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own  Steve, played by Edward Norton  who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps.  A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.<br/><br/>The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but `The Italian Job' boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time.  The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup.  We want to see more confrontation scenes between the `good' thieves and the one `bad' one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers.  That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face.  The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade.  Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out.  The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.<br/><br/>Still, `The Italian Job' is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater.  That one forgets the movie the minute one leaves the theatre is pretty much par for the course for this genre anyway."

"StuHolmwood","6","4","7","29 May 2003"," Proof That Trailers Are The Devil
","Contains Spoiler Speaking from the perspective of being young enough to have not seen to original, this movie serves as an example of the fallen nature of movie previews. The important and fun parts of action films like ""The Italian Job"" are the plots twists; however, when all the twists are known to all the audience before the film starts, then the film must depend on other elements.<br/><br/>This is a film whose story can be summed up simply as: the crew gets the gold, Norton kills Sutherland, the crew recruits Sutherland's daughter, and then the crew finally get even. While this would normally serve as ample material for a film of this genre, it is unsatisfying because of the extensive trailer. We know that Norton kills Sutherland. We know that the crew finds Norton. We know that the daughter gets involved. We even know that in a mass traffic jam, an explosive is used to bring an armoured truck to the underground.<br/><br/>A caper film does not, thankfully for ""The Italian Job"", necessarily have to depend exclusively on action and plot twist. It can depend on things like original and comic characterization, as in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", but there is no Steve Martin or Michael Caine in this film. This film is a triumph of the flat character.<br/><br/>Alternatively, a caper film can be a success when it contains many many more twists than its trailer reveals, as with ""Heist"", starring Gene Hackman.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, a film of this kind can be a good movie if, through traditional means, it proffers an important theme unto its audience. The theme of ""The Italian Job"" is that good guys win and bad guys lose. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff than this.<br/><br/>This is a film with no surprises. All is known from beginning to end. No one character is explored to the point of serious interest. While I was hoping that the trailer was a red herring, and there would be a surprise somewhere, I was bitterly disappointed. It failed to say or do anything important, which was per se the only real surprise, given Ed Norton's record as a villainous philosopher in films such as ""Rounders"", ""American History X"", and ""The 25th Hour""."

So obviously funded by product placement, this movie has not one OUNCE the wit of 'Oceans eleven' which it tries so hard to ape. I've seen bricks with more charisma than Mark Wahlberg- and Charlize is his 2D, Cindy doll counterpart. The dialogue was hewn  by cretins and polished by potatoes.

","What was the point of making this movie? I went to see it with friends thinking the stunts might be good, but they were nowhere near as impressive as in the original. The stunt with the helicopter was original, but the rest were yawn-inducing. The script is appalling and the resolution of the relationship between Theron and Wallberg at the end was laughable (I dropped my Coke container in the cinema in shock). It was so obviously tacked on to fit the traditional Hollywood hero-gets-the-girl ending. Jason Steatham had some awful lines to deliver. Whereas the original is very tongue-in-cheek, this was too serious and the little humour in it was weak. What is it with screenwriters today? They think they can fill a script with weak one-liners and we'll all be so happy? Mark Walberg is a terrible actor. He ruined Planet of the Apes too (another poor remake). There was no chemistry between Theron and Walberg at all and them getting together at the end was clumsy and contrived. Donald Sutherland had the right idea by dying early on. He didn't need to suffer the rest of it like we did.<br/><br/>One of the worst films this year and possibly the worst remake of all time."

","I do not know what it is about movies like ""The Italian Job"", but I just love to sit and watch them. A couple of years ago was like a dream with ""Sexy Beast"", ""Heist"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""The Score"". Admittedly I do not like ""The Italian Job"" as much as any of those four aforementioned productions, but I still enjoyed this film very much. Old-time master thief Donald Sutherland has hatched an elaborate plan to steal $35 million in gold bars in Italy. He has assembled a dream-team of criminals (Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def and Jason Statham) to pull off the complicated heist. Naturally the robbery goes off without a hitch and it appears the six will get away free as birds. However Norton turns on his partners, kills Sutherland and takes all the money for himself. Fast-forward a bit and Norton is in Los Angeles living high, but revenge is still wanted by Wahlberg and the others who were double-crossed. Master safe cracker Charlize Theron (also Sutherland's only child) also seeks vengence on the man who took her father from her. Thus the five plan to take the remainder of Norton's money and take care of their enemy for good. ""The Italian Job"" suffers through sometimes with an often silly and cliched story, but the production saves itself late with an outstanding final act that will leave your heart pounding and your pulse racing. The cast is all right and Theron is just one of those actresses you can't take your eyes off of. Norton is not really utilized as much as I would have liked. He ended up stealing the show from DeNiro in ""The Score"" but he becomes willing to share the spotlight here with lesser performers. When all is said and done ""The Italian Job"" offers just what it advertises: a couple of hours of fun without much thinking at the theater. 4 stars out of 5."

Seth Green seems to win most of the time but Mos Def in particular was a pleasant surprise. I'm no great fan of musicians turning to acting, especially ones with weird names.

The `Matrix 2' was the other one. But Matrix used the transitions as tools to subliminally remind the viewer of the `difference' between reality and illusion.<br/><br/>Here, the transitions are less obvious but no less complex.

To bring the story partly to the concept of the original they've even included completely non-sensical situations.

","It started off okay: the Italian heist scene; But when one of the thief crew, (Edward Norton), decides to take the gold for himself, the situation resulted into the rest of the crew ending up in freezing water, for several minutes - the death time exposure would kill anybody, but the crew lived through it. There must have been some heavy doses of vitamin intake by those guys in preparation for unusual events, because, not only did they live through that, they sat around on the rocks beside the water, in that freezing cold, pondering their next move, which of course, was revenge. And then, the double-crossing 'Norton' ended up in Los Angeles, of all places. Shamefully the movie reverted to a lower class atmosphere. With the 35 million in gold, Norton then buys a house that looks to be worth 30 million. Doesn't figure? To which then all he does, and is concerned about, is to watch TV. Mark Wahlberg gets Charlize Theron, (the daughter of the only crew member to die), to help with the revenge plan; she's a safe-cracking specialist with an idiot passion for driving outrageously. Some hype dung there. Matter of fact there's hype dung everywhere. You've got your typical computer geek--nothing new there. But you don't have your typical ladies man--this guy looks like a street fighter losing his hair, and he's used to seduce a TV cable woman for the purpose of arranging, (wouldn't you know), the look-alike Charlize into getting inside Norton's house: a house that Charlize scans for a safe that might have the gold. Okay, continuing in short: getting to that safe is complex and watchable--street traffic scenes highlight the obtaining of the truck containing the safe. But . . . Man O Man . . . With those dinky cars that they used to transport the gold: one scene--get this, they went into a subway rail system by driving along the platform and then take a right turn to get onto those tracks (ten feet below)! Man, that's just so damn undoable: in actuality they would have nose-dived . . . Crashed and piled up. And that's this movie; it's full of the undoable! --Made because Hollywood only cares about entertainment, not quality. Edward Norton had been getting some respect from me, but now I've lowered him a notch or two. As for the rest of the crew (other than Sutherland): give them pink slips and directions to the Salvation Army."

In this case, Wahlberg doesn't have the leading man magnetism of Clooney, and the likes of Seth Green and Mos Def don't play the supporting roles like, say, Brad Pitt and Carl reiner do. This remake just falls short.<br/><br/>Ed Norton seems wasted here - I actually think the movie would have worked better with Norton and Wahlberg switching roles."

There are no big moments of jaw dropping ""Wow! I didn't know that was going to happen."".<br/><br/>The Italian job starts in Venice Italy and thus the name. After that the remainder and majority of this film is in sunny California. It is your basic revenge action robbery without police interference.

While this was my very first viewing of the movie on Netflix, I quickly noticed that many scenes have been duplicated in the video game ""GTA V"" right down to the buildings.

","This movie is on my ""Bucket List"" of best movies ever. When my kids are old enough to handle it, this movie will be required viewing. Every time it pops up on the movie guide, I can't resist watching it. I should share the fact that I enjoy movies that provide entertainment. Do I notice some goofs and factual errors, absolutely! Do I care? No! Here are the facts about this movie from my perspective.<br/><br/>Rock solid character development and story line. Story is simplistic, characters have fairly 2 dimensional development and it all requires some suspension of disbelief. If you don't like this, watch a *&%$#@& documentary.<br/><br/>This plot offers classic characters from Greek tragedies and Shakespeare. The thief with a heart, the thief with a heart who is going straight after this last job, the heart breaker thief, the geek thief, the brilliant thief with a chip, the scum thief who betrays everything and everyone. Then, as added spice you have the straight laced daughter who goes rogue to avenge her father. Lastly, this is the story that illustrates the edict of ""Honor among thieves."" All these thieves band together to pursue the thief who has violated this sacrosanct honor.<br/><br/>I LOVE the relationships in this movie. That is what makes me watch the film time and time again. All these characters are so attractive and conflicted. I love how they interact with each other. Naturally, they complement each other, but the beauty of this screenplay is how they enrich each other in the one-on-one interactions. There is good natured teasing between Charlie, Rob, Left Ear, and Lyle. Gradually, Stella is allowed into this ""boys club"", but with respect for her skills and contribution not because she is just a pretty face.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is the movie that makes me want to embark on a life of crime. If I could find partners like Charlie, Stella, Rob, Left Ear and Lyle, I would be willing to consider high stakes theft! Please, people, this is movie making at its summit. If you love deliberate suspension of disbelief, watch this movie. Just enjoy the artistry of the story/character development and the craftsmanship of the actors and directors."

Ed Norton played an excellent villain who said in the movie, right or wrong, I don't care, it's about what I want. His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves. The director left no stone unturned. Every word and action was accounted for and in my opinion, that's a huge contributor to what makes a good flick. While nothing new was introduced, the movie had some of the best car chases I've seen in a while. The plot was good and the actors were excellent. I thought The Italian job was well cast and the story was well acted and well told.<br/><br/>The action was endless and I had such satisfaction because the ending was soooo... sweet.

","If like me, you were expecting a mediocre remake of the Michael Caine film, then this film should come as a pleasant surprise. Aside from a brief shot of 1960's Michael Caine on a TV in one shot, most connections are nominal and the only logical explanation for any attempt to tie-in to the first film must be to do with financial support from BMW for the inclusion of their ""new"" Mini. In fact I found this about the only bit of the film that never really rang true, it's explained away because of the width of a corridor the gang need to drive down. However, unlike the first film where the original Mini was a quintessential element in the 'swinging London' British theme of the film and where its presence seemed logical with the England football team playing in Italy. In the new film any car of a similar size would have done the trick and using brand new red, white and blue Minis could only make the gang stand out like a sore thumb. Still, the pace is good, the actions flowing and the speedboat and helicopter stunt work are particularly notable. Whatever it's merits or otherwise, this film couldn't have anything like the impact the original Italian Job had when it was first shown, but if you watch the original now it does seem very dated. If you enjoyed Ocean's Eleven, then you'll enjoy this as well."

"rosscinema","6","2","3","23 June 2003"," Unrelenting action!
","This is your basic remake of an old caper film and while it has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned, the action sequences are thrilling to watch. The story is about an older thief named John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is in Venice with his gang and they steal 35 million dollars in gold bars but when they are in the Alps they are ambushed by a bunch of armed men headed by Steve (Edward Norton) who is in their gang as well. John is killed and Steve takes off with the bars. A year later Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) gets the gang together again and have tracked Steve down in Los Angeles. The gang consists of Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def), Lyle (Seth Green) and they also enlist Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who is an expert safe cracker. They elaborate a scheme to steal back the gold bars and the action never lets up. Sounds like a very familiar story and it is but director F. Gary Gray does a very wise thing with this material. Its loaded with car and boat chases with helicopters and the way they steal the gold bars is actually pretty creative. The action never really ceases much so the film never becomes boring. Forget about logic, this is one of those summer films that you can just sit back and enjoy. Its nowhere near being a great film like Michael Mann's ""Thief"", but it is a little better than ""Swordfish"" minus a beautiful actress getting topless. Edward Norton has stated that he only did this film out of a contractual agreement but he does seem to be having fun playing a real bad guy. His character Steve is your cliche' backstabber but he is enjoyable to watch. Seth Green has the funniest moments in the film as Lyle who insists that he is the original Napster and doesn't generate much respect from his fellow gang members. If you go and see this film you can expect the same story you have seen many times before but the characters are engaging and the theft itself of the gold bars is done in a very exciting manner. Sit back and have fun!"

","Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson very well. This remake of the original English film with Michael Caine and Noel Coward, among others, should have been left alone, as it suffers in the translation to the American screen big time.<br/><br/>This film also points out how can a great actor of the stature of Edward Norton, work so differently with two directors. In the 25th Hour"", he gives a great performance under Spike Lee's direction. Here, evidently surrounded by such mediocrity and directed without any spark by F. Gary Gray, he acts by the numbers. His being in this film was the only reason I adventured to go, in spite of reports of his conflict with this production. It is very noticeable how bad things must have been on that set.<br/><br/>As capers on screen go, this one is only about car and helicopter chases. It just doesn't add anything to the genre. It also suffers from Mark Wahlberg's almost expressionless approach to this ""genius"" he is supposed to be within the gang. He exudes such blankness about himself that it's surprising that he is constantly cast in these types of roles where he could be more effective in another type of film."

When I went, I was completely surprised.  It's a really fun movie with good acting all the way around.  There's some pretty good jokes in there too.  I always wondered where the name Napster came from.  If I had one complaint to make about the movie, it would be that not enough time was given to the Mini chase. I've heard that the chase in the original was awesome, with the Minis going over rooftops and all kinds of other stuff.  Here it just didn't seem long enough to me.

I watched this not long after it came out and it passed the time and I found it a lot better than I'd thought it would be.
After watching it again recently, it is a good heist film in its own right. It's not a complete remake of the original, though the minis speeding through the streets, gold bars, traffic chaos is a respectable nod to it.
Plenty of action, stunts and twists and a great all star line up, who carry their characters off well.
The film starts in Italy but it's mainly in the US which makes the title a bit non existent.
It hasn't got the wonderful cliffhanger ending either, unfortunately!"

","A gang of cockney villains, led by small-time thief Charlie Croker (Caine), undertake a daring gold bullion robbery in the heart of Turin dressed as England footie supporters and driving a trio of Union Jack colour-coded Minis.With a reputation forged on the back of multiple Bank Holiday afternoon TV screenings, The Italian Job is a ""classic"" owned by the people rather than the stuffy critical academia. Receiving lukewarm reviews on its 1969 release, Peter Collinson's sensational crime caper has worn well, blessed with enough 60s swagger, swinging music and quotable lines to make it quaint while equal amounts of laughs, story spinning brio and cunning stuntwork keep it fresh.<br/><br/>Add stunning Continental vistas and the kind of crowdpleasing antics that only really take flight in the cinema, this opportunity to catch it on a big screen is not to be missed.<br/><br/>Penned by Z Cars writer Kennedy Martin, The Italian Job is a story of charmingly absurdist conceits; a gang of cockney villains, led by small-time thief Charlie Croker (Caine), undertake a daring gold bullion robbery in the heart of Turin dressed as England footie supporters and driving a trio of Union Jack colour-coded Minis (surely the most identifiable getaway cars in the history of crime). Yet this hokey idea is embraced and played up to the hilt - witness Croker's run-ins with the comedy mafiosi - embellished by a clutch of original characterisations: chiefly Benny Hill's potty Professor Peach, with a roving eye for XL ladies, Noel Coward's hilarious imprisoned, criminal mastermind, the regal Mr. Bridger - watch him take applause as news of the gang's ""success"" breaks through - and Croker's gang of campish crims, eons away from stock in trade hardmen.<br/><br/>Yet above all these are The Italian Job's two dazzling trump cards: Michael Caine's cocksure embodiment of cool Britannia and the truly breathtaking getaway sequence. Here is a rare heist flick that concentrates on the escape above the crime itself - in which the smallest output of the British motor industry slaughters the fuzz through streets, subways and sewers before meeting a tantalising fate on the edge of that cliff.<br/><br/>Indeed, after all the Yank flagwaving of Armageddon and within a homegrown cinema dogged by reserved worthiness and humdrum mundanity, revel in a film that exuberantly celebrates the fact that it's ace being British.<br/><br/>As a film, The Italian Job is hardly a work of unalloyed genius; but as a reminder of the time when Britannia really was cool, it's peerless."

However, I have to admit to possibly enjoying this remake/reboot slightly more....<br/><br/>I think the biggest strength of this film lies with the characters and their dialogues; as we're introduced to each character we're given a little bit of background information on each character in order to explain away their relevant 'expertise' but it's done in a way that was both funny and clever. I quite liked the way that each character was set-up in this way. I also felt a great sense of camaraderie between the cast; the whole production was done in a very slick and tongue in cheek manner; I thought the scenes between Green and Statham were the funniest and strongest scenes, but the rest of the cast were all great as well.<br/><br/>Another big strength with this film is that it's just so much fun; some heists films have a tendency to become over-plotted and throw in twist after twist. However, with the Italian Job we're just given a straight-forward plot, but yet it's still entertaining enough to keep you interested.<br/><br/>The chase sequences are fun, the direction, editing and basically all technical areas are also excellent resulting in a film that's not only fun, but it's also quite a good looking film too.<br/><br/>Perhaps having low expectations helped here - I thought the original was a good film rather than a great one so I wasn't expecting much here, but the plot moved along almost as fast as the Minis, the script and the camaraderie between the cast were also top notch and above all else it was fun.

","This Paramount film is a remake of the 1969 movie of the same name that was a very good comedy caper. This 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" doesn't measure up to the first film, but it is entertaining in its own right. This film is sans the comedy, and in place of that with the clever scheming in the original, this second rendition is all modern. That means lots of technical, electronic, mechanical, scientific caper stuff. I do enjoy these films, but find that they tend to be awful formulaic absent a good and different plot. <br/><br/>The highly technical aspects of some films render them almost sci-fi movies. This one is an example. While the final plan of this plot may be technically feasible (very doubtful at that), it's so implausible that it is more sci-fi than crime caper. Of course, that makes it more of an action thriller as well. <br/><br/>The cast are a quite good. Donald Sutherland isn't on screen very long. Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron play their roles very well. The rest of the cast fit their roles to a T. The film location scenes in Venice and the Alps are beautiful, and reminiscent of having been to those places. The crowded Los Angeles streets and scenes are Â… Los Angeles. <br/><br/>This is an enjoyable action film to watch, but there's not much suspense to it. Be sure to watch the 1969 film that stars Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill and Raf Valone."

","""The Italian Job"" is nothing like a real ""job"". This on the edge of your seat movie, makes you wanting the job of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). The Italian Job is a great action packed movie which keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and gives you everything you want in a movie, from comedy and romance, to high intensity action that is joined by superb acting. Charlie Croker, his mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and six man team assemble to steal millions of dollars of gold in Italy. Charlie and John plan and execute this mission to a tee. <br/><br/>However, after the mission is over their planning can not help them with what happens. The aftermath of losing the money affects all of the men on the mission team in a different ways, and they all go their separate ways. However fate brings them back together for a once in a life time opportunity to get back what is rightly theirs. A new member is added on to the team as a safecracker, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron). She is not only bringing her expertise but also revenge. The team assembles and new bonds are connected between people especially Charlie and Stella. A past leaves these two with mixed emotions and tension towards each other, but their chemistry is undeniable. They were connected because of Stella's father, who was Charlie's mentor and more of a father figure to him then Stella. This creates the chemistry and tension between the two and leaves them caring for one another more than either one of them could expect.After careful planning by the entire team. It is time to take down Steve (Edward Norton). The mission has its ups and downs and in the process the action keeps you on your toes along with some laughs such as Left Ear's (Mos Def) hearing problem from a childhood mishap.<br/><br/>From driving cars through Los Angles's busy streets to making deals with mobsters. Director, F. Gary Gray, uses Los Angles along with Italy to provide a setting that makes space tight and the action ten time more suspenseful because of these places restrictions in ways to escape. This adds suspense to the film because of the populous places they are in.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg along with Charlize Theron and Edward Norton are captivating in this movie. The casting was phenomenal because of how each character worked with each other in the movie. Norton portrays the enemy so well by making the audience despise him. His careless and less than remorseful attitude toward Wahlberg and Theron, when realizing he has fallen for the man's daughter that he killed, makes you want to get up and punch him as Theron does in a restaurant scene. Theron's no B.S attitude makes the viewers give her respect, especially when she fights through working with the people that ultimately costed her her father. Walhberg on the other hand steals the hearts of the audience by caring for Theron's character and wanting to steal back the money from Norton to, in a way, avenge Theron's fathers death.<br/><br/>The action packed movie will leave you cheering for the team of cons and feeling connected to the all-star cast. This movie has everything you would want to see in an action movie, car chases, guns, fist fights, and even some under and above water chases. Even if that is not enough for an audience the clever acting, comedy, and romance that are intertwined will leave any viewers happy, and asking yourself why no other action movie has ever kept you on the edge of your seat like this."

The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot. The film is still enjoyable and better than average for its type. 7/10 stars."

","THE Italian JOB has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years. Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE Italian JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible. The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best. The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a camaraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton. With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit.

","Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of thieves who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.<br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtually no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audience at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).<br/><br/>The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is throughout the film you will either say ""yeah right, like thats possible"" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, ""skinny Pete"", you will know what I mean when you see it. As a rewatch 06.11.20' and nearly 10 years since the initial watch in September 2010, opinions remain the same. Great fun, entertaining and occasionally light heist film. There isn't strong bloody violence which made this film more in tone. Overall just as good as remembered, if not slightly better."

Importantly, there was so much that was different in the story that I never felt the need to compare it to the original.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, low-rent action protagonist, was marginally less inexpressive than usual, and the rest of the cast gave reliable performances. A special mention must go to Seth Green, occupying the Benny Hill slot as official bollixer of traffic lights - a quite different character (no big ladies for a start off!) but still a very funny performance.<br/><br/>The original is still out there, folks, and it's still great, but this version has a lot going for it - don't discount it."

The best things about this film were the big golfing guy, Skinny Pete, and the Ukrainians.  Edward Norton doesn't deserve this... he did pretty good (you've seen Edward in so many good performances at this point that he always SEEMS good), but was he under some contractual obligation?

However, as most other B rated movies, this movie falls short on many levels.<br/><br/>The Italian Job is a remake of the original The Italian Job (1969). It's about revenge over the death of John Bridger (Sutherland) after a $35 million heist. Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) leads his team of men and long with Bridger's daughter, they take a vengeance on Steve Frezelli (Norton) who stole the money from them in the opening scene. <br/><br/>The three mini-coopers seem to get a lot of attention in the movie (I wonder how much mini-cooper paid?). So much attention, in fact, that they had to show them from almost every angle for a good 3/4 of the movie. In fact, by the end of the movie, I myself was wanting one of the little powerful machines.<br/><br/>Actually, that's unfair to say because in the original, mini-coopers were also used. In any case, these cars swerve in and out of traffic during car chase scenes like no other. But even with these small, manueverable cars, they never make the action feel complete. When you go into an action movie, you expect action. Though action is delivered (during the robbery scenes), the action during car chase scenes never holds up. It's what you've seen in just about any other car chase scene ever, nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>There are a couple scenes though, which make you just laugh. Lyle(Seth Green) brings comedy to the screen and though the jokes are always on the same subject, they never get old. Norton, on the other hand, does not deliver. Not so surprising though, as he said in an interview that he did not look forward to making this movie.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie was the fact that it cut too many scenes short and made too many scenes long which should have been shorter. This was probably done so that the pacing would be steady throughout the movie, but it never makes the viewer feel satisfied.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","I have not seen the classic version from 1969 with Micheal Caine so I had no preconceptions of how it should be but what I saw was very enjoyable.  It is very similer to Ocean's Eleven in the sense that the two most important factors to a Heist is teamwork and an unlimited budget.  Both feature heists that are very convincing in explanation and execution but as far as the heists being a plausible reality (in terms of real thieives actually seriously going about a heist in such a way and then executing it flawlessly), is a whole other story.  However, just like Ocean's Eleven, this implausablility only makes the movie that much more fun.  What also makes it a fun movie is that all of the actors go about their characters in a very enjoyable fashion.  They seem to know that this type of Heist is very unlikely but still go about it as if it is such a heist could be done and pay attention to little details (like the cars having the proper power and suspension for transporting gold) which, in most cases goes ignored. That is not to say that the movie had no fun or funny scenes, in fact, it is quite the opposite.  The majority of scenes were light hearted and only got real serious when it called for such seriousness (like mourning the death of a character).  Ironically though, given the incredable chase sequence at the end, the best part about it is the mutual respect that every character has for one another and not resulting to the compitition of genders (Charlize Theron plays a very important part in the Heist) which usually leads to scenes that are nothing more then showing the woman having the advantage or the man having the advantage which really amount to nothing (unless you are either a male shovonists or a femonist).<br/><br/>Moving onto the action, there are actually only two action scenes both of which are chase scenes.  Again, these chase scenes are executed very convincingly but are very unlikely in terms of practicality but still 100% fun.  The rest of the movie is comprised of heist preporation scenes which are as interesting as they are fun."

Yes, it's got bits of the film shot in Italy.<br/><br/>Sadly, that's where the similarities with The Italian Job (1969) end, and this becomes an entirely different film not deserving of the title ""The Italian Job"". They should have, and could have, given this film it's own title, because it's an entirely different plot. For the rest of my comments, I shall refer to this film as IJ2003, and the original as The Italian Job.<br/><br/>There's a cameo role from a single Rover Mini Cooper, but the real action is BMW Mini Coopers; IJ2003 has far more violence and unnecessary killings, maybe this is a sign of the times. In 1969 very few criminals used 'shooters'.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you have seen The Italian Job, and feel like watching IJ2003, because you liked the original film, don't bother. If you haven't seen The Italian Job, go and see the original first, admire it, then go and watch IJ2003, a totally different film without any preconceptions as to what it should be like. You might like some of the sequences. You'll probably come out of it realising that Paramount only made this film because they messed up on the American marketing on the original."

","This isn't just a senseless bash at America or its movies, like many other comments. (For example, I agree that the musicals of the 'golden age' was Hollywood at its finest). However, modern Hollywood has once again proved itself to be a shadow of its former self, with this feeble remake of The Italian Job. Virtually every movie now HAS to have Americans recast as the heroes and the backdrop of 'downtown LA' a must for nearly every action thriller on the market. What a yawn! The excuse that it would have more global appeal is nonsense. What's London if its not one of the largest, most famous cities in the world (twice the size of LA), not to mention being the centre of the largest former empire on earth. How's that for global appeal? They talk about 'box office', but being British never did James Bond any harm! The new mini looks great, but the chase is not a patch on the original, despite being 34 years on. However, my biggest problem with the remake, which no critics on TV have mentioned, is the lack of humour and irony. The original had it in spades. It's a typical British thing that we can laugh at ourselves, hence the gang's quirky misfit nature (Professor Peach, Camp Freddy, etc.) and yet while they were massively outgunned by the Mafia on their own turf, they still 'took 'em to the cleaners!' The original was also typical of our 'lads, pints and pubs' culture that fitted the film perfectly, especially as we had recently won the World Cup in 1966. Paramount made both movies. It allowed the original characters to be English, so why the change now? Despite modern communication (like here), America seems more insular than ever! However, while this movie may be annoying, it's still based on fiction. Surely, more sinister is the new American habit of rewriting real history. Their plans to remake The Battle of Britain, provisionally entitled 'The Few' with - you've guessed it - an American in the title role, is not only scandalous, but dishonours the memory of those brave pilots of the RAF, who fell (outnumbered 3-1 against) whilst fighting off the Luftwaffe bomber offensive in 1940. Britain stood alone in the world then, as it was a full year before Pearl Harbour, when America officially joined the war! (There were only a handful of Americans on unofficial attachment during the Battle of Britain). Other movies have also had the Hollywood treatment. (The Enigma machine on a U-Boat was discovered by the Royal Navy, not the Americans. The list goes on...) This surely sets a dangerous precedent. Most American kids probably view the sugar-coated gloss of Hollywood when it comes to history, as fact. Now more than ever before, I think it has a responsibility to tell the truth and forget 'box office' when dealing with such massive issues ..... or alternatively, just stick to the Sci-fi and Bruce Willis in a vest!!<br/><br/>By the way, the spelling above IS correct ... REAL English (something else they've nicked!)"

","One of the worst directing jobs I've seen in years. Heist movies, even the weak ones, generally convey a sense of fun. Almost as if the performers were enjoying themselves as much as the audience. Here, the actors perform like they're in a hostage video and their first born child is in danger. With a good cast, cool cars and exotic locations you'd think it'd be hard to screw up but every element of this is bad. Anytime people speak it's like watching a high school play. There's no pacing, no humor, no tension, and zero chemistry. This film should be Exhibit A in illustrating exactly what a director does. F. Gary Gray is a completely talentless hack and if you don't believe me go watch 'Be Cool'. It makes one pine for the studio system, when, at least, you were guaranteed a level of professional competence."

"Badman5","3","3","7","7 June 2003"," Really Really shoddy
","I've seen the original Italian Job with Michael Caine, and that was a classic action/comedy.  This version shifted its action to L.A., and its theme from action/comedy to action/drama.  Unfortunately, it delivers very little of either.  The acting is listless and the story, lacklustre.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but he's not enough to save this movie.  Seth Green plays a computer whiz who claims he invented napster (another annoying and pointless schtick). And somehow he's got enough remote hardware power to wirelessly hack into the L.A. traffic system from a baggage claim cart to throw the whole city into logjam.<br/><br/>The mini-cooper car chase scenes are hardly reminiscent of the car chase scene from the original movie, which still remains a classic.<br/><br/>
The relationships between the characters are poorly developed for a pseudo-drama, which they try to toss in between Donald Sutherland, as Mark Wahlberg's mentor and father figure; and his romantic interest, Charlize Theron.  The worst part had to be the abrupt end to the movie, which culminated with Charlize and Mark living happily ever after without every developing a history in front of the viewing audience.  Another major disappointment is Edward Norton's character as a greedy, ruthless villain, who apparently is not smart enough to avoid transporting his gold putting it at the greatest risk possible for looters like Mark's crew."

","A very poor Italian job, another poor American big money remake. The whole idea or the Italian job was that it was British, and a Britain against Europe. The new film can't leave Europe quick enough and replaces the minis with German BMWs, thus negating the two founding points of the film. This is an average heist flick at best and calling two characters the same as ones from the original doesn't make it a remake, nor does using a car called a mini make it a mini. In short this should be flushed into room 101 along with the remakes of get carter, taxi, the assassin and ring. - - - save your time and just watch the original. Watch the extras ad let the creators tell you that the whole idea was to keep it British and the idea of a remake was just silly."

","The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","I didn't get to see this movie in theaters, but as soon as I bought it on DVD, I was engaged with every bit and piece of the story. This is a fun film. Fun, fun, and fun to watch. Probably my favorite heist film to date.<br/><br/>The acting is all well done, especially from an A-list cast, with Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron -- all expectations are met, and their performances are the ones we cheer and boo for.<br/><br/>The action has great placement in the film. The pace is enjoyable, as we get scenes where they make the elements needed to get a job done, and scenes of very nicely filmed car chases.<br/><br/>There's a lot of laughs to be had. The comedy works well, from the backstory of Seth Green's character -- who was the ""self-proclaimed"" original inventor of Napster, only to have his room-mate steal his plans while he was napping -- as well as Handsome Rob's freeway chases. All funny.<br/><br/>All in all, The Italian Job is a movie I watch without any feeling of boredom or impatience, which is why I give it a 10-star review. It's just a fun movie, with good comedy relief, nice drama and action, as well as some very entertaining heists. I definitely recommend this film."
"nicholas.rhodes","Null","2","4","19 September 2004"," Reasonable Thriller film not on a par with the original.
","The film, per se, is not bad, but what I object to is its title. The Italian Job was a superb crime caper made in the sixties and took place, as its name suggests, in Italy. Here we have a film that starts out, true, in Venice, Italy but for the most part takes place in Los Angeles. There are some elements from the original, the three minis of course ( but which were much more of a showcase in the original ) plus the name Croker / Bridger which where a throwback to M Caine / N Coward.<br/><br/>The original Italian Job was a ""highly funny and original"" film, it had a comedy element in it ( notably with Benny Hill as the Computer Geek ). That was lacking here. This film could not be ""remade"" as it has a unique stamp to it. Even its ending was highly original, plus the theme tune ""Self-PReservation Society"".<br/><br/>The remake is devoid of any originality and just seems like normal crime thriller film with some good action scenes. There is no comedy and some of the action scenes are overblown with too much noise and also appear highly improbable. And it does not take place in Italy.<br/><br/>Basically, I have no objection to the existence of this film, but a different title should have been used, and certainly nothing hinting at the original. It's not a film that I will remember in future years unlike the original, which is a true ""facet"" of English culture of the Sixties. I'm seriously not one of these ""systematically anti-remake"" people but the case in point here is one that could have been dispensed with !!"

This movie was rather boring with the best part being the robbery of the gold and the neat idea of getting it out underwater.  Also, the scene where Charlie slugs Steve at the table was good.  But, I didn't think much of the Mini-Cooper chase. It wasn't that great or original.  And there wasn't that twist at the end where someone you thought was good or bad is exactly the opposite.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  I like smart, somewhat funny, last robbery job movies. But, this one wasn't that good, so I don't recommend it."
"jeffrey-46","Null","2","4","21 May 2004"," Fairly enjoyable to watch, but basically a stupid movie.
","I don't understand how so many people could give this movie positive reviews.  It was basically a stupid movie.  I'll break it down into pros and cons (Caution: possibly some spoilers, not that it matters -- you can see where this movie is going from Pluto):<br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>* Good music (I agree with some of the other reviewers on that one)<br/><br/>* Charlize is hot.<br/><br/>* Some funny bits, especially with Seth Green.<br/><br/>* Some neat-o, whiz-bang tricky/clever james-bondian heist stuff<br/><br/>* Slightly less stupid than the last James Bond movie, Die Another Day.<br/><br/>
Cons<br/><br/>* Good music does not a good movie make.<br/><br/>* A hot chick does not a good movie make (but it doesn't hurt)<br/><br/>* The funny bits were actually tiresome and stupid after a while (e.g. the epilogue where Seth's character finally gets the stereo he wants. Just plain stupid scene).<br/><br/>* Some *semblance* of reality would be nice, here! I mean, I realize that this is a hollywood movie, but at least please don't act like the audience is a bunch of idiots! (although judging from how many people liked this movie...well...you never know).<br/><br/>Examples of stupid stuff:<br/><br/>  -- There is no way Charlize could have opened that safe with the ""glass panel"" lock the way she tried to open it (by ""touch"").  Especially after the glass panel was broken!  I mean they *explained* how hard this thing was to open because of that glass panel and then she breaks it and then she can open it anyways???<br/><br/>  -- The motorcyclists chasing them in the subway.  How on earth could they possibly have known (A) where they were, (B) that they escaped through the passage that they did and (3) how could they have gotten there in the first place? The traffic was all backed up!<br/><br/>  -- There is no way that the *entire* team would have survived being in ice water for as long as they did, wether or not they had a scuba tank.<br/><br/>  -- $37 Million is not nearly enough money, the way Ed Norton appeared to be spending it!  That Aston Martin alone is over a quarter million!<br/><br/>Etc. etc.<br/><br/>Practically every scene had some major departure from reality, which, in my opinion, makes a movie stupid.  And a stupid movie is a bad movie.<br/><br/>However, since this particular group of actors are enjoyable and charismatic, and since it did have a pretty cool chase with a bunch of Minis, a car with which I am particularly obsessed, this movie gets a<br/><br/>C-<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>**** (4 Stars out of ten)<br/><br/>If Charlize had appeared nude in any scene (See Reindeer Games (another stupid movie) or The Cider House Rules (a decent movie)), I would have added one star automatically."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","2","4","25 September 2003"," Mindnumbing fun but what's with Norton's Moustache?
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I've always viewed myself as quite a patriotic Englishman who adored Wembley (although Twickenham is a better ground), knows the first verse of ""God Save The Queen"" (which is all you need really. It's such a slow anthem, someone would have to be mad to even consider attempting to sing the other two verses) and loves his Chippy as often as possible. I do however have one vice with regard to this patriotism. I'm not an enourmous fan of the original Italian Job. Don't get me wrong, there are some classic lines in it, the ending is superb, and Michael Caine is a genius, but I know people who seem to adore it, whilst simultaneously never actually watching it. The original film is a slow moving piece of cinema which is actually very weak up until the final half hour. Anyway, I'm not supposed to be talking about the original, but the American's views on how the film could be done.<br/><br/>So here am I, it's Thursday night, I've just seen the film (and told a friend what he missed, but then he's still being closed minded as it isn't Michael Caine) and I'm trying to work out how good this film really is. Well let me tell you, it isn't half bad.<br/><br/>The acting by certain people is wooden (Ed Norton is possibly the greatest actor of his generation, and he just walks through this without needing much effort at all. Perhaps his fee is the real robbery of this film as he sure as hell doesn't try hard enough to earn it), the cars scenes are good but nothing special, and the ending is the corniest ending I've seen in a film for quite some time. Despite these though, the plot goes along well, theres a few hilarious jokes, and it's just a good film to sit down and watch without thinking.<br/><br/>Truth be told, there are only three negative things I can say about this film. Firstly, it's so blatantly a marketing ploy as the ""Italian Job"" name and occasional tribute are completely unnecessary. Secondly, I wish that in Britain they'd get rid of this stupid 12a certificate as I'm fed up with parents bringing noisey brats who blatantly don't care about the film with them to watch it. Leave the kids at home with a babysitter or wait till video you infuriating people. Thirdly and finally, my remaining gripe about this film is that the final editors must have seen all the mistakes and thought ""we might not make a fortune, but at least we'll get onto that mistakes website"". There appear during the course of this movie, millions of little errors. At one point the camera shows a side on shot of the Holywood sign and the ""h"" and the ""o"" are back to front. I mean, who misses something like that when they're editing a film! Then, in a restaurant scene, it's hard to focus too much on the plot or on the acting, when Ed Norton's moustache is so bent, that a black marker pen would have been more realistic.<br/><br/>So yeah, ultimately, if your an enourmous fan of the original, don't be closed minded, go see this just for the experience as ultimately, it's not as bad as it could be, but be warned, Ed Norton's Moustache is so terrible, you'll be laughing at it for days to come."

","`The Italian Job"" is a stylish heist film beginning in Venice with exciting photography of St. Mark's and canal boat chases. As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score.   Its modernization is primarily in technology: Computers can program all the stoplights in LA and graphically reproduce all the dimensions of a heist location.<br/><br/>
Mark Wahlberg has taken Steve McQueen's place behind the ""Bullitt"" wheel in a cute-as-hell mini Cooper, racing under LA streets as McQueen did above-ground in San Francisco. McQueen is a better actor; in fact, Wahlberg has a smile as his only defining emotion, but still better than his tepid recent roles in `The Truth about Charlie' and `Planet of the Apes.' (`Rock Star' is an exception, possibly because of his music experience).  Donald Sutherland's cameo as the grizzled veteran is worth the admission price, and director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') shows he can pace a film with the best of them. Edward Norton would like you to forget his  traitor turn, and I find that easy to do.<br/><br/>
Adding to the updated success is location shooting in Venice, LA, and Philadelphia by Wally Pfister, whose `Memento' cinematography is memorable. John Powell's (`Bourne Identity') musical score is modern without being intrusive. Additionally, some supporting roles are strong in concept and performance:  a computer nerd (Seth Green) claiming to be the original creator of `Napster,' a half deaf thief (too many M-80's at one time in a toilet bowl) called `Half' Ear (Mos Def), a tough crook called `Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham), and a lithe blonde (Charlize Theron) described as a ""professional vault & safe technician.""<br/><br/>
The two major heists are carried with the watchful eye of an accountant and the spirit of `Ocean's 11.'  I laughed heartily at the outrageous but believable mechanics of removing huge safes but then remembered the equal true grace under pressure in `Rififi.' I also reflected that this is just summer (`The Hulk' is still to come), and I relaxed with my brain at rest and my sensibility tuned into just enjoying slick films which don't need to impress critics with lofty themes and remorseful protagonists. Enjoy."

It's workable, if not particularly inspired.<br/><br/>And that's probably the biggest problem with this film. It's workmanlike.

","For those who are unaware, this movie is a remake of a classic British film starring Michael Caine. The 1969 original is a nifty heist caper that contains what is, in my opinion, one of the best car chases ever committed to celluloid. You would be right to assume that a remake would struggle to live up to the high standard of its predecessor but in this case the remake sets itself apart by not sticking too closely to the source of its inspiration.<br/><br/>This time around, the titular 'Italian Job' happens right at the beginning of the movie and serves as the impetus for the events that follow. The simple premise is this: Following a betrayal by one of their own, a team of high-tech thieves plan to take down their former ally and hopefully get rich in the process. There are definitely many elements from the original that found their way into the remake's script but the plot is distinct enough to keep you interested. What's more important is that the remake captures the same light-hearted feel of the original with its combination of comedy & heist-centric action.<br/><br/>The cast is better assembled than you might expect. This is definitely a Mark Wahlberg star vehicle but there were a couple of casting coups in the form of Charlize Theron (in her Oscar year) and the always-interesting Edward Norton. Granted, Edward Norton only took the role to fulfill a contractual obligation but he still excelled as the film's villain. Mark Wahlberg may be no Michael Caine but he was charming enough to anchor a cast that had undeniable chemistry with one another. The supporting trio of Jason Statham, Seth Green & Mos Def ended up being the unsung heroes of the movie. Add in Donald Sutherland and you've got a cast that's more than capable of stealing the show.<br/><br/>Being a $60 million production, ""The Italian Job"" had plenty of resources to draw on in bringing its heist to life. There's lots of stunt work here but it isn't just in the movie for its own sake. The heist does indeed come off as a carefully orchestrated affair, which is a credit to both the screenwriters and the crew. Personally, I don't think that it quite reaches the heights of the original but that was admittedly a tall order. The bottom line is that ""The Italian Job"" is a well constructed piece of Hollywood entertainment.<br/><br/>It seems that most people who dislike this movie do so on the basis that it supposedly pales in comparison to the original. To me, the movie manages the tricky balancing act of being faithful enough to be recognized as an homage without being overly faithful to the point of predictability. Taken on its own terms, this 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" is quality popcorn entertainment."

To me a heist film is more a who done it with mystery. Italian Job is clearly an action film and a very good one that is worth a watch on a boring cold day in the winter time.

","I am a big fan of the 1969 original classic, The Italian Job so I originally watched this remake with some scepticism that it would reach such highs.<br/><br/>Many of the plot elements that made the original such a classic are here but some are missing! The small Mini car in the guise of the newer version is here and the film showcases some excellent driving stuntwork routines.<br/><br/>The film differs from the original in that the 'Italian Job' is at the start of the film and is located in the city of Venice rather than Turin.<br/><br/>One of the robbers, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays his fellow gang members and steals millions of dollars worth of gold bullion murdering gang chief Donald Bridger (Donald Sutherland) in the process.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is based in Los Angeles and shows the efforts of the rest of the gang to get the gold back, avenge Mr. Bridger and kill Steve in the process!<br/><br/>The film has a decent cast including action movie stalwart Jason Statham, Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker and Charlize Theron as Donald Bridger's daughter, Stella. The film also borrows from the original in that a big city's computer controlled traffic system is hacked although computer technology has evolved since 1969!<br/><br/>Not quite as 'British' as the original. Jason Statham is the only Brit in the cast I believe and he is hardly Michael Caine class.<br/><br/>The bodywork on those poor Minis after going through their driving stunt paces!"

","The Italian Job is unlike any other heist movie that you may have seen.
To be quite honest I found myself getting invested in its storytelling which is something highly unlikely for a film of this genre.
The first half of the film carries the momentum in the plot quite excitingly enough and a fast pace.
The second half however takes sometime to catch up to the momentum leading up to the events in the climax. But, hang in there beacause this is one of those heist films that try to be logical considering all of its actional consequences which ultimately helps it to deliver an exciting tale boosted with a strain of comedy in it.

"LennyRenquist","7","0","0","18 August 2003"," Italian whatnow?
","Okay. This is a remake. And I usually try to judge remakes on their own merits. I usually end up failing, often because the remake HAS no merits (eg. Get Carter, Planet o' the Apes). This movie, however, DOES have quite a bit going for it, it's just that the original Italian Job happens to be one of my all-time favourite movies. So I found it pretty difficult not to think of it while watching this.<br/><br/>In theory, this movie should have been crap. First of all, it's set in America. I'm not going into buy into the argument between the English and American film types...<br/><br/>English: You're butchering a classic, a film which defined 60's Britain, blahdy blahdy blah!<br/><br/>American: Yeah, but you're just jealous 'cos we're better 'an you.<br/><br/>...for the simple reason that I don't belong to either nationality, and am therefore unqualified. Not that I have any allegiance either way. Honest.<br/><br/>Come on, people! There are plenty of other frivolous reasons to fight wars. You don't need to start one over a Mark Wahlberg movie.<br/><br/>My problem with it being set in America is that the movie is called ""The Italian Job"", and not ""The American Job"". Yes, I know the job at the start of the movie is pulled in Venice, in BOATS (""Boats?"" I hear you ask? ""In Venice?""), but that's not really the focus, is it? I suppose, at least, they HAVE chosen to set the main job in a city (LA) where not much effort is needed to create gridlock. But planning to leave themselves a thoroughfare in the chaos kind of defeats the purpose of using Minis, which were used in the original due to their ability to fit through tight spaces in shopping malls, drive through narrow drains and turn on the proverbial ""dime"". Bloody yanks. Sorry. Oh, yes, now I get it! They needed to clear a path because the new Minis are FRICKIN' GIGANTIC, and wouldn't FIT through the narrow spaces in Turin. So they moved it to LA, where everything's BIGGER! Even the DRAINS! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!! Kind of!! Um, maybe!!<br/><br/>I seem to remember saying something about merits. Um...oh yeah. The fact that this story isn't a duplicate of the original kind of makes it work like a sequel, if you forget the 30-year gap and the whole England-America thing, and think of Michael Caine and Benny Hill whizzing through Venice in a boat (well, I DID say ""kind of"").<br/><br/>The script is also pretty funny, and the team have good chemistry. Marky does fine as the straight-man, and his funky bunch of cronies work well as a team. Jason Statham (who would have made an excellent Charlie in a more faithful remake or sequel) is great as the driver and ladies' man, Handsome Rob. Seth Green is funny as Lyle, the computer hacker geek (an obvious update of Benny Hill's Professor Peach). Mos Def, one of the better rapper-turned-actors around, does a good job as Left Ear, the demolitions guy. Edward Norton is okay, but below his usual standard, as the slimy Steve. The big surprise for me, though, was Charlize Theron. I've seen her in quite a few movies, but never thought much of her. I found her kind of wooden, dull, and not even very attractive. But I thought she was great in this. Funny, cool, and very sexy. Maybe it was because she was the only one who got to drive a ""real"" Mini, her red Cooper S making a meal out of rush hour traffic. That scene, while entertaining, actually detracts from the rest of the movie, because it just heightens the absurdity of them opting for the NEW ""brick"" to pull their job. It's just product placement, I guess.<br/><br/>And where was Alan Cumming as Camp Freddie? Talk about a missed opportunity!<br/><br/>Anyway, It's a serviceable enough crime caper movie, but with logical holes big enough to drive three armoured cars through. It's no Ocean's Eleven, and it's not a patch on the original Italian Job. But it's good fun."
"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","30 July 2003"," Breezy fun
","I guess I was surprised how enjoyable and just light this film was.  It seemed like it could have almost been rated PG with a risky enough ratings board.  I mean, think about it: no shootings in the climactic minutes, no sex scenes, not all that much obscenity, and no scandalous or heavy concepts to take in.  The Italian Job seems weirdly almost a family film... The Italian Job is like some of the great caper/action flicks (Sneakers, The Firm) in that there's a smart villain who can anticipate the movements of his opponent, and the good guys do have to work as a team to meet the challenge.  There're some brilliant moves in this game, and the players are obviously having a great time.  I mean, even in the REHEARSAL of driving the Mini-Coops through the train tunnels, you can tell how charged these guys are.  And the chemistry between all of them, given what a strange hodgepodge they are, reminds me a lot of what made Sneakers so great. However, Sneakers also had THE BOX.  And THE BOX has a lot of symbolic things going for it, like the prelude to the information superhighway, the meaning of spying in the post-Cold War world, ideas about media control, and perception of reality mattering more than reality.  Here, we've got the same charm, but all we're talking about is gold.  So, this is a fun movie, but it won't stick in popular memory like Sneakers has for me and many others. It's a great night out, and this summer, that's all I'm looking to get. ***.5"

","I entered the theater in the company of a grumbling 12 year old.  He was complaining for a reason that my generation (I'm 26) has difficulty understanding.  The movie was Pg-13, he said.  If it's not rated R, how can it possibly be good?  Well, I told him, helping myself to his huge bag of skittles, let's see.<br/><br/>One empty skittles bag later (about 10 minutes into the movie), he was a convert.  A true believer.  The Italian Job is one of those movies that just works.  It's a combination of good scripting, fine acting, and perfect pacing.  Granted, it's fairly predictable and ultimately ends the way any hollywood movie should.  But we are taken for a fun ride along the way, and it's hard not to feel the energy and commitment from the cast.  Everyone is having a wonderful time making this movie.  The car chases left my hands sweaty; the capers were well thought out and clever.<br/><br/>Although every movie requires that the lead have a love interest, the directors here handle it brilliantly, with a noticeable freshness.  The well put together Charlize Theron plays the part of the love interest, and she does it quite well.  She is cast as a reserved safecracker opposite the usually doltish Mark Wahlberg, who fails to make an ass of himself in this film, which is a genuine step up.  But these two attracted leads never sleep together, they never even kiss.  The culmination of their clear desire for each other resides in a warm, consoling hug.  And this is typical of the entire movie.  They leave things up to your imagination.<br/><br/>The Italian Job pulls its punches, but delivers quite well.  It is subtle, endearing, and very PG-13.  The gratuitous violence, needless profanity, and pointless sex are all missing.  It is a step into the past, but i believe it to be a step in the right direction.  Even my young companion admitted his approval, as he jammed another brightly colored candy into his mouth."

","I like heist movies, and The Italian Job was a pretty fun one with a great ensemble cast. It had more humor than I expected, much of which came from Seth Green's character, who kept insisting he was the original inventor of Napster. I enjoyed seeing Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, whose skills included driving cars and wooing women. I would have liked to see him do some fighting like he did in The Transporter, but this isn't that kind of movie. And of course, Edward Norton always rocks. But he apparently said his participation is a result of contractual obligation, not choice. The Italian Job might not be as deep as some of his other films, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. Anyway, I did feel like a lot of the action scenes and surprises are given away in the trailer. So you can probably guess where it is going, but it's still fun to be along for the ride."

","I rate this one better than the Matrix Reloaded. This one wasn't as complicated and it simply gave me what I wanted. I thorougly enjoyed this Summer film. Even as I anticipated it and watched it, I never compared it to other heist movies. I took it for what it was. <br/><br/>And since the summary's been told about this film, I'll mention the pros and con of this movie. I didn't want to compare but it shares some of Ocean's ll features. Now like Ocean's 11, its a remake, it had its all-star cast,individual querks of the characters, its comical moments, a heist to accomplish and a girl. But instead of pushing clothing fashion, the IJ pushes fashionable Mini Coopers. I wanted to buy one as the ending credits rolled.  <br/><br/>Memorable characters that stood out was Seth Green's character. I thought the Napster element added great comic relief along with Mos Def's character Left Ear. Even Stratham's character as Handsome Rob left a favorable impression. I just don't get how everyone has dogged E. Norton's acting ability. He is highly underrated. Anyone who dogs this guy has never seen American History X or Primal Fear. He gives awesome performances.<br/><br/>I like how they didn't make Marky Mark and Charlize fall in love and kiss all over each other. No time for that. The pacing was succinct and I wasn't bored because sometimes movies can stall on you.<br/><br/>Okay a con, well...I could wait till it came out on video. I mean an excellent movie is one I could see over and over. One viewing is adequate."
"jantoniou","Null","0","0","23 June 2003"," Fun heist flick
","Another lightweight heist flick, but still a lot of fun watching the Minis slide slickly through the motions.  Given how badly I wanted a Mini after watching this movie, it makes you wonder if BMW didn't have a hand in producing this puppy.  The cars--more than the characters-- are really the centerpiece of this flick.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is nearly reprising his role from the unknown Deniro movie called, not surprisingly, ""The Heist.""  In that movie he also plays a double-crossing thief.  Norton was far better in that flick than this one though where, as mentioned, he really feels like he's reluctantly reciting the lines off a cue card in front of him.  Norton doesn't quite make it for me as a villain anyway.  He fully has the confidence and, arguably, the screen presence, but his looks can't carry him all the way, no matter how buff he gets or how many buxom Mexican actresses he beds.  Doesn't he still look like a high school band geek to you?  And tell the makeup crew who put that mustache on him to look for a new line of work.<br/><br/>None of the other characters are really developed in this flick either, with the possible exception of Charlize Theron's, who strives to give it some depth.  Marky Mark is pretty stiff as the head thief and the romantic chemistry between he and Theron has all the excitement of a root canal. At least there were no gratuitous sex scenes where we get to see Marky Mark's underwear yet again.  The neatly tied-up final scene where he and Theron are on a romantic gondola ride is baffling, given the lack of development of their relationship.<br/><br/>I liked Seth Green as the geek and the Handsome Rob character--a British accent always soups up the screen.  And the guy who played the mountain of a thief -- literally -- made for a pleasant grotesque sideshow touch.  It makes you wonder how a guy that fat could make it in the crime business - by sitting on people perhaps?  They certainly can't jump through windows and would get winded if they had to stand on a corner dealing dope.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie centers around the Minis.  If you want to see these cars in action, this movie is definitely an extended Mini Cooper advertisement."

","Well, maybe I'm prejudiced, I Loved the movie - highly recommend it to Mini enthusiasts and Feel good Movie buffs. I went to the Cincy premiere of IJ with 150 other Mini Cooper owners (and 7 very nicely kept classics)! WE took up a large chunk of parking spaces oh'ed and ahh'ed over each other's motors and were feted with free Italian Job Mini posters and other promo material courtesy of CincyMini. We then filled the whole theatre, and proceeded to cheer madly whenever there was MINI action on screen. Early on Charize Theron side kicks a Classic Red Mini into a space just vacated by a motorcycle and the whole audience erupted into applause. It is definitely a genuine homage to the Michael Caine classic, but holds its own as a cleverly worked out retelling of the story.  The soundtrack was well done and moved the action and story along.  Too little of Donald Sutherland was augmented by a fine performance from the rest of the ensemble crew. The story was believable and well laid out.  It was most refreshing to have real bright COLOUR production instead of the dark and dingy sets provided by the Matrix redo and the interminable RingsForever sagas. Anyone who doesn't have a giant screen TV will hate those films when they go to DVD. The one wish that lingers with this Italian Job is if somehow they could have resolved the incredible ""Cliff Hanger"" ending of the original as an introductory act for the new one. Oh, and it goes without saying, the MINIS were fabulous. I can't wait to see them nominated for the Golden Wheels, Oscars, and Happy Motoring Awards.<br/><br/>Cheers Jacques"

The new version is your standard gadget-ridden heist film right down to the computer geek controlling everything from his laptop.  The use of Mini-Coopers, which were admittedly fun to watch, coincides suspiciously with their recent re-introduction into the consumer market.  I personally enjoy Edward Norton in just about anything he does.  His characterization of the bad guy was about as good as it gets given that the focus of this movie was on the caper.<br/><br/>In contrast, the old version should have been better based on the era it was made in and the cast, but I believe it suffered from poor direction and probably a poor script.  There was no tension or feeling of rising climax, no witty dialogue and not enough 1960s campy fashion.  The best part is the opening scene with Rossano Brazzi driving his Ferari through the hills of Italy.  It promises another 1960s era sleeper, but does not deliver."

","I saw this last night-what a treat! I went with an open mind, being a fan of the original. In fact, I wasn't going to see it, because I am a fan of the original. But the previews, the publicity-it all got to me.<br/><br/>It was good! It was more than good-it was enjoyable. Heck, if it hadn't been a discounted matinee, I would have paid full price! (Something I cannot say about some other recent films...)<br/><br/>Yes, it's not a LBF (Little British Film) even though there are LBCs. No, it's not the same plot-just a few things borrowed from the original and a couple of names carried over. And yes, Mark Wahlberg is not the most charismatic of actors-but, compared to Keanu Reeves-he emotes nicely.<br/><br/>
Speaking of Reeves, the last movie I went to see was ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and I have see several reviews for ""The Italian Job"" comparing it unfairly with ""Reloaded"". I think they're entirely different types of movies and how can the two be compared except to say that ""The Italian Job"" was enjoyable and the audience reacted during it and APPLAUDED at the end, whilst ""The Matrix Reloaded"" had the double whammy of Mr. Reeves terrible acting and an indecipherable story. THe audience left that one looking stunned and exhausted.<br/><br/>So, comparisions to ""The Matirx Reloaded"" aside, and forgetting about the original movie, as I loved the old ""Italian Job"", this one stands on it's own-wonderful locales (hey, some of us really do love L.A.); car chases that actually seem to be for a reason; clever thievery; a fun cast-and a spirit that seemed to carry the (mostly over 30 year old) audience that I saw it with all the way through-I'd give this one two thumbs way up for a fun time at the movies."

One thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as Edward Norton(who i last saw in 26th hour, which i enjoyed also), Jason Statham(transporter, enjoyed that also) and Seth Green who i think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate dubbed ""The Napster"" is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in LA. The car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I haven't seen the original so i can't really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone, it isn't a film where you need to like that specific genre, it will suit everyone, i felt good after this movie, it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch.

Actually, the two leads (Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron) were the only two actors that I had problems warming up to. Performances by Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def were all very well done, although it seems that the last three films that I have seen with Jason Statham he has played a wheelman of sorts, typecasting? I don't know. Some of the jokes were lame (i.e. The pseudo-subplot of Seth Green's character) and the moustache on Edward Norton's face kept distracting me but that didn't keep me from having a good time. Hey, free movie, even bad movies are good when they're free. Poor Edward Norton, he could have been off making a better movie yet was bound to this. Again, this isn't a bad movie, simply mediocre. Seriously, what was with that moustache! It was like, lopsided and looked utterly ackward on Norton. This piles amongst other annoyances like acting ability and speakers blowing women's clothes off.

","They borrowed the minis and the traffic jams and that's all that's left of the original. They even stayed clear of the tightwire ending. So why not just call it the ""Hollywood Heist""?<br/><br/>The scenery in Italy is nice and keeps one interested for that part of the movie. Once it moves to L.A., it becomes just another heist movie, with none of the characters holding one's interest. Ed Norton is losing his initially interesting ""bad guy looks like a wimp"" persona. Mark Wahlberg is flat. Charlize is as usual adorable to look at but unexciting.<br/><br/>
The holes in the plot are elephantine, so leave your brain at the door if you want to relax and be entertained. For example how does Ed Norton afford a house that costs more than the gold he stole while he still holds on to 3/4 of it?

Edward Norton is always a great actor when it comes to being the ""bad guy""--for example in the movie The Score. Charlize Theron can become really well-known from this movie; I didn't know anything about her before I saw it, but I am now anxious for the sequel. This movie can be very much compared to Ocean's Eleven, but it also includes an action-packed car chase--with Mini Coopers!! I can't say enough about how great it was.

"bkam","5","0","0","9 June 2003"," Heist Adventure
","While it was a fairly typical heist movie, this film was more in the adventure category to me than action.  Its lack of cursing, violence, and sex in some ways was refreshing, but on the other hand it did lose some of the grittiness of a movie about lowlifes.  I'm not saying that there needs to be another movie in which everyone betrays each other and ends up dead, but rather that the honor among thieves theme may have been pushed too far in this movie.<br/><br/>The energetic and enjoyable score and the cool but entirely unartistic camera work help to give the movie some of its character.  The acting was fine, with nobody particularly memorable and without much opportunity for good acting; despite this, the characters' individual talents were fun throughout the film.  Two static but still entertaining characters are ""Napster"" (who's funny) and Handsome Rob (who's just sweet).  The plot is utterly predictable in every way; they made no attempt to disguise Steve's betrayal at the beginning (even though I'm informed that the previews showed this--never watch TV).  Neither was there any doubt over whether Stella would help them.  As a result many of the early scenes were dry and cliché.<br/><br/>The action scenes are typical, but typically entertaining.  I was impressed by the fact that they made those stupid looking minicoopers semi-cool, and the final elaborate plan unfolds rather well.  If you're into heists or cool non-violent action but you don't mind a Deus ex Machina, a trite plot, and an unmemorable cast, this is one for you.  I should mention that for reasons entirely unfathomable to me, my female friends seem to be of the ludicrous consensus that Ed Norton and Mark Wahlberg are hot (never mentioning Jason Statham whose coolness boosts him far above them IMO), so if you're one of those kind of people that might make the film better for you.

There's nary a scrap of fat on its bones, and the characters are drawn expressively and efficiently enough to keep it from being a soulless exercise.  But an exercise it is.<br/><br/>It's an especially nice change to see Mr. Wahlberg appearing to have so good a time, looking so pleasant a guy; this is the wrong kind of movie to be gritting your teeth in, so he's smart to be playing it cool.  More 'Judy, Judy' here than he was in `The Truth About Charlie'- which is not to say that `The Italian Job', or his role or performance within, is worthy of Cary Grant.

","*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*<br/><br/>I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****"

","As a movie, THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best; good (not great) acting,<br/><br/>nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough<br/><br/>to walk out on.  But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINI<br/><br/>Coopers, this film is spectacular!<br/><br/><br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Ok, it's a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid<br/><br/>(with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all came<br/><br/>down to it, the real ""stars"" of this picture were the three MINI<br/><br/>Coopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,<br/><br/>bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory.

The film starts out promising.

Why he claims this is his best film I can't imagine; his<br/><br/>character is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly it<br/><br/>was as if Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting<br/><br/>his body.  Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, though<br/><br/>nothing magical.  Seth Green's character is perfect and the<br/><br/>running Napster jokes (including a cameo by Napster founder,<br/><br/>Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of Mos Def's early<br/><br/>lines add some much needed sparks of humour.  Unfortunately,<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get near enough<br/><br/>screen time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and the<br/><br/>dialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt the<br/><br/>filmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as a<br/><br/>typical action/suspense flick it comes out alright.

Like many heist films of late, the thieves are so smart, that they seem to have little trouble pulling off these ever so complex schemes.  I thought the car chase that I saw in the trailer was going to be spectacular, but it was only so-so.  Why can't movies make car chases like 'The Seven-Ups' anymore, or 'Bullitt?'<br/><br/>
As for the performances, Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron dutifully performed their roles, while the supporting cast stole the movie from them.  Seth Green always brings a little extra flair to the characters he plays.  Check out his scene-stealing role in 'Can't Buy Me Love.'  Mos Def really impresses me every time I see him.  He has a cool presence that will undoubtedly bring him into leading roles in the near future.<br/><br/>

","While I cannot compare the new Italian Job to the Caine original, I found the new version to be an enjoyable heist flick.  It's no Ocean's 11, but it's still entertaining.  Wahlberg is good, although I've liked him better in other films (Three Kings), Theron is wonderful, Norton is as sleazy as he should be and Wahlberg's crew, complete with their funny quirks, are an entertaining group. It won't win any Oscars, but it's a great popcorn movie for the summer.  An interesting and amusing ride with a happy ending, it's a good movie for a hot summer night."

"RandomTask-AP","5","0","0","30 May 2003"," A $10 Heist - FYI: possible spoilers
","There's nothing like a heist film. The gadgets are cool. The stakes are high. Everybody is a snappy dresser.  And the thieves are eminently likeable characters exhibiting Zen calm or comedic sarcasm toward their tense profession. If you've come to play, The Italian Job, a remake of the 1969 film by the same name staring Michael Caine, will be a good time. However, if you're looking for the surprise movie to upset the summer clogged with superheroes or make a timeless entry in the crime catalogue, you won't quite find your contender here.<br/><br/>Starting out in Venice, the characters are introduced as they boost $35 million in gold bars from some rather ugly and shady characters guarding a safe in a smoke-filled apartment. It's just enough exposition to let you know who everyone is and that the thieves function as more of a well-bonded fraternity than a group of criminals. John (Donald Sutherland) is father to Stella (Charlize Theron) and plays master-heistman and father figure to Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) just long enough for Steve (Edward Norton, who is rumored to be part of the cast only under the duress of a lingering studio contract) to betray the group - setting up everyone's motivation for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Burning through a cliché-riddled script is often the task at hand for summer movie fare, and the cast is largely up to the challenge. Ed Norton goes for the throat in a Snidely Whiplash mustache and goatee making Steve remorseless in his pursuit of luxury. Charlize Theron is the film's most compelling character who has the greatest motivation for revenge, but not convinced that the second heist attempt is the best way to go about putting her personal tragedy behind her. She also takes flat lines that could come from any action film and does her best to make her Stella stand out. Mos Def, and Franky G have fun breathing brains into their back-up muscle. Jason Stratham has the best career move here as Handsome Rob, the getaway driver and smooth-talker. Every time Seth Green comes on screen, you're just waiting to see how he'll steal the scene with a flourish of his jaded GenX programmer's pent up itch for attention.<br/><br/>The weak part of the group is Wahlberg. It isn't that he fails to fill the leading man role with a wild twinkle in his eye and provide a protagonist for the audience to jump into the ride with. There just isn't enough for him to distinguish this Charlie from a plethora of other leading heist men. He's the guy who's going to get the girl. You are certain of it. From the moment John mentions his daughter and all his regrets, you are positive that he isn't going to make it out of the first act alive and that Charlie will be carrying his professional and personal torches the rest of the way. The script just doesn't make out the specifics, and Wahlberg lacks the unspoken charisma that made George Clooney's con man in ""Ocean's Eleven"" both likeable and distinct among movie heroes.<br/><br/>The script shows its seams most during the second act when the characters are supposed to be driving the story. The suspension of disbelief has kicked in enough to let the audience hang in until the 3rd act heist, which is really what everyone came for. Director F. Gary Gray takes the opportunity to make one of the most memorable moments in his movie a quiet one of suspense that interrupts the heist and challenges Stella in particular.<br/><br/>
Then it is off and running and a solidly fashioned and special-effect-free race through the streets, subways and reservoirs of Los Angeles. Without giving things away, it is a romp that makes the city of LA more of a character than it usually is by making traffic a real factor in the theft and ensuing chase. There is something about the danger of genuinely crafted stunts that makes the expected face-off between the thieves and Steve more satisfying than it has a right to be<br/><br/>So if you like the thrill of a con game or a good chase, go for the ride but if you're in it for character, take your friends because they will be the ones who will provide the evening's best conversation.<br/><br/>A 5 out of 10 from this movie-goer."

","Under the assured direction of F. Gary Gray, ""Italian Job"" never loses its grip on being cool and fun.  Although the material is rehashed and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfyingly good.  The tone could easily have been much heavier, considering the murder-revenge plotline but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone light by good humor, snappy dialogs and pulsating music.  It is a pleasure to see these would-be-bad guys form a great bond and stick to eachother through deceit and murder, while never forgetting to have fun.  This one is 7/10."
"Pavel-8","7","0","0","3 June 2003"," Good summer flick.
","**Warning! Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>""The Italian Job"" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines, knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them.<br/><br/>What carries the movie is the work of the cast.  In a movie about a crew of thieves, the individuals must have a good rapport with each other.  Without that cohesive feel, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance.  But from the first scenes, in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the proper chemistry is in place.<br/><br/>
The characters themselves aren't anything novel; they're your basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill.  But each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part.  Mark Wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner.  Edward Norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role.  Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry.  Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each nail those parts.  Statham as the smooth-operating driver; Green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolitions man.  Charlize Theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her.  She is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good.  That she does.  None of the characters are that deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar sort of movie, two dimensions are all that is required.  <br/><br/>As the title implies, the movie has a European feel to it, a la ""The Bourne Identity,"" in part because it was shot on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles.  Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast.  The look of the movie is also a perfect match.  The bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude.  The Minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device.  <br/><br/>The plot is more or less straight-forward.  There are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve.  Even with those, the movie speeds  along. Once the foundation is laid by the first act, everything continuously progresses.  Thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided.  There aren't even any breaks for 'real life.'  The story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. The lack of character depth prevents ""The Italian Job"" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist-planning, such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick.<br/><br/>There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing.  But the movie is so enjoyable that I didn't and don't care. In the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly.  But ""The Italian Job"" doesn't take place in the real world.  It occurs in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us.  <br/><br/>""The Italian Job"" is a movie, in the true sense of the word.  It has no pretenses of Oscar and contains no deep moral message.  It provides pure escapism entertainment and does so quite well.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far.  7 of 10."

"Dkish","6","0","0","30 May 2003"," `The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film.
","One part `The Score', two parts `Ocean's Eleven', a twist of `The Heist' and shake then serve chilled at a European locale. This is the almost recipe for `The Italian Job'.<br/><br/>`The Italian Job' is a film loosely inspired by the cult British film of the same name. In the way that `Ocean's Eleven' was a remake of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, `The Italian Job' borrows a couple elements but never tries to clone the original.<br/><br/>In this version of `The Italian Job', Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, a protégé to the infamous retiring thief master, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). It's John's last heist and he hopes to bring in a haul worth $35 million dollars in gold. All John wants is to hug his now grown daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron) and retire into the shadows. But all goes to hell when a vindictive and jealous member of the gang, Steve (Edward Norton), decides to double-cross the team. John's last mission ends in blood-shed and the team loses their 35 million dollar prize. Now it's up to Charlie and the rest of his gang to take out Steve in one giant heist.<br/><br/>
`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film. There is a lot more talking and planning in this film then the actual action sequences. Because the film is laid out that way it makes sense to have assembled such a colorful cast.<br/><br/>In some ways the casting choices are great but the film also has some hang-ups. In the scenes with Edward Norton, you can definitely see his lack of enthusiasm with the role. There could have been so much more tension and poisoned-filled vengeance if Norton would have put more into the role.<br/><br/>The other casting hang-up is the romantic chemistry between Wahlberg and Theron. I really do like each actor a lot but I found it very hard to believe that there was anything more than a brother-sister or colleague kind of relationship. Did I miss something?<br/><br/>The great casting choices actually are in the film's supporting cast. The chemistry between Seth Green's techno-whiz, Napster and Jason Statham's Handsome Rob were pure magic. These two really are the hi-lights of the movie. I really want to see more of both in the future. How about a Handsome Rob and Napster flick?<br/><br/>I really did enjoy the stunts and action sequences of the film. I especially enjoyed the new version of the Mini. To bad those cars weren't in the `The Fast & the Furious'. `Italian Job' could have been in the same league as `The Fast & the Furious' if it would have relaxed a bit. I can just imagine what this film would have been like if it would have been revved up some. (3 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer."

Second, I have rarely seen such an interchangeable cast in any film.  Other than Seth Green, any of the men could have been playing any of the male roles.<br/><br/>But my huge objection to this film was the car chase in L.A.  There's not a foot of interesting tarmac or any surface that we have not seen cars racing over in a hundred films or on the nightly news.  This movie is about a car chase.  The original did it on wonderful European locations.  So did the Bourne Identity.  Not a single surprise in L.A. Of course the Minis went over the Sepulveda Dam.  Of course they drove on sidewalks. Of course they drove the flood control channels and the LA River.  But even the thoroughly ordinary Metrorail tunnels couldn't make this chase scene interesting.  Made me want to shoot the neighbors for having that party.  How much better it would have been if the chase had been in the mansion (which is why they chose the Minis in the first place)."

Also...there's a quick cameo from Spider-Man! Blink and you'll miss it! Right when the guys are blowing up the ground to get the truck, there's a quick shot of him.  Good stuff, enjoyable popcorn that is most definitely worth seeing.  My only complaint is that the most talented actor in the cast (Edward Norton) is given the least interesting character, made especially disappointing since the villain is usually supposed to be more interesting than the hero.  Unfortunately, Mark Wahlberg's ""hero"" also falls somewhat flat, but you'll be having too much fun to really notice until later."

","In recent years, it has been commonplace for movies to have many twists and turns, and/or the big shocker at the end.  The Italian Job, from director F.

A gold heist turns sour after Edward Norton, who plays Steve, has his own plans for the gold, and makes sure of that once the team reaches the Italy-Austria border.  A year later, the leader of the team, Charlie (Mark Walhberg) recruits Stella (Charlize Theron) to join the remainder of his team to steal back the gold.<br/><br/>The Italian Job, free from fancy visual effects, feature actors who are perfectly suited for their roles. Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as the demolitions guy who ""had a bad experience"" with dogs, and Seth Green, who claims the idea for Napster was stolen from him.<br/><br/>Simply put, The Italian Job is fun to watch from beginning to end, the boat chase in Venice, Italy to the Mini-Coopers in L.A., the sneaky but simple-minded bad guy played by Norton. It is far from perfect, but it deserves to be a box-office success."
"tprofumo","Null","0","0","1 June 2003"," A re tread with a few miles left on it
","I went to see ""The Italian Job"" on the recommendations of people I know. I no longer consider these people to be my friends.<br/><br/>This film stars Charlize Theron and three Mini-Coopers.  Seth Green is good in a supporting role.  Donald Sutherland is fine in a cameo.  Also in the cast is Edward Norton, who delivers an undistinguished performance as the bad guy, and Mark Walberg.  He is nominally the star, or at least, he gets top billing.  He plays the head of the heist mob.  Unfortunately for Mr. Walberg, every one of the members of his mob has a life and a personality, except him.  His character is so underwritten that it would take a James Cagney or a Cary Grant to bring it to life.  Not being blessed with their personalities, Mr. Walberg simply soldiers on along reciting his lines competently, but having virtually no impact on the screen.  Had he dropped out half way through the picture, you would not have missed him.  But again, he was given precious little to work with.<br/><br/>The story is a remake of a 1969 Michael Caine film about a complex heist in Venus, Italy, and after the crooks have their booty stolen from them, and even more complex heist in Los Angeles to get the swag back.  Not much more needs to be said.  We have all seen it before.  The whole film is in reality one long build up to another big car chase, this one involving the Mini-Coopers and taking place in the tunnels of the LA subway system, which we are informed is after all, under utilized.<br/><br/>Forget that not a single one of the male characters is in any way believable.  They really don't matter.  This is a movie for people who want to kill a couple of hours and nothing more.  Actually, Miss Theron's personalty throughout most of the film is probably the strongest of the lot and she does a pretty good job with her role.<br/><br/>She's worth seeing.  So are the Minis.

Edward Norton is made to look like Sean Penn, so he plays out at the perfect sleazeball.

","Contains Spoiler!! A couple of weeks ago I got a pass to see a screening of this movie.<br/><br/>The title sounded familiar, so I checked the imdb and found that it was a remake of a movie Michael Caine had done in 1969. I went down to my favorite mom-and-pop video store to check it out.<br/><br/>What I found was a so-so caper movie about a robbery of a vanload of gold on the streets of Turin (hence The Italian Job). Caine was the leader who was using the plan of one man (killed in the opening minutes of the movie) and the money and material provided by a criminal boss (Noel Coward) who doesn't let being in prison interfere with his activities.<br/><br/>The central set-piece was the robbery, followed by a crazy chase scene through the streets, walkways and stairs (!) of Turin. The plan called for using the city's computerized traffic control system to tie up traffic (and the police) while they use the only unjammed corridor to escape with the loot.<br/><br/>This is the central part of the new movie as well. The twist is that they steal the gold and then have it stolen from them. It is only in the stealing it back that they return to the original.<br/><br/>This time Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the Michael Caine part and the computer expert (a hacker, of course) is played by Seth Green (Benny Hill in the original). Seth plays a computer whiz who claims to have created the Napster software, but it was stolen from him while he was dozing (while napping, get it!).<br/><br/>I can imagine what you're saying: ""Benny Hill! The original version must've been a real funny one"". Sorry. Benny and Seth both are left with little to do. Seth has a couple of good scenes but that's it.<br/><br/>What you're left with is unsatisfying. It's not a split-second gosh-wow caper movie like the remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" nor is it a comedy of errors like the classic ""The Hot Rock"" (AKA ""The Four Masterminds""). The best part, as in the original, is the big chase scene: three small cars darting in and out of traffic and generally driving where you shouldn't. (The chase scene in the original is IMHO one of the best I've ever seen)<br/><br/>This is one to wait for it to get to the video store. Meanwhile, visit your local mom-and-pop video store and rent ""The Hot Rock"". You'll be glad you did."

","Okay, I got to see an advanced screening of The Italian Job and I must say I was impressed.  I expected less from this movie than it delivered.  It's definitely a summer movie worth checking out.  The plot is your basic heist flick.  Guy has gold.  Team wants to get gold.  I won't give anything away, but you can probably guess what the motive is from the trailers.  The plot is simple but that's okay because the movie goes along at a fast pace with some humor sprinkled in here and there.  One scene to note is when handsome Rob picks up the cable girl to which Seth Green does some really good comedy.  I'd liken the movie to Ocean's 11.  I think it ranks just below, but it definitely stands on its own as a decent heist flick.  Overall it's one to check out.  It's fun and fast paced, and that's all I ask from a summer flick."

I have to admit I had low expectations of this new film, and they were not disappointed, it was actually even worse than I anticipated. All performer presence, witty dialogue, and the action of one of the best car chases on celluloid (perhaps the best) has been removed to be substituted with blinding teeth, slicked back hair and constant, unimaginative, intrusive cutting. Even if the director wished to have a car chase to match the earlier set piece (he does not) he could not accomplish it because the demands of the ludicrously short takes in mainstream modern American cinema (to suit short attention spans) mean the stunt drivers cannot drive more than a few metres before 'CUT' must be called. The performers of the first film have, as with so many modern examples, been replaced by young, vacuous, uncharismatic and ineffectual model types.

This movie is about a group of robbers led by Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) who just made a successful robbery with his group my stealing these golden bricks. When they were just about to divide the shares out, one of the members of the group, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays the group and kills John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is the father of Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) who is a master at picking locks and getting safes open. So then after Steve killed John, Charlie begins to set up a big plan to take down Steve. So then they create this huge traffic jam in downtown Los Angeles, CA to have them get away with the gold with the traffic light switching with the help of the computer-wiz Lyle (Seth Green). SPOILER WARNING: THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE 1969 VERSION! This movie also had some good funny parts to it like when Lyle was changing the traffic lights in the airport he stands up and yells and then the entire people in the airport look at him and then he says ""I got the Holy Spirit."" Also another funny part was in the end when they are showing the credits Lyle buys this big stero system that blows women's clothes off! My favorite part of the movie was the entire mini-cooper car chase and the part where Charlie is at the dinner table with Steve and says, ""You don't know how hard it is for me to reach across this table and punch you!"" and then Steve says ""You blew the best thing you had going for you. You blew the element of surprise."" and then Charlie punches him and says ""Surprised?"".

The problem with Gray's last film was the script and given the right material Gray shows his talent as a director , hence his work in his previous films The Negotiator and Set It Off. The Italian Job sharp and witty written by Donna & Wayne Powers is a huge improvement over the previous film Valentine, the Powers duo get great performances out of everyone in the cast from the star Mark Wahlberg to Franky G. Walhberg and his team which consit of Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham decide to reccuit Charlize Theron  to bring the evil Ed Norton. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot of the film so I won't ruin it here but the film is a lot of fun and considering the lack of gun battle violence that's really suprising. Seth Green and Mos Def  are real scene stealers as always and Wahlberg has great chemistry with everyone in the cast. My advice go see this movie and just have a good time."

"nicolechan916","9","1","2","12 October 2015"," Great action, intricate plans and good acting.
","This film is really exciting and the plots are just so intricately thought out. What I really like about this film is how engaging it is, that it pulls you in by sheer force. From the beginning the film shows us how they pull off heists, and this sets the expectation for what this group can do. So while we are unsure of what they plan to do later on, we willingly follow knowing it will be great. Also, I think this was the film that made me appreciate mini coopers. <br/><br/>The acting was great in this. Mark Wahlberg is a little mild, and does not really seem to be the robber type, but he played his part well. Charlize Theron did great too, unfortunately she is the only female in the film and so obviously is given the emotional role. Plus it was her father who died, so there is justification for her tears. But I must admit, her character was pretty tough and badass which I give props to. Jason Statham, Seth Green, Yasiin Bey and Edward Norton did their parts well too. <br/><br/>Apart from minor background stories of the group and how they started their career, we do not see what motivates them to steal in the first place. When planning the revenge on Steve, the phrase 'it's not about the money' constantly comes up, so if money was not a big motivator for them, why did they become robbers in the first place? The rest of the film is motivated by revenge obviously, but without giving a reason for their start in crime, it depicts that these robbers aren't really robbers, since they are robbing from the biggest robber of them all. Also, Charlie is pretty much the only mastermind in the film which makes the rest of them there to provide muscle or just for comedic effect. <br/><br/>Overall a really engaging and exciting film that did not exaggerate masculinity which I am grateful for. It would have been nice to have more than one female character though.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","The Italian Job (2003): Dir: F. Gary Grey / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland: The title doesn't describe the film as a whole but it is a remake of a much better film. The characters had potential but none have personalities. They are double crossed after a heist. Those remaining narrowly avoid death and plot revenge a year later with plans to steal the gold bars they originally stole. Setup isn't new but structure details the operation. The conclusion more or less glorifies crime. Director F. Gary Grey previously made the cliché filled farce The Negotiator. Mark Wahlberg is no Michael Caine but he does pull off the desire for revenge after a hefty double cross. After devising the plan he is assisted by Charlize Theron who plays the daughter of his deceased boss who was murdered during the opening sabotage. Both are driven by revenge, which serves against any sympathy in the end. Edward Norton plays a double crossing sleaze who learns that his intelligence is outmatched. Other roles are not as broad although Jason Statham is featured among the supporting cast. Donald Sutherland plays their former boss and Theron's father but the role isn't very broad. It substitutes the original's humour for action with little purpose. The result is an action film that doesn't represent Italy let alone get the job done. Score: 4 ½ / 10"
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","2","13 November 2014"," Fun, well acted and strongly executed.
","Well executed is the phrase that comes to mind with this movie. This applies to both the execution of the film itself and the crime it depicts. The acting is solid all around and there are a few moments of remarkable performance. The crime is also done in a very professional and practiced way. The crime is the first major element I will address. It is done with a motive of vengeance, but I will get into that later. The object of the robbery is $27 million worth of gold. The style in which the crime is performed is very different from Ocean's Eleven, especially since it's not a casino setting, but that's just something for any prospective viewers to be conscious of. It is pretty technologically based, though I saw it eleven years after it came out so I was relatively unfazed by this. There isn't really any time in the robbery where something goes seriously wrong which may or may not appeal to any given crime fan. We see a lot of the planning that goes into the heist, another striking difference from Ocean's in which we are kept in the dark as to the master plan until the end. The second element to discuss, since I have already brought it forward, is the filmmaking execution. The script is written well and flows naturally. The lines are not quite as dramatic or deliberate as in many movies. The conversations between Steve and Charlie are the most deliberately scripted and even these scenes aren't too bad as they go. John Powell's score has the usual crime movie feel with some light guitars mixed with some horns and drums like in Ocean's and Tower Heist. As stated above, the acting is very good, but I will address that in context with the characters. We have a pretty brief look at Donald Sutherland's character, John Bridger, since he gets killed pretty early on (this becomes the stimulus for the crime). He is the well established the leader of the original team most likely because of his experience, though I don't really like his little quote about why the team should steal. The quote's interesting, but I don't quite agree with it. Charlie Croker is a natural crook who seems to steal for the thrill of it and is solidly played by Mark Wahlberg. He is given a little more personality than some lead roles, but not as much as he probably should have gotten. However, it is clear that he cared strongly for John and feels justified in robbing Steve in retribution. Edward Norton does a great job playing the villainous jerk, Steve. I hated Steve's character from very early on, which was good. He all but admits that he had no good reason for stealing the gold and killing John. His one big problem is that he doesn't adapt to the circumstances. Even after he finds out that his old team is still alive and out for his blood, he does nothing to throw them off. In short, the team is able to easily predict his movements and it comes back to bite him. The rest of the characters lie in the team. Stella Bridger, John's daughter is a safe cracker who at first is averse to Charlie and the idea of stealing the gold. But eventually, she joins the others in a quest for vengeance of her father. Charlize Theron portrays her as a confident woman who asserts herself as a leader of the crime. Plus, she does a pretty good job driving her Mini Coopers, which adds a nice touch. Left Ear, played by Mos Def, is the pyrotechnics guy of the bunch and we see a few of his techniques interspersed throughout. He has a mild personality, best exemplified in his encounter with Skinny Pete. Handsome Rob is the team street racer and is played pretty well by Jason Statham. He's more than a little cocky and doesn't mind showing off. Lastly is Lyle the hacker (but of course we have to refer to him as the Napster). He's kind of jealous of the rest of the group because his one big accomplishment got stolen from him by his college roommate. Nonetheless, he contributes a key piece of the crime in his traffic light algorithm that allows the team to get away with the gold. His best scene is the one where he mimics Handsome Rob talking to the cable lady. This leads nicely into the sub-element of comedy, of which there is a little. There are a few pretty good one-liners (""Surprised Steve?"") and a couple of fully comical scenes. The most prominent of these, and my personal favorite, is the scene where Charlie tells Stella about the criminal histories of the rest of the team. Skinny Pete and the one Hispanic guy are also both introduced mainly for comical elements since they play pretty small roles in the crime. So basically, it's a good flick to pick when you're looking for decent crime or decent comedy. If you're somewhat interested in either element, it should satisfy since it's well executed. Again, it is distinctly different from Ocean's Eleven so it won't necessarily appeal to Ocean's fans. But overall it's fun and smooth. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."

","Well,I got what I was hoping for. First the good stuff about movie. Story was quite satisfying to me.. I really like the section of movie up to part where Steve betrays his comrades (maybe even to the point where Charlie presents his crew to Stella),it was really promising,it was dead serious,and thats how I like my thrillers and action movies,there was no too much silliness about it,which was great. Movie kept my attention,plot was constant,there were no points in movie where I was asking myself why these scenes exist.. First robbery was interesting,quite original. I was kind of sad that it was Norton who played the bad guy,I was hoping he'd stay in the crew as one of good guys because I wanted to see more of him,but ironically,I did see more of him because he was the villain. Liked the dialog between Steve and Charlie when they meet for first time after sell out.<br/><br/>And now,for bad stuff. The movie didn't keep its seriousness.. The scene where Mark talks to Stella on how his crew member got their nicks I understood what is the top reach of this movie. Some scenes were accompanied with music that also gave them a cheesy tone,one of them when Stella is trying out the mini,there were more.. Also,one blunder plot-wise.. Robbing your fathers murderer for revenge,seriously ? Thats kind of weak.. Whatever happened to characters like Neil from Heat,who chooses to kill the snitch instead of going to airport with his sweetheart and starting new life in New Zealand.. Did we lose edge compare to 90s ? I think so. Oh yeah,almost forgot,the Napster anecdote gets old after a third time.. Also,the ending is also cheesy.. Botom line is,if you want to make a good action movie,don't try to be too funny and silly about it,if people are looking the movie for laughs,they'll watch comedy instead,be serious,thats what most of new movies are missing.<br/><br/>Anyway,movie deserves 7.5,it was interesting,it was a bit better than average but not for 8 thats for sure,entertaining,actors did their thing,none of them failed,even the Mark Wahlberg who I cant stand was quite bearable,its a cool flick,but nothing thats gonna mark a cinema history."

Basking in the glow of a job well done at a secluded retreat in the Alps, the thieves -- including the aptly-named Handsome Rob, tech-geek Lyle, and hearing-impaired quipster Left Ear are ruthlessly double-crossed by one of their own, the taciturn, calculating Steve Frezelli. Time passes and each member of the group finds himself pursuing other opportunities in the States, until Charlie rallies them together for a revenge-motivated scheme designed to bilk Steve of all his misbegotten earnings. In order to cinch the deal, he even enlists John's reluctant safecracking-prodigy daughter, Stella, for an elaborate, incognito Los Angeles heist. But the paranoid Steve proves himself to be one step ahead of them at just about every turn, and Charlie finds that he'll have to make some daring last-minute changes to their plan if the team is to succeed.<br/><br/>F. Gary Gray has crafted a fun summer film packed with action, comedy, and a talented ensemble cast.Also,it offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting.Overall,it was an entertaining film thanks mainly to the charismatic cast."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","13 August 2008"," ""Italian Job"" nails down all the elements of a fun, modern heist film
","""The Italian Job"" is a great getaway film and we're not just talking about robbery getaways. This movie never bores and is solely focused on action, technology and crime strategy lore, moving along at a brisk pace and giving the bare amount of drama to provide fuel for its characters and story line. It's a 110 minute vacation that has all its bases covered, delivering a smooth ride with little to no chinks. While it may be a remake that doesn't really improve on the original, it successfully defines itself in a modern context as a fun heist flick.<br/><br/>The film takes us straight to Italy for a job being done by well-acquainted accomplices. There's the mastermind John (Donald Sutherland), his protégé Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), the odd explosives expert named Left Ear (Mos Def), the trying-to-be-cool hacker (Seth Green), the lady's man driving expert Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) and the inside guy (Edward Norton). This is a pretty good ensemble with a wide array of talents. Wahlberg doesn't carry this film and that's how it should be. It's a very ""Ocean's Eleven"" style formula, but director F. Gary Gray gives this film its own more relaxed vibe, limiting the comparisons.<br/><br/>The job is successful, but after the getaway, Norton's character goes rogue and takes the loot for himself. He retreats to California and the guys plan to get it back, with the help of Charlize Theron. The rest of the film they devise their plans and execute them, with the script incorporating character development into those scenes. Still, it's not particularly dialogue heavy and no moments ever lag.<br/><br/>This is not a very flashy heist film like ""Ocean's Eleven."" The action and car chases are much more subdued, with little gunfire and no extravagant crashes or explosions. It's not going to wow you, unless you're a 30-year-old single woman who loves Mini Coopers, but it's definitely creative. The elements of the heist will interest you if you're into that whole crime strategy stuff, though there's no unforeseeable twists. Best of all, the drama is minimal and not distracting from the film's objective of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>So ""Italian Job"" doesn't exactly raise the bar with action/heist films, but it understands the genre and knows how to deliver it the right way, providing exactly the kind of entertainment one would expect watching this kind of film."
"vostf","5","1","2","24 April 2008"," OK heist
","As a heist movie The Italian Job is neither a noir heist, but could have been, nor a really suspenseful heist, but might have been. Instead they played along the line of the source material, the 1969 flick, and set up a movie about a cool bunch (minus the swinging sixties style).<br/><br/>Hey, there's the rub. As a cool actioneer it works pretty well, much better than the original indeed since action then was thought as a big farandole joke in line with the rest of the movie. But they added other stuff around the heist in it: above all there is not one single big heist, it's more about a setup for the original idea of having minis speeding in narrow subway tunnels; then things that are not sparklingly cool also clutter up without adding much.<br/><br/>To make it short without giving away plot points there's a line that says fine for a thief means ""Freaked-out Insecure Neurotic Emotional"". These are precisely the points that never come to fruition along the story although there's supposed to be a strong emotional background.<br/><br/>Bottom line: OK movie that could have been much better paced (quite a few lull ends in it between the expected action, comic strip characterization), hence entirely forgotten the next day."
"jboothmillard","5","1","2","21 January 2008"," The Italian Job
","I was expecting this remake of a British classic to be a pretty boring or rubbish film, but it actually was okay. It may have the three minis (red, blue and white coloured), and it may still be a robbery of gold in Italy, but it is a completely different story. Basically Charlie Croker (Planet of the Apes' Mark Wahlberg) leads a team of expert thieves pull off a daring heist of 35 million dollars in gold, but Steve (Edward Norton, as an agreeably one dimensional villain) betrays the team and gets away with it. A year later, Charlie reunites the team to pull off a bigger job in Venice, Italy, this time obviously using the three minis, some traffic light access, and some explosives. Starring Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger, Seth Green as Lyle, The Transporter's Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as Left Ear, Saw II's Franky G as Wrench, Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Mashkov and a very brief Donald Sutherland as John Bridger. To be honest, it is only interesting for the cast of well known stars, the opening and concluding robberies, the big chase, and that's it, and it didn't have a cliffhanger ending, literally, at all, but it is still quite a fun film.

","As far as heist films goes, The Italian Job was a fun popcorn flick. I liked this film better than its competitor, the Ocean's 11-12-13 series, since there is more action and a better plot.<br/><br/>You can sympathize with the main characters in this film, unlike in the Ocean's films. Who cares if Clooney wins back Julia Roberts? The guy is a stud anyway and could get any girl. But, you hate to see Donald Sutherland die and you can sympathize with Charlie (Wahlberg) who was like a son to Sutherland and Theron who is Sutherland's daughter.<br/><br/>Edward Norton puts in another brilliant performance as the bad guy. It is truly a pleasure seeing this guy on screen; he can play anything! Norton is one of the best actors in the business today.<br/><br/>If you want to see a typical popcorn flick with a decent story, fun characters, and a little action then check out The Italian Job. A sequel is due out next year. Rating 7 of 10 stars."
"rebeljenn","6","1","2","31 December 2005"," More of a different version instead of a remake
","'The Italian Job' (2003) is really not a remake of the 1969 film, as such. It's basically the same concept involving chase scenes with Mini Coopers, but this film has a lot more to it than that. It's completely modernized, and it involves the use of technology in the criminal mastermind as well as romance and revenge. The character story is more in-depth in this version, and the characters have a sense of reasoning for their actions. There is also a lot more action throughout the film in this version than there is in the 1969 version, and there is a different story and subplot and ending. I don't think the two versions can be compared, and I do not call this a remake.<br/><br/>Although it contains a lot of action and good characterisation, I found that the action got old quickly. It's still a good film, but it felt too ordinary and unoriginal in some places. It just feels like a typical 1990s/2000s movie following the certain mold of character scenarios and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The Mini Cooper chase scenes are done well, and I guess it helped Mini sell their cars in America, although I've always loved the Mini Cooper and now everyone else seems to. Anyway, this is a good action film and a good film to watch to liven up the day."

","I missed at least 10 minutes of the beginning of ""The Italian Job"" due to wrong times in the listings, but I seem to have gotten there just in time for any of the key plot points that were referred to later in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a breezy robbers vs. robbers movie with none of the character gravitas nor noir sexual tension of ""The Good Thief"" or even the cute interplays and dialog of a similarly re-made ""Ocean's 11.""<br/><br/>The chase scenes are very entertaining in neat surroundings, but with little of the life-and-death suspense of ""Ronin"" or ""French Connection,"" maybe because all that's involved is money, ho hum, whether it's $35 million or $27 million.<br/><br/>Maybe because Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are just too light-weight here. Edward Norton is wasted as a one-dimensional villain; even Wahlberg's character disparages him as lacking imagination. At least for once a distinction is made between Ukrainian and Russian criminals.<br/><br/>There's a fun cover version of Pink Floyd's ""Money"" by Scott Weiland, Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum (last 3 are ex-members of Guns 'N' Roses) in the movie twice at least, but is NOT on the soundtrack CD.<br/><br/>It is nice to see that the robbers' goal is to catch an Amtrak train; public and freight transportation could use the plug. <br/><br/>(originally written 9/7/2003)"
"cherold","6","1","2","8 July 2005"," acceptable caper film
","This film is one of those that gets such a slow start that I considered giving up on it. In spite of the presence of Donald Sutherland, the first half hour is a rather dull setup for what follows.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie picks up as planning starts for the caper that is the centerpiece of the film. I developed some hope for the movie during a series of vignettes introducing members of the gang. From then on things were pretty good, and the extended caper sequence itself was quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Still, the movie feels hollow. Theron is unconvincing, simply because she looks like she just stepped out of a shampoo commercial. The cars in the movie all have that shiny look of something in a car commercial. It's not that I object to glossy caper films; the 1960s was very good at those, but this movie lacks the overall polish so the glossy slick elements don't feel integrated into the whole. Generating little feeling for its protagonists, the film is somewhat entertaining for the most part but completely insubstantial."

","Mark Wahlberg, not satisfied with ruining Planet of the Apes and Charade, tries to act in this American update of The Italian Job (1969). Cary Grant, Charelton Heston, and now Michael Caine have been trod upon by Marky Mark. The Funky Bunch, Mos Def, Seth Green, Jason Stratham, and briefly Donald Sutherland are the reason to watch as is the much anticipated demise of the a**hole Edward Norton plays. The romance between Charlie and Stella is tacked on with little emotion. The ending is not as fun as the original, although the gang has more flavor in this version. Too much like other heist movies to be highly regarded, but too fun to be disregarded. A better lead could have made all the difference."

","Over all, this movie is fun on a bun. Some nice twists, what with the foreign dudes coming back with a vengeance in their characteristic style. Also, good use of flashbacks. You don't see enough of that these days... Seth Green was particularly good. His scene in the car alone, where he ad-libs the conversation between Handsome Rob and Becky was hilarious, as well as his motorcycle scene. Edward Norton's portrayal of the antagonist also surprised me, although the mustash was a little unpleasant. The Italian Job is a good mix of action, drama, and comedy.

Now they found their man in LA and they want to steal the gold back. Here should be a spoiler warning but as I think you shouldnt see this film Im going to give away the best bit of the movie. They steal the truck with the gold by blowing up the ground underneath it. A trick they pulled with a safe in the beginning of the movie. Pretty impressive?

","F. Gary Gray has created a very effective high-speed caper flick. Nothing too deep, just the basic elements delivered with style and flash. These elements include the members of the gang; the sage leader, his number one, the tactician, geek, and explosives guy. Then there's the initial big heist, betrayal and death, another theft that is bigger than the first, while not forgetting the obligatory chase scenes, other cliffhangers, and romance. The characters are portrayed by a well-rounded ensemble cast who usually resist chewing the scenery. The directing is competent and abetted by a great soundtrack. No overreaching by Mr. Gray, he delivers a straight, just-for-entertainment story, and does it very well."

Watch this and ""Ocean's Eleven"" in chronological order - first Soderbergh's excellent and somewhat original take on the genre, then Gray's cheap ripoff. Just compare the score in both movies, for instance. If at least he had imitated fully, the movie would be unoriginal, yet somewhat interesting to watch.

Do I need to say I had exactly the same feelings the day I saw this movie? The original movie was a very British one with Michael Caine doing his flawless British role but even if the director may pretend it's not a remake, we all know it is... Mind you this movie itself isn't so bad, I mean you can watch it till the end but at the end you just have one feeling : what have I done the last two hours? Watching a mediocre movie that is based on wasted talent (Charlize Theron and Edward Norton) and flashy cars in a style like ""The fast and the furious"".

","The best way to describe this movie is ""fun"". It's a quality heist flick with a very nice cast...and the mini coopers! You might say there's nothing really new here, but it's all done well. I've easily seen a dozen heist movies in the past few years, but this one is one of the best of the bunch. All of the actors played their characters well and really brought them to life with their little quirks. And the stunt work was phenomenal. From the minis to the boat chase in the canals of Venice, it was all very believable with the actors doing most of their own stunt work. This movie is a remake and I've been a little down on the large quantity of remakes in recent years. But the term remake is pretty loose here. The only real similarities are that it's a heist film that uses mini coopers for the getaway cars. The story is very different. With all due respect to the 1969 original, which I also enjoyed, this movie stands on it's own.<br/><br/>*** (Out of 4)"

","""The Italian Job"" (2003), a commercial product after the tween/teen buck, is an uninspired action flick with a very soft PG-13 rating and a simple-minded make-it-up-as-you-go plot about a bunch of thieves (the good guys) who are after 7 tons of gold and another thief (the bad guy). A mindless mess of Hollywood action busyness, this flick might have been worth watching if any of the stunts or chases or techno-babble had been new, creative, or unique.

"Hair Thief","Null","1","2","19 September 2003"," Very poor
","Okay, I went into the cinema determined to forget that it was a ""remake"" of a damn fine film. I was going to judge it on it's own merits. I chose to do this I already knew it had little to do with the original or even Italy as the title suggests.<br/><br/>Even if I look at it as a film on it's own, it fails on every level. The script is stunned, the delivery of these poor lines is also lacking, there is NO character depth and it is amazingly slow. After the gang pull the job in Venice and are discussing spending the cash in the Alps, the conversation is so stilted, it's like an awkward moment at a dinner party, no one seemed to know what to say. That's just a small example. The lines were standard pap and predictable in every way. When the film moved to USA it totally slowed down, big long discusion and recon of the baddies lair, convulted explainations on how they could involve the minis. A pointless subplot with ukranians that suggested it might get interesting but totally failed. Wooden acting from Mark Whalberg and Edward Norton just looking unhappy to be even involved in the film. All this without even thinking about the original.<br/><br/>Just to compare briefly, the original was a fun crime caper, it was all about the hiest with a minor sub plot of the Mafia to keep Caine on his toes. It was excellently paced too, the development of the job, the set up and the actually heast and mini chase, all evenly spread through the film. The mini chase lasted for quite a while and used them to maximum effect. Whereas this remake uses the mini for about 15 mins at the end (the only decent bit) and spends too long on the setup.<br/><br/>All in all, it just seems a waste on all levels to me but it might improve mini sales."
"adam-176","Null","1","2","20 September 2003"," Not too bad
","When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original.<br/><br/>As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense.  There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.<br/><br/>The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters.  Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end.  Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge.<br/><br/>It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties.  What is it with Hollywood these days, that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening?  Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favourite poodle?<br/><br/>So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway.  This is where the second comparison comes in.  The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centres, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam.  Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of ""fans will expect this, so we'll put it in"", as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says ""let's do it like The Italian Job"".  Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake.<br/><br/>Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job.  It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments.  I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it."

No guns in the hands of the protagonists, a nice low-key love story almost from another age of film, a bunch of distinctly drawn characters (even the secondary ones, and who cares if they are 'types': was anybody looking for anything else?), nifty car chases, and...AND!...a very impressive helicopter scene (in the garage: was that flying or WHAT?? - God, I love helicopters!), plus lots of quotable lines that you can anticipate on the next watching and have quizzes about with your friends.<br/><br/>And, what is it with guys complaining about Wahlberg? He's not an 'actor' per se, but I , for one, am not sure that's such a bad thing. I also like his low-key way of coming across. As long as he's not pushed to having to express profound depths of emotion he's just fine- and, to be perfectly honest, I'll watch a movie with him in preference to anything from the go-through-every-emotion Tom Cruise, or, say, the self-important Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>The Italian Job wasn't a 'character piece', and if it had been, it probably would have been considerably less enjoyable.<br/><br/>A popcorn flick?<br/><br/>Yeah, sure.

","Being a fan of the original Italian Job, I feared the worst. What friends and I got tonight, on its first night down here, was a well-paced Hollywood film that's a nice throwback to actioners that aren't disgustingly violent, with lighter moments and a distinctive flavour. <br/><br/>For once I agree with Mark Wahlberg when he described this third classic-remake starring him as a 'reimagining'. While it's clearly based on the original 1969 film, director F. Gary Gray (to whom I take off my hat) moves the proceedings along at such a pace that during its viewing, you aren't thinking of Michael Caine's Charlie Croker and Noël Coward's Mr Bridger. In fact, you like, but not sympathize with, the new characters of Handsome Rob, Left Ear and Lyle  a.k.a. Napster.<br/><br/>To show how different, there are very brief flashback sequences to the childhoods of Left Ear and Charlie Croker, appropriately accompanied by period pop music  and fortunately these aren't as bad as they sound.<br/><br/>Gray allows his performers room to move. Therefore, their own characters emerge, in particular Seth Green's unscripted imitation of Jason Statham's voice and accent in one scene. Gray places the camera inside the cars with the actors to get some great shots of Charlize Theron (in particular), Wahlberg and Statham driving. <br/><br/>It's apparent to the audience that they enjoyed making this film, with the exception of Norton, whose real-life lack of interest probably suited his role of double-crosser quite well.<br/><br/>But these aren't substantial characters. They are caricatures. You root for them because it's part of going to a movie for entertainment value and enjoying yourself. There is no additional reason: Wahlberg pales in scenes with Donald Sutherland because there is a too-evident comparison against a great actor. And thank God he drives so much because he sure as heck cannot walk like a man.<br/><br/>But Wahlberg, while lacking presence, is acceptable at all other times, as are the others. While we know she can act and act well from her earlier movies, Theron has her great beauty on her side, but largely goes through the motions.<br/><br/>Green is the only exception, turning in an excellent performance as a frustrated hacker who claims to be the inventor of Napster.<br/><br/>The entertainment value continues with far less blood than modern actioners and the ending  which I won't reveal  is less controversial than Troy Kennedy Martin's original.<br/><br/>In fact, don't expect any of the layers of meaning of the Kennedy Martin script, the commentary on a declining British national pride and economy and the idealism of ""Britain with her back to the wall"". Don't expect the interplay of the soccer game between England and Italy and its parallel against the Croker gang and the Mafia in the ""job"". There is a single track here, no extra meaning.<br/><br/>And don't expect memorable Quincy Jones melodies such as 'On Days Like These' or 'Self-preservation Society'. John Powell's score is standard, early-2000s Hollywood fare that will seem very period in five years' time.<br/><br/>Despite some moments, this film is largely predictable. The trailer lets most things out of the bag and the involvement of a separate Mafia  this time Ukrainian  is minimal. Still, it's a mainstream audience-pleaser that can stand strongly on its own merits. It's a 9 on the entertainment scale (a point off for a naff ending)  so let that be your motive when seeing this film."

","...""The Italian Job"" stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron as Charlie and Stella, a pair of thieves trying to get back at Stella's father's killer (Edward Norton) by stealing his gold.  Helping them are Lyle ""The Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham) and ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def).<br/><br/>You can be sure that the producers remade this film after ""Ocean's Eleven""'s success, but unfortunately, ""The Italian Job"" lacks the style of the 2001 remake.  Sure, the writers give their characters 'cool' nicknames that are explained in brief flashback sequences.  Lyle claims he invented Napster, but it was stolen from him.  Left Ear lost the hearing in his right ear because he set off too many explosions as a child.  Handsome Rob is, well, handsome.  Unfortunately the nicknames just don't cut it.  Everything from the wardrobe to the background music in ""Ocean's Eleven"" was cool, but ""The Italian Job"" tried too hard.<br/><br/>Still, it managed to be a very fun and funny movie.  The wisecracks from Left Ear and Handsome Rob are hilarious at times, and every word that comes out of Seth Green's mouth is amusing (as always).  The action is good too, involving tiny cars known as Mini Coopers racing through streets and subways.<br/><br/>The acting is probably the low point, but nothing as bad as ""Gigli"" or ""From Justin to Kelly"".  The best performances probably come from the three side characters played by Green, Statham and Def.  Unfortunately, Edward Norton's character is both annoying and boring, something you wouldn't expect from such a great actor.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Italian Job"" was an exceptionally fun movie, but nothing more, 7.5/10."

I wouldn't try to go through the array of these movies since the first Italian Job (1969), or even further back. The most recent is Oceans Eleven (another remake) which is quite good. The relationship of the people there however is more casual and transient. What I like about Italian Job (the new one) is the closer bond of comradeship which makes the bonanza that much sweeter. But then, the caper doesn't even have to be a success either. In League of Gentlemen (1959) when Jack Hawkins was napped and brought to the police prison van, the sight of his seven buddies already sitting in the van waiting for him brought a wave of joy to the audience that it could be called nothing other than a happy ending.<br/><br/>The only thing I remember of the old Italian Job is the Mini Cooper chase scene, which has to be what 99.9 per cent of the audience will remember most. That doesn't really matter, and I believe that stories are entirely different anyway, as with other remakes such as Ocean's Eleven and Thomas Crown Affair, where the title and main characters are probably the only things kept. Here, at least we still have the mini Coopers. But let's forget about comparisons and see what this Italian Job has to offer.<br/><br/>Having seen comments that the movie is too long and too bland, I have different thoughts. I believe that this done by intention, packaging the movie into something that is quite different from movies we see today, that are continuing to try to top one another by pushing onto the audience characters with edges, angles and exaggerations that that are meant to draw attention (but often fails). The Italian Job offers something that is quite different, indeed opposite. In Stella Bridges (Charlize Theron), there is a sweet coyness which haven't been around for a long time, reminiscing of adolescent romances back in the fifties and sixties. Charlie Croker (Mark Wahberg), the self-assured hero, the determined mastermind, is also presented as a well-contained understatement. Neither the lady-killing flamboyant adventurer (Jason Statham) nor the IT wiz guy (Seth Green) have the exaggeration usually seen in their counterparts in other movies, and the black explosive expert (Mos Def) is almost unnoticeable. <br/><br/>Even the villain is uninteresting, not particularly smart and sometime verges on being comical, especially towards the end. Norton achieved this objective first and foremost of course through his acting ability, but is helped considerably by the moustache and goatee. His use of a high pitch, nasal voice does the rest. <br/><br/>The end result is something quite surprising. Blending together these low-key characters creates a movie that goes down as smoothly as spring water, quite refreshing from all the highly charged emotional conflicts we see in a majority of movies today, most of which, unfortunately, are not that well done.<br/><br/>Many complain that the movie is too long and I beg to differ. For a movie of this style and intention, the length (of close to two hours) is a good match, even perhaps not a complete necessity. The details lend credibility to the story and the waiting makes the finale that much more enjoyable. In addition to the title and the name of the main character, what absolutely must be kept for The Italian Job is of course the Mini Cooper chase. Teleported to L.A., this sequence is repackaged with some delightful originality, such as the three vehicles squeezing in succession into the subway track in front of the approaching train, with only split-seconds to spare. Remake or not, The Italian Job is worth watching."

","This movie was ok. I thought it's ending was a little abrupt, but the ending of the movie didn't really satisfy me.  I don't think that we saw the bad guy get what he deserved for what he did.  It seemed like the whole thing was a game.  It just frustrates me because, why wouldn't they just kill him? If they want real revenge, why take all his money?  He still had some of it left anyway.  The whole climax seemed pointless to me.  *SPOILERS*  I know he dies anyway, but they didn't even plan on killing him until the friends of the guy Norton killed came into the picture.  So, I give this movie a 4.5/10 because the ending was unsatifying, seemed abrupt, and I think the point of the movie was, well, pointless."
"mrchaos33","Null","1","2","6 July 2003"," Good remake
","The Italian Job is a remake of a 1969 film of the same name that starred Michael Caine and Noel Coward. The cast isn't as upmarket for the re-make  we have to make do with Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham  but they do seem to be having a good time. Palindromically named director Gary Gray keeps the pace in high gear, staging an elaborate (and unlikely) robbery, a nasty double-cross and a sweet revenge story. Couple those elements with a wild Austin Mini (yes, I said Austin Mini) chase through the streets and subways of Los Angeles and you have the makings of a good lightweight summer heist film."
"lschwrtz","Null","1","2","2 July 2003"," Entertaining!
","Well, I saw this movie with a basically neutral attitude going into it. I was pleasantly surprised...it had good action scenes, a GREAT cast, and a script/plot that did not suck so much that it diverted attention away from the action. (I'm a firm believer that the most common way an action movie shoots itself in the foot is by having a script that is bad AND that directs too much attention.) This movie wasn't Shakespeare but it got the job done.<br/><br/>Seth Green is hilarious, he speaks to my generation like few others can. (Yes, I'm one of those ""idiots"" who liked Idle Hands. Shoot me.)<br/><br/>My one complaint about this movie is Jason Statham, or whatever his name is. He's cocky with an annoying accent, and he's unnecessarily condescending. This would not bother me if the characters to whom he was condescending were supposed to be disliked by the audience.  But the Italian Job is full of character's that I personally liked (Norton is a God and I love him. He was able to play the villain and still retain his charisthsthmthsma..(spelling uncertain)) Yeah, he can to stunts, yeah, he can drive. He's a good action actor with good potential, and I hope that he develops a sense of humility.<br/><br/>If he does, he can be a great movie star.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes, go everyone! Go action movie remakes! Go entertainment! Go Seth Green! Statham take a running jump. 7/10"

"Simmonz","8","1","2","25 June 2003"," Good heist film, with the exception of Wahlberg
","The Italian Job: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton<br/><br/>Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of theives who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.<br/><br/>
I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtualy no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audiance at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).<br/><br/>The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is througout the film you will either say ""yeah right, like thats possible"" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, ""skinny Pete"", you will know what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>

","This is a very slick movie. It has the same title as the Michael Caine movie, and it has some gold bars and some little cars, and otherwise it's entirely different. I liked both of these movies, but the first is a comedy with some action stunts, and this is a caper movie with a sense of humor. The cast is very good-looking (so much so that at one point when a new member of the gang is needed, you know it will be the best-looking person we've seen recently -- my wife and I had some laughs over that). It's completely escapist, but it's excellent at it."

","Ok- so they spent the money on some hip, pretty, and talented actors.<br/><br/>They hyped the movie as an action flick minus any over-indulgent computer special effects . However, the info they didn't provide us was that in the film's making, they failed miserably in providing the audience with any original plot, concept, or character. I understand that this is a remake... but if one is going to attempt a remake, shouldn't it be based on a tale worth telling???  This tale has been retold in hundreds of theft/caper flicks already. Nothing new to see here. No one you end up really caring about or finding compelling, quirky, interesting in the least.  The chase scenes weren't even cool enough to justify marketing them in the trailers. So they souped up a coupla Minis... great. I personally am more entertained by the Mazda commercials... ""zoom zoom zoom""...at least they have a catchy jingle!<br/><br/>spoiler: The catch phrase heard in the film a few times is ultimately an ironic one that sums up the entire film:  ""no imagination""!"
"mattryan00","6","1","2","23 June 2003"," Formulaic
","I went in with high expectations on this one, and found myself chortling (not laughing mind you, chortling) a few times; let's just say the dialogue left something to be desired. It just got to the point that I was trying really hard to like this one, given the awesome ensemble cast and what I thought we be a solid plot line.<br/><br/>Alas, this one was as predictable as could be. The only things that were more disturbing than the plot line were the SHAMELESS commercial tie-ins. I mean really. It's fine to tie-in products; I'm not against the concept. But the Italian Job really lacked the subtlety required, as the ads just took away from any of this movie's respectability.<br/><br/>When this film ended I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. And do you know what could get rid of that bad taste? You guessed it! A cool, refreshing Pepsi Blue. <br/><br/>I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but since the Mini Cooper was such a central part of this movie, do you think that BMW had a hand in the script? Duh-Dum-Dah-Da!"

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.  Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!"
"ruby_fff","7","1","2","1 June 2003"," A satisfyingly entertaining re-make with a techno-approach, with equal suspenseful fun and humor of a heist with mini-coopers and traffic jam in L.A.
","""The Italian Job"" 1969 I fondly remember - those three red, white and blue mini FIATs scooting around dodging the Italian police - high and low, whizzing up onto the top of a dome or splashing down by the waters, a 15 minutes worth of quite a caper of chase through Turin. It was a British-Italian production from Paramount, then ""A Gulf + Western Company,"" directed by Peter Collinson with Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, and Noël Coward as Mr. Bridger, a figure in prison well-respected - there lies the British humor to the plot. The opening and ending frames were also memorable: Rossano Brazzi driving a cool red sports car while Matt Monroe singing ""On Days Like These"" (music by Quincy Jones, lyrics by Don Black), and pardon the pun, a cliff-hanger of a bus with the essential glistening load and Caine uttering, ""hang on a minute, lads, I got a great idea"" ending with a rallying chorus singing the catchy tune ""The Self-Preservation Society""...amusing, indeed.<br/><br/>""The Italian Job"" 2003, also produced by Paramount Pictures, directed by F. Gary Gray (""Set It Off"" 1996, ""The Negotiator"" 1998) with refreshed screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers of Troy Kennedy-Martin's original script, successfully delivered matching fun and humor with a smaller concentrated team of six - well, it's Mark Wahlberg as Charlie with three essential partners: Seth Green the computer whiz ""Napster"" Lyle, Jason Statham (of ""Transporter"" 2002) as Handsome Rob the car expert, Mos Def as Left Ear the explosive expert (that 'don't do dogs' as the trailer suggested). Also there's Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron, as father and daughter John and Stella Bridger - both expert safe crackers, and from the trailer, we know already, Ed Norton as Steve the betraying nemesis. We actually get double scoops of action thrills of two heist setups in this version. An exciting start and the pacing throughout keeps audience going, rooting for Charlie and co. <br/><br/>Here we also have three mini-coopers in blue, red and white. They also gave fêtes of acrobatic agility: speeding down subway steps, flying high jumps, swirling through splashing cylindrical tunnel, down to the ""open the door"" routine that finishes off a pursuant on bike. The Powers' script had fun with the key players, giving each specific characteristics that provided chuckling amusement. The plot may be nothing new to a heist story, but it's tight and just as suspenseful with its modern day techno approaches. The father and daughter drama gave Theron a more substantial woman's role than Angelina Jolie's in ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" (2000). All in all, this is an entertaining Hollywood caper with satisfying ending guaranteed."
"lawprof","8","1","2","31 May 2003"," A Slick Re-make, Fun, Great for Techno Buffs
","The original of ""The Italian Job"" was good.  Director F. Gary Gray's re-make is better, a real winner.<br/><br/>Don't look for depth in this caper flick.  The story has been done a number of times before but not often with such crisp acting, great stunts and the infusion of up-to-date cyber-technology gone amuck (or gone in the service of crooks).<br/><br/>John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is the substitute dad for a young fellow safecracker, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg).  Dispensing sharp advice on pulling off a huge gold bar heist in Venice, he also counsels his protege on the true meaning of life.  Steal, he exhorts the worshipful younger thief, not just for wealth but to be able to savor a rich (no pun intended) life.<br/><br/>Bridger has been a largely absent dad (because of long tenure in correctional facilities) to his locksmith daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).  Before embarking on the big Venice job he calls her to say a present is on the way.  She's worried that's he's skipped out on his parole officer but is remarkably sanguine about his resumption of career opportunities.  They seem to have a great relationship - no mention is ever made of mom.<br/><br/>It's no spoiler to report that the larceny is successful but runs into a problem when confederate Steve (Edward Norton) and his thugs decide splitting the $37M loot isn't the way to go.  So they kill poor John and think they've also wiped out Charlie and his oddball associates, an explosives expert, a computer nerd and a master of the wheel.  Well, we know they haven't and the movie follows their complex scheme for revenge. Steve's the target and, of course, an eager and alternately vulnerable and steely Stella is the key to the program.<br/><br/>From high speed chases along Venice's canals to near mayhem on L.A.'s freeways, the action comes fast.  Lile the Geek (Seth Green) runs through techie madcap tweakingethat my kid thought not impossible.  Edward Norton is deliciously evil - a role that requires little depth becomes entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Fans of road action will see the hottest cars since ""Q"" outfitted James Bond go through wild maneuvers.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is appealing as a quick-witted, super-skillful locksmith temporarily putting aside her successful and legitimate career to use her talents to avenge dad's murder.<br/><br/>The outcome:  c'mon, what director or screenwriter could leave Stella's broken heart unmended?<br/><br/>John Powell's score works very well.<br/><br/>8/10."
"easy_eight","1","2","7","30 December 2011"," Awful, improbable waste of time, deserves a 0
","I believe that there is some ballot stuffing at work here. This movie does not deserve a 6.9 rating. I think most people who saw this movie thought it was crap. There should be better policing of the responses because there is manipulation at work probably from movie distribution companies to improve the rating.<br/><br/>In the movie, in the early scene the team of crooks are double-crossed by the wimpy villain who attempts to murder the rest of the crew after the original heist for reasons that are not shown.<br/><br/>In real life, they would have tracked him down, tortured him, took the gold and that would be it. I had to turn it off (saw it on cable) when the villain starts to manhandle Theriz Theron in the restaurant and the others show up to protect her. They just walked away. They should have waited for him outside the restaurant, beat the crap out of him, and wimp that he is, gotten the gold from him, then made him disappear.<br/><br/>The whole plot is absurd from start to finish. The whole good guy robbers thing just does not work. Probably the reason why the movie is so bad is that it lacks any kind of passion.<br/><br/>Some other reviewer made the point that if these guys were so cool and so ""good"" why would they disrupt traffic in the middle of the day in a busy city and not stop to think that many innocent people would be killed.<br/><br/>Also, Hollywood thinks that anything is possible technologically. One smart guy can hack into the traffic system of a major city and control it for ten minutes. Ridiculous. So much of the slop that comes out of the movie industry just does not make sense.<br/><br/>Also, the way the car expert walks up the cable woman who is drop dead grogeous and is a look-alike the Theron is ridiculous. What are the chances of driving up to the cable parking lot and finding the right person. Why even waste time on that part. It seemed so silly and trivial. And what could he have said to her anyway? This scene was totally unnecessary and obviously was just a filler because they had to stretch out the movie.<br/><br/>And the acting is atrocious. Theron is like a manikin. Walberg is not convincing as a crook and seems like he is playing the role in his sleep. The rest of the crew is even worse.<br/><br/>It is not even worth watching on cable."

","I must admit, when i first went to see this i hadn't seen any trailers and thought it was going to be a bad under-funded film. I had not seen the Original Italian Job before i had seen this, although i have now as i was that impressed with this new version of the film. Firstly, many people say that the film is going to be rubbish as in is set in America where the title of the film suggests that the film takes place in Italy. The film explains this as the story goes on, and it does it well too! Right, now onto the film itself. The story line in my opinion is one of the best out of all films in 2003. The character choices are very good, with Mark Wahlberg playing Charlie Crokers part excellently, and i especially liked Seth Greens part as a computer 'genius', being into computers myself, i particularly liked his role in the movie. THey have kept some of the original things in the new movie from the 1969 version, including starting the movie with a heist in Venice and the inclusion of the new Mini Cooper S's, as the original minis were used in the 1969 version. Overall this is my favourite movie in recent years, and i wouldn't normally give a vote of 10 for any movie, but this film certainly deserves it."

I do recollect having a pleasing sensation of seeing Charlize Theron, bra-less in a tank top, but they make mannequins with nipples, and I was in a clothing store a few days ago. Mark Wahlberg was there, all angry, wounded puppy-dog handsome. Donald Sutherland popped up, then popped out after crossing paths with ferret-faced baddie, Edward Norton. Venice, Italy and Hollywood, California both looked nice. There were millions of dollars in gold bars, some scuba gear, laptops that could do things I don't think can be done even 11 years after the movie came out, a couple of bullet holes, a number of giant Samoans, cusswords looped out with non- cusswords, and a feeling that this was all just so much fun for a bunch of popular actors and their action-movie-addicted audience.<br/><br/>Yet, I can't be sure. I think The Italian Job was an equally pleasant and vacant bit of duck fluff for summer consumption. I know Wahlberg has so much animal magnetism that if he screwed a light bulb in his ear, the damn thing would light off instantly. Theron exudes such a dangerously sexy vibe that, even though she has nothing to do here but act as if she's happy to be invited to work with the boys, we don't mind because there's something primal in her provocativeness. Norton could narrate a documentary on Pope Francis, and the viewer might want to clean his ears out with Lysol, all because he's so . . . um . . . icky.<br/><br/>I just don't know for sure if I saw this movie.

It might just be me, but I like movies that throw some curves at you; this one doesn't, except at the very beginning, which you then know there is going to be some retaliation and you can figure out how it from there how it is going to happen. This movie reminded me more of Fast and Furious, just more on an international scale. I thought XXX was better. I did not find the characters to be believable in their roles."

","Competent acting, a brisk plot and some spectacular set-pieces do little to satisfy me. Having recently watched the outstanding original once more, I am reminded of exactly how little charm this movie possesses. Where the original had a captivating personality, this has just another white-washed Hollywood sheen to it. The new minis are quite nice, but have none of the cheeky character of the old ones and with Micheal Cain replaced by the competent, if frankly uninspiring Wahlberg, this movie disappointed me in almost every way possible. Don't even get me started on the happy go-lucky ending either. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not simply worshipping the original because it was there first. I worship the original because it's a classic, and quite rightfully so. Admittedly, this film had a hell of a lot to live up to, but with such a cast and even the original scriptwriter, Troy Kennedy-Martin, the fact that it didn't made me hate it even more. To even associate this film with the original is to do Peter Collinson's masterpiece a huge injustice."

With so many great and fun characters you would expect a better movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences are nicely done, you can tell F. Gary Gray is a real action director.

Too bad that Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton were not the two best casting choices from the movie, an extra shame because they were the two main characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice musical moments by John Powell and a good pace and atmosphere but overall that can't help it that this movie is a forgettable one.

Seth Green looks like he had a great time making this movie, and has some of the best lines. Jason Statham makes me more of a fan every time I see him, and it was nice to see him play a more humorous character than those he's done in the past. And I'd never seen Mos Def before, but he was hysterical.  Charlize Theron didn't have a whole lot to work with - her character seemed to be the least fleshed out - but I still enjoyed her performance.  She's one of the few ""It"" actresses out there these days that I can stomach.<br/><br/>The action sequences were great, and the Mini Cooper chase made me want to take a trip to the local BMW dealer (which I'm sure was half the point).

It lingers for a sec on a billboard for the ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" TV show. That title captures the energy of this flat tire of a movie. <br/><br/>""The Italian Job"" is the kind of movie Hollywood does really well. It's a slick, ensemble heist flick with chivalrous thieves to root for. Unfortunately it's also the kind of flick the audience has seen a hundred trillion times. The boredom was infectious because the cast acted like it was drifting into a coma.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was the worst offender. He also starred in ""The Snore"". Ooops. I mean ""The Score"". He is playing the exact same character in this flick minus the retarded guy disguise.  Maybe he should have whipped that routine out. He needed something to jumpstart him. Wahlberg plays a thief who wants to rip-off Norton because Norton betrayed him. Wahlberg truly earns the title ""Chief Blank Slate"". Whether he was upset, sad, happy or angry, he gave the same facial expression: Blank stare. Stoic or constipated? I couldn't tell. Theron is the hot blond girl they rope into the gang in order to give it a hot blonde girl. She was also bereft of emotions. She said this was a ""personal job"" for her but she looked like she couldn't care less. ""It's a safe, (Yawn) I can crack it, I can't wait to see the look on his...zzzz.....""<br/><br/>In fairness, there were some cool scenes during the final heist in L.A. But that's about it.  There's one point in the movie where the thieves say this job is not about stealing the gold. It's not? What the heck is it about? Revenge? Then why not just kill Norton? Why go through this elaborate heist if it's not about the gold? Actually it is all about the gold but Hollywood needs to hold onto its myth of the noble thief. It would be hard for the audience to root for money grubbing lowlifes if the thieves didn't have some altruistic motive for stealing. See, they're like modern day Robin Hoods stealing from an even worse thief and whatever."

"CleveMan66","8","1","5","16 February 2015"," ""The Italian Job"" is a remake which pays homage to the original, but creates an enviable legacy of its own.
","The faithfulness of re-made films to their original material run the gamut from shot-for-shot remakes, like 1998's ""Psycho"" (starring then little-known Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche), all the way to movies that bear almost no resemblance to the original except for the title and basic concept, like 2013's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Sean Penn). 2003's ""The Italian Job"" is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. This movie is a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine vehicle of the same name, and known as one of Britain's most popular films. The 2003 version is, according to director F. Gary Gray, ""an homage"" that is ""inspired by the original"". The remake changes the location of the story's main caper, but keeps the focus on stealing gold bullion. The homage aspect of the remake can be seen in the names of some of the characters (even though their roles in the plot are different), the part of the plan that involves carefully controlling the escape route, the prominent use of the Mini Coopers, an escape through a small tunnel and a dramatic scene in which a vehicle is perched precariously over a large drop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>2003's ""The Italian Job"" begins with a creative and daring heist of $35 million worth of gold bullion in Venice, Italy. The gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg, in the Michael Caine role), Steve (Edward Norton), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham), ""Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def) and the group's senior member (pulling his final job), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After cleverly making off with the gold, the crew is celebrating on a mountain road in the Alps (also a setting from the original film), when John praises Charlie (the group's new leader) for planning the perfect robbery and pulling it off ""without even holding a gun."" Unfortunately, the group doesn't get much farther than that. One of their own turns on them, leaves them all for dead and makes off with the gold.<br/><br/>The story now jumps ahead one year. The original group's traitor is living large in his L.A. mansion, while those he thought were dead are planning to steal back what remains of the gold bars. John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), an expert safecracker like her father, joins the gang. They also take on a mechanic named Wrench (Franky G), who the group needs to customize those Mini Coopers that are essential to the plan – and so prominent in the story that Gray referred to them as ""part of the cast."" After dealing with some unexpected challenges and having to completely change their plan, Charlie and his crew go after the gold in a climax that is even more inventive and exciting than the original robbery in Venice.<br/><br/>""The Italian Job"" is exactly what a movie like this should be – a whole lot of fun! Every cast member is fun and interesting to watch and they have great chemistry between them. The story contains some clichés, but you won't care. The screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers has some very funny moments amidst all the scheming and double-crossing. Gray balances it all perfectly, makes the whole thing entertaining and what comes out is a ""Job"" definitely worth having."

","Warning: This review might contain spoilers. The 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" is a great example of what a modern day action film contains. It has villains, heroes, gun battles, car chases, great camera work, and of course a beautiful woman. This film stands out on any list of action films and is an excellent movie.<br/><br/>This movie really has little in common with its 1969 predecessor, other than the fact that gold is stolen with the help of Mini Coopers. However, this more modern version still manages to upend its earlier version. The advancements in technology make the camera angles more impressive and much more interesting, while the idea of high tech tools make the characters the envy of modern males.<br/><br/>Seth Green steals every scene. As the geeky computer hacker Lyle, Green manages to create a true geek image and brings a new level to the parody of the geek. As he helps the thieves hack the computer systems necessary for the job, he constantly flashes back to his college days where he claims to be the real maker of Napster.<br/><br/>The casting is perfect. Mark Wahlberg plays the leading role of hero Charlie Croker. Edward Norton, who does a great job making his character disliked, takes on the villain role. Charlize Theron plays the role of beautiful woman, Stella Bridger. Charlize does an excellent job with this role and this is the best she has looked in one of her films.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, F. Gary Gray's version of ""The Italian Job"" is superior compared to its predecessor. This movie updates all of the elements from 1969, which are now obsolete. The film is well done and the new twist on a well-known plot is appreciated and creates a new classic."

For one, I'd think the weight of the gold would be too heavy for the craft to support.   But also they never showed how they actually escaped underwater.  The movie cut from the scene when they were loading the gold bars, to all of a sudden they are celebrating on top of the snowy mountain.  I'd think it would be hard to drive and steer the craft underwater, afterall, in murky water, even with goggles, it's hard to see 2 feet ahead, so they could have easily crashed into say, a cement pillar of a bridge.<br/><br/>Oh, one other thing, near the end of the movie, it was foolish for the backstabbing thief in the helicopter not to think of just lifting the cover off of the hole that Wahlberg order his car remodeler to cover up with the side of a truck, and then lowering down on say, ropes, and then they would be instantly at the location of their armored car full of gold!"

The cast was all outstanding, the only disappointing thing was they had to kill off Sutherland so quickly (necessary, but one got the impression he was going to be very good in the movie too.) Ed Norton hasn't been this good since Fight Club, and Wahlberg really comes into his own here."

"Ziya90","1","1","6","19 December 2009"," Talking, talking and talking
","I don't call it fun, because the movie was too slow paced. It begins good, the opening scene arouses attention, but then talking, talking and talking. It is weird, isn't it? Many people say it is fun, fun and fun and also fast paced. May be, they forget Die Hards, Mission Impossibles etc. at that moment. I believe that comparing original movies and remakes are a bit wrong, so I won't do that, but I want to say that as a note, the original film was excellent and real fun from the beginning till the end. In addition, it was very flowing, because it did not consist of talking like this movie. And its great (and unusual) final had the last word. This remake is not even an action movie, because there is no action except the expected car chase scene which takes place very late. Then, the movie livens up a bit, but that's all. Edward Norton is interesting, there is Jason Statham who is the man of action movies and more, but none of them can save the movie, because as mentioned, not only it is slow paced, but also it is not a stylish picture, just OK in terms of direction. Such movies sell themselves as action movies, thrill rides, but they are not. If you call a scene that they drive a car for test before the heist as action, then it changes. The chase scene was fun, but there are much better car chases, it does not raise the bar. Just a fun car chase, but before, you have to watch the uninteresting conversations between Wahlberg and Theron to see this chase. By the way, they get closer of course later. A soap bubble movie."

This movie shows life as it is today, short lived entertainment, Computer gurus, fast cars and tricked out sceneries that most people can't afford to visit. The Italian Job is exactly that, a couple of hours for your entertainment to shut off some brain functions and enjoy a wild ride to catch the price. Nothing more, nothing less. The Minis fit right into this picture, todays technology available for your pleasure, just need to buy one. All of these intellectual comparisons with the ""original"" movie have absolutely no value to me, even more so after the Director's statement that this isn't a remake. Can't we just drop it here and enjoy another little action story? Not sure how often this must be repeated: it's made in Hollywood - if I want something better or slightly intelligent I go visit the library and read Plato. But that is getting boring sometimes.<br/><br/>People are reading too much into movies at times; it is like art, politics or personal taste - a matter of opinion and not a subject of judgment, so take it or leave it.

","In Venice, a very specialized team of thieves, composed of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg),  John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Lyle (Seth Green), Left Ear (Mos Def) and Steve (Edward Norton) heist US$ 35,000,000.00 in gold bars in a cerebral plan and without any shooting. However, they are double crossed by Steve, who steals all the gold and kills John. One year later, they find Steve living as a millionaire in a mansion in Hollywood. They invite the straight specialist in safes, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), daughter of John, to join the group and steal the gold from Steve, in a sort of payback. In their plan, they intend to provoke a traffic jam and the Minis have an important participation. This story has many cliches, is totally unbelievable, but what could a viewer expect from an action movie? Exactly what this movie offers to the audience: a breathless adventure, funny, full of action, a great entertainment. Of course, we cheer on the nice and daring thieves against Steve, the real bad guy in the story. The DVD has many extras and shows that practically all the action scenes were performed by the cast, who had a specific training. Charlize Theron is very beautiful in this film (as usual). I liked this movie a lot. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Uma Saída de Mestre' (`An Exit of Master')"

","Mark Wahlberg is one of my favorite actors, and especially this is one of his best movies. In fact I've never yet seen any better movie than this one. It was recommended to me by people who saw it earlier than me in a country where it was released earlier than here, so once I could go to a night preview, I took a look, I didn't even wait for the official premiere date. So this recommendation had not misled me in any way as I enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>The gold worth 35000000 Italian euros ended up in quite a mess, as one of the robbers robbed all his crime partners in the Dolomites quite soon after they had taken the gold away from Venice. A year later those who got nothing due to this second crime in chain found out where the gold was and even if the person who had it all lied that it had all gone, there was gold worth 27000000 euros left, so in the end everything is OK. Why I say this (which is a kind of a spoiler) is that I admire the way Mark Wahlberg a.k.a. Charlie Croker takes back from Steve what belongs to the others, and the way that all is well that ends well. I'm eagerly expecting the 2nd episode to come."

","This movie is a typical Hollywood ""remake"" of a brilliant British original. The story is only vaguely similar to the British one, and this is shown in the use of gold bars as the target of the theft, the three mini's, the chase scene and the traffic jam. Other than that this picture is very far removed from the original Italian Job that has always been one of my favourite classics. The only thing that is really worth watching in this mess is the lovely Charlize Theron and a 10 minute appearance by Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>This picture is not special in any way, and is just yet another one of these modern-day action movies with a bunch of thieves, some high-speed chase scenes, lots of guns and explosions, some boats and some pretty Venecian scenery. It is the sort of thing I might watch only if I get bored with the news and the commercials, the fresh paint on the wall has finished drying, and the grass outside has stopped growing!<br/><br/>Hollywood has shown us yet again, as if we needed any more proof, that the Yanks just can't make movies as well as the Poms can. This title was originally a Michael Caine British classic of the theft movie genre with a dash of typically understated British humour, and Benny Hill in an uncharacteristic scientific role. How dare the money-grabbers in Hollywood even think that they can ""update"" such a classic with a bunch of Yankee actors and some speed boats and still maintain the quality of the original? I do not mean to take anything away from the actors themselves here; they have done the best that they could with what they were given to work with, and stars like Mr Sutherland and Miss Theron were obviously brought in as draw cards to grab the audience. They are not the issue, but it always maddens me when the Hollywood sausage-machine tries to recreate a brilliant original movie which cannot be equalled. They should leave them alone because all that ends up happening is that they reiterate just how good the original is. That is what has happened again here, and so I can only give this movie a 4 and tell you to go and grab the original Italian Job and be properly entertained, and forget this ridiculous rubbish!!"
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","1","10 August 2016"," Solid if unremarkable remake
","The Italian Job is the ill-advised Hollywood remake of the much-loved Michael Caine classic about a gold heist in Italy. Now I, like most people, really enjoyed the original film and I expected that this film wouldn't and couldn't hold a candle to it. Surprise, surprise, it doesn't, although it is a solid action film. This movie can best be thought of as a precursor to the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise as it feels very similar to those films. The dialogue is snappy and the action is fast paced, with lots of enjoyable car chases. This and the GONE IN 60 SECONDS remake would make a good double bill.<br/><br/>A word on the cast: Edward Norton is ill at ease, making a film he has no interest in, but Mark Wahlberg is a solid enough and charismatic lead. Donald Sutherland is ever the professional and Charlize Theron does well in a star-making turn. The real stand out is Jason Statham as one of the crew; he did well enough to turn his back on ensemble movies for many years, instead making a series of fun action vehicles occasionally more entertaining than this film."
"sol-","Null","0","1","27 December 2015"," Less a remake; more a homage
","More a homage to the 1969 heist caper than a true remake, the 2003 'The Italian Job' fascinatingly takes place in a universe in which the Michael Caine film exists with our heroes plotting to carry out a heist and ""do it like 'The Italian Job'"". What similarities exist between the films are entirely due to the characters here taking inspiration, and the parallels are very few, one chase sequence aside. With an essentially new plot, we are treated to better fleshed out characters. Donald Sutherland only appears briefly, but the surrogate father bond between him and Mark Wahlberg (in the Caine role) is so strong that it provides ample motivation. The chemistry between the characters sizzles more here too. There is a lot of great repartee and some genuine laugh-out-loud bits, such as Seth Green imitating Jason Statham, accent and all. More interesting as the characters may be though, the performances are not quite as good. Wahlberg is particularly ineffectual - too withdrawn and uncharismatic for the leader of his gang, and his predictable romance with Charlize Theron lacks sparks. Some of the stunt work is also a tad over-elaborate. There is an instance in which Wahlberg survives a glass window shattering in his face without any cuts or bruises. For the most part though, this is a very impressive remake, just as effective upon revision, and if it were not for a corny ending, one might even argue it as superior to the original."
"classicalsteve","6","0","1","11 August 2015"," Sort of Ocean's Eleven Meets Die Hard-- Descent Heist Flick But Nothing Special
","Ever since the brilliant remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" with Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, et al, heist films have been in vogue. There are about two or three per year since circa 2001, a few have been outstanding, most are about average, and a few are duds. They are entertaining, more or less, but sometimes they rely on too many known plot devices. Some of the exceptional ones include the first ""Ocean's Eleven"" film (not the Sinatra one), ""Inside Man"", one of the cleverest of such films, and ""The Score"" (also with Edward Norton, by the way), which keeps you guessing all the way. (If you want to see a really great heist film set in Victorian England, I suggest ""The Great Train Robbery"" with Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland produced in the 1970's.) Some average but descent fair include ""Tower Heist"", and ""The Art of the Steal"". Among the less memorable ones include both of the ""Ocean's Eleven"" sequels, ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"", and the remake of ""Fun with Dick and Jane"". The present film, ""The Italian Job"", despite a few nice moments, fits into the middle category of being marginally enjoyable but not great.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, an up-and-coming sophisticated thief who uses high tech to achieve his plundering aspirations. His mentor is older thief John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who helps him plan for a heist to lift $35 million in gold from a safe which happens to be in the hands of the Italian Mafia in Venice, Italy. Like Ocean's Eleven, they use a team of safe-crackers and embezzlers who enact the theft. Everything goes as planned, almost too easy, until after the heist is completed, everything goes wrong.<br/><br/>Without giving away what happens exactly, the thieves lose the gold, which is possibly the best part of the film, The film then focuses on about the thieves finding out where the gold resides and how to retrieve it while also getting revenge on those who stole the gold from them which was stolen originally from the Italian Mafia, who also must have stolen it from other people. They also solicit the help of Bridge's daughter, a crackerjack safe-cracker, to lift the gold. The film then uses a lot of Ocean's Eleven-type devices, describing each of the henchmen which will be involved in the heist to retrieve the gold lost from the original heist.<br/><br/>While the film has a couple of unexpected twists, particularly at the beginning, unfortunately it lapses back into tried and true formulas. There's lots of the standard car chases, some subplots and a few characters get ""offed"" for their troubles. Despite the shortcomings, Edward Norton offers a stellar performance in the clothes of one of the most ruthless characters I've ever seen him play. His performance saves the film. At the same time, I felt some of the other characters were rather flat, especially Mark Wahlberg as the Danny Ocean equivalent in ""The Italian Job"". Sometimes I find Wahlberg just a bit too humourless and rather stiff. Clooney in the first ""Oceans"" film is always playful with lots of unexpected comic relief. The film in question is a descent effort, but again the script needed more work, and the ending was a bit predictable. I was hoping for a major unexpected twist at the end, but it never happens. The film tries to be another ""Ocean's Eleven"" using its devices but little of its charm. I guess my expectations are too high."

Wahlberg is a flat front-man. Edward Norton makes for a surprising bad guy, annoying and outsmarting Croker (Wahlberg) and his team left, right and centre. The other cast members struggle due to a lackluster script and and its inability to succeed our expectations. You'll be least disappointed in this film if you get the chance to watch this before the 1969 classic."

It had a lot of great actors, especially unexpected ones, that made this a much better experience. I mean, we have Mark Wahlburg, great actor with lots of diversity. Jason Statham, which was perfectly fitting for this sort of film. He's the king of action films. Seth Green. I couldn't believe he was cast, but I loved him in this film. He added comic relief (although there was much more comedic things going on) and a sense of style that made the cast all fit together. Mos Def? That was another unexpected actor. He pushed aside what people would call 'racism' but then added his little role to add to the team. Then Edward Norton. Great actor, who played a great villain. He seemed a bit too serious about what was going on in the screen, but nevertheless he added a great part to the film. The greatest charismatic team of all time. So with all that cast going on, what more could add to the film? I love heist movies. This one adds to the list of good ones, but never competes to the classics. But the plans were clever and new, and never stopped twisting and turning with action and intensity.<br/><br/>But the film is just so forgettable. Even with the great cast, and the great action scenes, nothing makes up for it's clichéd doings.

"JamesHitchcock","5","0","2","29 November 2010"," There are remakes and then there are remakes.
","There are remakes and then there are remakes. At one extreme is Gus Van Sant's recent shot-for-shot version of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", not so much a remake as a carbon copy. At the other extreme you would have something like the Robert de Niro/Sean Penn ""We're No Angels"", officially a remake of a Humphrey Bogart comedy from the fifties but having virtually nothing in common with it beyond the title and a storyline about escaped convicts.<br/><br/>The 2003 ""Italian Job"" comes somewhere in the middle, although perhaps nearer to the ""We're No Angels"" end of the scale. Like its British namesake from 1969 it is a heist film about a bullion robbery. It keeps the names of some of the characters and part of it is set in Italy. It features a complicated plot to steal the gold involving the modern version of the Mini Cooper, a piece of product placement quite as blatant as that in the original film. The plot, however, is quite different; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous ""cliff-hanging"" ending.<br/><br/>In this version Charlie Croker and most of his gang are American rather than British, although there is one Englishman among them, played by Jason Statham. This is perhaps unsurprising; the film was, after all, made by an American studio, Paramount Pictures, although given that the original was never a great success in the States I am surprised that Hollywood showed any interest in remaking it. There are in fact two robberies featured in the film, the first taking place in Venice where Croker and his gang succeed in stealing a large amount of gold and making their getaway in speedboats in a sequence doubtless inspired by a similar one in the James Bond film ""Moonraker"". Unfortunately, one of the gang, Steve, betrays his colleagues, shooting one, John Bridger, dead and making off with the gold himself. (Bridger, older and more experienced than the rest of the gang, is the rough equivalent of his namesake played by Noel Coward in the 1969 film, although unlike that character he is not currently serving a jail sentence).<br/><br/>Croker and his surviving comrades swear to get revenge by stealing the gold back from Steve. In this they have the assistance of Bridger's beautiful daughter Stella, a character with no equivalent on the original film, which had no major female characters. Stella has inherited her father's skills as a safe cracker, although unlike him she has hitherto only used those skills for lawful purposes, using them to assist the police. Her desire for revenge on her father's murderer, however, leads her to throw her lot in with Croker. (Inevitably, the two fall in love). The rest of the film tells how the team manage to double-cross Steve, retrieve the loot and make their getaway through the streets of Los Angeles in a trio of Mini Coopers.<br/><br/>As in the original, the three cars are red, white and blue, but here no patriotic significance attaches to those colours. The original film was markedly nationalistic in tone- the message seemed to be ""We Brits may no longer have an empire, but we are still better at stealing things than Johnny Foreigner""- but, fortunately, the remake does make similarly jingoistic claims on behalf of the American criminal fraternity. Nor does it replace ""Rule Britannia"" and ""God Save the Queen"" on the soundtrack with ""America the Beautiful"" or ""The Star-Spangled Banner"".<br/><br/>Because the two films are so different in terms of plot, it is difficult trying to compare them. In the end I gave both the same average mark because I did not enjoy either very much, although I disliked them for different reasons. The 1969 version is marked by a certain amount of originality, and has two charismatic stars in Coward and Michael Caine, although I dislike the nasty xenophobia which lurks just below the surface veneer of smug patriotism.<br/><br/>The 2003 version is at least free of xenophobic tendencies (something one cannot say about all recent American films), but has little except its connection to its famous predecessor to distinguish it from a morass of similar movies. Apart from Donald Sutherland who gets killed early on, none of the cast displays any charisma, least of all Mark Wahlberg who replaces Caine as Croker. As usual, Charlize Theron looks better than she acts, and I was surprised to see Edward Norton, an actor I normally associate with more intellectual fare than this, as Steve. (Apparently he was obliged to take the part for contractual reasons). As with the original, most of the interest lies in the action sequences, especially the getaway, but overall but this is little more than a standard-issue heist movie. 5/10"

","This is one of those movies in which a car rarely starts from a standing position without burning rubber. And, as far as I could tell, there wasn't a single U turn in it. If the driver wants to reverse his direction, he (or she) simply spins it around in a sort of pivot. Not to give the driving team too much credit. The three principal cars are souped-up Mini Coopers of different colors and must be easier to pivot than, say, a greyhound bus or an earth mover.<br/><br/>There's no need to spell out plot details. A team of half a dozen or so ""professionals"" pull off a spectacular heist of some 35 million dollars in gold bullion in Venice, Italy. I believe Venice was chosen as the location because it gives the film makers a chance to shoot sizable speedboat violating all the traffic rules on the narrow canals of the city. The boats chase one another at high speed, upsetting gondolas, smashing fishing docks, shooting through the air over obstacles, sinking battleships, and whatnot. Except for the police boats that seem to run in circles, I couldn't figure out who was chasing whom or why. It hardly matters. The point is the chase per se.<br/><br/>The professionals meet on some Alpine mountain top to savor their success, with their mentor, Donald Sutherland, presiding over the proceedings. The young leader is Mark Wahlberg. Lamentably, there is a traitor in their midst, the freaky looking, mustachioed Edward Norton. He kills Sutherland and does his best to knock off everyone else.<br/><br/>But they outwit him and survive, tracking this new multimillionaire back to his sumptuous lair in Southern California, home to many sumptuous lairs. They recruit Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter and now a security expert, in their attempt to steal the gold back.<br/><br/>Norton, being nobody's fool, twigs to the arrangement and tries to foil their plan. The plan, by the way, involves a good deal of that impossible high tech stuff that appears only in movies like this. Their computer expert hijacks -- is that the word? -- hijacks the entire traffic light system of Greater Los Angeles as well as the subway system. Not only didn't I realize that these things could be hacked, I didn't even know Los Angeles now has a subway system for the little people. All of this leads to another, even more monumental chase, with the Mini Coopers zipping around on streets, sidewalks, subway tracks, and the ever-popular Los Angeles River like three cockroaches, pursued by a black helicopter and some expendable motorcycles.<br/><br/>The acting, what there is of it, isn't objectionable, except that when the good guys finally corner the villainous Edward Norton and confront him with their victory, they smirk abominably. That's the director's fault, not the actors'. And certainly not the actress's. Charlize Theron, former ballerina, is seen drilling a particularly difficult safe.

","There are movies that you absolutely MUST see before you die (Shawshank Redemption, Good Bad and Ugly, etc). There are movies that are very good, but one little factor kept them from being classics (The Bourne Trilogy). And then there are movies that you kick back and watch on Friday night. Italian Job is the latter.<br/><br/>This was a very fun movie to watch, and the action in it was very well choreographed, no doubt. This had some of the best chase scenes I think I have ever scene. The acting was good as well. How could it not be? Modern greats like Wahlberg, Theron, Statham, and others were all cast in this movie in ideal roles for their style. But the thing that keeps this movie from being something truly special is the most important element in a good film- the storyline.<br/><br/>Let's be honest. How many times have we seen movies that revolve around a group of criminals that go after someone else that in most cases double-crossed them? This storyline simply does not have anything unique in it that sets it apart from any other action/crime film.<br/><br/>Reservoir Dogs had the unique characters and unpredictable story. Godfather was sheerly epic. Italian Job was......just a fun little movie.<br/><br/>This was one of those movies. We've all seen them. They have so much potential to be something great, but they don't have anything truly original in them, and they end up becoming nothing more than a standard action flick. I'm not saying this is bad, because it's a very fun movie to watch. I'm just saying if you are looking for something special that will leave you in awe, this isn't it.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Enjoyed this wild adventure from Italy, Philadelphia, Hollywood with plenty of car chases, comedy, drama and a small amount of romance. Charlize Theron, (Stella Bridger) was the good looking gal throughout the entire picture wearing a French Twist as her hairdo and being a fantastic safe cracker. Stella took a liking to Charlie Croker, (Mark Wahlberg) put kept him at a distance because she had a great deal of revenge against a certain man who harmed her family. John Bridger, (Donald Sutherland) played the father to Stella, however, she was a very young girl at the time and he had other endeavors to keep him busy. This is a very entertaining film with a OH-6 Observation Helicopter from the Viet-Nam era chasing down Hollywood Blvd after a car and causing major traffic jams. If you like action this is a great film, but rather drawn out and the ending disappointed me, I guess the producer ran out of ideas."

","I really enjoyed the Italian Job with Michael Caine i thought it was a exciting,funny and a perfect Brit action/comedy. This one though i had mixed emotions, Maybe if i never saw the original i could give it 9 or maybe even a 10 but after only recently seeing the original i just couldn't like it as much. But i do admit that it was better than expected i will give the producers and writers a pat on the back because mainly when Hollywood remake a classic British film it is awful but this beats the average remake, I liked the cast even though i'm usually not to fond of most of them though like Mark Whalberg even though he seems like a nice guy i just think he makes to many poor choices and he same for Charlize Theron i think she's talented and very pretty i think a she has quite a long list of bad choices but i liked them both in this.<br/><br/>Overall-I found it better the than expected i taught the acting and writing were very good and the way they make the truck ""Disappear"" gives two thumps up from me.

","I liked it that the film starts off at a modern pace, establishes characters, and gets moving right away. The story unfolds at a friendly speed with a few interesting features thrown in, including meaningful dialogue between a man and a woman that is not a lame seduction scene. Sometimes, an all-star cast becomes frustrated by the inability of big stars to work unselfishly as an ensemble, but this film provides a satisfying exception and example of how it can be done right. <br/><br/>The 1969 Caine version has little to offer in the way of complications and subplots, which this update rectifies with flair, while maintaining an excellent standard in unique car chase elements. It is an action flick, however, and does play a little loose with scientific verities, such as how long a person can survive at a low body temperature."

","I was put off seeing this in the cinema when it came out as I'm a great fan of the Michael Caine original and had no wish to see a hollywoodised remake. However I caught it on TV for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised. It isn't really a remake at all, just borrows some character names and a couple of plot ideas, the minis being used as getaway cars through a computer induced traffic jam being the main one.<br/><br/>Quite frankly I think some Hollywood exec or five messed up using The Italian Job title. To my mind they'd have done much better to call it something like 'Another Italian Job', used different character names and then have the central character get the idea for the getaway because he's a movie buff and saw the original film!"

","I didn't expect much from 'The Italian Job;' and I didn't get much. But what I did get was good: an entertaining, generally well-acted action film with all the right stars. Two Academy-Award nominees, and one Academy Award-winning Charlize Theron.<br/><br/>The film starts with a heist worth $35 million. Then, of course, something goes awry. A member of the thieving team betrays everyone else by stealing the money and killing their oldest member, John Bridger. With revenge in mind, Mark Wahlberg and the gang decide to steal that money back. They manage to hire Charlize Theron to work for them (she plays Bridger's daughter, Stella).<br/><br/>So, that's the plot. You can guess what happens; good guys win, bad guys lose. What's new?

"elshikh4","6","0","2","21 September 2007"," An Old Joke ? A Rat Race ? Well, It's The American Job !
","Once upon time, there was a nice crazy movie named (The Italian Job - 1969), and it was just pure fun. As the years passed by, it became a classic, to the extent that some of its simple lines turned into the most memorable ones in the history of cinema! So why after 34 years, Hollywood would remake it?<br/><br/>Ok, consider it as one of the usual events in the 2000s, when Hollywood declared bankruptcy, or just about to, with very few original screenplays for the commercial movies. So you would have all the time: A remake of an old movie, part 2 and 3.. etc. of that remake of that old movie, sequels for another movie which have nothing to do with it except for the utilization of its popularity, and some movies that are based on previous comics, video games, TV series, American movies, or French, British or Japanese movies.. and so on and on and on. It seemed that the producers began to see ""new ideas"" as the devil, so they aimed at secure formulas from old sources!<br/><br/>With its joyful atmosphere, new third act, and unfinished ending, the original British movie was an explosive cinematic joke. And when you repeat an old joke, what you'll have is unfunny one. So maybe this Italian Job's makers realized that early; therefore, made totally another thing. But was that thing excellent as a whole? I don't think so!<br/><br/>For one reason, the pale cast, or perhaps they're good stars who were so pale in here! (Mark Wahlberg) as (Charlie Croker)?! Com'on! His face had no features to act. And who played that character before?! The honorable Mr. (Michael Caine)! Poor (Wahlberg) was in a real deadlock, especially with his icy performance as the cool (Croker) who was here cool as inanimate or lifeless! (Edward Norton) said once that he hated the part, and just made the movie to terminate his contract with the production company. You can watch him here on the brink of mocking at the traditional role and dialogue. One of these times is so obvious at the restaurant scene. And, for the love of God, aren't both of them, (Wahlberg) and (Norton), so terribly young to be those expert thieves?! Also, I felt pity for (Charlize Theron). What a fake performance she gave!<br/><br/>So nearly that entire cast was deadly cold, and by all means director (F. Gary Gray) was the responsible. However, as always, the producers thought that the good action would save the day, forgetting that it wouldn't save EVERY DAY. As if watching (Theron) doing her driving without stunt would compensate for her insipid acting!<br/><br/>There is no deep connection with the original; I should say the inspiration instead, except for the plan of stealing gold by breakdown the traffic, and escaping in mini cars. But while the script has a new ball game, with Five Samurai in heist / revenge against an evil guy, the conflict is flat. You know so well that this intolerant, less intelligent, evil guy will be vanquished easily by this confident and creative team, which cracks the movie's foundation, and weakens everything; even the general amusing feel after the viewing. Because one of the ""writing"" secrets is in the antagonist's characterization. Feeding him with more power and smartness makes the conflict more hot and attractive. But this script just didn't care about any of that!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it has some fine fun. (Seth Green) was great, stealing the show from the rest. And technically, it's dexterous; all the action is expensively done, and masterly directed, as the only perfect thing in here. But when it comes to the climax, I found myself saying: ""OK, I've seen that before, and it had a spirit too!"".<br/><br/>Well, it's an old joke trying to be a new one by adding some slight fresh things; like a different plot, or technical updating, but totally without (The Italian Job - 1969)'s surprise effect, or pristine craziness, which made it more naughty, clever and original. This time, while being fairly entertaining, it's merely another project done with no desire to be extraordinary. I though they shouldn't connect it to the 1969 movie in the first place, that wasn't for the sake of anything but fooling us, and degrading them!<br/><br/>It's like the situation between (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World - 1963) and (Rat Race - 2001), 2 years earlier. Which reminds me; when we'll witness the end of this wearisome rat race of remakes as the biggest, and feeblest, American jobs ever?!"

","Criminals are betrayed by one of their own and become set on revenge in ""The Italian Job,) a 2003 film starring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, and directed by F. Gary Gray. Gray never lets the pace up, keeping the viewer hooked all the way.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is really the best, when the thieves pull off an astounding heist of gold bullion in Venice. The scenery alone is worth the whole film. Then the action shifts to Los Angeles some time later. The thrills never really let up. It's reminiscent of ""Ocean's Eleven"" where, if you stop and think about what the criminals are doing, you realize it's completely impossible, but you go along with it because it's so clever.<br/><br/>What made the film especially interesting for me is that the story and execution really depended on the actors not at all. Someone commented that Charlize Theron was doing an Angelina Jolie role - all of the actors, while okay, were doing roles that could easily have been played by someone else. This includes Donald Sutherland's short but sympathetic role. Some films are dependent on special effects; this film is dependent on moving breathlessly from one thrilling car chase or dangerous situation to another. This was particularly true at the end, when every time it looked as if the situation was resolved, there was another roadblock to overcome.<br/><br/>I did not see the original film but will seek it out. This ""Italian Job"" is clever, with some humor thrown in, and very exciting. A highly recommended rental."

","The Italian Job is about a robbery done for money and for revenge on a man who betrayed them in an earlier robbery.<br/><br/>First off, this is a very entertaining, very cool movie. It glamorizes thievery but also shows a noble side among thieves. Charlize Theron is by far the most attractive woman ever, and in this movie she is just sizzling hot. From every angle she is a work of art.<br/><br/>One of the things about this movie that annoyed was the branding. I don't know whether the brands were deliberately there for marketing purposes or whether they were essential for the plot. At the beginning of the film we notice the divers are wearing Casio G-Shocks. One hypothesis is that the film is marketing Casio watches. The other hypothesis is that G-Shocks are normally what divers use anyway because of the brand's shock resistance. There are plenty of references made to Aston Martins, and the film probably help market many new MINIs. Of course, they're not going to use a Ford Suburban for this robbery because of the SUV's size and slowness, so the MINI was probably necessary. The MINI is an icon for many people. Even though MINI is owned by BMW many believe the MINI is a symbol of Britishness. The car's status as a cultural icon is probably what justifies its price premium, as it is about double the price of a Corolla. Probably not worth it for a small car if you were totally utilitarian, but most people don't buy cars just to get from A to B.<br/><br/>While watching The Italian Job, I kept thinking to myself how unrealistic the whole plot was. Everything was planned to perfection and only one small thing had to go wrong for everything to fail. For everything to fall into place so perfectly is like flipping a coin twenty times and getting it to land heads up every single time. The film is definitely over-the-top but that was probably what made it so entertaining in the first place."

Movies such as ""The Heist"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""The Italian Job"" are just the movies to make me forget about my despise for thieves.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays the familiar weasel role that he played in another burglary movie, ""The Score"", with Robert DeNiro. In this movie he plays Steve, a member of a gang of master thieves led by John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After the gang successfully lifts untold millions in gold from Italy, Steve double crosses them all and takes the gold for himself.<br/><br/>What makes a movie about stealing good is the creativity that the thieves use in stealing. Even though they are committing a crime, there is a certain level of appreciation for a person doing a craft well. ""The Italian Job"" was about innovative ways to do the impossible, much like the other theft movies I mentioned. The acting was acceptable from Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, and the others, but the focus was never on the actors. All of the movie's stock was in the scheme.

","The Italian Job was as greatly thought out as Charlie's detailed plans in the movie. I may not be a Roger Ebert, but I am hoping that my review is respectable in saying that it well-fit the description of a must-see movie. The Italian Job goes along the lines of action and comedy, yet a touch of romance for those type of viewers as well. I was actually amazed that such a male dominated movie did not contain any sex-oriented scenes. Without that being the point, the audience is introduced to a number of interesting and entertaining characters who have nothing in common other than a good heart, great motivation, and immense knowledge in each of his or her trade. As the movie succeeds in putting its viewers mentally in the heist with Charlie and the gang, each chase and heart-racing moment is an adrenaline rush. The Italian Job is a movie for those that admire masterminds filled with imagination and have a love for adventure. Thus allowing those who want to create diversions and act on such genius plans to be taken on that intense ride through the movie and feel accomplished. It is just that type of a movie."

One problem with movies that have as much (main) characters as this, is that of course the characters cannot be very deep or developed.<br/><br/>The money fetish is an interesting issue in these movies. But maybe it's just as good fetish as anything: People must have (or at least they very often want to have) something that gives their life some goals, excitement, hobbies...

","Although we have a couple of overrated idiot actors as stars in this promising film, I was sure that it could be made up for with the brilliance of Ed Norton. I was a little bit wrong. Although Norton is a great actor, it seems that he half-assed his way through this movie. It just seemed that he didn't put in full emotion for his character in the ways that he has always done with his previous work. So, now we have a great actor half-assing his way through a movie with a few overacting imbeciles. That doesn't look good.<br/><br/>This movie isn't great by any means, but it's not horrible. Although good acting wasn't primarily on this movie's side, it had a few intriguing scenes. Seeing these guys come up with a plan for thieving gold and following through with the robbery and getaway was really cool. The action, although rarely seen, was pretty good.<br/><br/>However, lame and overused comic relief helped bring the enjoyment factor down quite a bit. I kid you not when I tell you that Seth Green used the same joke about a hundred or so times throughout the course of the movie. It wasn't really that funny the first time, and the more I heard it, the more I wanted to burst through the wall behind me and strangle the guy sitting behind the projector for showing me such garbage. I was just like 'Okay. Yeah, you said that. Okay. Hey, you used that one already. Okay, I get it. I get it now. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Stop. No, stop. Please, Seth, stop! SETH! SETH!!! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!' Needless to say, towards the end of the movie my sanity was nearly lost because of how repetitive it was to hear the same joke over and over as if it's really supposed to be funny or something.<br/><br/>It doesn't really stop there, either. It seemed that there were more attempts at comedy than there actually were action scenes. Rarely was it actually funny. Comic relief is a necessity in any type of movie, but there are certain limits that the writer of this film was not aware of. This included lame segments like each of the characters having childhood flashbacks of them doing something mischievous and cartoonish as a kid. I felt that it just made the movie satirical.<br/><br/>If I were the director, I would have removed some of the boring, unnecessary dialogue scenes and comic relief as well as re-casted. Aside from those flaws, the movie is actually decent. It's worth your time to watch if you are interested in seeing people perform such extravagant heists. However, I think that if I'm walking through the video store in the future looking for something to watch, this movie's tag shall remain on the shelf. One time was enough for me.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

","I really dislike re-makes, I can't think of many which are any good and any which are better than the originals, so I have to admit I avoided seeing this at the cinema and rented it out with at least a partial expectation of being able to write a cutting review. I thought it would be a doubly cutting review because I could minutely (and dis-favourably) compare it to the ""original"" which I think is an excellent film.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: I thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Within minutes I realised that the film is not a ""re-make"" but a different take on a basic idea of a clever robbery using cars to make a getaway.<br/><br/>I've even got to the stage where I think I understand why it's called the Italian Job. To make the same film with a different name would lead to cries of plagiarism for the use of the basic getaway idea. Using the same name freely acknowledges the origin of the idea but lets the story be told differently.<br/><br/>So OK, enough with the theorising; Why is it a good film? Well, like the original it's fast paced, clever and witty, there are good lines for all the characters. The characters have motivation which makes their actions logical and enough emotion that you care what happens to them and want them to succeed. I think I'd have to be honest and say that I felt the relationships between the characters were more enjoyable than the original, but this is simply a reflection of the fact that Michael Caine was such a huge star that he dominated the original. Mark Wahlberg may not be the greatest actor but for the purposes of this film he works well, allowing the rest of the cast to create the idea that it is a team effort, and it's a good team, Charlize Theron is smart and good looking, Mos Def and Seth Green generate some good laughs and Jason Statham is  well he's an actor that can make a success out of ""Transporter"", yes he really does have that much presence.<br/><br/>As for the robberies? In my mind they are every bit as clever as that of the original. I found myself on the edge of my seat during both, not only that but you get two robberies not one!<br/><br/>So I'm disappointed to have to say that I enjoyed this, it may not be a ""great"" movie but it's good entertainment, it's totally different to the original (which I do feel is a better, but different film), it's out on DVD and well worth the rental and it's made me eat my words.<br/><br/>Bah Humbug."

","In The Italian Job (2003), Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and a group of robbers pull off a perfect theft of $35million in gold bricks. It was perfect...until one of their own turned against them, steals the gold for himself and shoots John (Donald Sutherland), who is like a father to Charlie and to all of them. After leaving the rest for dead, Steve leaves to go spend his fortune. One year later, Charlie has still not gotten over the death of John, so he re-assembles the team, with the help of John's daughter, Stella, to go take back the gold from Steve and get revenge. It's an awesome movie, and the final scenes bring to life some of the greatest driving stunts in Hollywood history.

I thought Norton was a badly cast choice for his role, but qué sera. There ""mos def"" was some other talent that coulda been used for that role. Seth Green's obsession with being called ""Napster"" was highly amusing. He lucked out. The fake one got shut down, lol. Charlize still felt like an outsider and her ending up with Mark just seemed like a last minute choice or an obvious choice, because they're the pretty people of the film. They had no chemistry whatsoever and them getting together was like, ""Ok...I guess..."". I like movies like this because it feeds into certain sociological theories like functionalism: everybody has a role. Movies like this are usually good, unless badly cast, because everyone gets a good amount of screen time because they're needed for the overall result. Jason Statham, hot as ever, was charming and smooth as Handsome Rob. Gotta love this cat. Mos Def really held it down as Left Ear. You could buy that he knew his way around explosives. Humans fascination with fire...lol. The action was a good pace. Made you want to be in the film and apart of the gang. The cinematography was rather lush for an action film, especially in Italy.

But with Edward Norton once again playing the betraying thief (see The Score) I kept expecting for Robert De Niro to waltz on screen. I love Edward Norton and this sort of roles really suits him. The betrayal of the group was far too predictable, as was the ending. Because honestly, that's just how betraying heist movies are!!

","I was biased to this movie from the announcement of production. I mean a film that is touted not as a remake, but as being influenced by the original and truly wonderful Italian Job, immediately struck me as another idiotic Hollywood idea. My feelings were twisted even more when I heard that the heist in the new movie was happening in LA, so what was with the title? You've pretty much guessed that at this point I thought very little of the movie, had I known Donald Sutherland was in it then some of my respect may have been won back, but I didn't.<br/><br/>In the interests of my movie reviews, I was determined to see it, after all even if it was awful it needed to be seen. So I rented the DVD and began to watch. I was surprised. To be fair Sutherland carries all of the movie he's in, and Mark Wahlberg struggles to get anything near acting while he's on screen with him, his mumbling monotone voice fumbling embarrassingly through their scenes. It's only until Sutherland is off screen that Wahlberg begins to gather some acting talent back.<br/><br/>However most of the cast still seem like they're walking through it. Even Edward Norton seems to tackle this with a half hearted gesture. To be honest there are two people who really stand out in this movie, and that's Jason Statham and, believe it or not, Seth Green. They're both lively and watchable characters. The others appear flat and emotionless.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's an enjoyable movie, in the entertainment sense it's quite fun. Some of the heist moves are set up well, and the stunts are particularly good, mainly because of the effort put in by the behind the scenes team to make them all as real as possible and try to avoid any special effects."

There are many fast-paced action sequences in a gracious plot; less commercials, especially all those Mini ads, would have made this robber's film distinguish itself from others of the same genre, but due to its engaging characters and to its light humor, it gets to be quite riveting. Mark Wahlberg demonstrates its ability in the role whereas I did find Edward Norton wasted in that role. Lastly, Charlize Theron is even more beautiful than anybody imagined she would be."

There are little things throughout the film that gives a little bit of extra spice.<br/><br/>The cast is good, having fun with their likable, albeit rather clichéd, characters. The biggest dud, however, is Wahlberg who simply can't bring any life or interesting features to the screen. A more charismatic lead would have been better.<br/><br/>At two hours, the film is a bit too long. Especially the middle part that drags on for some time without really getting anywhere. Of course, the main reason for this film being made is the car chases (or blatant product placement). If you're really in to cars doing impossible stuff at high speeds, then you'll probably like it more than me (car chases are one of the most boring things you can put in a film), although these scenes are a bit less annoying than usual.<br/><br/>The film looks great and technically there's not much to complain of. The biggest problem comes towards the end, when all that better-than-average writing is ditched in favour of stupid action and gaping plot holes. This happens in so many films that I'm starting to wonder if there's some secret organization out there, stealing the final reels of big budget films and messing them up on purpose...

","The remake of 'The Italian Job' is certainly not better than original, but it is actually a fairly easy film to watch. The original was problematic because there was no driving force to the plot- except the crime itself involving those celebrated Mini Coopers, and Caine's charismatic performance. In the remake, the plot is driven by revenge, and that works fairly well. Of course, the trademark minis are featured again and that works well in the climax! Although the location is changed from Italy to America! Mark Whalberg's Charlie Crocker is no Michael Caine's Charlie Crocker in this movie, and he doesn't really add much to it (I know Mark Whalberg has more potential than this). Donald Sutherland is short-lived as the new John Bridger. Charlize Theron is okay, and Edward Norton makes an okay villain (pity, you can tell his disinterest in the movie creeps into his performance every now and then). It was the supporting cast that actually makes this film worthwhile- Seth Green as Lyle, Jason Stratham as Handsome Rob and Mos Def as Left Ear! They all added the much needed humour and kept the story going, and were memorable support- unlike the crew in the original film which only had Crocker and Bridger as memorable faces.<br/><br/>F. Gary Gray, director of 'A Man Apart' (2003) and 'Friday' (1995), does well with the chase sequences, and the pacing of this film. Unfortunately, the main performances seem too restrained and lack conviction to make this film surpass the remake. Plot-wise, this version is better structured, but the original Crocker and the original Bridger are far more memorable. I think Gray could have aimed a little higher when remaking this movie! Purists may hate the remake, simply because it is a remake, however, 30 years later is a fairly big gap! It certainly doesn't dishonour the original like the remake of 'Get Carter' did! Like I said, not as good as the original, but easy and fun to watch! *** out of *****!"

We even get to see them enjoying their money as the end credits roll, in amusing vignettes.The good guys (and girl) triumph and the villain gets his comeuppance. But does the prospect of an horrific death really offer catharsis in a 'caper' film where car chases visibly result in nothing more than a few cuts and bruises?

Peach, the egg-headed pederast with an unhealthy penchant for the clinically obese female is a perfect counterbalance to Noel Coward's pompous and aloof Mr Bridger. <br/><br/>To prepare for the role, Hill travelled to Turin six months ahead of filming in 1969 and narrowly escaped prosecution on a number of occasions thanks to Italy's then rather lax laws on gross indecency. <br/><br/>I often wonder who would have best filled Benjamin's filthy boots in the 2003 remake: Marlon Brando?

","This is a heist movie. I am fine with heist movies but they have to be ironic (like Ocean's Eleven). After all we watch thieves and in the case of The Italian Job we watch pretty adolescent thieves taking what they do much too serious. Heist movies are to be about stealing something in a very elaborate and cool way, not about very deep emotional problems. So this film here mixes cool, state-of-the-art technological stealing and a revenge story. And Edward Norton's villain is much too mean, he destroys the ironic heist story. It is the same problem with the James Bond movies: it is pretty tasteless to see Bond tortured. Bond is supposed to be a comic strip hero, not really serious. Because if you take the characters in this movie serious you want to sink them all in prisons to teach them a lesson how to behave in the world of adults."

","I haven't seen the original film and therefore cannot compare, however, whatever was unique about that one seems to be missing, except for maybe the ending.<br/><br/>The acting is flat and uninspired - you've got Wahlberg and Theron as your stars? Yikes. (Apparently Norton made it clear this was a contract and you can tell he hates being here, which maybe helped his performance as a villain). The characters are all clichés from other heist films: explosives guy (also token black guy), computer nerd/comic relief, ""crazy"" foreign dude/driver, hot girl and way too cool hero. There is not really any character development as this is plot driven and action heavy, not that this is necessarily bad.<br/><br/>The technicals (sound, lighting, cinematography) are all great but the real winner here is the editing pumped up by a steady soundtrack. Without giving much away the best part is the ending. This film is not really memorable but it is entertaining Hollywood action and I can't say I disliked it, but it's nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>As the title implies, this is just another job for everyone involved (which explains the average acting).<br/><br/>OVERALL: 6/10.

It sure did LOOK good and had that technical polish we've come to expect of modern American chase movies.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>I don't know how to say this, but the film was like...I dunno, like a helium balloon that's four days old. It still floats, but hasn't got the happiness a fresh balloon has. And I can't really fault the director, this time; he did better than journeyman work and had some really flashy moments. And the writers...well...they didn't try to get away with all that much dumb or irritating stuff, unlike some other thrillers have tried. It's mainly the performances.<br/><br/>Oh, Donald Sutherland was letter perfect, as usual, and Seth Green can do no wrong in my eyes. But while Mark Wahlberg handled his lines well enough, he seemed like a kid. Edward Norton, who has done some powerful work in the past, seemed even more like a kid. Mos Def seemed like a kid. Charlize Theron seemed like she was only there to make sure the guys came across as straight. But not one of them had any heft or danger or threat to their actions, despite the punches and doublecrosses and threats and gunplay. Even at the end, when Edward Norton is facing his inevitable end, he seemed more peeved than anything else. The fact is, aside from Sutherland and Green -- who carried more weight when he was mimicking ""Handsome Rob"" than when Jason Statham was mimicking himself -- the most convincing performances were turned in by the Minis. And that is sad.<br/><br/>Compare this film to ""The Bourne Identity"" or even ""Speed"" and you can see how lightweight the acting in it is. That's not to say it's not a fun movie...it's just nothing more. And that's what makes it forgettable. Too bad; them Minis deserved better."

Although, according to the DVD commentary, the writers for this film didn't actually see the original before writing for this one, it really looks as if they did and made a conscious effort to improve on it. Because where the original seemed to meander and drag, this one quickly takes you into the story and continues non-stop until the finish. And while the first lacked emotional punch, the re-make added some via the seeking of revenge for death of the team's father figure. And I liked the way how the mini-cooper was introduced by allowing us to see its usefulness early on in the film so that we could understand the team's choice for it in their heist. In the first film, the mini-coopers were simply arbitrarily chosen with little reason as to why. The heist and getaway plan in this film was more intricate, clever and interesting than the one in the first. In short, this is a fast-paced, exciting and smart film. The original was just too slow and boring. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's better."

","I didn't hold high hopes when I picked up the VCDs because neither the cover nor the blurb is attractive. However the more my eyes rolls over it, the more earnest my heart grows. Now I am even tempted to see the 1969 Michael Caine production. It remains me a Hong Kong hi-tech stealing movie ""Downtown Torpedoes"".<br/><br/>The death of John Bridger causes his daughter and his ""co-workers"" to retaliate with a vengeance to cook up an international $35 million Bali dancer gold bar heist carefully. Their plan is perfect, flawless and the car racing-chasing scenes though not stunning, it's well-designed. Bravo to the safecracking skills and the building blasting skills!<br/><br/>One mis-cast is Edward Norton. He expressed that doing this project is out of responsibility but not choice. Well, this tells why his face does not match the ambiance. His face is not villain-looking, not cunning even though he wears a mustache. John Travolta, Clive Owen, Tim Roth all can replace him. Strangely, the top-notch team is too gentleman-looking, too soft, craftier faces are wanted.<br/><br/>Thank God it's a decent action film of brain-teasing game and rivalry, it doesn't reek of sex, however, it might be due to this spicy void that the box office gave a less satisfactory report, and a re-release was desired. It's a sacred formula of Hollywood movie that: ""sex it up and sell it well"".<br/><br/>If a love or sex scene is to be inserted to vacuum up more money, easy, Charlie and Stella strip, but first kick out Mark Wahlberg, put Ethane Hawke or Brad Pitt or Keanus Reeves instead. And bingo, bingo, money will come.<br/><br/>It is evident that cinematography is not the selling point, and so my beloved San Marco Piazza, Venezia water canals are portrayed as drab district, mamma mia. If cinematography is done by Giles Nuttgens, the screen vision should surely be entirely different. The beauty of this world famous scenic city will be exposed to its fullest. Nevertheless, the music team deserves kisses because the music score has compensated the visual flaw, a suspense is successfully created through out the film."

","This is clearly an action film, however, it is refreshingly different than anything before it. Without giving away the story, these characters are not children... and the film is not geared towards the teen market as so many action films are. The characters are largely the late 20s and early 30s group, they devise several unique and clever plots to steal gold from Italy and to keep it. They also drive speedy little cars.... not because they are fast, but rather because they can weave in and out of narrow spaces. A feature that is totally unique in ""chase films"".<br/><br/>The characters are also on the educated and sophisticated side.... and are clearly not ""trendy"". The score is interesting and does not rely too heavily on rock or rap music, but has a totally new ""chill"" score that lends itself to the sophistication in the tone of the film. The photography is first rate and the BIG chase scene is miraculously performed in the packed streets of Los Angeles and Hollywood with all the crowds and traffic totally intact. How they did it, is truly beyond me. A nail biter from beginning to end. This is everything ""The Fast and the Furious"" should have been, but was not. I place this on a par with ""Gone in 60 seconds"" and ""Speed"" for action, story and trills."

","I caught this on the cable TV last night, and probably would have liked it better in the theater.  It really needs to be on a big screen for good impact.  The acting is passable to very good, but these are characters we've all seen before with very little beyond stereotypes.  The whole story is telegraphed in the first half hour and the only thing to keep interest is how they'll do it.  We know they'll go after the gold and get even with Steve, but how will it be done?  That's really the only question in any of these gang retaliation type of stories.  Basically these are set up so that we have a bunch of bad guys versus a bunch of worse bad guys, so we root for the lesser bad guys.  Really typical and not at all original.  And the character of Steve by Edward Norton was more like Norton of THE HONEYMOONERS.  What an incompetent and weak-kneed crime lord.  He looked as though he could have been done in by a minimum wage security guard. Definitely in the running for the puniest criminal in film history."

I think he made big steps in the last years. The picture is superb and the direction well executed. I didn´t see the original version but this remake is very entertaining and suspenseful.

","`The Italian Job' is not based on the documentary of my favorite restaurant Pauloluigi. Hey Paulo! Free plug there! What about sponsoring my weekly movie review show? Anyway, `The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, a renegade brigand who is on a vengeance journey against a former colleague who violently betrayed him. We have experienced this plot development before numerous times, so that is why I feel they should have changed the title of this film to `The Battalion Job'.  Yes, the same old redundant premise of a protagonist seeking revenge to a former friend who is now a present foe. Charlize Theron co-stars as Stella Bridger, the safe breaker who joins up the Marky Mark `Steeler' team. Even though  it is a safe bet to say that Charlize looks hot, her work here was a dull & unchallenging one. Obviously, unlike her daring Oscar-winning performance in `Monster'. Edward Norton disappoints here as Steve, the bad boy nemesis. However, I must state that `The Italian Job' does present a marvelous exhibition of product placement. Which product you ask? As if you did not know; let's just say, we will call it: `Mini-Cooper'. These stylish transports will drive you crazy to purchase one. `The Italian Job' had plenty of pasta but was a bit cheesy.

Each scene there is something new and unique about it that was different to the last scene. Something happens that moves the plot along. Something is either said or done by one of the characters that will make you either chuckle or continue watching with interest, something that I can only praise the scriptwriters for.<br/><br/>I thought this new version of The Italian Job was well worth the money and the time spent watching it.

","Hollywood loves making movies about con artists and thieves. It's a tradition, and it sure has its own place in all the movie categories. This one seems a very typical thief movie, although I have to admit I did enjoy it. The plot is well laid out and executed, though mostly predictable. Two scenes are worth mentioning, one is the ""original"" Italian job at the opening, the way they got the gold out of the safe under water right beneath the ""job"" spot; another one is the mini coupe chasing scene. The performance of all characters (including Charlize Theron who just won Ocsar for her role in ""Monster"") are just flat, which does not bother me at all. Keep in mind that both producers and viewers are looking for FUN here, not gripping performance.

One can sense some possibilities for plot-twists but they are never realized. In addition, the actors do not make any award-winning performances. None is bad, in my opinion, but they do not make anything extra out of it either. This doesn't mean the movie is bad.

"stamper","6","0","1","14 February 2004"," This is not a remake
","Maybe it was because Michael Caine turned 70 or maybe it was because there was a remake' of The Italian Job in cinema's around the world, but halfway the August of 2003 the BBC aired this film. That gave me a somewhat unique chance to go and see this version of The Italian Job before seeing the remake', since the 1969 version was not for rent or buy anyplace I could think of. Now there were basically two reasons for me to see this film, first of all because I think Michael Caine is a good actor and second of all because it is rumored to be a classic. Well I did not find this film to be a classic. Sure the car chases were well filmed (and probably spectacular for 1969), but they didn't do much for me. Neither did any of the acting or the story. Also I found the music to be quite irritating at times (especially in the applauding scene near the ending, which dragged on and on and well you get the idea!). Nevertheless, this is not a total stinker, it just isn't anything special. If I were you I'd skip this one and see the remake', something I did a while after seeing the 1969 version.<br/><br/>
The thing with the remake' is that is actually not a remake. The only things these films have in common are the heist, the Mini's and the title. That's is. The underlying story in the 2003 is a lot better and more elaborate than the story in the 1969 version. It also leaves much more room for character development and all of that adds to the excitement of the film. Also the actors are a lot better in this film, than they were in the original. No offense to Michael Caine, but the average actor in this film, was much better than the average actor in the 1969 film of the same name, even when Edward Norton made a somewhat pale' performance. I hate to say it, but his character in this film, was about the worst I've seen him portray yet (which does not mean that he was bad though). Charlize Theron on the other hand surprised me a bit, with the depth and emotion she brought to her character.<br/><br/>
The action scenes were good as well and the heist(s) were very well planned, executed and filmed as well, but despite all of these good things I did not feel that this was a great film. It just lacked that extra edge and excitement at times. That extra edge, ironically is originality. Whereas this film succeeds in portraying a very original story and original heist(s), some of the characters missed a bit of originality, as did some of the dialog and a twist or two. In conclusion I'd have to say that the 2003 version of The Italian Job is not a classic, but definitely worth a look, since it is better than it's predecessor carrying the same name.<br/><br/>

","even though the whole idea was a played out takeoff on oceans 11, styx, and many other caper movies, with a team of thieves broken down into specialties, the explosives guy, the computer guy, the safe cracking guy, the overall brain of operations, etc, the movie itself was entertaining from start to finish and i can honestly say, that there wasn't a moment when i was bored and despite the copy catting, i enjoyed watching all the different specialists work together to show how an age old job can be pulled off by thives with 21st century technology, even though im not a movie expert and i really dont know the difference between good and bad acting, i think that edward norton, matt damon, mark walberg and company did a really good job this movie really was as good as advertised so i really reccomend it if your in the mood for a good ride."

","SPOILER! My parents were in town the last weekend of June, so we caught two movies. We saw Bruce Almighty and Italian Job.  I think we all like Italian Job more.<br/><br/>It was a good little action flick.  Even though I am sick of seeing Mark Walberg in movies, I enjoyed this movie.  It starts with a safe heist by a group of hi-tech thieves.  The group is double-crossed by a member of the team played by Edward Norton.  The team re-groups and decides it is time to take action and get back the stolen gold that should have been theirs in the first place.<br/><br/>They scope out the house make a plan to rob the person that double-crossed them.  He finds out, so they must change the plan to steal the money during transport.  The plan involves blowing out the road and dropping the armored transport onto the subway.  It is pretty ingenious and original and the movie stays fast paced with car chases.  I love the Mini's in the movie. There is a car chase in the movie motorcycles chase the Mini's throughout the bottom of the subway system, and the Mini's are later chased by helicopter in the air.  I think the next car I get will be a Mini.  I probably cannot afford the Americanized, high priced model.   I would love to get my hands on an original low priced European model, (like Mr. Bean's car).  In the end they get the gold and live out their dreams. 8/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic."

Man, what a wild ride!  This movie reminded me alot of Ocean's 11 and it creates the same effect which is to basically keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the length of the picture. This is a movie where,like Ocean's 11, you can't leave your seat for even 1 minute or you'll miss something important(trust me I did.) It is also a movie with some of the best direction and coolest soundtracks I've heard and seen in awhile. It is a movie to just lose yourself in for 2 hours-no thought on the reality of the story, no thought at all-just sit back and enjoy the ride!<br/><br/>I like heist movies and this one was incredibly well done so I liked it ALOT-I could see someone to whom this genre of movies does not appeal NOT liking it but I still thought it was great(8.5) though I still like Ocean's 11 a wee bit better.<br/><br/>The direction and cinemotography were excellent-the views of Venice and the Alps were breathtaking-and the whole feel of the pic was larger then life-I would easily recommend this movie as a rental to someone who has not seen it-Norton,Theron, all the  stars are at the top of their craft and the ending is suitably satisfying."
"MF210","5","0","1","22 November 2003"," The beginning has style, but that does not help the rest of the film
","My Rating: ** out of ****. <br/><br/>The Italian Job was one of those summer movies I did not see but I heard it was good. So tonight I decided to give it a try. The result was a mediocre movie. <br/><br/>The Italian Job opens with very stylish opening credits. It features nice cinmatography of Venice and has a clever constructed heist scene. Then it moves into snowy mountains which are also beautiful. Unfortunately, from then on it was mostly down hill. <br/><br/>After the sylish beginning, the characters come on and we have to accept them. This is something that never happens. Why? Because the characters are not likable in the slightest. You do not care if they die. As a caper movie, Oceans Eleven was much better because the characters were all likable and had some very clever dialogue. The Italian Job occasionally has some clever dialogue but it is much less successful than Ocean's Eleven.<br/><br/>
The performances do not help either. Mark Wahlberg is stiff throughout the movie.  Charlize Theron is looking beautiful and is convincing but again her character is not likable. Jason Stratham is fine, but his character is so arrogant that you can not stand him. Seth Green has his moments but hes not entirely likable either. Mos Def is good and he is pretty much the only likable character in the gang. Edward Norton is no better than ok as the villain. Donald Sutherland is good but really wasted. He is only around for a few scenes. <br/><br/>The Italian Job is too long. It really is too long when you dont like these characters. The chase scene with the minis was overlong and not exciting. Even though I was not interested in the characters I felt the movie was hard to follow. The DVD I rented did skip(only for two minutes) but I feel it was more than that. If I was a little more interested maybe I would not have noticed. <br/><br/>Overall, The Italian Job was not quite a failure. It is a good example of style over substance. It has some good moments but not enough for an hour and forty-five minute movie. If fifteen minutes were cut it could have been better."

","""Italian Job"" is a slickly made heist movie that exceeds expectations with its cleverness.<br/><br/>The movie contains a well-proportioned amount of action and comedy. It is almost self-aware that it is a remake, but doesn't worry because it knows it has a killer cast with some strongly conceived action scenes and decent dialogue to drive along the witty plot.<br/><br/>Edward Norton adds a lot to the entertainment with an oddly mixed muted yet over the top performance, while Mark Whalberg and the rest of the men in the gang fill out the movie nicely. In alot of action movies, these ""gangs"" don't work, but each actor in ""Italian Job"" performs their purpose well. Charlize Theron stands out as the daughter of Donald Sutherland, in an excellent casting choice.<br/><br/>Director F. Gary Gray knows exactly what he's doing, and in many ways, this is the movie that Bruckheimer's ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" remake should have been.<br/><br/>The verdict: a Hollywood heist movie the way it should be done."

You don't buy the 'remote control traffic lights' scam or the idiotic level of thinking Norton displays-and why is he alone like this, no retinue, no bodyguards, etc?-but for the time being as you watch the film, it's alright.<br/><br/>Best parts are the trucks falling thru the streets, the racing in the tunnels, etc. It was fun seeing the Ukrainians go after Norton too.

","This is a relatively entertaining heist movie abound with the commercial slick of Hollywood. The set pieces are suitably expensive, and the action sequences, although largely uninspired, are adequate. We don't expect great acting for a tongue-in-cheek film such as this but there are no real sparks in the interplay of the characters. The script doesn't sizzle and there really is no memorable dialogue to speak of. Edward Norton, who plays the villain, is on auto-pilot. Mark Wahlberg's performance is as charismatic as a 4 by 4 plank. The only character in the film I found entertaining was Lyle, played by Seth Green. Donald Sutherland, always a welcome sight, played little more than a cameo roleshame.<br/><br/>The final sequences with the Minis as they career around Los Angeles was a huge disappointment and a wasted opportunity to have a car chase sequence that could've been amongst the best in the annals of cinema history. It's not like the budget wasn't there, just the creative vision and inventive impetus.<br/><br/>On the plus side though the music was great. Graham Revell really injected some chic into the movie with his cool tunes. The film was expertly paced and managed to keep my interest from start to finish, but then that is the least we can hope for from the director of The Negotiator.<br/><br/>

","Well, I'm partial to the odd heist movie from time to time. You generally know what to expect, so the success of the film is measured by how much fun it is. The Italian Job certainly delivers on that account.<br/><br/>The gang's all there: the old guy on his last job, his heir apparent, the slightly shifty guy, the nerdy computer guy (Seth Green is excellent!), the muscle guy and the oddjob guy. And away we go - it's good fun watching the original heist, and then we come to the fairly predictable twist (which I won't give away here). After that, the rest of the gang obviously try to get the loot back from the traitor, with their plotting - and therefore the film - occasionally more than slightly reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven.<br/><br/>OK, the film might be played by the numbers a bit; Mark Wahlberg will forever remain Marky Mark for me, and not a leading man; the car chases are overlong if good (how much did Mini pay them?) - but the script is fast-paced, happily devoid of soppy love-scenes and basically, any film (except maybe Trapped) that is willing to devote a lot of screen time to the ever delectable Charlize Theron gets two thumbs up from me on general grounds. In short, the film does exactly what it says on the tin - it's one of the better movies I've seen this year. 7 out of 10."

The last show i watched resembling something of a heist was Out of Sight. Was it another Clooney show?<br/><br/>Hence comparing The Italian job to Out of Sight is a definite no-brainer. I was blown away by the elaborate plot, which was executed with much panache and finesse. The characters unfortunately were too one-dimensional.  This was a movie in which the plot was the star and nothing else. Maybe i make an exception for Charlize Theron!<br/><br/>Lucily there is no love scene in this movie. Lesser plots would have been saddled with sappy romance, but the director instead chooses to inundate scenes of mark wahlberg and charlize thereon with hints of sexual tension. Maybe I'm unconsciously referring to Out of Sight, but subtlety is simply more effective.<br/><br/>I rate this movie the best Hollywood action movie i've watched in a long time, having sweared off hollywood after the disastrous Bad Boyz 2. Unfortunately Edward Norton can do much better I'm sure, having seen what he had achieved in American history X, Fight Club and Red Dragon.<br/><br/>

I just knew that Edward Norton was gonna be the backstabber during the whole heist sequence because they didn't show him that much and when the crew was standing around talking about what they were gonna do with the money the camera kept shooting back to him. And he wasn't saying that much. The Mini Coopers were so cute! I think they were more the stars of the movie than the actual actors themselves. ""The Italian Job"" is one of the best heist movies. I loved all the action sequences. Especially with the helicopter scene and the part where Mark Wahlberg and his crew blew Edward's truck underground and Ed was like ""What the f--k happened to my truck!"" Sorry. I loved that part. His character was really evil. He felt absolutely no remorse for killing Donald Sutherland. I also thought the scene where Mark Wahlberg and the crew confronted Steve (Edward Norton) in the restaurant when he was on his date with Stella (Charlize Theron)was pretty slick. This was a great action movie. It was absolute fun to watch and all the actors knew how they were supposed to star in this movie. This is definitely one I'd like to own.

","This remake of the 1969 caper film (I haven't seen the original) is the kind of movie you watch on a night by yourself when nothing else is on TV.  You know you could watch better, or pop in a DVD, but since it's on you might as well see it through till it's pre-ordained climax.   If anything, it has its moments, notably from a A-list cast.<br/><br/>After a successful heist in Venice, Sutherland's character wants to call it quits, or at least take a break.

Cut ahead months later and Wahlberg and Theron decide to get back at the conniving Norton, who has his own bit of wealth in Los Angeles, and assemble the old crew.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious story, there are aspects of the Italian Job that kept me entertained, if not entirely excited or enthralled at the turns of the film. The supporting work from Green and Statham gets some laughs, and Norton delivers some fine work as well (though another heist film he co-starred in, The Score, is much better), and the action set-pieces remind the audience that Gray is a competent director.

It's way worse than a lot of the straight-to-cable Cinemax actioners.  Marky's becoming the king of remakes; not a good career move, since most remakes tend to stink like this one.

"psi_fla","Null","0","1","10 October 2003"," Job well done
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>1969's The Italian Job has earned a massive cult following among many. It's a film I hold quite a high opinion of (although personally I don't see it as a real classic), so my initial reaction to this supposed remake was that it was a `bad idea'.<br/><br/>So I guess we should be grateful that director F. Gary Gray and his talented cast have decided against religiously remaking the original. Rather, they have just borrowed the title, the minis and the basic `heist' premise. And maybe some other little details as well, if you care to look for them (such as Donald Sutherland's character sharing the same surname as Noel Coward's - but that's all the two characters really have in common). The mafia involvement and humour have been replaced by family & revenge issues, plus a few more surprises. Oh, and memorable musical numbers are pushed aside in favour of a typical modern soundtrack. <br/><br/>As was the case in the original, a gang of thieves have a `job' to do, although the main job takes place in America, not Italy. This gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg reprising the role originated by Michael Caine), Lyle (Seth Green), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Half Ear (rapper Mos Def) and Steve (Ed Norton). After a successful gold grabbing heist in Venice, the gang meet to discuss what they'll do with this money. Unfortunately, Steve has ideas of his own and suddenly turns on the gang, killing Bridger and taking the gold for himself. The rest of the gang somehow escape his clutches and set out to regain the gold with the services of Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).<br/><br/>In some ways this is a more ambitious film than the original, but that isn't necessarily a plus point. The Italian heist is a little bit dull and confusing, but the majority of the American heist (the true centrepiece of the film) provides thrills aplenty, including the most memorable car chase of recent years. Like the original, several coloured minis are involved, but the pacing is upped to another level altogether.<br/><br/>Perhaps, however, the script was written too lightly. There are some true surprises, but also many plot holes. We are thankfully spared a heavy-handed love subplot (which you nearly feel you can see coming from a mile away). Unfortunately we are not spared some trite character building scenes, but the actors do manage to make them work. A more serious issue, in my opinion anyway, is that the sound quality isn't the best. In the early stages, the average filmgoer may find it difficult to keep track of what is going on, and may just decide to go with the flow. Come to think of it, `going with the flow' might be the best idea, as the part of the film where the main plan is explained very nearly falls flat.<br/><br/>Up against Michael Caine, Mark Wahlberg does look rather inferior. Yet it must be stated that he isn't trying to follow the example of the famous British actor, and, for what it's worth, he does an above adequate job. Everyone else slides easily enough into their parts, and Charlize Theron has rarely looked better as a smart safe-cracker. <br/><br/>Much of the original's subtlety and humour has been lost at the expense of modernising the film. I wonder if this film would have been more successful had the tone been less politically correct. It sometimes feels like this version was deliberately dumbed down for teenagers. <br/><br/>Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, and luckily the 2003 Italian Job doesn't cross the line into stupidity. In fact, there are quite a few smart lines, and viewers will generally feel comfortable and involved while watching, even if the majority of this involvement is relegated to the film's second half. The action in general is handled pretty well, building up to a rewarding climax (albeit one with an overused plot device for an epilogue). <br/><br/>The new Italian Job is a satisfying enough package, even if it is full of holes. Just don't be comparing it too much to the original, because  as I stated earlier  it's not an actual remake."

However one of the group, Steve, turns on them, killing John and leaving the rest for dead.  The rest survive and one year later they find Steve selling the gold in LA.  They recruit John's daughter Stella, an expert safe cracker, in order to steal back his gold and thus get revenge.<br/><br/>While I was writing a review of the video game about a year ago I spotted that this remake was in production.  I'll admit that my initial thoughts were `sweet Jesus' and `not everything should be remade', but I was still open to seeing it and, by now, those thoughts had subsided a bit.  The film opens hesitantly and the early scenes with Charlie and John positively stutter.  After the first job the film really picks up and gets enjoyable without every really letting rip.  The downside of this is that it never really becomes a feel good spectacle in the same OTT way that the original was.  Yes, some moments are funny and the final job is quite exciting and quite clever but it isn't `fun' in the way I'd hoped.<br/><br/>Some scenes are really weak and I'm sad to say they are most of the ones that rely on Wahlberg.  His scenes (with  Theron and Sutherland) are quite dry and he fails to captivate as a leading man.  Thank God then, for a pretty good support cast.  No, I don't mean Theron, although she is used for her looks quite well, but the male cast.  The rest of the gang bring the laughs and the characters, they are not as emotionally important to the story as Charlie and are much better for it.  Statham does good work and is cool and funny, Green is as good as you'd hope he'd be  although his Napster stuff gets a bit tired after a while.  The highlight for me again was Mos Def  this is the second time in a few months he has been in a small support role but has lifted a film (Brown Sugar being the other).  All three do good jobs round the edges and help support the very iffy Wahlberg.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Edward Norton even if he was clearly slumming it a little bit.  I detected a bit of mischief in his eyes when his character is placed second after Charlie by John  ironic as Wahlberg was favoured to play Charlie over Norton who wanted the role!<br/><br/>The mini action is good as it doesn't use effects to a great effect  almost a good old fashioned car chase  but to say it compares to some of the other chases this summer is just silly.  Overall this is an enjoyable film but is weak at it's core and suffers as a result.  The film doesn't flow as freely as it should and it is only the enjoyable car chases and sterling work by the Mighty Mos et al, that lifts it to be better than the sum of it's parts. Not great but enjoyable."

","This movie which got a C+ in our paper should have got at least a B. Very well written script - right on page 30 something happened and right near the end something was resolved. Lots of clever dialogue and I especially liked the Napster angle. There were lots of ""cut to the chase"" scenes with the best one taking place in the canals of Venice. But, there is major suspension of disbelief in a few places -- just how much DOES $27 million worth of gold bars weigh? And they could FLOAT it UNDERWATER on two rafts? Or the ability to override the cable connection quickly. The last time the cable guy came to my house it took forever to figure out which one of those connections was for MY house. And flying a helicopter into a parking garage; is that in the flight manual somewhere?"

Are we now, as seems more and more evident considering the growing list of dire remakes,  to be condemed to a never ending circle of remakes that constantly repeats itself?!!!!!!!!!!

I've been a fan for F Gary Gray since Set it Off and kind of hoped he would be able to do something with the material, and it was quite imprerssive... in places.<br/><br/>I feel it would have been a better idea to make Jason Statham the gang leader and incorporate his role with Wahlberg's. Statham is quite a good (untrained) actor who can pull off a fast-talking chancer role very well (check out Lock, Stock and Snatch), so why waste him such a such small role?<br/><br/>And for all the talk of Norton's unhappiness with the project (contracts, no publicity blah blah blah) I thought he gave one of the sleaziest performances I've ever seen.

"CitizenCaine","8","0","1","19 September 2003"," A better than average film
","The Italian Job is an ultra slick crime/revenge film, which is not a remake of the original as some believe. There has been much discussion about this, but all one has to do is see the cast from the original to know that that film was more of a comedy. This film focuses on the heists themselves, the planning, and the cat and mouse anticipatory skills one needs when committing such acts. The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot. The film is still enjoyable and better than average for its type. *** of 4 stars."

","I went into this with a fond memory of the original, being the first film I ever saw and all that. And I left with that fondness still intact.<br/><br/>The Italian Job 2003 isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. The main problem has to come down to the plot or lack of it. Its too simple. There's never a moment in the film where something happens you don't expect, it's as if the writers just joined the dots to come up with their story.<br/><br/>Starting off in Venice, where a motley crew of characters in Charlie Croker, Left Ear (He's deaf in one ear) Lyle (Who swears he invented Napster) Handsome Rob, who's well handsome and John Bridger, an aging mastermind who's determined to pull of ""one last job"".<br/><br/>After an exciting and rather original Venice waterfront chase its into the Alps, except there's trouble in store. If you've seen the trailer you'll know what happens next.<br/><br/>Back to L.A. and its up to Charlie (Wahlberg) to recruit Bridger's Daughter Stella who crumbles like a biscuit and succumbs to the revenge plot of Charlie and his crew. <br/><br/>See, the plots simplistic. It tries to flesh out the story by introducing Russian gangsters and a huge Asian bloke, but really everything builds to the climatic job and subsequent escape.<br/><br/>Sure, it's cool and stylish but its really a disappointment. Apart from a cool moment where a chopper and a Mini tangle, it's textbook stuff, much like the rest of the film really.  <br/><br/>Despite all these flaws its still fun. Seth Green and Jason Statham play their parts for laughs and there's plenty of little jokes (The actor learning his lines in a L.A. traffic jam then stealing Statham's accent once he yells at him) and cool moments (At one point it looks like they'll take the Mini's into the house, maybe for the sequel.<br/><br/>Apart from the plot though, the biggest problem has to do with the script. It unravels incredibly simply and everything that could happen does happen. It's also hampered by uneasy switch from comedy to drama, one minute we have short, entertaining vignettes introducing the characters lives then the next we see Theron, all crying and vengeful. It's an uncomfortable mix and Theron plays her role way too seriously.<br/><br/>If you like heist movies, see this. If you like car chases, see this. If you like Mini's, definately see this (I want one!) but don't expect to come out of the cinema and know anything new or feel like you've watched something extraordinary. This is just a bit better than average, due to its style.<br/><br/>6/10"
"meako1973","9","0","1","17 September 2003"," A brit perspective
","People have been waiting to criticize this film since it was first announced.  Everyone ready to pounce at the opportunity to say how it is `no-where near as good as the original,' and that `the original was a classic and shouldn't be remade!'  (although when you look at the original now, it isn't really a classic!  Yes, there is THAT mini scene, and the `bloody doors' quote, but aside from that it was a slow film.  Good, but not classic.)<br/><br/>Anyway, here is the chance for all you naysayers to pounce, and then find that you are really disappointed..'cos Italian Job is a pretty good film. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say it is a damned enjoyable film!<br/><br/>The film doesn't remake the first film, and a recent interview with the director revealed that the intention was never to remake, but to homage. Indeed it does pay homage.  A bullion heist in Venice is successful, until one of the gang of thieves betrays the rest and leaves them for dead. Months later, they all seek to steal the gold back, and get their revenge.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this film so much fun (aside from the mini scenes, which I won't go into detail about, suffice to say they are 'cool') is the caliber of actors on display, and the likeability of the 'good guys' (if indeed a thief can be a good guy).  Much in the same way Oceans 11 seemed perfect in the casting, so does this.  Mark Wahlberg is the smooth mastermind behind the scams, and with Ed Norton as the bad guy, adding Seth Green, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and Donald Sutherland into the mix is pure genius.  The personalities bounce off each other well, creating a group of players that you do care about.  Norton is as good as ever, but seems to be just playing by numbers.  He has been vocal about how he didn't really want to do this film, and now I understand why.  He is an actor who likes to take on different roles..this was just a repeat of his performance in the Score.  Nontheless, still a good actor.<br/><br/>Direction is pacey, and the story keeps moving throughout, with the initial heist being a work of genius, to the introduction of the players (with amusing flashbacks), then the set up for the new heist.  Witty dialogue is scattered throughout, giving that extra character to each of the stars.<br/><br/>So, feel free to criticize this film, and compare it to the first..but make sure you watch it first before you make an ass of yourself!"

","When I heard about the remake of Get Carter, I thought it was sacrilegious for Hollywood, supposedly the movie centre of the world, to have the gall to remake such a classic instead of coming up with their own stories. Then I heard about the remake of the Italian Job, one of my favourite films. This, quite frankly, is the last straw. If Hollywood can't make up their own stories, why bother making the movies."

","`The Italian Job'  was entertaining.  The two capers were inventive and exciting and the product placement car scenes were fun.  The acting was okay.  There wasn't a whole lot you could do with the trite dialogue.  It was an action movie.  When there wasn't action on the screen the movie lagged.  Charlize Theron was sufficiently babish to sustain interest in non-action scenes.   The characters were a clichéd lot of  movie types.  The computer hacker stereotype allows for awkward plot developments to be remedied with five key strokes.    Overall the movie did its job of providing good summer entertainment.  The pace was, mostly, fast and the characters were appealing.  Worth a watch."
"jeffbertucen@hotmail.com","Null","0","2","4 September 2003"," And dont forget to book your Mini test drive in the foyer after the movie..!
","This remake of Peter Collinson's popular 1969 caper set me thinking about comparisons between the movie's star cars, the Mini Cooper S. In many ways the new film resembles the new car; bigger, better built, competent, yet utterly lacking in character, relevance or the intangible fun factor.<br/><br/>
  Despite a lively start in Venice (providing the only pretext for the film's title), The Italian Job soon showed signs of triteness and thin characterisation. Sutherland's 'Mr Bridger' was played with a sort of fluffy-haired, huggy beneficence that instantly marked him out for a predictable death. King-of-the-remakes Wahlberg once again demonstrated his brilliant future in rap music, and Charlize Theron provided an attractive, if vapid and rather anaemic love interest. Only Edward Norton's character played anything remotely like the clever criminal personalities supposedly involved.<br/><br/>  For a 'caper' film, the plot was disappointingly linear with none of the intrigue, paranoia or suspenseful setbacks one would have expected in this genre. The Ukrainian mafia was a token nod to the Italians of the original (are Italian gangsters in America thought passe by now?) yet thrown in almost as an afterthought, and serve only to provide the Norton character with his inevitable undoing. The writers obviously felt they needed a handy way of avoiding blood on the hands of our saintly anti-heroes. Even continuity errors don't seem to trouble the producers' pursuit of mediocrity - a motorcycle with rider crashes into the door of one of the Minis during the chase only to cause it no damage in the ensuing scenes.<br/><br/>  The original Italian Job had eccentricity, wit, colour, the clash of English versus Continental cultures, and above all, class. The remake is nothing but Starbucks coffee in a brightly coloured styrofoam cup. In view of the fact that similar territory has been covered recently (and so much better) anyway, by Ocean's Eleven and The Score makes me wonder why the project was even considered viable. In this age of product placement I have a sneaking suspicion that BMW may have had a hand in the funding somewhere.. 4/10"
"elu5iv3","7","0","1","25 August 2003"," Good movie, but one of Norton's lesser roles.=
","The Italian Job: 6.5/10<br/><br/>Although the concept of ""The Italian Job"" only appealed to me mildly, the inclusion of one of my favourite actors, Edward Norton, made me decide to check it out. I was reluctant even with Norton involved, as he was forced to take this role to break out of a contract. The plot is based around a theft in Venice that goes perfectly, only for one of the team members (Norton) to betray the others, killing the mentor of the lead character (played by Mark Wahlberg). Said mentor just happened to be Donald Sutherland, who was excellent and underused in the movie. The movie followed a basic plot of revenge, and was fun to watch, if not perfect. Charlize Theron was very good as the daughter of Sutherland's character, who hesitantly joins the team for revenge on Norton's character. However, Mark Wahlberg is a very ""blah"" actor, who often fails to distinguish himself and make himself worthy of a leading role. Although he wasn't bad, I felt that many others could have worked the role better. Now as for Norton's role, it was one of his worst ever. It was very run-of-the-mill by Norton, who didn't work too well as the main villain, although had his moments. Many of the things that make Norton such a great actor were missing, and you could tell this wasn't exactly a role he wanted. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching once, maybe twice for the awesome heist at the start, that is worked so well."

","I can't say I was overly looking forward to The Italian Job, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's just a sheer action film, where the thieves are not really bad because they don't use guns. They just take stuff that doesn't belong to them. Anyway, it's a fun film, with a great boat chase in Venice. And an even greater chase in L.A. involving three Mini Coopers and a helicopter! Somehow I don't think three Minis are inconspicuous, but nevertheless, it was a wild ride. BTW, watch for a snippet of Michael Caine in Alfie. Caine was in the original Italian Job in 1963."

Relying on title recognition to sell the tickets! As a film maker with more than a dozen original scripts sitting on my desk, it appears to me that originality is no longer the bye-word in Hollywood. It was Hollywood that led the world in originality. Now every movie has to cost US$50M minimum, lacks originality and is full of talentless or ill  fitting stars.

","The Italian Job is a complete film with few weak links.  The acting is superb - and by extension the casting.  Well directed, great camera work, good special effects - but the writing is what I believe set it apart and took it to the next level.  <br/><br/>The inevitable comparisons to Soderberg's ""Oceans 11"" are unfair to Italian Job in my opinion.  I felt this film was much better written, the acting was better and overall execution a cut above what Oceans 11 accomplished.  When watching the latter, I felt like it was more escapist entertainment, whereas Italian Job did a much better job of drawing me in to the story -and- entertaining me.<br/><br/>The criticisms that Wahlberg didn't have enough 'charisma' to pull off the leading male role in this film are unfounded.  If they came from the same people who gushed over Clooney in Oceans 11, then they obviously value Clooney's 'pretty boy charm' over Wahlberg's more substantive acting talent.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one, you should.  It has a much broader appeal over more audience segments than most films of its type."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","1","23 June 2003"," Follows the formula, but at least does it with style and creativity.
","Contains spoiler The first thing I heard about The Italian Job was that it had a car chase in it that was supposed to be better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. I'm not sure I would go that far, but there is no denying that there is some great action in this movie. It is, admittedly, an hour and forty minute Mini Cooper commercial, and it definitely follows the typical formula of a heist movie, but there are subtle differences that make it more than worth watching.<br/><br/>Seth Green plays the part of Lyle, who I'll just describe as exactly the same character that he played in Enemy of the State to save time, but he provides some of the most entertaining scenes in the film. The creation of the `Los Angeles' largest traffic jam ever' (although I'm SURE I've been stuck in worse than that in that place) is the movies main attraction, and Lyle creates it with suck geeky style that he makes it cool to be a computer nerd again.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Charlize Theron plays Stella Bridger, the daughter of John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), whose vicious murder provides much of the drive for the conflict of the entire film. Stella plays the beautiful blonde with a whole world of possibilities open to her because she's so intelligent and strong, and then she is sent into an emotional turmoil for most of the film. So basically exactly the same character she played in The Devil's Advocate, Reindeer Games, The Astronaut's Wife, Mighty Joe Young, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Men of Honor, 15 Minutes, etc.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland is, of course, his usual badass self, with a calm and collected cool that is rivaled only by such greats as Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. He is an actor who naturally portrays characters who have plans that go just a little beyond what is spoken aloud (except, of course, for the character he played in Backdraft). In a movie that's populated almost entirely by stereotyped characters, it's nice that at least one of the caricatures is not routine and boring.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is another caricature, but he is also not boring just because it's so much fun to watch him be p***ed off and seeking revenge. I've always thought that he had a tiny bit of a hard time playing anything other than a former-musician-turned-actor, but he definitely has his own style which fits perfectly with his role in The Italian Job.<br/><br/>And then there is Edward Norton, one of today's few young actors who promises to ultimately obtain as much skill in portraying diverse characters as people like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, who are so good at what they do that they can literally play any role in the world should the need arise. One of the only things that I was a little apprehensive about when I went to see The Italian Job was that I knew Norton was going to play the bad guy, and I have always been so staggered by his performances in movies like Primal Fear and American History X that I was a little bummed that I would have to watch him caught and probably killed in this movie (thankfully I was spared the latter, which is more than can be said of movies in similar situations, like Training Day).<br/><br/>Despite my opinion that Edward Norton's role as the bad guy was initially a little disappointing to me, it also turned out to be one of the best parts of the movie, and not only because Norton is such a spectacularly talented actor, some credit also goes to the writers in this category. As a whole, The Italian Job doesn't stray too far from the typical heist movie formula, but the thing that really makes it interesting as we're led to the ending that we always knew we would see is that the villain, Norton, is not a complete moron, as villains quite often are.<br/><br/>When the rest of the team finds him, a year after he betrayed them to steal the $35 million worth of gold that they stole together (in an opening sequence that rivals any one in any James Bond movie ever made), we get some pleasant surprises in a movie that never really promised to have many. Stella goes to his house as the cable-repair technician and ends up on a date with him, and when they're out to dinner, she doesn't easily deceive him with her beauty as long as she needs to, giving him wildly revealing death looks all the while as you would see in the typical heist movie, but he has caught on to her and tricks her into revealing her identity as well. Norton plays a villain that is aware of his surroundings, he's not reckless and ignorant and protected only by the mistakes of his pursuers, as would normally be the case.<br/><br/>This intelligence goes on into the thrilling final action sequence, where he places his gold in one of three armored trucks in order to confuse his pursuers, who he knows are watching every move he makes. I was a little disappointed that the movie took the nosedive at the end where it is explained that every character took his share of the gold and went and bought exactly what they wanted (they did everything here but include the phrase Happily Ever After), but I guess that's the price you pay for getting to have an interesting and entertaining ride to the ending that you already knew you would see. As a whole the movie is about as predictable as they come, but at least they came up with some new things along the way. Given the amount of movies of all genres these days that don't even bother to do that much, this one is a breath of fresh air."

It is great fun and I hated to see it end.<br/><br/>The only two extremely minor objections were 1) I prefer Ed Norton as a good guy. 2) The only ridiculously ridiculous issue was their parking right in front of the gate. Of course, almost everything in a movie like this is ridiculous. That's a given. But, the staking out the gate so visibly was over the line.<br/><br/>Still those are so minor that they almost are irrelevant. And, I would have given it a 9 even if Norton were a good guy and there was no gate issue.

","No one can play a slimy character as well as Edward Norton and he pulls this heist off better than ever before  he is able to make the viewer admire him and even envy him, yet be utterly happy that they are NOT him.<br/><br/>This re-make of the 1969 film of the same name with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is far superior to the original  rare in this day of endless copies and re-makes. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays the character that Michael Caine originally acted  and while Wahlberg is certainly not an actor of the same ilk as Caine is he is certainly more entertaining in this role than Mr. Caine was. He is written as intelligent, witty, charming and, even though Michael Caine epitomizes class, far more elegant and sophisticated than Mr. Caine was able to achieve in the initial film; kudos to Mr. Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is what I would want Cameron Diaz to be if I were ever lucky enough to wake up next to her  sexy, intelligent and just immoral enough to make her a truly fun romp. I totally approve.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of crooks (Mos Def, Seth Green (!), Jason Statham and a woefully brief appearance by Donald Sutherland) is just delightfully fiendish enough to completely inveigle and entice the viewer to be completely caught up in their wicked, wicked ways.<br/><br/>Whenever a film starts with a catchy and compelling opening sequence I am always wary  all too often it is a way of hiding the woefully inadequate film that is to come. Fortunately, even though `The Italian Job' started out on a high note, this time it did not let me down. It started cleverly and did not disappoint.<br/><br/>The sound track was an absolute delight  hitting all the right elemental notes in all the right places  with themes that the viewer will recognize (in all the proper spots) mixed with new music that was completely appropriate to the action on the screen.<br/><br/>Action is the key word. This was a film full of encounters and excitement  with never a slow moment or a let down.<br/><br/>The use of the Minis as get away cars was a stroke of genius  where many screen writers or directors would have used a car a la James Bond the utilization of the not-so-exciting Minis gave an enormous sense of fun and exhilaration to the chase scenes.<br/><br/>`The Italian Job' is the best time I have had at the movies so far this year and I highly recommend it to any and everyone that is looking for a good time replete with action, humour, romance and wit."

","Move over, Sharon Stone! Somebody who was once at the top of their game is now reduced to this. Yes, I'm talking to you, Charlize Theron. Of course, it isn't as bad as an amorous night with the little AOL man, but when you're second billed to MARK WAHLBERG, your career's in hock. Although when other actors such as Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham, you can look and see that it's not all bad.<br/><br/>What I'm talking about it The Italian Job, F. Gary Gray's addition to the ever-popular genre of heist movies. In fact, Gray is a big fan of these type of movies, naming Snatch the greatest heist flick ever. Unlike straight heist films like Heist, The Italian Job has humor and takes itself more humorously. Of course we don't understand everything that the computer whiz/geek Lyle says, but neither do the people in the movie, adding to the mocking tone of the movie. It's not exactly a parody of crime movies, just an homage.<br/><br/>Donald Sutherland must have been aching for a paycheck. He stars as John Bridger, an aging thief who is doing.guess.one last job! Clichès run high, but so does fun (I'll get to that later). He's with his team doing a job in Italy, and they successfully steal about $35 million. One of the team, Steve (Edward Norton) turns against them, shoots and kills John, and runs off with the gold. The rest of the crew plan to steal the gold from Steve because of revenge, including Stella, John's daughter.<br/><br/>PT Cruisers used to be the fad car, but now Mini Coopers are becoming steadily more popular. Thanks to The Italian Job, where everyone drives one, that is. The car chases weren't that many, but the culminating one was great. When three Minis were driving on the subway tracks, it was just amazing, I really loved it. Of course, there was a lot of advertising. It's basically a two-hour car commercial, with a few Pepsi adds added in.<br/><br/>However, there's an interesting note I found. Wahlberg, who plays Charlie, the ringleader, said that The Italian Job had some of the most amazing special effects he had ever seen, while Norton repeated several times that he joined this movie only because of contractual agreements. Wahlberg is most definitely not a leading man.his acting's like a log on a stream. It starts off high but then falls down. Theron, who plays a beautiful safecracker, also isn't that great of an actress. When the high point of your career is a RECENT Woody Allen film, you're in trouble. Norton, my second favorite actor, heaps on the camp, but still doesn't come off that well. Other actors, including Mos Def, Stathem, and Green, were all funny, especially Green.<br/><br/>The Italian Job is very fun and entertaining, but can't stay away from clichés. Sutherland does one last move, Norton has a moustache, Green is geeky, Theron is beautiful, there's a token African-American. Also, the ending is more predictable than, well, a Disney movie. Overall, The Italian Job is a fun two hours. If you're looking for more than that, stay away.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence and some language."

"ilovedolby","Null","0","3","7 June 2003"," `The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed, either.
","Everyone loves a good heist flick. But it's hard today to make an original one-probably the reason why some modern heist flicks have been remakes such as `The Thomas Crown Affair' and `Ocean's Eleven.' Now, we have the remake of the 1969 film, `The Italian Job.' It's easy to conclude that the main reason Hollywood remakes older films is because they are just trying to cash in on a dead movie. However, if they can do it as good as the original or better, than perhaps that does warrant remaking a motion picture. `The Italian Job,' from director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') was a good film, but its one problem may rest in the fact that heist flicks are becoming less intriguing and more of cliché. 	`The Italian Job' is the story of a group of thieves who while trying to steal gold in Venice are betrayed by one of their members, Steve (Edward Nortin), who kills their boss, John (Donald Sutherland), and takes the gold from the group of thieves. After a period of time, the friends regroup under the leadership of one of the members who felt that John was like a father to him, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg). Under new guidance, they try to steal back the gold from Steve. But they can't do it alone-they need the help of John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron). The film moves towards a revenge scenario, as the group not only tries to get the gold back, but also avenge the death of John. 	`The Italian Job' has its moments that require a person to suspend disbelief. For example, in the scene where Steve betrays the others, their van crashes off of a bridge and they fall into a frozen mountain lake, as Steve peppers the icy water with bullets. It's amusing that, with the exception of John, all the men survive the frozen water. After they come out of the water, they even have time to grieve a bit over the death of John, regardless of the cold temperatures and that they are still wearing their soaking wet clothes. 	The film was well made, though. Director Gray did a good job with making some suspenseful moments during a chase scene between a helicopter and three Mini cars. The movie also has its humorous moments, the best of which involve Seth Green who plays Lyle. According to Lyle, he invented the Napster music-sharing phenomenon while his roommate in college, Shawn Fanning, stole the disc with the program on it while Lyle was sleeping. Hence the reason while Lyle refers to himself as the original Napster.<br/><br/>	 Although `The Italian Job' was a good movie that was fun at times, it just didn't feel all that enthralling. The reason rests in the notions that heist films, or confidence scheme movies are becoming more of a cliché where we can predict everything before it happens. Also, the trailers for this film just ruined any surprises that the audience could take away from the film. It would be wiser to download the two and a half-minute trailer online than to pay full theatrical prices to sit through the two-hour movie. However, if you have the time and ambition to do so, `The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed either. ***"

","Warning: teeny-tiny little spoilers!<br/><br/>It's nice to know that every once in awhile, Hollywood puts a little effort into making a good movie. Sure, they don't always make it, but effort counts for a lot.<br/><br/>Take `The Italian Job' for example, a remake of the 1969 film. Effort was put forth to give us a little bit of everything in the hopes that it all added up to a great movie, and they did their best to make the pieces work together. They even got around to following a half-decent plot, even though they had to go all the way back to 1969 to dig one up.<br/><br/>`The Italian Job' is about a group of nice-guy thieves who steal $32 Million worth of gold from a nameless place in Venice, Italy. One clever caper and a boat chase later, and our boys are on their way. Of course, 'Steve' (Edward Norton) betrays them, takes the gold for himself, and tries to kill the rest of the group. Unfortunately for him, he only manages to kill the most loveable father-figurely (yes I know its not a real word) character, inciting the rest of the group to hunt Steve down a year later in Los Angeles and try to steal his gold just to annoy him.<br/><br/>Mix all of this in with a love interest (Stella Bridger), the all-American hero/thief (Mark Whalberg), the gigolo car-guy (Jason Statham), the computer geek loser (Seth Green), the token black guy (Mos Def), some explosions, some car chases, and some Minis, and you have `The Italian Job'.<br/><br/>So, does it all add up?<br/><br/>The answer is a definite resounding `sort of'!<br/><br/>The movie was fun to watch, it's worth going to the theatre for, and it will be a fun rental. That having been said, I'm not buying myself a copy. While the acting was good, the action was good, and even the plot was good, none of it was great.<br/><br/>I'm saying this for a pretty simple reason: international thieves probably aren't all a bunch of super nice people. Trying to portray it any other way means that the actors have to portray slightly unrealistic characters (Oh I don't want to see Steve dead, I just want to see the look on his face!), the plot gets a little watered down to accommodate that (Our plan is simple: we'll wing it!), and the action sequences are limited to scenes where nobody gets hurt (Ok folks, in this scene you drive down the sidewalk, down the stairs, along the subway platform and then in front of the train. Don't hit anybody.).<br/><br/>So basically, it makes for a movie that has it all, and ends up just ok.<br/><br/>If it helps you make up your mind about whether to see it, Edward Norton made it clear he only agreed to do the movie because of contractual obligations. That can be good or bad, depending on how you feel about Edward Norton.<br/><br/>3.5 of 5 Wuffies. Nice try guys, see you next summer."
"thomasdosborneii","Null","0","1","6 June 2003"," A Great Heist Movie
","I really do like heist movies and this one was no disappointment--in fact, it's essentially three heists for the price of one, and they were jam-packed with style and clever energy.  I'm glad I hadn't seen the trailer until afterwards (which I saw on this site), I think it gives too much of the good stuff away--so please, skip the trailer and just go see the movie! I saw the movie based on its Venice location, but I ended up liking even better the L.A. location, thanks to clever use of such features as the Metro, the empty concrete river, and the killer traffic.  If, along with the new GPS systems, cars offered a small handful of us a device like what ""The Napster"" put together, L.A. really would be a paradise!<br/><br/>There was great chemistry and humor among the interesting and sometimes peculiar characters.  I guess Seth Green was probably the best (everytime the word ""Napster"" was spoken, the audience in the theater laughed, clapped, or cheered), but Mark Wahlberg was effective, as always, Charlize Theron, well, she just looks good and acts with such style, and I had a particular liking for Mos Def's character (although I half expected him to break out in a cockney accent like Don Cheadle's character in ""Ocean's 11""!  Fortunately, he didn't).  Also, I really happened to like a lot the golf-practicing explosives supplier, what a unique character and you know what, this is L.A. and we've really got people like you've never seen before!<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was great fun, a kick to watch, and a great advertisement for Mini Coopers.

Roughly a year later—with the help of an accomplished safe cracker—they track him down in Los Angeles and attempt to settle the score.

The plot was incredible, the characters were dynamic, and the movie combined just the right amounts of humor, action, suspense, and Charlize Theron. Mark Wahlberg, although wooden at times, was good as the leader; Edward Norton made for a fairly passable bad guy (gay mustache included); Jason Statham was great as Handsome Rob (the scene explaining his past is especially entertaining); Seth Green and Mos Def were constantly getting laughs out of the crowd; and Charlize Theron was rediculously hot.  The best part of the movie undoubtedly was the car chase involving three Mini Coopers and a helicopter.  Whoa.

","I haven't yet read all the other comments for this movie, but I find it hard to believe that people could see it as a fantastic movie.  This is one of the silliest films I have seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON<br/><br/>This movie starts off fine, the opening sequence is interesting and action packed.  From there, however, it drifts into a silly Mission Impossible wannabe sort of atmosphere, with way too much fast paced techno music and way too little plot.  After the opening sequence, it is as though the next 30 minutes were completely unnecessary, as all those plans were thrown out the window and a new plan developed?  This seems a bit silly to me.  The final sequence is then very similar to the opening one in that they use nearly the same methods...not very creative.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is very average, if not below average.  Theron is surprisingly decent.  Seth Green is very good, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Norton is good but not great in a limited role.  Searching for positives, this is a fun and fast paced thrill ride, if those sort of things make your say.  The story, however, is contrived and silly, and too much of the obvious ends up taking place with Wahlberg and Theron.<br/><br/>I give it 4/10"

","THE ITALIAN JOB is a good entertainment.  You won't learn any deep truths about the human condition, you won't really see any oscar winning performances, but you will be entertained.  Which really is what most movies should try to do.<br/><br/>Okay, I've never seen the original Michael Caine ITALIAN JOB (I keep missing it on BBCAmerica), so I cannot compare the two.  What I can compare it to are recent heist flicks, like CONFIDENCE, THE HEIST, THE SCORE, the OCEANS ELEVEN remake, and (as my Dad pointed out) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.   It compares quite favorably.  You know the gang is going to get screwed by a confederate (thanks to the trailer, grrrr!) and that they are going to get their revenge.  The fun is watching how the intricate plot they plan is going to be carried out.  And the greater fun is watching how, when the first plan falls through, they improvise the second plan.<br/><br/>I am especially impressed that the film is a true heist flick, like THE SCORE and THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, rather than a shoot-em-up like THE HEIST. When John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) says ""We pulled it off without drawing a single gun"", he sets the ground rules for the gang's later revenge plan.  Any dumb crook can shoot people; it takes brains to pull off a nonviolent heist.<br/><br/>One interesting little cameo-by-proxy.  Watch closely when Steve Frezelli (Ed Norton) turns on his giant TV.  The image on the screen is a closeup of Michael Caine (I'm assuming from the original ITALIAN JOB)."

His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves.  The director left no stone unturned.

Definitely never saw the original(don't like Michael Caine or Benny Hill),but doubt I would have enjoyed it from what has been described, Think of it as a new film, just some same charecter names.

Pretty clever indeed.  A clone of Ocean's Eleven in too many ways to mention.  There were some middle school teen boys in the crowded theater who apparently never saw a caper movie.  At first they annoyed me, but it ended up being almost as much fun watching them enjoy themselves as watching the movie.  I give it 9 out of 10.  (P.S. My eyes might have deceived me, but I'm almost sure I saw Spider Man in the crowd dashing to get out of the way of those Minis.)"

","My whole family went and enjoyed it enormously.  It was a great action film, and all of the stars shine.  Donald Sutherland is always a great character actor.  Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron were great together. And, well she was sort of perfect by herself.  Seth Green was brilliant.  We will definitely be seeing more movies with him.  Jason Stathem should have more headliners like the Transporter.  The rest of the cast was great as well. An enjoyable way to spent 2 hours."

","Just a wonderful movie, lots of action, suspense, twists and turns and scams and stings. The star of the movie is the MINI MINOR automobile. Simply brilliant writing and Charlize, what more can you ask for. Wahlberg was terrific as was the entire supporting cast. A must see movie. You certainly get your monies worth and that is all you can ask for. The critics again are morons. One person's opinion...don't miss."

","Poor cinematography, terrible script, and bad casting are the lowest points of this average heist flick. Wahlberg--a capable actor--and the rest of the cast are not able to flesh out the flat, lifeless characters they are given."

","My son Greg gave me the deluxe Widescreen Edition DVD of 'The Italian Job.' Until I watched the extras after seeing the movie, I didn't know that an original movie of this same title was made in the 1960s. However, it was more of a comedy, and the new version is quite different. The movie starts with a job in Italy, followed by a double-cross, followed by a heist of the loot in Los Angeles. Very creative, very exciting. No lasting value, but an entertaining way to spend almost 2 hours, for Charlize Theron, if nothing else! The DVD is a very nice one, especially for those who enjoy seeing various 'making of' extras.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, stop reading, OK!?<br/><br/>The first heist in Venice has them creating several blasts that allow a safe with gold to fall through several floors and into the water, where the gold was extracted while a boat chase with fake safe was used as a decoy. Edward Norton plays the group member who double-crosses the others at an Austrian pass, wants the $35Million in gold bars all for himself, kills Donald Sutherland, but the others get away by driving off the bridge into the frozen lake and using breathing gear. They track the gold to L.A. where they enlist Sutherland's daughter (Theron) a legal safecracker to help them. Wise to the plot, Norton arranges three armored trucks to leave his house, one with gold, which they figure by remote measuring of rear tire compression, take control of L.A. traffic lights, cause the truck to go a certain route, a blast causes the truck to fall into the train tunnel, where with the help of red, white, and blue Cooper Minis they get the gold to a freight car and leave town, Norton is taken away by Russian friends for 'disposal.'"
"gregsrants","7","0","1","29 December 2003"," Good movie - Too bad Mark Wahlberg was so distracting
","There is a scene at the beginning of The Italian Job that let me know I was seeing something different from the average action, heist caper. During the opening chase sequence, a boat goes flying in the air and lands aground without exploding into a great ball of Hollywood pyrotechnic fire. This may seem obscure or insignificant to most, but after viewing such biennial action films as Bad Boys II and Terminator 3 this past year, where everything including a kitchen sink was blown to pieces, it was refreshing to see an explosive opportunity passed on by such a young up-coming director. <br/><br/>That director by the way is hit and miss F. Gary Grey who had success in 1996 and 1998 with Set It Off and The Negotiator, but came back to earth pretty hard with the gawd-awful Vin Disel vehicle, A Man Apart in 2002. To his credit, the fact that Paramount would hand the reins to such a young director to bring to the screen a remake of a Michael Caine 1969 film that is still revered by many today, is an indication of the talent he must contain. And the result, is a fun heist yarn that gives you your monies worth for two hours. <br/><br/>The similarities to the original film are minimal. Mark Wahlberg takes over the role by Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, a thief who has assembled a team to help steal a shipment of gold stolen from them years earlier. The assembled crew all come with new cool 21st century names and talents. Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is the daughter of former slain crewmember John Bridger and is an expert at cracking safes. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the getaway driver, Lyle (Seth Green) is the computer expert and Left Ear (Mos Def) is the explosives expert that got his name due to a botched explosion in his youth. Together, they conspire against Steve (played by Edward Norton) who assisted in the original heist then turned on his team and confiscated the gold leaving the others for dead in the frozen waters of the Italian mountains. <br/><br/>As caper films go, The Italian Job zips along at a fast pace and keeps us entertained with its thought process on how to pull of the perfect crime. In homage to the original, there is an extended chase scene by three mini-Coopers through the Los Angeles subway system and into rush hour traffic that might not make the best of list that contains such classics as Bullit and To Live and Die in L.A., but does offer an entertainment value of exceeded expectations. All this culminates in a concluding chapter that is both enjoyable if not foreseen. <br/><br/>The Italian Job's biggest drawback however is the incredible cardboard acting of its lead, Mark Wahlberg. Consistently the weakest link in better than average films (Three Kings, Boogie Nights), Mark falls this side of Ben Affleck as one of the worst actors that get plumb roles in new-Hollywood. On subsequent viewings of his filmography, I can't help but think of the lack of talent presently being exploited on screen to moderate success. Ashton Kutcher, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just three more examples of why we still stand in line to see Jack Nicholson play himself over and over again in films like Something's Gotta Give. <br/><br/>But I digress. The review in hand is The Italian Job and despite its inferior lead actor, the movie does deliver on many levels and if it's domestic box office is any indication (over $100 million), audiences tend to agree. Thumbs up."
