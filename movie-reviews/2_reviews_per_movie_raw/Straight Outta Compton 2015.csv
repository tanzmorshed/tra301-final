"Dan1863Sickles","10","1180","1834","23 August 2015"," Something Fishy Is Going On Here!
","I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with ""negative"" marks, earning scores of ""1 out of 15"" likes.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. <br/><br/>Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!<br/><br/>There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.<br/><br/>I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. <br/><br/>I've got enough already."
"andreasi-15287","9","60","94","4 December 2016"," A great movie
","When reading other reviews about this movie, I really get frustrated due to the lack of understanding about what this movie is really about. A lot of empty reviews only giving 1 star due to ""explicit sexual content, and black men who does not respect the law"". <br/><br/>What people does not seem to understand is that this is a movie about the rise, and fall of the biggest rap group ever, how they evolved and what power, money, and fame can to a man (and in this case, his relationship to his friends). As much as anything, this movie really is a lot about the abuse that a lot of black males experienced from the police in the 80's (which is still a very relevant topic).<br/><br/>Personally I am a big fan of N.W.A, without that being the reason I am rating this movie 9/10. It is a really interesting true story about some of THE great rap artists of our generation. Great performances by actors who looks a lot like the original group, as well as Paul Giamatti. Great directing, the movie has a really nice action curve, keeping things interesting throughout the movie, and really gives the public a good insight of the life of some of the biggest stars in the world during the 80's/90's. <br/><br/>This is the first time i have ever written an review on IMDb, even though I have a lot of strong opinions about movies, but I really had to come to this movies defence. This is one of those movies I am really expecting to see a 8,3 star rating or something similar, and it really frustrates me to see a lot of people giving this movie unnecessary hate. GREAT MOVIE, if you like N.W.A, it is really worth your while, and if you are not, it is still worth a watch just because of the really intriguing true story that ""Straight Out Of Compton"" is.<br/><br/>9/10 movie<br/><br/>11/10 will watch again"
"nianikaila","10","72","127","25 August 2015"," Don't Listen to the 1 Star Reviews
","Everyone one here who complains about the movie don't know what they're talking about. This movie is reality! Police brutality, growing up in the hood, the extravagant lifestyle of singers/rappers is all there. Someone complained about this being vulgar and not appropriate for kids? No duh, it's rated R. Even though it was a long movie, I didn't want it to end. You really felt what was going on in the movie. When they were angry, you were angry. When they were sad, you couldn't help but to feel that as well. Don't listen to the people complaining, and calling them ""selfish"". They're probably just upset at how the police were portrayed, which was the reality for N.W.A. The movie is amazing. Watch it. This movie was extremely enjoyable, and despite the length, it felt like it went by in the blink of an eye."
"duaneincali","10","41","74","6 July 2016"," excellent movie
","First of all, I am a white man, 58 years old. opinions will always vary on quality of movies, but I am shocked at many of the comments/reviews I've seen for soc (straight outta Compton). To say one needs to know ebonics and ridiculous things such as that........is racist. I was shocked at how good the acting was. Oshea Jackson was the weak link in my opinion; but paul giamatti, and the guy who portrayed easy-e were amazing. I was prepared for a typical bio (especially music bios) where the story is way ahead of the acting. Guy playing dre was excellent as well. So I was pleasantly surprised. This is an outstanding movie. One need not have knowledge of the hip hop culture/industry, any more than one needs to know about southern America to watch and appreciate steel magnolias or fried green tomatoes (ok,, I'm dating myself here). I don't like the sound of u.s. southern accents, but that doesn't mean those flicks are not great. So please. To the point that many like to mention about the vulgarity: it was real life depiction! movies about 1600 England have a certain dialect. Same with this. people in different parts of the u.s. speak very differently. This should not be a drawback, but rather a very realistic telling of what happened. Open your minds, not everything is Ellen and Seinfeld. I have lived in l.a. since 1982 and I found it to be very interesting on many levels. Great writing, directing and acting. If it is very very odd for you, then perhaps you'll learn something watching it. I highly recommend this film."
"mhikmetaltug","8","83","167","20 September 2015"," Rhymes of The Ghetto
","""Straight Outta Compton"" has the similar taste of the other Music business,Wall Street business and the merchandise business movies which could easily satisfy and inspire the young audience to live their Katharsis of being a successful man or woman in the future, like the depicted successful people in these biographical genre movies. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street ). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell. Especially to young needy teenagers and young people eager to try everything to break the societies pressures and taboos.<br/><br/>The expectation on the box office is important of course. ""Straight Outta Compton"" will possibly gain the success on box office.But some effectiveness' can make the audience feel uncomfortable about watching it again or remember it as their one of all time favorite classic. At least I will criticize the defectiveness that I have determined after I watched the movie until the end.<br/><br/>The Subject of the biographic approach of Rap All-Stars is a perfect and unique idea. The originality can't be questioned. However the catharsis that I have mentioned before could not work for all cinema audience, I found the directing, acting and narration superficial.This was not the first biographical movie that has disappointed me with its narration and process of progression. And I think that won't be the last for sure.That's another argument.The main point is some biographies made by commercial concerns and cosmetic structure, harms them sometimes.This is the Rap Music's fathers' story,the action scenes could be more efficient on the contrary of matching some action b-movies, the classical and vigilant music agent profile played by Paul Giamatti, gave me the feeling of the same type which I ran across in other Music based movies.The actors who play the role of The Rap creators are good. The lack of the Katharsis begins with their shallow depiction, so that I definitely think that Dre or Ice Cube or Eazy E's lives depiction with other characters and crowded casting had created that mess and caused the defectiveness. Because almost 2 and a half hour movie isn't enough to depict the whole family of rap's beginning and the depiction of separate lives of them could make a better order in the narration. Linked to that criticism of the shallow narration, the documentary trace additions which would be a good idea on a biographical Movie, was used ineffectively in my opinion. For Example The Rap's born documentary series on VH1 would be watchable for all kinds of documentary lovers, so I believe that in the movie this magazine coverage documentary style is used by showing the social struggles of the Rapper's since their youth, the police's tough attitudes to the Black Citizens in their Neighbourhoods and putting the actual footage of the fights and plundering in the ghettos. However the idea of Half magazine and half crime narrated documentary style using in a movie, is very hard job and I realized that some parts were good adopted from this kind of E! or VH1 documentaries but some parts seemed weak because of several things that make the distinction between Documentary Movie and Cinema Movie, which would cause dead ends on the narration of Cinema Movie.<br/><br/>For instance the lack of voice narration as a result of the director's obligation of staying out of magazine words, the time-lapse difference between a documentary and a movie,the slow timing usage to tell the story in the movie on the contrary of a rushing biographical documentary and doing it with telling the audience the story of at least 5-6 rap stars in such a slow occasion, had killed the spirit of the ""Magazine-Documentary- Biography"" triplet style depiction. But I still believe that ""Straight Outta Compton"" could easily be the first and unique example of the future styles of direction and maybe could create a new unique genre as well."

","Their stories are told well, vivid and emotional. It helps fill in the blanks if you remember this time period on what really happened.<br/><br/>I laughed I cried and sang along. It was a beautiful piece of art. Loved the quality of acting definitely Oscar worthy!<br/><br/>The movie did a great job putting their songs and feelings into context with the political climate as well as the internal struggles that they had as a group.<br/><br/>I have much more respect for these guys because they have definitely come a long way merely by believing in themselves and standing up for their dreams and the social causes that they believed in.<br/><br/>Although I am not from Compton (Oakland), I love how they portrayed both the good and the bad within the city and showed how Compton and cities like it tend to not be like other places and therefore cannot be judged as such.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to see this movie again this weekend (opening weekend) so that my dollars count even more.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling misty thinking about Eazy and his family and what this movie really means to his memory. My heart was overjoyed because the truth is out about them and I think audiences today will be able to reflect on the criticism of that time with new and different eyes knowing all that is taking place in our world today.<br/><br/>This movie is coming out at the best time and I think that so many people will be able to relate to fighting for the underdog, voicing the untold story, and achieving more than you could ever dream possible. Love Love Love it."
"Julian2209","2","249","596","23 August 2015"," The beginning of the mess....straight back to Compton!!
","...I had to watch the movie since I actually liked at the time some of the music of NWA, especially the title track of the movie. Yet what happened after-wards, after their success, is just a sell out to make a bunch of money with no more attitude than all the others. <br/><br/>And now the movie and it would deserve just one star, yet the music brings back some memories when things could have been changed in a different way than they wanted to. Look at them now, nowadays...thats all that there is to say about the characters of the movie. <br/><br/>The acting is typical for the gang banging crowds nowadays and so it can be seen on every street-corner in major cities and is nothing special and that I mean not in a good way. If that was meant to change things, well Sirs, screw you! The story itself, well I do not know what is true and what is not, but like stated above, in the end it came to make more money than others. What they have changed is just that violence and negativity can bring success, that youths of today look up to them what they could do and want to do as well...THAT is what they have changed and just because Compton is nowadays almost everywhere, does not make this a success in changes, but a success in stupidity. And so it does not matter to me if you become legit than after-wards and make movies about your awful youth and how you can succeed and then make funny movies, like Ice Cube....<br/><br/>So what remains is the music...there was once a dream of a few guys who wanted to change something, what they have changed is to have today an attitude, which became wide spread, for the big buck. Nothing wrong with it, yet don't be surprised when you get now the attitude that you spread and so...please straight BACK to Compton and please try again! <br/><br/>For former NWA fans a must, for people who love the attitude nowadays a must, for normalos who aren't impressed but rather appalled by the success of a negative attitude and the real change they created, a no show!"

It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film.<br/><br/>Alas what a boring film!.<br/><br/>From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me.<br/><br/>Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult.<br/><br/>What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels .<br/><br/>Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money."
"Monkey-Character","3","192","455","1 September 2015"," Hip Hop fans will like this
","I'll come clean and say that I generally liked this film because I love hip hop; particularly from the late 80's through to the late 90's. I was interested in the character portrayal, the music was great and as a hip hop fan it was interesting.<br/><br/>However ...<br/><br/>Honestly, as a film it was pretty bad really. The acting is terrible, it's an hour too long and I find it a bit weird that Cube and Dre are bigging themselves up massively and they are the producers. I can't imagine that anyone that does not like hip hop would even begin to like this film in the slightest. It's very boring towards the end and it's just a series of really weird scenes all cut together.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's doing so well with the critics, but I expect that the timing is great with Dre's new album and the Apple Music stuff. Either way, if you like hip hop you'll like this for a lot of reasons. If you don't, this is likely to be the worse film you'll ever see!"

","I really tried to look at this movie with an open mind although this type of movie isn't really my cup of tea anyway so to speak. It was awful to say the least with no cohesive plot whatsoever! It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the ""thug"" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on ""Hip Hop"" culture. Just not a good movie in any way, shape, or form. Do not go see! If you want to see a great movie with an African American cast that is uplifting and shows what is admirable about our great society then go see ""War Room""!!"

","I'm no fan of the police, and I know first hand that police officers can be nasty and abuse their power, but the way ""Straight Outta Compton"" portrays the LAPD is about as realistic as an X-Men villain. Oh the big bad police keep picking on these low-lifes who make money off exploiting their own people and promoting the spread of violence within black communities... I like NWA, and I liked them all as solo artists, so believe me when I say that this isn't an indictment on their musical talent, but still this movie really annoyed me less than halfway into it. As I've gotten older, I've learned how to think a little more critically.<br/><br/>NWA should not be glorified, those who control our society want you to put these idiots on a pedestal, but don't do it! NWA was not some rebellious voice that black people could rally around in an effort to improve their lives... No, it was the opposite of that... NWA and gangster rap in general is there to KEEP YOU ON THE PLANTATION!

This isn't how music should be this genre is so poisoned and tainted it shouldn't of been funded it was unbearable. Would it of been so hard to have some positive people in it positive lyrics. Not that their life stories aren't bad or respected it's just the movie was all about rewarding ignorance I feel like anyone that watched this has been tainted it's not the cast, I respect some of the cast it just put the wrong message out to people especially the ones underage that will watch this. The swearing, drugs and violence were a huge impact on this and now more teens will do it monkey see monkey do.

","I should first clarify that while I'm no fan of rap music, I can appreciate any solid movie about a musical group.<br/><br/>That all said, the movie was horribly flawed. Movies in which the antiheros can be liked are indicators that a movie may be quality. This was no such film. The main characters were simply not likable, yet we're supposed to sympathize with their supposed ""peril and hardship."" Once they achieve the fame they were oh so desperate for, they become aggressive and egotistical.<br/><br/>However, I can excuse that, since there are far worse problems with the film. The plot has no direction whatsoever. It's a series of mild hardships, followed by some success, followed by an ""authority figure out to get them."" Then you just rinse and repeat. An hour into the movie, I was wondering if my hair was graying. This was my largest problem with the movie, along with a distinct lack of chemistry between any of the main leads.<br/><br/>The movie had a weak plot, weak characters, among much else. Granted, I laughed a few times in the film, and found Easy-E tolerable. For those few good things in the movie, I'll give it a 2 out of 10. It's overrated, don't bother."

The best bits are of the band shaping their first album. The rest should be read in books and preferably forgotten. It's not hard to see why Ice Cube went on to surpass what Dre did later, even on his first solo album. I wish one would hear more dissing of Dre courtesy of Eazy-E, buuut--Eazy's dead, so Dre's words take precedence, I guess.

","First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree."

I think there was too much Cube influence and the sad thing is that Cubes son played the part exceptionally well and was the most believable performance. I think N.W.A and Eazy's story differ perhaps from the perspective of cube and Dre. There wasn't much about MC Ren in the movie and being a fan of M C Ren and Eazy, I found hat disappointing. Dre's role was played well and Dre was the realest in contributing towards the truth in the writing of the story. All in all we want Eazy-e movie on it's own and this time man the f**k up and let em know he gave you your success. They made him look younger than the rest in the movie and he was the eldest.

","This is a typical movie that glorifies one party and demonizes another. There are three sides of the story: party A, party B, and the truth. Cops had just as much reason to target young black men as young black men had reason to target innocent people in the streets. The thing that should not be glorified encouraged in young people who are inspired by this film is the terrible attitudes and general lack of respect for anyone. Aside from the dominating racial theme of this movie, the truth of the events that took place is stretched to put it lightly. Fact checking any number of the scenes that were portrayed will lead you to see that the facts were warped in order to convey the story that they wanted rather than the truth. Along with the fictitious plot-line, the acting is cheesy and not believable. There is no stand out performance and one can expect that, as this is many of these young actors' first big time film.

","I cannot stress how disappointed I was with this movie. I expected a powerful, raw and real view into the true story of the revolution of hip hop/rap. I was quite young when all of this actually occurred but (growing up in the 90's) music was evolving in new and significant ways that was truly exciting. As far as the stories behind the music we were left with what little we heard on MTV news, read in the few gossip columns of magazines and word of mouth. That's why I was eager to see this movie. With social media now we know every step everyone takes-and they are aware of that-so I was looking forward to seeing a depiction of a time before that. A behind the scenes look at what really went on when nobody was looking-because then compared to now-nobody was.<br/><br/>...Instead what I got was 2 1/2 hours of horrible acting! I've seen more character in infomercials than in this movie. Seriously I'm more emotionally invested in if Bob can get that burnt cheese off his non-stick pan than I was of the deaths in this movie. The actors seemed as if every single blink was scripted, nothing seemed natural or real at all-which to me is important when you're portraying something that actually happened! <br/><br/>If the intentions of this movie were to take a real life, hard, emotional yet exciting revolutionary story and make it seem fake and drab it gets 10 stars.

","I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their ""music"" became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this. <br/><br/>The actual story is so stereotypical and formulaic that it became tedious to watch very early on and made it difficult to stay interested.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","94","222","12 October 2015"," A music genre and lifestyle I don't have much interest in
","""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most talked about films from this year and it gives us an insight into the rise and fall of the successful hip-hop posse NWA. And even if I am not too interested in rap music, I cannot deny having heard of some of the main characters such as Suge Knight and Dr. Dre of course. Maybe my lack of interest in this film is because I have not lived back then yet or wasn't old enough to follow these significant years in hip-hop history. The director is F. Gary Gray and you may have seen his ""Law Abiding Citizen"". Another problem I had with Compton is that it just felt too long for its own good. There was nothing really refreshing in here, pretty much everything expected, such as the guys' struggles with (predominantly White) policemen, authority arguments with other black people living in the hood etc. Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti may be the most known name in the cast here playing a prominent record company boss and even if he is good as usual, he cannot make this film a memorable watch either.<br/><br/>This movie runs for almost 2.5 hours, which is definitely way too long. They just did not have the material to make this an exciting watch for such a long time. 100 minutes would have been more than enough. There are occasionally interesting references about the 1980s such as near the end people thinking the HIV virus would only be transmitted through gay sex, but also this area is not enough and could have been much more than it actually turned out to be. I think this film is only a good watch for people who are already hugely interested in rap music before watching. This is no film that will spark an interest for anybody who doesn't really care about hip-hop. Surprised this one has received such favorable critical reception. Not recommended."

Watching this movie was painful because even though I grew up to this music and used to have at least a modicum of appreciation for it all, as an adult I see the damage that it's done to an entire generation, and to watch these men painted as martyrs and heroes and such literally turned my stomach. It's SO FAKE. You can see through it even if you don't know anything about the real rappers. I'd advise you all to do your research on these people. Dre especially does not deserve respect or even a portion of your paycheck.<br/><br/>So glad I waited until it played on HBO. I would never buy this junk."

","The most entertaining thing about this movie for me wasn't actually in the movie. It was the clever memes people put onto Facebook. Mine was: Straight Outta My Mom.<br/><br/>Sure, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and knew of these artists, but they were never my bag. Never been a rap fan, so I knew very little of their history here. Make that, I knew almost nothing going in, so all of this was interesting from an outsider's POV. That said, my suspicions were correct: There were no good people here. Everyone was pretty much an asshole and contained very little moral ground to cling to. <br/><br/>I did, however, agree with their rights to the First Amendment and completely disagreed with those who fought against their privilege to use their talents to convey their messages. <br/><br/>The movie, while well-made, is just another run-of-the-mill music biopic. Inspiring artists with no one to back them and more telling them not to continue, finally make it. This comes with costs, tensions, jealousy, contract disputes, make-ups, etc., etc. <br/><br/>Mercifully, and delving into spoiler territory, the movie redeems the real-life characters, but sadly by the time the Lifetime Movie moment happens, I've all-but dismissed everyone as bad people. <br/><br/>Hell, even when they try and do the right thing, they give their opposition freedom to rightfully slam them. <br/><br/>Again, the movie was competently made, interesting and definitely well-acted. Didn't turn me into any fan of rap, or the N.W.A., but it was worth a watch. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Either I saw the reader's digest version, or they're not telling the whole story, but it sucks on how much violence they threatened and caused and got away with it. All the way through this, I only stayed in their corner for their First Amendment rights. All the other sh|t they pulled, wellÂ…live by the sword"

","Even as a white kid from suburbia, I remember being exposed to the exhilarating and raucous sound of N.W.A. when I was four or five. My mother would play one of her brother's personally mixed CDs, filled with novelty songs, parodies, and vulgar rap songs I probably shouldn't have been heard at such a tender age, in car rides with me. Songs like ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""F*** the Police"" were ingrained in my head, and I remember especially finding telling social relevance in the line, ""searchin' my car, lookin' for the product - thinking' every n**** is sellin' narcotics"" from the latter song despite being so young.<br/><br/>I may not have ever experienced racial injustice in my life, but I was at least aware of racial double standards at a young age. With that, one of the purposes of F. Gary Gray's biopic on the acclaimed, pioneering rap group N.W.A. is to get us angry at the injustice that occurred in the 1980's and 1990's and remind us that this kind of hate still frighteningly occurs today. It hits us in the face and stomps on the audience hard, as if its strapped with brass knuckles and decked out in the latest Nikes, portraying the race relations in Los Angeles as they were - ugly and disgraceful.<br/><br/>This portrayal only fits that of N.W.A.'s music and character. Comprised of five talented, street-smart young men, N.W.A. was a rap group predicated on detailing their harsh reality and controversial opinions in a brutally honest manner. Featuring the lyrical talents of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr., son of Ice Cube and a spitting image of his father), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), in addition to the lyrical and producing talents of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.), N.W.A. went from a Compton area bunch to a nationwide supergroup in what seemed to be overnight. Armed with the guidance of acclaimed music producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and their desire to rap the truth and the strength of street knowledge, ""Straight Outta Compton"" details the rise of the group in addition to subsequent beefs, contract battles, and multiple tragedies that faced the talented young men in their prime.<br/><br/>F. Gary Gray directs this film with complete conviction. He and writers Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff work to capture the major events in N.W.A. in a manner that, while all-encompassing, gets to the heart of each emotion and the significance of every conversation. Gray and company don't mess around in detailing the sure power and magnitude of this group through concerts, riots, and nationwide recognition, and they do so in a manner that's investing from the very first time the group is questioned by police for doing nothing wrong.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton,"" again, much like the music of N.W.A., hooks you with its bravado and swagger. We see the incredible charisma and charm of these five men, we hear their hard-hitting lyricism and their strong production, and we feel their simultaneous pride for their city and condemnation of its flaws, such as systemic racism and discrimination. From Gray's assured direction, it continues with the performances, all of which unanimously strong. Eazy-E was a character I wasn't really expecting to see developed as much as he was, but with the writing at hand and Jason Mitchell's emotionally potent and tender performance, he becomes the standout in a sea of great acting.<br/><br/>Each actor brings something to the table here; Jackson, Jr.'s aggression is unmatched, particularly in a telling scene involving Priority Records, Hawkins is the conviction and the even-tempered soul through all this madness, Hodge is the wit and the sporadic humor of the group, and Brown, Jr. is the backup to all the characters in the film whenever they need it. Mitchell is the tender and enigmatic one, someone who isn't easily defined, has trouble rapping and performing occasionally, but someone who also comes with big ideas for the group he knows, loves, and wants to make huge. Finally, let's not forget Giamatti, in his second Oscar-worthy performance (first being in ""Love & Mercy"") of the year, who gives a performance just as emotionally investing and captivating as that of Mitchell's, particularly when the two are having a heart-to-heart.<br/><br/>As entertainment, ""Straight Outta Compton,"" for this past summer, is unmatchable in its level of fun and human interest. As social commentary, despite being set a few decades back, the film is frighteningly current in its issues and its ideas. While it may follow some typical tropes of a biopic (the ""rise and fall"" structure), nonetheless, the sleekness and universal strength of everyone and everything in this project make it rise above those shortcomings into something truly worthwhile. Finally, as a piece of hip-hop history, and film in general, it's an indisputable must-see."

"blakerogers2015","5","48","119","17 August 2015"," Unbiased Honest Review
","So I just saw Straight outta Compton and I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I did enjoy the movie and felt like there hasn't been a genuine long drama for a while. I think we need to bring more of these back. On the other hand, there were a couple of things wrong I thought. So I'm going to go ahead with a pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: The story was told wonderfully. Again, we as a society have been so numb to dramas because we are so used to seeing non stop action, explosions, and comedies. I for one appreciate a good drama. I enjoyed the story for the most part I thought the acting was great. Ice Cube's son was perfect at representing his father. To be honest, I hate rap music, but did enjoy everything they performed I did like how the friends who split up and fought ended up making amends. <br/><br/>Now the Cons Despite enjoying the story, I thought the movie could have been about 20 minutes shorter I will say this without getting political. I want to say first that the cops portrayed in this movie were terrible. They were absolutely awful and should be stripped of their badges. With that being sad, they do not represent every cop. So to write a song called F*ck the Police and demoralize every cop is ignorant and immature. Lets see what happens when we take every cop off the street and see where our society goes with no law. Thats all I'm gonna say on that It's bothersome also that these ""role models"" live such disgusting lives. They cheat on their wives like it's nothing. A wife should be cherished and loved. And on that note, I feel as though there was unnecessary nudity. It didn't advance the plot and we already know they lived in such debauchery that I felt it unnecessary <br/><br/>These are my thoughts. It was cool to see the background behind Ice Cube and Dr. Dre."

","Whether you'd like Straight Outta Compton depends on how you like hip hop. However, if you're a NWA fan you probably know all there is to know about the events depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>With Dr. Dre and Ice Cube among producers i can assume that the facts are slightly skewed. But even this notion, and i admit it is slightly below the line, doesn't influence the big picture. This is one fine biopic.<br/><br/>The rest is really your opinion. If you're into hip hop, this is one of those movies that would be a candidate for the Holy Grail. My opinion, though, is implied by my vote...<br/><br/>The resemblance of the actors to the real-life NWA members is amazing, although i didn't expect less from O'Shea Jackson Jr. for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>My strongest impression, though, is how biopics such as Straight Outta Compton influence my opinion about the protagonists. I like to call it ""Wikpedia's drawback"". In this particular case, i've listened to NWA and later mostly Dr. Dre and formed my opinion both about the authors and their output. This is some kind of idealized picture. But when you read on Wikipedia or see a biopic and realize how it all really happened it always gives me a whole new insight. And such insights are not always positive.<br/><br/>Yet again, this is all just my opinion."

","The story of NWA is so diverse and interesting, all of these portrayed artists are very different from each other and highly talented. Even if you took away their background & heritage there would be still a lot of oddities and interesting anecdotes to tell us about. Instead the movie is as formulaic and stereotypical as it can be. I would have been able to look past that and enjoy it for what it is: a mediocre attempt of rap group biopic of the early 90s except that is were its weak point is. The wardrobe, lingo, streets, mannerisms it's all wrong. Very wrong. At a pool party you get a close up of a woman shaking her giant booty in a g-string. Let me tell you in the early 90s you had high cut baywatch style bikinis, yes. But no lady showed up to a pool party in a g- string, big asses were not really considered attractive and nobody danced by staying in place and bouncing their booty. Perreo dance styles that made it into hip hop culture appeared in the early to mid 2000's. <br/><br/>The only redeeming part of this movie are the actors which come very close to the characters they portray, except of course when they speak. In that regard only Ice's son did a somewhat good job by shutting his mouth and talking through mimics like the real Ice would when he was fronting.<br/><br/>For someone who lived the era, who knows how South Los and Socal looked like, who has seen it up close this movie is painfully wrong. There are other things wrong too like the story being too drawn out and the pacing being weird. (It felt in many scenes like there was a build up, hinting that there was something significant going on and then it flattens out, really weird!)<br/><br/>Altogether its a bad movie and I could not recommend it, not even to the die-hard fans. As a fan of the music and the artists the wasted potential is really imeasurable, a big disappointment."

","I'm a hip-hop head and grew up in the NWA era, even if I wasn't a hip-hop junkie I don't think I would love this movie any less. When I first saw the trailer I wasn't quite sold. The movie was wonderful. I cannot find too many things I didn't like about it. If I were too nitpick, then I would say they painted Dre & Ice Cube too positively. I'm pretty sure there were less flattering things about them. But judging this from just how well it was written, acted and directed, I would have to say this was flawless.<br/><br/>Obviously there are five members of the group, and the film chose to focus more on the three most popular members, which I did not have a problem with. Because the movie was carried out so well, it did not affect the overall story of the group as a whole. What made this so wonderful for me is that almost every pivotal scene in the movie, I remember being a part of it, because I remember where I was when each moment was happening. When certain songs were shown being made or when the tragic news of Eazy-E was reported. It took me down memory lane of my own life, not too many films can do this.<br/><br/>And the music of course is a major part of the story and it was well executed. Now let's talk about the cast. What a well-put together cast! This movie had humor, tragedy and everything in between. It was sold by this wonderful cast. Basically Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson was born to play this role, literally and he knocked it out the park. But the two that held this glue together was Paul Giamatti playing Jerry Heller and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. The chemistry between those two was amazing. I would love to see someone from this cast get an Academy Award nomination. In my opinion, this is a great contender for Best Film for the Oscars. <br/><br/>As a hip-hop junkie and a lover of great films, I would like to say thank you to the creators of this movie for reminding me why I love Hip-Hop so much."

"trublu215","8","32","81","13 August 2015"," If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton is entertaining to say the least.
","Straight Outta Compton tells the the story of the most influential group in hip-hop and rap, that group being N.W.A or as Eazy-E so gracefully puts it N****s With Attitudes. Directed by F. Gary Gray, Straight Outta Compton is, without a doubt, his best work behind the camera. However, by traditional standards, that isn't saying much. Gray is no stranger to N.W.A, Ice Cube or Dr. Dre having directed numerous music videos featuring their music. While the film is a very nice ""fairy tale"" telling of a story filled with tension, violence and rage, it lacks the balls to tell the actual story. Instead, the film picks and chooses what to tell and what to leave out, very strategically as well considering the film is two and a half hours plus. Starting with the streets of Compton, we are introduced to each character with a bang. Each of them getting their own introduction as if they were folk heroes or something, whether it is petty crime or writing rap lyrics, the film shows these characters with a sense of heroism to them no matter what they're doing. The best performance out of the group would have to be Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre. Hawkins delivers in every scene he's in, making it a true standout performance among actors that sometimes feel like they're in over their heads, more specifically Jason Mitchell, who plays Eazy-E. Mitchell feels more like a caricature of the late rapper rather than an actual actor portraying a real life counterpart. The film moves quickly enough and focuses long and hard on all of the partying, the women, the guns and the drugs, so much so that you start to wonder whether the film is a N.W.A music video tribute. Despite the falsehoods, the glorification and the shaky performances, Straight Outta Compton works well as an entertaining film. The only downside of this film is its haphazard statement on Police Brutality. While that is as prevalent as a topic can get for a film from 2015 about N.W.A, that was not the highlight of the group. The highlight of the group was the fight against the censors. A fight that they won, obviously. Despite that truth, the film wallows in trying to be a message about police brutality rather than a film about these men, their flaws and their triumphs, their ups and their downs. Unfortunately, it leaves us knowing nothing new about these people and at two and a half hours, we should leave this film knowing every little detail about them. Instead, we're left wanting more out of them. Overall, Straight Outta Compton ends up being an entertaining film about some of America's favorite rap artists instead of an important one."

","I love this era of music and was really excited when I first heard they were making a movie based on NWA. I must say I was disappointed with the way the story was told and the way certain characters were portrayed. The movie was pretty much from the perspective of Dr Dre and more or less made him out to be the hero. They did everything to portray Eazy as a money grabbing broke loser when it was he who set up NWA. Not only that the time lines of the story were way out of wack, how can Tupac be recording California Love in the Death Row studio in 1993? I also doubt that Dre would've visited Eazy in the hospital as he had no issue with Suge doing his dirty work. This movie was very fictionalised and misses the mark completely.

"kingbk-2","8","28","72","16 August 2015"," Excellent Movie about Influential Pop Culture Giants
","I was reading some of the reviews about this amazing movie and wanted to laugh. ""Oh my gosh, it has sex, drugs and violence. Boo hoo!"" I mean, do people do any kind of research before shelling out their $10? This movie takes place in Compton in the mid 80s. This wasn't Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, this was a rough, hardcore area where blacks didn't know if they would be arrested and assaulted by cops or shot at by gangsters anytime they stepped out the door. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most remarkable rags to riches stories about a group that changes the face to music, movies and pop culture on a grander scale. <br/><br/>The movies introduces us to the five members of N.W.A.: Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. We see how the group formed, how they met manager Jerry Heller, the recording of their first album, the flack they received on tours, their constant battle over censorship and freedom of speech, their lives of excess and partying, the trouble they experienced by law enforcement for just standing there, the battle of egos, inner band turmoil, and eventually the splitting up of the group. If you are a fan of hip hop, you know how much of an influence N.W.A. had to the rise of West Coast Hip Hop and Gangsta Rap. At this time, the only real way to hear new music was the radio, and due to their controversial lyrics, they never got any airplay, but the media helped create buzz and popularity almost indadvertedly by talking about how controversial the group was and how people didn't like their music. That resulted in the band becoming multi-platinum superstars. In fact, the band didn't just grab the black audience, but was highly popular with white men, who started turning away from rock music, which was facing a decline due to cheesy hair metal production, to this new, powerful, anti-establishment credo that rock once represented. Yes, there is drug use, sex and violence, but this was the life these guys knew, and no matter how far you go, you never forget your roots or completely leave them. <br/><br/>The actors all do an excellent job in their roles. The only real veteran in this film is Paul Giamatti, who does his usual solid performance, this time as the sleazy, manipulative manager Jerry Heller. Interestingly enough, Giamatti was in another music biopic this year, Love and Mercy, about another influential Southern California band (The Beach Boys). Both bands, very much from the same area, had such a influence to their periods of time and represented completely different worlds of Southern California youth life.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of hip-hop, I still think you need to this as their effect on pop culture in general is still prevalent today. Also, on a sadder note, the issues of police brutality on minorities still is a glaring problem that makes F the Police sound just as fresh as it did in 1988."
"jthomas-60562","10","25","64","14 August 2015"," Really Enjoyed this Film
","Despite my own personal interest in the music, I was not going to let that influence how I felt about the this film. Fortunately it did not have too. I enjoyed the hell out of it. <br/><br/>The casting was excellent, not just based on their looks but the talent level was apparent by all members. The characters were well developed and each had their own unique personality, and the characters especially Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's characters. This is one of the most crucial parts of this film is that I needed to be able to feel the chemistry between these characters in order to pull myself into this film and begin to care about these people despite them being based on real people. One complaint I have heard about this film is that the second half of the film is not as compelling as the first half of the film due to the fact that it gets more dramatic and in depth on the personal lives of Ice Cube, Eazy E, and Dr. Dre as they began to go their own directions in their music careers. Personally I enjoyed the second half of the film, because I was able to see how well the cast act in dramatic situations and I was impressed<br/><br/>As far as complete accuracy goes, obviously there are certain things that were left out of the movie based on the negative history that took place during the 1990s but that is to be expected since Ice Cube is one producer of this film. However does not take away from the experience in anyway, shape or form. In short I loved this movie in its entirety. I talk about this movie forever but the point is a highly recommend you see this film especially fans of rap music because it will give you a true appreciation for the music created by N.W.A. This is my first review I have posted so hopefully this was helpful and if not I will try to improve."
"angie_l","5","22","56","16 March 2016"," Potential but Ends Up a Superficial Retelling
","I was extremely disappointed by this film. With the Oscar controversy and the snub, I had high hopes. After watching the movie, it didn't deserve to be nominated for any awards. What I think is the bigger controversy, though, is that the writers received a completely undeserved Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The movie begins amazingly well. The first scene really gives you the setting. The dingy small house, bars on windows, a male dominated society, drug dealings, the militarized police, Compton is bleak. I was excited, I'm in for a gritty edgy story about the controversial pioneers of gangster rap (even if in reality, they aren't so gangster). Then, it was all down hill from here. So what went wrong?<br/><br/>First problem was the script and possibly the editing. Overall, haphazard is the best way to describe the plot. The main focus of the story is the financial dispute between Cube and Eazy-E. However, I felt like the story was more concerned with ticking off all the boxes of things that Dre and Cube wanted to be shown rather than telling a coherent and compelling story - the Bye, Felicia scene, check - Ice Cube trashing a music execs office, check etc. Some scenes in the story come about with little explanation. An example of the careless story telling is how the infamous song, ""F*** Tha Police,"" was handled. That was a hugely controversial song with 1st amendment implications and the challenging of censorship in America. It had so much build up with the police harassment. It leads to a riot and then Cube jokes about Raiders gear and we never hear about ""F*** Tha Police"" again.<br/><br/>I felt like the poor script was due to the writers being handcuffed by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre who produced the film. They were going to have the story told they way they remembered it and not by an objective third party. Dre and Cube are the ""good guys."" Even when Cube destroys an execs office, we are supposed to be cheering for him. While his frustration is real, I think a better script would have you wavering between whether he was throwing a tantrum or justified. Dre is literally just there most of the time. He's a producer so he does get some story line. DJ Yella and MC Ren could've been left on the cutting room floor without losing anything. Did they really contribute so little? I looked them up and they are credited as writers on most songs. Eazy-E who is the movies quasi-villain, and not around to tell his side of the story, is even shown to not really be so bad, just misguided by their manager Jerry Heller. It all felt so superficial, like it was only scratching the surface. The characters were flat and one dimensional - these are real people, right? Or maybe I got too hung up on the tone set by the first scene. The last scene also mistakenly thought the movie had stayed in the tone of the first scene. I didn't feel enough chaos for the final word to land with the intended impact.<br/><br/>I found the acting to be mostly sub-par minus the seasoned actor Giamatti. He's good here but it's not his best and I felt like he was a somewhat awkward fit for the role. The acting standout of the cast was Jason Mitchell who played Eazy-E. There really isn't much to say about the directing other than it was passable. Also, the movie was at least a half an hour too long and really dragged in the second half.<br/><br/>In the end, it was typical, bland, biopic fare."
"subxerogravity","9","25","67","14 August 2015"," Not only tells the story of NWA, but the movie itself is a milestone in hip hop.
","When I saw the film was going to be well over two hours, I will admit I thought they were too overzealous, but every minute of this movie was entertaining. <br/><br/>The fact that a movie that tells the history of hip hop's most infamous group, and is on the level of such biopics as Oliver Stone's The Doors just shows you were hip hop has gone since the beginning of NWA. <br/><br/>Usually biopics like this get boring when the third act hits, but not Straight out of Compton. It keeps your heart pumping to the very last minute.<br/><br/>He's not gonna go down in history as the world's greatest thespian but you could do no wrong with Ice Cube Jr. Mimicking daddy-o (Ice Cube's son plays his dad and looks just like him). He had it down, but so did the kid playing Easy E, but the real credit goes to F. Gary Gray who made music videos for members of NWA. The writers and producers which included Ice cube also contributed to how entertaining this movie was. It feels like everyone cared about the project.<br/><br/>Straight out of Compton is a positive spin on the NWA story, showing how five guys from the neighborhood who only wanted to make music for the kids on their block ended up taking over the world. It's has this ""this could be you"" vibe and overall is an uplifting story about living your dreams on your terms. It's no different than any other rock star's story and that's one of the reasons it's amazing. <br/><br/>Also like how the story gave equal time to members DJ Yella and MC Ren. I was expecting the Big three players in the band to overshadow them, but the film treated these two with respect. <br/><br/>What a great story. It was totally worthy of the 2 hours and 42 mins spent in the theater. Every minute counted.<br/><br/>I'm thinking good enough to get nominated for something in awards season."

The three lead actors are amazing as well as the direction. Yes you see them ""fight"" the police but this is not a political film. This is a drama. <br/><br/>It is about friendship, about self-fulfillment, about creating something and about how greed destroys everything.

"peggyatthemovies","8","23","64","13 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton = a very good story
","Art comes in many forms. A Masterpiece for instance is usually a word used in the art world as a painting or portrait that is brilliantly done and is usually invoked by inner thoughts and feelings of so many emotions. That could sum up the feeling of this story and what a story it is. This film has everything you see invoked in a masterpiece painting. Love, war, death, money, drugs, power, sadness, happiness and most of all, music. It's a story about art in the truest sense of the word. These 5 young men – Andre 'Dr Dre' Young, Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright, O'Shea 'Ice Cube' Jackson, Lorenzo 'MC Ren' Patterson, & Antoine 'DJ YELLA' Carraby changed the world with what they did and this more or less, is their story.<br/><br/>Director F. Gary Gray takes us through the years from the group's origin in 1986 to Dr. Dre's founding of Aftermath Records in 1996 and while it's the N.W.A. story..it's mostly a three-man show focusing on Dre, Cube & most especially Eazy-E. It does justice in recreating a Compton from back in the day so perfectly and dare I say it, beautifully, as if the time & place and what the street life of the city truly was like, came straight out of a time machine. This is a big plus throughout the film.<br/><br/>Opening with a drug deal gone bad for Eric 'Eazy-E' might seem somewhat clichéd way to enter the story but is actually quite fitting especially since Eazy is the truly the main focus of the first half of film. He was the money, albeit it was from those deals, that enabled them to get studio time to record ""Boyz in the Hood"" and it was that song that attracted and brought manager 'Jerry Heller' (Paul Giamatti) to them. Heller knocks on the doors and pounds the pavement to connects them to their 1st label, Priority Records and we all get a laugh when we find out from that the only group 'Bryan Turner' (Tate Ellington) and the company had ever recorded before signing N.W.A was the California Raisins. Yep..you have dig real deep and go way back to remember that one!! But cash those checks from that Turner did, enough to land the company N.W.A. As we watch the group go from playing skating rinks to huge massive arenas across the nation. Meanwhile, Jerry also manages to finagle himself into part of starting up Eazy-E's Ruthless Records where we see everyone but E get underpaid & overlooked.<br/><br/>This leads to acrimony between the guys and while on tour Ice Cube, reminding everyone that he is the one who has written most of the music, departs the group. But before he leaves though we do get the anthem that penned the groups title as 'the world's most dangerous group' mainly because they scared the bejesus out of middle America with their anthem ""F**K the Police"" which comes straight from Cube after we witness multiple scenes of humiliation and harassment of not only him, but the group, their friends, their neighbors for just basically being.<br/><br/>The movie clearly focuses on the big three of the group, 'Dr. Dre' (Corey Hawkins) and 'Ice Cube' (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) with 'Eazy-E' (Jason Mitchell) taking the lead, with 'DJ Yella' (Neil Brown Jr.) & 'MC Ren' (Aldis Hodge) getting only minor attention. They easily brush right over their misogynistic lyrics as women here are barely given the time of day and only the wives or girlfriends of the moment get a few lines at best. Though as with most bio-pics, while we might not be getting the complete story here – it's still a very good story.<br/><br/>We see bits of the infamous East Coast/West Coast rivalry that started up. And once Cube is gone we get right in the middle of his lyrical riffs with the remaining members of the group badmouthing each other back n forth through their music giving us surely what is only a glimpse into this and then with Dre also going his own way with the ever and still unscrupulous 'Suge Knight' (R. Marcos Taylor) – showing the forming of and his subsequent abandonment of Death Row Records.<br/><br/>We catch beginning snippets of 'Tupac Shakur' (Marcc Rose), 'Snoop Dogg' (Keith Stanfield) (or as his character notes – that's Snoop D. O. double G.), 'Jimmy Iovine' (Mark Sherman) & the beginnings of Interscope Records. Along with this, we get clever allusions to what is to come – Everything from Cube's films 'Boyz N The Hood', 'Friday' and it's sequels, to Dre when walking out on Knight, almost cheesily referencing Aftermath. The film closes with updates on the band members careers post-1996 with various interview clips in large focusing on Dre and Cube's successes, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent, among others, paying homage to Dre showing the fruition of what both his and Cube's visions came to be. Also, the sad and untimely passing of Eazy-E from AIDS. Noticeably absent are updates on DJ Yella and MC Ren.<br/><br/>For all it's small flaws here and there, this is still a hellava story to be told. N.W.A helped to change the musical culture of the time because they actually told the world what was happening in their own backyard through their music. And in doing so they succeeded in making themselves one of the most powerful groups of the time. Oscar buzz? Probably not. But fan favorite (and one of mine) – definitely. RIP Eazy-E.<br/><br/>Grade: B+ @pegsatthemovies"
"gsvaesthetic","10","25","72","31 August 2015"," Speak a little truth and people lose their minds.
","I just created an IMDb account specifically to point out the following issue I see here on the User Reviews section for this film. <br/><br/>Me and my roommate just watched Straight Outta Compton and it was a fantastic picture. I would've sat for 2 more hours watching the extended version, which I hope is someday released. Now, after every incredible film I watch, I'll check IMDb to see what others are saying and I noticed that even with all of the positive reviews from all over the internet, the IMDb user reviews section of this movie is thickly littered with 1 Star reviews. That seemed odd to me, until I started noticing a pattern. Each of these 1 Star reviews all carry the words ""adult"", ""shame"", ""disgusting"", etc. Furthermore, each of these reviews feature bad punctuation and almost ALWAYS have the final sentence of the review ending with ""!."" An exclamation point AND a period? That's not right. But doing the math, it seems like one person is trying to sabotage the reviews section of this film. What I'm getting at is that maybe someone is trying to smear this film. I'm getting the feeling that perhaps this film wasn't supposed to be a success because of the deep messages it speaks about in regards to police brutality, issues of freedom of speech, and minority oppression. This is a very important and powerful film and I don't think a select group of people are excited about it.<br/><br/>Welp, those are my thoughts. Aside from that, I think the movie kicked ass. So go see it."
"gbill-74877","9","16","43","28 February 2017"," Fantastic movie, whether you're a fan of the music or not
","This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty. <br/><br/>It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?<br/><br/>You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements.<br/><br/>I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie."

"wwer06-742-758393","9","22","64","24 August 2015"," Do NOT Listen to the Offended Reviewers
","I usually do not write reviews for movies, but I feel like this movie is given unfair treatment by the same radicals who bought N.W.A's records in the 80s and 90s to protest and demolish them. I keep reading there's nothing good about this film and that is a complete lie. The acting is superb and Oscar-worthy, the cinematography is beautiful, the writing is constantly exciting, and the impact is long lasting.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie shows much excess (sexually, violently, etc.), but this is the reality of the film and even with all this adult content, there is learning from the characters on screen. Much like WOLF OF WALL STREET, there's a lot of offensive acts, but it's there to show the growth of these characters we follow for nearly three hours of screen time. Even if you hate rap or whatever N.W.A was promoting, you can still find talent in front of and behind the camera. If you deny that, you should never write a film review and you're only letting your values criticize something that shouldn't be judged on the surface.<br/><br/>I guarantee you most of these 5 star and under reviews are from people who either know nothing of the filmmaking process or they are completely against the handful of scenes shown in STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON's certain moments of mature content without considering what these adult images transcend into. I'm not spoiling anything, but you should give this movie a chance, because it's more than a rap gimmick... It's American history. You're not only getting sex and violence, you're getting a series of vignettes following several interwoven stories that capture the harsh realities of ghetto life and federal hypocrisy."
"gabrielurena","7","20","58","31 October 2015"," Very weird reviews here.
","I am definitely no film critic but one thing I can tell: This is NOT a bad movie. It caught my attention the fact that this movie has so many bad, unfair reviews. Many claim this movie is vulgar, obscene, as if it was a kids movie. It's not! They also claim it's violent, which they wouldn't say about American Sniper, which is a lot more violent, but with white heroes. Or they claim there is nudity, as if they never saw The Heartbreak Kid with Ben Stiller. It doesn't promote drugs as much as Pineapple Express and it doesn't promote violence even a fraction of how The Godfather does. So this reviews are absurd, apparently made by white police officers who feel offended by ""F The Police"".<br/><br/>I was checking some of the reviewers who gave it one star and found some weird thins. For instance, many of them have either no other movie reviewed or have one other review made the same day they made the review for this movie, which is a little suspicious. There is one of them who gave Amelie one star also. If that is not proof of a mental issue I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Now my review: This movie has a good rhythm in most but not all the time. It might not be the most truthful account of what happened but, hey! It's NOT a documentary. The subjects of this movie are also the producers and they chose what they wanted to portray, which they have the right to do. Besides you should never judge a movie by how truthful it is to the real story but how consistent in it self it is and how the story is told. It's an interesting movie and it makes you interested in the real-life characters. Now I want to see a documentary about these guys, cause I understand this is a movie and I'm curios about what was really going on with them. It's NOT boring but it's not a Michael Bay film. The acting was not impressive, but it wasn't distracting.<br/><br/>I was skeptical but when I saw the first 10 minutes I was hooked."

It pulled me in, made me laugh, made me cry and was well worth the price of admission. I will see this again. The gentlemen playing in this film did a wonderful job portraying the group members. It was hard to not really see Eazy as Jason Mitchell presented him on film. O'Shea Jackson Jr did a phenomenal job as his father during his younger years. Corey Hawkins did a fantastic job portraying Dre. Well done Cube and Gray. Well done. The birth of a genre was well represented."
"philpriestley","8","20","59","29 August 2015"," Intense and compelling
","This is a great film. The detail and the effort that been put in here is superb and it's wonderful to see.<br/><br/>Each of the actors is well chosen, credible and presents their chosen character in convincing manner.<br/><br/>The actors that play Dre and Ice-Cube are particularly compelling, but it seems wrong to overlook the portrayal of Easy-E.<br/><br/>This is explosive stuff straight out of the blocks and it never feels slow. It's a long film too, but it keeps you right there. I went to see it in the cinema with my wife and she'd just worked a night shift - she didn't fall asleep and she thought she probably would. That is a pretty good test for a movie.<br/><br/>The menacing figure of Shug Knight comes right off the screen too. The drama is both incredible but so real.<br/><br/>Laced within this film are real messages too - freedom of speech messages, racial discrimination messages, police brutality messages - which are really important because they were and are part of our times.<br/><br/>The big message is though - these five guys came from nowhere, a place where there is less than nothing to share - but with their own gifts, their creativity, their musicality - they left their mark on the world. It just shows that, it's always there waiting to happen, something new and unexpected, out of nowhere. The political elite can't ever stop that, it can't be smothered.<br/><br/>This is a great film that holds the torch for the power of creativity and self belief - the ability to over come it all.<br/><br/>Final mention - easy to overlook - this film is bringing NWA to a whole new generation who don't know about them. After the film was over I was waiting for my wife (bathroom) and I asked this young guy if he remembered any of the events he'd seen on the screen. He shook his head and said 'No, I'm only 16'.<br/><br/>Great film. RIP EASY-E."
"valen060","9","20","59","16 August 2015"," A Stunning Glimpse Into N.W.A.'s Tribulations and Legacy
","Ever since I can remember on Universal's 2002 semi-biopic 8 Mile, regarding how Eminem came to be (albeit name changed and loosely based on his life), I expected Straight Outta Compton was going to follow in that same fray. The moment the film began and completed it from start to finish, I was left bewildered and further curious on how much N.W.A. went through in the early 1990s, much like how Eminem wanted recognition in his skill despite his appearance and background. I may have been too young to understand what was going on in that era, but it piqued my interest even further since such harsh circumstances still reverberate in today's culture.<br/><br/>The cast was profound. Jason Mitchell's take on the late Eazy-E was so spot-on and performed solidly as the one who basically held N.W.A. together. O'Shea Jackson Jr. does bear a striking resemblance of his own father Ice Cube and convincingly portrayed. While Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre certainly brought out the dramatic tension he faced when it came to confronting Death Row Records owner Suge Knight. And even Paul Giamatti's Jerry Heller - whom at one point had put their careers on the map until his methods were questioned altogether - felt suitable for Giamatti's skill in drama. For example, that one scene where Ice Cube leaves the group when he finds out about the contract deal the group would face individually when signed, I can already foresee what would immediately follow from there: diss tapes and retaliation (which was a big deal in the prime of the 90s).<br/><br/>The entire film does live up to its namesake because it was all about five individuals whose lives weren't the best in the ghetto areas of Compton, yet their combined talents in writing music and shameless ways of expressing their lives in song really shook up the music industry, notably their hit song ""F*** tha Police"" which got them into serious law trouble during one stage performance. The Rodney King beating, L.A. Riots, and even the tragic loss of member Eazy-E greatly affected them, but despite the tribulations overtime, they certainly left a mark on hip-hop/rap culture that continues to influence newcomers in the business years later. Director F. Gary Gray (Friday) definitely provided a stunning glimpse into these mens' lives and I applaud him and the cast for showing how the hood is not entirely all what is believed. Surviving police brutality and racial injustice were just of the few problems they've endured. Among the many reviews I've read nitpicking how it's so ""offensive"" or ""noisy"" and this is actually ""erotic porn"" because of the gratuitous sex/nudity, pervasive language, and violence, the old-timers who despise such music seriously underestimate this movie without seeing what is trying to be accomplished here. Sure, they're nowhere perfect or classy (in the best sense), let alone heroes. But deep down it's expressed from the heart and a must-see for music enthusiasts of the old and new generation."
"bryank-04844","9","20","60","13 August 2015"," 'Straight Outta Compton' is one music bio-epic you can't miss. It's an incredible film that is executed exquisitely, and not only that, it's an important film.
","Music biopics are one of my favorite genres of film. I love seeing a musical artist or band portrayed on screen and their rise to fame, complete with how they came up with their platinum hits, warts and all. As of lately, we haven't seen a ton of these biopics with the exception of the excellent 'Love & Mercy' about Beach Boys member Brian Wilson. Most of the biopics usually focus on one person or a band and go up until they hit it big, but that's not the case with 'Straight Outta Compton', which is more of a bio-epic than a biopic. Instead of following one person, the film follows three main characters with a treasure trove of other superstar artists.<br/><br/>The three in question are Andre Young, O'Shea Jackson, and Eric Wright or Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E respectively as they form one of the world's greatest rap groups in the late 80s - 'N.W.A.'. Director F. Gary Gray ('Friday'), has perfectly strewn together several characters and told their stories through several years, highlighting the good times as well as the bad of these three amazing artists. If you grew up like I did in the 80's and 90's, 'N.W.A.' was a huge deal. Not only was their music and lyrics incredible and powerful, but they spoke the truth about was going down in their violent neighborhoods as well as how the racist and trigger happy L.A.P.D. would treat them and their fellow neighbors.<br/><br/>Nothing like that had been done before and caused a revolution of sorts as it gave the people a voice to stand up against the unfair and unjust law enforcement, as well as shed light onto what was going on the in these certain neighborhoods on a daily basis. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr.) were already creating beats and rapping about the streets at local rollerskating rinks and other parties in town to get by, and people were taking a keen liking to the new style of rap. It was then that they asked their drug-dealer friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) to front the money to cut single, which would become 'Boyz n the Hood', as Dre made the music, Cube wrote the lyrics, and Eazy sang.<br/><br/>It didn't all come easily either as we see in a humorous scene where they finally talk Eazy into getting on the microphone, and realize he sounds awful, that is until Dre gives him some advice and direction, to which we hear those iconic lyrics, ""Cruisin' down the street in my 64"". This film is made up of moments like this, and it's so much fun to see how these amazing artists came up with it. After the 'Boyz n the Hood' single was released on Eazy's Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager comes after Eazy and tells him her can bring him to the top of the music game. All seems kosher and right with Jerry at first, but he's focused on Eazy rather than anyone else in the group, leaving Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella without pay or claim to their contributions to their first record 'Straight Outta Compton'.<br/><br/>As we go through these guy's careers, we also see their vulnerable side, as they struggle with fame, death, law enforcement, and even the federal government who try to cease and censor their music. We even see the origin of their famous song 'F*ck the Police', after several repugnant L.A. police officers force these guys to the ground outside their music studio for doing literally nothing, which is something these musicians have witnessed and been privy to many times before. We also get glimpses of how TuPac, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Suge Knight came into play as well, with their usual claims to fame, whether it be how Snoop and Dre created ""Nuthin' But a ""G"" Thang"", Dre showing 'California Love' to TuPac, or Suge Knight showing his true violent colors.<br/><br/>It's all well directed and executed in a manner that you'd always hoped it would, which respects these artists. The film spans quite a few years and gives each person enough time to relate and sympathize with, which is key in this story and Gray shows each sequence, emotional moment, and concert flawlessly. The actors here are perfect as well, and all show some great promise in their future careers. Each performance was spot on and very believable, pulling out each emotion perfectly. You might even muster tears at certain points from these great performances.<br/><br/>Not only that, these guys look so much like the real-life people they're portraying that I forgot I was watching different actors several times throughout. Their facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on. And of course, Paul Giamatti plays the asshole business manager/agent very well, just like he's played in several other films in his recent career. Then of course there is the music, which is chock full of the greatest rap hits from this time period. You'll find yourself moving to the beat with each song. It's hypnotic in a way.<br/><br/>'Straight Outta Compton' is one music bio-epic you can't miss. It's an incredible film that is executed exquisitely, and not only that, it's an important film, that showcases some of the violence of law enforcement that is going on today. This is a must-see.<br/><br/>HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION AND MUST SEE!"
"MurdockATeam1","9","20","61","16 August 2015"," Not Perfect, But Extremely Fantastic Film Overall (Eff The VERY FEW Haters!)
","Okay first I have to say this was an extremely fantastic film as my title line said. There's too much to lay out because I already typed a whole review but IMDb said it was too long a post, so I'll just send a message out to the few who complained about the movie here.<br/><br/>(I WILL LIST SPOILERS AS I GO ALONG. THIS IS YOUR WARNING)<br/><br/>So, the haters complain about the sex and drug use. Honestly I barely saw any drug use. The only drug use was in the opening scene which was barely any. Most of the scene focused on Eazy-E trying to get paid for what he dealt to the dude in the drug house. There was an occasional hit of weed, I think the only one was when Tomica (Wright) was smoking Weed once during a conversation with Eazy while in bed and giving him a hit and then it goes to another scene. My god how sensitive can people be out there??? Also, there is quite a bit of nudity but it was like a quick glimpse of a full nude at a party the NWA dudes threw. Most ""nudes"" are just topless black women with panties and (Sometimes) high heels on. ONCE AGAIN THEY WERE A RAP GROUP OF DUDES IN THEIR LATE TEENS TO EARLY 20S. IN SHOWBIZ, THE LATE 80S, HOW CAN YOU BE SURPRISED? THAT WAS THE LIFESTYLE! Besides, the only actual ""sex"" was a quick 5 seconds DJ Yella was humping a woman in bed and they were half-covered! Seriously it was a quick glimpse cuz the camera's goal (by the way it was in the movie) was to just pan from one side of the hotel suite to the other which ENDED with Eazy getting a BJ from a woman but it was Jason Mitchell with his pants barely down and the girl's back is facing as she's on her knees WITH her panties on and her head is totally blocking his front, giving the clear acting movements of appearing to give him a BJ. That was only for like 3 seconds when Dre or MC Ren told the others that the dude who was looking for his GF (Who thought she was in that party) was threatening to shoot them with a gun, then they get out of their ""Acts"" and get together to do the strength in numbers thing against that guy. Oh, and the scene where it's a fast-forward montage on the tour bus, that was just toplessness and it was all so fast cuz it was in all fast forward. No men were nude and nothing was quick enough to show actual humping at all. Come on, those of you who are complaining about the ""Sex and drugs"" it's not even bad! And how the heck can you have NWA's real life story without the swearing? You want them to say ""Fudge"" or ""H.E. double hockeysticks instead of hell???"" It's just how they talked! It was realism! Plus their songs have a bunch of profanity and their music has been that way for years! LIGHTEN UP AND ACCEPT THE REALITY OF THIS STUFF. NO ONE ASKED YOU TO SEE IT AND NO ONE IS ASKING YOU TO TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE IT, IDIOTS. IT'S ABOUT A GANGSTER (YES, GANGSTER!!!!!!) RAP GROUP! We're not talking about the crew that made teletubbies a TV show. Ya know what? I think these haters are measuring these films on the scale of movies they take their kids to like Frozen or Despicable me. They must be dumb because this is a Universal flick and NOT a Disney one. Morons. Go home and watch your Kate Hudson movies. Oh wait, they're probably too racy for you too. Idiots.<br/><br/>That's all I have to say because this movie deserves AT LEAST a 9/10.<br/><br/>This movie from me deserves a 9/10. Great job Mr. Gray."
"scaredsblood","9","18","54","17 August 2015"," An Ambitious Movie that Nails it on almost every level possible
","This isn't just about NWA and it's Members and their lives. <br/><br/>This is about everything America is, everything America can be and everything America was. For that I give this movie a 9/10 because if it were just a movie about NWA like a VH-1 ""Where are they Now"" well, I would've hated it.<br/><br/>At the core of this Movie is something special. I'm sure people want to focus on the language but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I thought it would be and in fact as the Movie progresses and as we see the Members become more Mature the Language and the Violence lessens and lessens. The language wasn't half as bad as what some folks have written and I wonder if they actually watched the movie or if they watched the first 30minutes and said ""Well there's a lot of potty mouths in this movie"". I've watched movies that were popular and have had dramatically less foul language than this. <br/><br/>I'm saying that the language as a negative is pretty much bullshit. There wasn't really that much bad language and a lot of scenes it was quite the opposite, probably 80% of the movie has nothing to do with being ""Gangster"" or really anything to do with anything illegal. <br/><br/>What this movie shows are people with a dream trying to rise out of the social accepted ""norm"" set for them. It's not just about the movie tackling social-political issues but at the core it's about people, people just like me, just like you, just like anyone who wants to be better than just ""Surviving"", or ""Getting by"". <br/><br/>It is at it's very core a success story about the American Dream and it doesn't matter the setting or the race of people or anything of that nature. It's about these people struggling to find what all of us are motivated by and what this Country was founded on and how they pressed the times to change and by doing that created a path for them and others who are ambitious enough to try. <br/><br/>I can't say enough about the movie and it's positives FAR outweigh it's negatives (at least anyone willing to look at this for what it is and not what they WANT it to be). <br/><br/>I could write more about everything it did right and it did almost everything right, it is as close to perfect as it could be. <br/><br/>Now for the negatives, very few (hence the 9/10) the only 2 negatives I really have are: Pacing and some of the Characters got lost. <br/><br/>Even though the movie was about 2 hours and some change it didn't really lag at any point, it was very fast and went straight to major events in each characters lives. Some Characters (Dre/E/Cube) had more events of interest and so they got more time but it makes sense because honestly if you know NWA then you know it was those 3 who were the most interesting but having said that, to be unbiased I have to say that Ren (who had some notable scenes and story) got lost as well as Yella and even though DOC wasn't in NWA he was in the Movie and was a bigger deal to the group then the 2-3 scenes we saw him in. Also those 3 had very little speaking lines and felt more like a glorified extra's. <br/><br/>That's fine though because like I said; Cube/Dre/E were the 3 people that were the most interesting and so because of that I only took a few pts off for that but still an overwhelmingly GREAT FILM. <br/><br/>If you have an open-mind, a decent brain and want to see a movie that can inspire as well as provide GREAT ENTERTAINMENT; then I highly recommend this because this movie IS the American DREAM come TRUE and not something from the 1920s either; literally we get to see how people turn nothing into something of legend. <br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't ""get"" this movie is doing so because they have their own biased to deal with."

","Straight Outta Compton delivers a raw, edgy, and powerful film that is built to last for generations to come. Starting in 1987, a group of 5 individuals start what came to be, a musical movement that came in like a tidal wave. They together formed the group N.W.A and with their powerful lyrics, strong wills, and big dreams, they got the ball rolling for the hip hop and rap music industry that we see today. This movie does an excellent job of showing the hardships that these men had to go through. The racist cops, the threats from the FBI, and the government and media want to censor their art. They were given a voice with their music and the were not going to be silenced. Police tried to silence them and were subject to racism and misconduct, This can resonate with the people and the movement that is happening right now. The casting department for this movie did an excellent job of filling the giant shoes of the musical giants Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and more. Most of these were fairly unknown actors but each one of them did an outstanding job. The music and the style they portrayed were spot on and this lead to a fantastic soundtrack throughout the movie. This movie would be almost perfect if it wasn't for the side stories that they brought in throughout the later half of the movie. Without giving too much away, I felt that bringing in these stories may have lost some of the emotion and the intensity that had been building up throughout the movie. This movie has done an excellent job of its presentation of the hip hop and rap revolution in a fun, entertaining, and historical fashion. I would highly recommend seeing this film. <br/><br/>Average Man Score: 9/10"

","growing up listening to the NWA, WTC etc. I enjoyed this biography to the fullest. The actors mimicking the artists was very believable. Loved how they truly depicted the story of the group. <br/><br/>Don't understand why so many negative reviews. If it's vulgarity then these reviewers watch minimal amount of movies, mostly pg13 I believe. <br/><br/>Fans will love this and if you weren't a fan before then this movie will make you one.

"azanti0029","10","17","53","9 September 2015"," An incredible film that is about so much more than just NWA and succeeds on all levels
","Brought up in the UK in place about as far removed from Compton as The Moon NWA was a band that I could get into but not really fully appreciate the emotion and the anger behind the lyrics - that was until 'Boys in the Hood' came out. That movie brought a reality to foreign shores that gave us an insight into the birth place of this music. Now Straight Outta Compton gives you the story behind that music. I'll say out and out this is a MUST SEE SUPERB FILM which for me will rank as one of the most important films of all time. It probably wouldn't do the Police of the USA any harm if they sat and watched it then they actually might have a grasp of how they make people feel and in the light of the wave of Police brutality in America never has such a film been more relevant. <br/><br/>The film itself charts the rise and fall of the group from their humble beginnings of sleeping out of cars and recording tracks in friends garages through to their internal beefs, eventual break up and the paths leading to the potential reunion that was cut short by the death of Eric Wright from HIV. <br/><br/>So why is it so good? Well first off the performances of all the cast without exception incredibly well pitched. O'Shea Jackson as Ice Cube shows he can already hold his own against his father in his very first acting role while Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell play Dr.Dre and Easy E with a great deal of poise and sensitivity portraying them as flawed human beings and relating for me the films main theme - Division will always conqueror. Paul Giamatti brings a well rounded performance as the groups manager making it hard for you not to totally dislike him and so it should be. <br/><br/>But its not just the acting - While telling the story of one of the most influential Rap groups of all time the film manages to make two very powerful statements - <br/><br/>1) The fact that the issues the film raises about how a Police Force treats its citizens are even more relevant now than they were then. Rodney King was beaten some years after NWA was formed and what happened to him only reinforced the anger that NWA was articulating in their lyrics. A topic which middle class white America choose not to believe until they saw that video. Now this film serves the same purpose - It underscores what is happening in America now and the need more than ever for it to be addressed. The film may not have intended this but it achieves it 110% <br/><br/>2) The internal conflicts in the black music industry are highlighted so successfully that it makes you realise how much such feuds only serve the cause of those who want to keep people in their place. The futility of being so divided all the time which ultimately comes from greed or in the cases of some an additional sadistic mentality. (Surge Knight) The divisions here broke friendships some of which could never be completely repaired. The death of Eric Wright was something that didn't get as much press in the UK as it did in the states and I was probably only more aware of it at the time because of my interest in NWA and having lost my own cousin to HIV a few years earlier. The film underlines the need within the black music community for artists to be more mutually supportive of each others work regardless of which coast their from and what neighbourhood they were born in. <br/><br/>This film should be successful for all the right reasons and while it might not be 100% accurate for it to contain so much power in a film of two hours twenty minutes is nothing short of superb. It will of course be criminally overlooked at the Oscars I am sure. The film will serve as the perfect companion to Filmmaker Dylan Avery's documentary about Police corruption when it is released. I have no doubt what so ever that Eric Wright would be incredibly proud of all involved. This is the film that not only NWA deserve but all the people who ever grew up in Compton too."
"shadowyx12","9","18","57","23 August 2015"," A film with a message that will transcend generations
","When it comes to biopics, I can proudly say that 'Straight Outta Compton' now ranks as one of my favourites. Ever since seeing the trailer, I just knew that it was going to be something that mainstream audiences had yet to experience. The film holds no punches when showing the rise and fall of N.W.A – it introduces a level of intensity rarely seen in biopics. F. Gary Gray and his crew did a wonderful job in recreating some - if not most - of the rap group's defining experiences (with all the violence, racism, and betrayal any N.W.A fan would come to expect). The film also dives deep into each of the rapper's personal lives (or at least that of Eazy-E's, Dr. Dre's, and Ice Cube's) – displaying a sense of compassion and togetherness that's just as hard to forget as the brutality and grittiness.<br/><br/>The three lead actors - O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (Ice Cube), Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre), and Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) - all give great performances. However, if I had to choose one actor who particularly stood out, I would have to pick Jason Mitchell. His performance as the late rapper Eazy-E is gold. Despite not having any guidance from his counterpart like his co-stars, I felt as if Mitchell essentially made the role all on his own. From his character's rough beginnings as a drug dealer all the way to his depressing battle with HIV, Mitchell owns almost every scene he's in (it also doesn't hurt that his story-arc is the most dynamic of all the other characters'). I wouldn't be surprised if the cast of 'Straight Outta Compton' was nominated for some 'Best Ensemble' or 'Best Cast' awards. <br/><br/>The script is amazingly well-written. This is probably the only biopic that I have watched where I wasn't checking the time on my phone at certain parts; there wasn't a moment when I lose interest while watching ''Straight Outta Compton'. Simply said, there is never a dull moment. The pacing works. The structuring isn't confusing. All the emotional moments hit at the right time. And although it doesn't seem like there's a clear external goal for the characters to achieve (actually, there are several goals), this film works brilliantly as a character study.<br/><br/>SIDENOTE: I'm well aware of the release date for this film and certain events that have preceded it. However, for all intents and purposes, I will not be commenting on the socio-political aspects of this film. Aside from the fact that I like to keep focus of my reviews on the film itself rather than divulge into reality, I also believe that this film speaks with a strong, uncompromising voice that's hard to ignore. I don't believe the producers could have picked a better time to release this film.<br/><br/>I am adamant that 'Straight Outta Compton' will be remembered throughout generations. It is easily one of the best films I've seen in theatres this year and one that will make its way into many top ten lists by the end of this year. Everything – from the acting to the direction, to the production value – is top-notch. If you can somehow stomach the tough reality that these young men had to go through, then you'll find yourself watching a truly complex and profound masterpiece."
"alexkheir","7","17","54","15 August 2015"," Overall great movie
","Pros: - Very entertaining, 2h30m goes by fast.<br/><br/><ul><li>Pleasantly surprised by the fact the producers put a lot of emphasis on the political influence of the group. Heck, they played the Rodney King incident video 3 times I think! It was very interesting to see the police abuse and threat scenes and in a few of those you actually got to see the good side of Jerry Heller. The scene where they perform 'F*ck the Police' and get arrested has to be one of my favorite of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A lot of music. They played almost all the hits, and not just just 30 seconds of them, often it was almost the whole song.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Very good overview of the rap game back then. The story goes from them knowing nothing about rap, to NWA being huge, then separating, and then everybody knows the ending. RIP Eazy-E. Everything was there.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons: - Not enough of Eazy's gangster life before becoming famous. We all know he was the biggest gangster of the group and you don't get to see enough of that aspect. You never get to see Eazy hustle except for first scene of the movie.<br/><br/><ul><li>Escalated too quickly from when they know nothing about rap to when they're producing thousands of vinyl (before meeting Jerry Heller).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>THEY DIDN'T PLAY 'REAL MUTHAF*CKIN Gs'. How could they? It's one of the biggest diss songs in rap history! They played 'No Vaseline' from Ice Cube but omitted Real muthaf*ckin Gs? I think this was a huge disrespect from the producers, Cube and Dre. Throughout the whole movie, they purposely made themselves look better than Eazy who, most of the time, looked like the bad guy even though he was the one to fund the whole thing in the first place. This is what cut the line for me from a 8/10 to a 7/10.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too much drama and crying at the end. They should of invested more of that time on the three previous points I mentioned.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Did I mention they didn't play Real muthaf*ckin Gs?</li></ul><br/><br/>TL;DR Overall great movie. Very entertaining. Lot's of music. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube make themselves look good. Can't believe they didn't play Real muthaf*ckin Gs. 7/10."

","I loved LOVED LOVED this movie!!!! NWA was always my favorite rap group so this movie was just a blast for me. This movie definitely exceeded my expectations. This is among one of the best biopics I've ever seen. This has drama, comedy, action, thrills, and above all, and incredible soundtrack! I was also surprised at how well directed this was. It's got to be the best thing F. Gary Gray has ever done. The cinematography for this movie was surprisingly gorgeous, especially for the earlier scenes that take place in the 80's. It just has this beautiful golden glow that was just incredible. considering the cast of school the bunch of unknowns I thought the acting wasn't going to be the best.....it turns out that it was fantastic!!!! Everybody in the film gives a great performance! Even in the emotional scenes, they deliver. There is some great talent in this film and I feel like these actors should get recognized after this film. Paul Giamatti was great as usual. Only problem for me was that MC Ren's character was underdeveloped. Maybe he wasn't as popular as Dre, E, and Cube, but he felt sort of left out of the drama. We get to know every character in the movie (even DJ Yella), but Ren was just kinda there. Either way, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. This is a 9.5/10 for me."
"DrMaxLaugh","4","1","1","15 April 2019"," Could've been a powerful film, but was too ""Hollywood"" and one-sided
","I loved this movie when I was younger, but today I could careless for it. It covers no new ground, and tries to uphold the cast as heroes without a strong case. I still enjoy some of their music, but other than the infamous police song and some of Cube's solo work, their music did not uplift the black community or make the world more aware of sociopolitical issues. The movie alludes to that and tries to tell us this, but we see more of the cast trying to act cool than them fighting for a cause, making it unconvincing in my eyes (Although my younger self was fooled). Let's all be honest, no one listens to N.W.A to ""be informed"". Their anger, aggression, and bluntnesss sells the music, and the consciousness is an afterthought (this doesn't mean it's wrong to enjoy them though). This isn't a morality crusade, but simply acknowledging a problem doesn't make you heroic, you have to take initiative to fix it.<br/><br/>A lot of people say this movie is raw and gritty because of the swearing, violent imagery, and groupie sex scenes. However, that is more glamor than grit, and despite all the parental advisories about this film (Police at theaters making sure no one under 17 gets in, and FX plays about four different warnings before this film airs), it's very sugar coated and PG compared to the real story of N.W.A. Entire beefs were skipped, and details that made Cube and Dre look like jerks were skipped over too. I'd like to compare this to The New Edition Story. Although that was a PG-13 film, the cast put pretty much every thing on the table, even the details that made them look selfish or foolish, and showed that they did their fair share of dirt, even during their bubblegum pop days, making it feel more raw than this film. Here, we only see these sides of the characters if it makes them look more badass, making the whole experience feel contrived.<br/><br/>And we all know that Eazy-E did not cry during the release of The Chronic. His popularity waned a bit from N.W.A's heyday, but he was still releasing music and signing new groups and artists. In fact, he received a portion of The Chronic's income. I did not appreciate the fact that they made him look weak and cowardly in the second half of the film. They made it look like he was nothing without N.W.A, but he fared well as a solo artist and would've further expanded his brand if it wasn't for his unfortunate death.<br/><br/>N.W.A's story is vast and includes many characters and artists who followed their influence, so I could see why certain details and people were not included. But when the final product ends up as a sanitized story that boosts up two people and downplays everything else, it makes a very one-sided and dissatisfying film. And although the finale scene was meant to be a declaration of Dre's independence, it came off as very cheesy and overly ""Hollywood"". The way Suge and Dre talked in that scene sounded like something out of a Marvel movie, and was wholly unbelievable. There is some good acting, a few powerful scenes, and little doses of humor throughout the film, but these cannot make up for the story<br/><br/>Edit: The most helpful review on the site claims that the only reason someone could dislike this movie is because it dared to show ""angry black men"". Considering how watered down this film was, they weren't angry enough."
"Solid_Gold","10","18","58","24 August 2015"," Compton is back on the map
","This is one of the best movies of 2015, in my humble opinion. Actually, I rarely go to the movies anymore, but I made a huge exception to go see this one. What caught my attention immediately was the ethnic diversity of the audience. I haven't seen that kind of variety since I saw ""Rush Hour 3"", where half of the movie patrons were black, and the other Asian!! This shows how movies like ""Straight Outta Compton"" bring people together. It bridges the cultural gap. Middle-class people can catch a glimpse into the lifestyle of a teenager growing up in a low-income neighbourhood where often there aren't a lot of options that don't involve crime and welfare. At the screening I attended, there were a lot of Koreans. I wonder if this has anything to do with the history of poor relations between blacks and Koreans (merchants) in Los Angeles, especially during the Rodney King riots, and the shooting death of Latasha Harlins, who was a young black girl killed by a female Korean store-owner. <br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" was an amazing movie to me because I love the group NWA, even though I was still only a little girl when I first listened to their music. I was intrigued by their audacity, failing to give a sh about what anyone thought of them. They were raw and genuine. The actors did a great job of showing this. They interloped into a culture that saw them only as a skin colour, as criminals, as thugs and gang-bangers, and they won so many fans all over the world, of all backgrounds. Even Axl Rose dressed like them. <br/><br/>Little O'Shea did a fabulous job portraying his daddy. I wonder if it ever felt awkward for him. I love how he kept a notebook handy for whenever poetic inspiration hit him. <br/><br/>The concert scenes were outstanding as well. My only complaint is the blatant misogyny, but I did laugh at the word play they used by calling that groupie in the hotel ""Felicia"" after she performed fellatio on Eazy-E. I read that this was also an allusion to Ice Cube in the movie ""Friday"". <br/><br/>Great job, I cannot wait until it's out on DVD."
"daxman-72932","9","16","51","13 August 2015"," If you grew up with NWA then you'll LOVE this film! It's AWESOME!
","Wow... I mean.... just... wow. Bravo, bravo, bravo! ""Straight Outta Compton"" is not just good, but I'll have to put it up there with my ""must see"" movies of all time for so called ""black movies."" You know, there are certain movies that you simply HAVE to have seen in order to keep your ""ghetto pass"" or your ""black card."" Well, this is one of THOSE kind of movies.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I've seen a film worthy of a real, in-depth critical review. Because this movie was made with me in mind, I will give this critique its just due. Let's start off with the screenplay.<br/><br/>There were about five white dudes who put together this story that black director, F. Gary Gray, brought to life on the silver screen. The story begins just before NWA is formed and ends as Dr. Dre exits Death Row Records to start Aftermath--his very own record label. What happened in between is one of the most compelling dramas I've seen on film. Because I lived through the entire arc of the film, I couldn't help but to be overcome by its nostalgia and it's gripping narrative. I was literally reliving my ""coming of age"" years along with the film's protagonists. The story drew me in from the opening scene and ran the gamut of emotions until the closing credits. Note: the film's epilogue is worth sticking around for because it features a litany of stars both past and present who owe their careers to N.W.A.<br/><br/>No good story or great director can make a movie truly special without a great cast. I was very skeptical about the casting of ""Straight Outta Compton"" because only Paul Giamatti was a known quantity going into this project. However, I will give credit where it's due; O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., and Aldis Hodge did a tremendous job as Cube, Dre, Eazy, Yella, and Ren. Jason Mitchell really delivers a standout performance as Eazy-E. There are some truly unforgettable scenes that this young brother absolutely KILLED. The supporting cast was also noteworthy portraying such icons as Tupac, Warren G, Snoop Dogg, Chuck D, and Suge Knight.<br/><br/>I had heard a lot of chatter prior to seeing ""Straight Outta Compton,"" and much of it was less than positive. My biggest fear is that it would be like that manish woman, Wendy Williams' absolute disgrace of a biopic on the late, great Aaliyah. When I heard that F. Gary Gray was directing the film, some of my trepidation waned. When I heard just a few days ago that Oprah said it was ""powerful,"" I felt really good about the prospects of this film actually doing justice to these rap music pioneers and living legends. I can say now with full confidence that ""Straight Outta Compton"" did NWA justice. This ain't no after school special, and it definitely ain't no ""made-for-tv"" bullcrap. This film is legit in every sense of the word. From it's expensive production values to it's attention to detail with respect to the period, to the amazing soundtrack, this film is straight DOPE! I can't wrap up my review without talking about the centerpiece of this whole movie--the MUSIC! Oh...my...dayum! The music in ""Straight Outta Compton"" goes HAM!!! I'm an ol' skool music connoisseur anyway, but coming into my own in the early nineties really made the music of that era resonate with me in a uniquely powerful way. I literally knew every word of every song featured in the movie! I don't think I've ever been able to say that about a film before. From N.W.A.'s classics to Ice Cube's solo classics, to Tupac's ""Hail Mary,"" to Dr. Dre's ""Chronic"" album (arguably the greatest rap album of all time), the soundtrack of this film keeps you moving from start to finish. The official soundtrack by Dr. Dre features new songs, but the music that's actually featured in the film literally transported me back to some of the greatest times in my life. There's a scene where Dr. Dre and Snoop are coming up with ""Nuthin But a G Thang"" that will make 1993 come alive right before your very eyes! It was oh so very, very DOPE! Go see ""Straight Outta Compton"" this weekend. It's the best film I've seen in a long time. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll get mad as hell. You'll learn something you didn't know before. You'll think. You'll gain a new respect and a new appreciation for the struggle of being a black man growing up in AmeriKKKa. You'll celebrate how a group of young brothers from South Central Los Angeles took nothing but their God-given talent and an ""NWA mentality"" and conquered the world. 5 Big Starz for ""Straight Outta Compton."" #filmcritic"
"grehfeldt17","Null","17","55","3 February 2016"," ""Emotionally exhausted and morally bankrupt.""
","I watched this movie start to finish with no interruptions. I found it be poorly edited and paced and lacking any significant emotional buildup or catharsis. Yeah, Jerry is scum and taking advantage of the boys and probably Eazy E participated in it, but even the ""big reveal,"" that Eazy E. has AIDS was sterile.<br/><br/>Sug Knight was poorly played and that actor had no idea how to menace someone just by his presence. Physically he was almost too small to play Sug, but his size could have been complemented by camera angles and keeping him in the foreground.<br/><br/>It also seems that the depiction of the relationships between the original NWA members was very sanitized. With Eazy E getting the majority of the money and the other members getting very little (they eating steak and lobster and we eating burgers), they must have been multiple disagreements that lead to the group's disintegration.<br/><br/>Lastly the ending left little closure, Eazy E dead, and perhaps Dre and Cube back together, but at what level? All in all a very unsatisfying film, but maybe that's was the real deal for this group."
"urthpainter","6","17","55","17 August 2015"," About the music...
","and this will decide whether you like the movie or not. Note: like - not love or hate. This movie is neither as good as the hype, nor as bad as the blow hards. Its rests somewhere in-between.<br/><br/>I was very surprised by the time-line. In '89 I was listening to this music - a lot. Anyone young and into rap music at the time had this in their play list with 2 Live Crew, Public Enemy, Sir Mix A Lot, Stesasonic, 3rd Bass amongst others. But you have to understand I was also listening to De La Soul, Faith No More, and the Beastie Boys. I'd like to think now, looking back, I have a bit of perspective at NWA's relevance at that time. If we were left believing this movie - NWA had no peers, and no matter what people think, they did. Back to the point, it is astonishing how fast NWA made their bones, got distribution, and made it to every corner of the US of A. I should know, I was in a backwater corner - might as well of been living in a tree house by comparison to the urban vistas of this film.<br/><br/>What's good? The music is good. Dialog, and performances often have snap, humor, and a legit feel. There is some good acting, and you can tell a lot of work went into these performances. SouttaC is well produced - it has all the trappings: sound, shots, lighting, glitz, glamor - absurd % of hot chicks with flesh flying high in many an over the top scene. This shouldn't be overlooked, or under appreciated. People completely out of the NWA loop will also learn a thing or two about the members and events. But this movie is not made for educational purposes, and a lot of the material is not presented in a way that improves the film.<br/><br/>This movie has omissions - smoking, and smoking and, smoking and drinking. Yea, it is implied - but the reality of this behavior is flat not the film. There are also way too many throw away lines that are supposed to indicate other huge absences: like Cube's film career.<br/><br/>Who edited this? Was the director by the editors side? Maybe that was the problem - this movie has more chop than a fickle lake shore. Many (all?) of the heavy dramatic scenes fall flat, because suddenly everyone is crying, angry, yelling, fighting, bouncing - with no set up! How the hell is a viewer supposed to buy into these lives, when the films tempo and presentation of material is all over the place? Good guys, bad guys, grey guys - whatever! As in all movies, it comes down to the script. Very unlikely that the script was written how this film is edited, which leads me to believe this movie was attempted to be saved in post instead of extensive preproduction. It felt as though preproduction focused on character building, not character development, and integrating them into a cohesive work of art. Predictably, the last 20 minutes of the film is painful to watch, in large part due to the strict chronological unfolding of events. Many viewers will give this a pass due to content - I won't; it is bad film making.<br/><br/>Perhaps most disappointing is the formulaic approach: From out of nowhere, rise to fame, we are a brotherhood, money causes issues, band members fall out, everything goes wrong for the bad guys, but the good guys come out on top. What is this? A well produced episode of inside the music, or history of rock and roll? Reduced to it's essence, this is a pretty damn bland film - that never chooses exactly what it wants to be.<br/><br/>Love NWA? - you gonna like this movie. Hate NWA, rap culture? Then F off! Crazy how people go Way out of their way to hate and attempt to $#|+ on things they have opinions about. My attempt? Objective analysis. Did I mention the editing in this movie is terrible?<br/><br/>My rating - 6.5/10, rounded down"

","STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is another wannabe gangster movie charting the rise of a group of friends who start out as ex-cons and end up becoming worldwide superstars. Unfortunately for me, the subject matter is the music industry rather than drugs or crime, and I'll admit straight away that I have no interest in this NWA group or whatever they were called; I know Ice Cube from his acting career and that's about it. Inevitably this is a film that turns out to go through the motions, full of angry young black guys with a vendetta against society, singing songs full of hatred and misogyny. The film is one-sided and one-note throughout, with no depth whatsoever, and the attempt to make these deeply unpleasant characters sympathetic is quite laughable."

","Everyone knows that this is the film that deserved better. The lack of diversity seen in the nominations of the past year makes little sense when there's a film like ""Straight Outta Compton"" out in the stratosphere. Thanks to this film an entire new generation of kids will know about the forbearers of gangsta rap. NWA revolutionized the genre, stood up to police brutality, censorship, and a predominantly classist society set to denigrate people and keep them in their place. Telling the story of the founding members of N.W.A. (Niggaz Wit Attitude), this film covers the group's rise to fame, and their eventual dissolution in the face of animosity and greed.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" was only nominated for Best Original Screenplay which is ridiculous. It could have taken ""Brooklyn"" or ""The Martian's"" place for Best Picture, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. or Jason Mitchell could have easily been nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the place of Sylvestor Stallone. I think it's important to note that when people choose which actors and properties get nominated, they aren't looking to what stories are most important, but who deserves what more. The Academy is made up predominantly of white men. This body decided that a film that tells a story unseen before, and hasn't been given the needed credence, deserved a nomination for telling its story, but not the actual story. Though this was an audience favorite, and is as polished and important as any bio-pic, it apparently didn't deserve the same respect as a film about an Irish immigrant who defecates in a bucket. Besides being an important story, this film covers a lot of history echoed in today's news. For one thing police brutality is a major issue in today's media, though it has been an occurrence since our country's formation. The media is only now taking note of the multiple deaths of African Americans and other minorities by police, as well as their patent racism in complying with stop and frisk and other discriminatory police procedurals. The film depicts the group as members of the Compton community, and they are often harassed and arrested by the LAPD. Their music fights the system and calls for action by society at large, but they don't want to incite violence or rioting. The Rodney King riots work as a backdrop for the group's dissension from one another, as well as a retread of current events, including the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner.<br/><br/>The film has been accused of revisionist history which highlights the best of the group, but doesn't cover Arabian Prince's contribution to the group's start, or the domestic abuse by Dr. Dre on the women in his life, or the story of rap group J.J. Fad. Dr. Dre comes out of the film looking squeaky clean, which is unsettling, but for the most part it's a really spot on story. Most of the film deals with Ice Cube and Eazy-E's beef, their manager taking advantage of the situation to make a lot of money, and Eazy-E's illness and eventual death. This is definitely a film worth seeing, and one that deserved better than it got."

"Likes_Ninjas90","5","14","48","17 October 2015"," Although there are good aspects here it's an untidy synopsis of the group's history.
","I used to listen to rap music when I was younger, specifically Eminem. Modern rap music carries the novelty of the artist vocalising the most outrageous, angry thoughts, mostly of young men, and funneling them through an aggressive attitude that is simultaneously tough and funny. Today, I still enjoy some of this music, such as Public Enemies' song Fight the Power from the Spike Lee film Do the Right Thing. Eminem's biopic 8 Mile also impressed because it never felt like a vanity project and identified rap music as a dialect between impoverished black and whites in the city of Detroit. But while watching Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about rap group N.W.A, you're reminded of how some novelties, like the aggressive nature of rap music, are little more than a gimmick, the impressiveness of which dwindles with time. While undoubtedly channeling the group's music, the relentless aggression of this film wore me down—from the constant swearing in the dialogue and the verbal and physical confrontations—particularly at the merciless duration of two and a half hours. It's a pity the film's machismo and aggro dominates proceedings because occasionally, but not often enough, some involving elements, counter the film's relentlessness.<br/><br/>The film constructs an interesting historical mirror by characterising the rappers as victims of police brutality. The members including Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), soon to be actor Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr., Ice Cube's own son), Dj Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), were according to the film regularly interrogated and bullied by the police in California during the mid-1980s. The scenes at night time are infused with a sense of danger, particularly as the camera of director F. Gary Gray pursues the back of the actors with a tracking shot, like in an exciting open scene where a house is raided. Similarly, the interrogation scenes at night eerily mirror the contemporary events of Ferguson as the police bully and subdue the rappers, which further adds to their story's acute timing. There are also some fine scenes where the film displays the bond between the group and their manager Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti). It's the persuasiveness he instills into the character as he reminds the rappers of the opportunities he can create for them, which brings authority to his character. In the scene where he defends the rappers against the police as they force them to lie on the floor, it shows that, at least initially, they are people he cares about rather than business or pop cultural pawns. But these insights fall second to a structure that is annoyingly typical of biopics like Jersey Boys, where events are ploddingly skimmed over in succession, rather than unearthing the depth and personalities of the main characters.<br/><br/>The film portrays the rappers as an emblem of free speech rather than as people worth exploring, meaning the main rappers lack meaningful distinction from each other. Initially, it is insightful about how N.W.A came to create their most significant song ""Fuck Tha Police"" because it makes you understand what they went through to develop the song's attitude. The film though is curiously hypocritical, championing individualism and free speech in the face of police brutality, while also glossing over how violent its heroes are to others. In one scene, Ice-Cube uses a baseball bat to smash up the office of a businessman who owes him money. Similarly, in a hotel scene there's no criticism of NWA drawing assault weapons on their enemies and dumping a girl out on the doorstep. This scene also typifies the film's weak view of females, who are cast aside and have little impact on the story. In an early scene, the mother of Dr. Dre says she's worked too hard to have him spinning as a DJ, which is a cliché biopic trope where the parental figure doubts the talents of the subject. Meanwhile, further criticism has been launched at the failure to include Dre's history of domestic violence against women. These qualms would have done little to dispel the enthusiasm of fans at the screening, dressed in their N.W.A gear. The film caters to them to a fault by lumping events on top of each other and sustaining the aggro to the very end. I'd rather see a more disciplined version of the story because although there are good aspects here it's an untidy synopsis of the group's history."

"hughboyd88","8","16","57","23 August 2015"," A solid look at one of the most influential music groups in modern history
","Anyone who knows anything about hip hop knows the influence and importance of NWA. Even today, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are still some of the most well-known rappers in the game. I suppose that it was almost inevitable that a movie of this type would come out, and after watching it I can say it definitely doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>For those who don't know, Straight Outta Compton is the story of NWA, an immensely influential hip hop group consisting of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr). The first half of the film chronicles the group's formation from the streets of Compton. The second half shows their eventual falling out, the starts of their solo careers, and Eazy-E's death from AIDS. Personally, I think the first half is the better of the two. You can almost feel the anger of each group member pulsing off the screen directed at racist police, lack of opportunity, and society in general. However, the last half loses a lot of steam. Once the group has broken up, the films changes from a grand statement to more of a ""where are they know?"" approach. We see the beginnings of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's solo careers and Eazy-E's struggles of making it solo. At this point in the film, MC Ren and DJ Yella are more or less forgotten, sidelined to focus on their more famous counterparts.<br/><br/>Cast wise, there are certainly some great performances. Paul Giamatti adeptly portrays NWA's crooked manager Jerry Heller. O'Shea Jackson, Jr. bears a striking resemblance to his father, and gives a strong performance. The best of the bunch, however, is probably Neil Mitchell as Eazy-E, who does a great job of portraying his inner turmoil. Corey Hawkins seems a bit miscast as Dr. Dre, but still does a good enough job of portraying him.<br/><br/>Reading through some other reviews on IMDb, it seems like these reviews were hijacked by some sort of Baptist church or something. There is no ""explicit sex"" in the movie. The most shown are bare breasts, but it really wasn't anything noticeably more graphic than any other R movie. Also, it shouldn't surprise anyone that NWA would have parties with lots of naked women. I mean, it's not like they were ever shy about rapping about all the women they got. Other reviews call them ""terrible role models"" and ""thugs"". OK, the movie never tries to act like they're good role models. And the people calling them ""thugs"" and ""gangsters"" seem to be referring to the fact that they grew up in South Central and Compton. Oh well, the movie isn't for everyone.<br/><br/>There are definitely some issues with the film. As touched upon earlier, the second half of the film doesn't replicate the energy of the first. In addition, it becomes pretty clear that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube are the ones producing the film, as they, along with Eazy-E take up virtually all of the screen time while MC Ren and DJ Yella are delegated to standing in the background for most of the film, even though MC Ren was a larger factor in NWA's success than Dre, who really came into his own after he went solo. In fact, once the group break up MC Ren and Yella aren't even seen for at least an hour, only reappearing once the group reassembles, coming back into the fold with no explanation of what they've been doing or why they came back. Another member of NWA, Arabian Prince, stands in the background for about 5 minutes before disappearing altogether with no mention of who he was or why he left the group. While he did leave before the group became successful, his face is still on the cover of the Straight Outta Compton album yet gets less screen time than Snoop Dogg and Tupac, who weren't even part of NWA. Dr. Dre rides his high horse the whole movie. The director makes sure to show him standing up to Suge Knight's evil, but seems to forget the allegations of abuse directed toward him. Ice Cube is similarly portrayed as never doing wrong. Eazy-E is the only character shown to have flaws, which makes him the most interesting character in the group, and is portrayed in a more sympathetic light. Ren and Yella don't really have any development to speak of. Also, the movie makes sure to not address the often homophobic and misogynistic lyrics of NWA's music, instead making it seem like their lyrics are completely innocuous, with everyone taking offense to them being in the wrong.<br/><br/>Criticisms aside, this movie is certainly one worth watching if you are a fan of NWA, hip hop, or even music in general. If you are easily offended by language, or hate rappers just because they're rappers, make sure to avoid this movie. If you are interested in learning more about the World's Most Dangerous Group, this movie is a must watch."

","Straight Outta the theater! (But not really, I gave myself two days to process the film.)<br/><br/>OK I'll be the first to admit-originally I wasn't 100% sold on seeing the movie. It was from hearing very high praise from friends and family that watched the trailer that made me want to see it in theaters. That being said, the highly impressive reviews that came out opening weekend would have made me go see the film regardless of what others told me. <br/><br/>I went into the film knowing pretty much nothing about the group NWA. I knew Dr Dre. & Ice Cube were in it and I had heard a few songs. My lack of knowledge did not stop me from loving this film. <br/><br/>From the first scene, the audience gets sucked into an intense situation, and I found myself quickly forgetting that I was at a theater. The film introduces the characters one by one and eventually we witness them connect with one another. <br/><br/>Seeing the way their lives played out was non-stop entertainment. The actors portraying the characters all gave amazing performances. The casting really nailed choosing the correct actors because I had to keep reminding myself that these weren't the real members of NWA. Even cameos of popular artists stood out to me because the casting was perfect. Everything from their look, their lines, and most notably their voices, made the scenes memorable. <br/><br/>The soundtrack, of course, was one huge aspect to the film. The songs were always put into scenes at the perfect moment. The beats and the lyrics always matched with the mood of the scene, and I found myself nodding along with a lot of the songs. The flow of the movie was also very well-done. The scenes were so smooth that you don't realize the films over two hours & 20 minutes long. <br/><br/>This film is one that won't leave you. I went home after seeing it and immediately went to look up more facts about NWA. I keep finding myself replaying the scenes in my mind.

"Lawlass","10","14","50","16 August 2015"," Beautiful movie
","This is the most important movie of the year, in this time when race relations in this country are so strained. I am so glad that someone has finally produced a truthful movie showing the view of individuals growing up in a violent society and the challenges that each and every one of them faces. The most telling scene was that of a young Ice Cube on a bus - just a high school student writing poetry - when he is exposed to gang intimidation and violence. This was not my experience growing up in white suburbia, when I rode along in the safety of my school-bus in the mid 1980's, writing morose poetry (which I thought at the time to be rebellious, but was just an outpouring of boring adolescent melancholia as opposed to true suffering.) Rap is poetry and I truly loved the insight provided by that single scene of the sweet, observant soul of the poet becoming witness to what will inspire his verse. The rest of the movie is equally riveting in its lyricism, its acting, and its emotion.<br/><br/>O'Shea is brilliant in his portrayal of his father. Jason Mitchell left me speechless in the purity, sincerity and depth he brought to his role. O'Shea and Mitchell should each be nominated for Oscars."
"Red-Barracuda","8","13","47","4 September 2015"," Very well acted and exciting music biopic
","Set in the racially divisive cauldron that was South Central Los Angeles of the late 80's, five young black guys from the inner city suburb of Compton formed a hip hop group which would go on to revolutionise popular music. Straight Outta Compton is the biopic about the band labelled 'The World's Most Dangerous Group', namely N.W.A. They only lasted as a functioning outfit for a very short time but their impact has been lasting and profound. In many ways, their aggressive socially aware music and image did for hip hop what the earlier punk band the Sex Pistols did for rock music. In that they created a brand of direct uncompromising music that acted as a call to arms for many, while leading the band themselves into direct trouble with the authorities of their country. What followed of course was the rise of the popularity of rap music to the point that at one stage it was the most popular form of music on the planet.<br/><br/>N.W.A was made up of five individuals, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella, are all portrayed distinctively here with particular emphasis put on the first three, seeing as they were the most prominent members. The cast is superb, with a charismatic turn put in from Corey Hawkins as Dre, Jason Mitchell captures the quirky nature of Eazy-E and O'Shea Jackson Jr. is extremely convincing playing his real life dad, Ice Cube, who he has an uncanny resemblance to. Rounding things off is the always impressive Paul Giamatti in the role of Jerry Heller the bands manager – he is portrayed poorly yet never one dimensionally negatively, as he is shown to defend N.W.A when they are harassed and demeaned by the L.A. cops. Overall, the acting is of a very high calibre. The film essentially charts N.W.A's quick rise and fast implosion, with some focus on their highly confrontational debut LP, Straight Outta Compton, which included the song F*** Tha Police which led the group to national infamy and harassment from various law enforcements around the U.S.A. as well as a threat from the FBI. I remember at the time the controversy this song caused, yet only a couple of years later the world watched open mouthed at the footage of Rodney King being savagely beaten by the LAPD, leading to the guilty cops being shamelessly let off by the justice system which led to the L.A. Riots. It seems that N.W.A's song was talking of a truth that made a lot of people very uncomfortable but it was a truth nevertheless. This film works partly as a critique of America, in its highlighting of topics like police brutality and the unwillingness of the authorities to allow freedom of speech about such an issue.<br/><br/>The film also looks at the gangsta rap (aka reality rap) scene more generally, with appearances from recording artists like Snoop Dogg and Tupac, while Suge Knight and his label Death Row Records comes off very badly and seems to represent some genuinely negative elements of the rap genre. As the film progresses the melodrama increases as the band splinters off and public fights ensue between ex-members. But some of the most impressive moments are the scenes involving the music itself. There is particularly powerful concert footage of a Detroit show which was ultimately stopped by the police. Whether you are a fan of rap or not, it's hard to not appreciate the sheer excitement of this type of music when it is delivered so aggressively and committedly. By the end, it takes a depressing turn with the death of Eazy-E due to AIDS and the film doesn't sugar coat this, much to its credit. Overall, this is a pretty dynamic and exciting music biopic and is delivered with some gusto, although I often felt that if anything it downplayed the incendiary nature of N.W.A a little. But, whatever the case, this remains an excellent film which tells a story that fully justifies its big screen treatment."
"ClaytonDavis","9","13","47","19 August 2015"," F. Gary Gray's gift to the world and N.W.A.
","""It's the film of my generation."" I uttered that exact phrase to my wife following what was one of the most vibrant experiences in a theater in some time. An undeniable love letter to one of the most influential groups in rap music history, F. Gary Gray's ""Straight Outta Compton"" is a vivacious and powerfully timely piece that stands as the single best film of the year thus far. I can't recall a more prolific biopic that institutes its own sensibilities about its subjects with such adoration and respect. Acknowledging the absence of certain events in the lives of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Easy E, and simply approaching the film as a piece of fiction, the movie is damn near flawless.<br/><br/>Telling the story of the group NWA, as they emerge from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.<br/><br/>This is one of the best examples of a film where three leads are treated with equal focus and respect. Each performer, O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (portraying Ice Cube), Jason Mitchell (portraying Easy E), and Corey Hawkins (portraying Dr. Dre.) all deliver invigorating performances. Jackson, Jr., the real-life son of Ice Cube, lives inside the character, delivering lines of powerful meaning. Mitchell finds his stride early in the film, executing a charisma and charm that few actors can deliver in a film such as this. Oscar-worthy is too broad a term to describe his abilities in the film, it's downright sensational and something I'm sure to remember for some time. Hawkins grows into the role as each minute progresses, before launching himself into the psyche of Dr. Dre and dissolving into the man. Academy Award nominee Paul Giamatti follows the energy and arc of his character with determination and presents another strong performance for his résumé. Another strong standout is R. Marcos Taylor as Suge Knight, the closest thing to a conventional movie villain but an embodiment of greed and aggression.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is so much more than a biopic. It's a full- on musical epic, a character study that isn't shy about what it knows and what it decides to show its audience. The music is at the core, but the lives and message are what really drive the movie. Looking back at films like ""Selma,"" a film that captured the time so perfectly and effortlessly, Gray's film manages to create its own defining staples in our nation's history. It's honest about the truth of the streets. As someone who grew up in both the Bronx and Jersey City, two urban cities with its own fair share of hardships (and in no way comparing either to Compton, CA), I appreciated everything that the film chose to show and say. The hunger for money and acceptance, or the ill-fitting look of a man from the ghetto who sits in a house that is larger than anything he could have ever dreamed. The script and story by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge, and Alan Wenkus is littered with fantastic narrative elements and raw projections of these men and who they were/are.<br/><br/>Gray's film is not just an acting and storytelling showcase, it's also one of the technical marvels of the year. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Oscar-nominee for ""Black Swan,"" gives a polished and engaging feel to every scene he shoots. His decisions about framing either an emotional moment or a light chuckle for the audience to indulge, is simple mesmerizing. Editors Billy Fox and Michael Tronick take 147 minutes of epic storytelling, and never let up for a second. I was involved in every scene, every frame, and every trait that Gray's film had to offer. Composer Joseph Trapenese (another Jersey City native!) takes his opportunities well to inject a swell of sentimentality and passion when the moment calls for it. You don't expect a composer to shine in a film about a music group yet he does tremendously. <br/><br/>This is film is not for everyone. I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this film to many people unless I was sure about what films they typically like. It's vulgar yet genuine, and graphic yet sensitive. The music takes over your soul though. I've been playing N.W.A. music the entire time I've been writing this, letting the lyrics and beats take on a brand new meaning because of Gray's masterpiece. And that's exactly what the film is...a masterpiece. A film that needs to be considered by not just awards, but by all who love daring filmmaking.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is distributed by Universal Pictures and is currently in theaters."

How unfortunate one of the founding members, the pioneer, Easy-E is not alive to witness its release."

","Straight Outta Compton... Boy, was I mad hyped up for this movie. Like... really, really excited. Alas, the hype died slowly over the trickle of two hours.<br/><br/>First off... Who is the protagonist of this movie? Ensemble mosaics like Short Cuts and Magnolia have more clear through lines for multiple characters. The biggest problem with Straight Outta Compton is not that it is the story of a group, but rather that it hits the pitfalls that so many biopics do. It tries to cram too much. (Thus is the overwhelming genius of the ""Steve Jobs"" screenplay to avoid this cliché and walk down broken-structure lane)... It begins with Eazy-E as the protagonist, flows into clearly being Ice Cube's story, then loses the thread of Cube, goes hard on Dre during the Death Row years, and then somehow swings back around to Eazy-E's death as the climax of the film. It's verrrryyyy structurally sketchy, and makes it a bit of a bore in the final half as it tries desperately to cram in Suge Knight, Snoop Dog, Tupac, Bone Thugs, Ice Cube's movie career, Eazy-E's AIDS, The L.A. riots, Dr. Dre's police chase that doesn't have a resolution or consequence (?), and a bunch of pool parties. Honestly... Straight Outta Compton's second half walks harder than WALK HARD.<br/><br/>Now... let's talk about what Straight Outta Compton got very very right... The F**k The Police sequence... from when the boys get unjustly assaulted by the cops, through the Detroit show- that was one of the more electrifying 20 minutes of filmmaking I have seen this year. Honestly... masterful. The performances all around were good. Ice Cube's son does a great Ice Cube! Who figured? Anyway... There was a tragic mis-use of one of my favorite unheralded actors, Aldis Hodge (Ray Voodoo Tatum)... but then again... who wants the story of MC Ren? So I get it. All around though- the acting is very solid, and the first half of the movie had me buying into the hype hard. Really exciting. But, oh, that second half...<br/><br/>Finally... I was let down by the casting and performance of the gentleman playing Suge Knight. Not at one moment did I feel any sense of real danger from that actor. That performance was helped along by the legend of Suge, but as for the actual portrayal in the film... Soft. Too soft.<br/><br/>PS. How was Tupac recording Hail Mary in like... 1992?"
"texshelters","8","13","48","16 August 2015"," A visually and musically interesting story of one of the most influential bands in hip hop history.
","""Straight Outta Compton"" has Something to Say <br/><br/>NWA is credited with creating gangster rap, also know as reality rap for singing about the reality of the lives they lived. NWA lead to not only million selling albums for the band and their three main members, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E, but to Tupac, Snoop Dogg and more. <br/><br/>NWA was more than recording artists, they spoke for millions all over the nation who were oppressed by the police, including the ""Black police showing out for the white cop."" <br/><br/>The racist L.A. Police has had a history of abusing the rights of African Americans, especially in the 80s. That is one of the catalysts for gangster rap along with the war on drugs and crushing Reaganomics. Were the NWA performers the most talented in the L.A. scene? Certainly Dr. Dre and Ice Cube were. Eazy E comes off as a bit of a dupe and lessor talent. However, Jason Mitchell plays the rapper well. <br/><br/>The son of Ice Cube, O'Shea Jackson Jr., is excellent and he looks just like dad. Paul Giamatti plays a thieving white prick with aplomb. The rest of the cast also does well. <br/><br/>The scenes of the band performing on stage and in the studio are real standouts. The cinematography is excellent as is the sound mixing. The plot holds together, but like a turducken, they cram too much in. <br/><br/>There is no way they could have put every event in the lives of NWA in the film. Even so, some of the scenes are too long for their minimal content. Scenes are held too long after the point is made and story elements are evident. There are a few moments of self reflection in the film that weren't needed, and frankly, some of the exposition was redundant. <br/><br/>Otherwise, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an entertaining and educational film. <br/><br/>Rating: Full Price<br/><br/>Some of the sexism of NWA, and in Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's lyrics, comes out in the film; that is unfortunate. However, that is who they seem to be, and to be otherwise, would be false. <br/><br/>The film does cover some familiar biopic band territory of member's squabbling, producers ripping them off and so forth. It is most handled in an interesting way except from the drawn out scene with their manager, Jerry.<br/><br/>In all, it's a well produced film with great musical performances and a good hip-hop soundtrack from the days when hip-hip was still political and relevant and more than just a commercial success. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"hoxjennifer","9","14","53","29 August 2015"," Well done
","Straight Outta Compton deserves it's top spot in the box office. The negative reviews I've seen focus on the excessive obscenity in this movie, but honestly to those reviewers: what did you expect? This movie is about a rap group that popularized the use of excessive explicit obscene language and themes in rap music in order to portray the harsh realities of their daily lives. I think one drawback of this movie is that it does gloss over the not-so-pretty pasts of individual N.W.A members (ex: Dr. Dre's history of abuse towards women), but if you're going into this movie expecting it not to have graphic scenes of violence, sex, nudity and profanity, then you must have severely misinterpreted the trailer and forgotten what this film is about and who produced it.<br/><br/>My two cents on ""Straight Outta Compton,"" for what it's worth is that it is a well done movie. As I mentioned, some ugly details are glossed over and embellished, but otherwise from my preliminary research, I think this movie doesn't do a bad job of telling N.W.A's story. The acting is superb and compelling. Ice Cube's son as Ice Cube was perfect, and I don't think anyone would have captured his essence any better than Oshea Jackson Jr did. I can say the same for pretty much all the other casting decisions. (Shout out to actor that plays Tupac - he has a 5 minute scene, and except for when he talks - he NAILS the look completely!) Great movie overall, especially if you're into this type of music. I'm not a huge huge fan, but after seeing this, I was really tempted to go home and download the soundtrack:)"
"nsully6","10","13","49","16 August 2015"," Best musical biopic since Selena
","Now when I first saw Notorious, I thought Diddy did a good job on the movie; but as I got older and started to gain a more critical eye for movies, I thought to myself that Notorious was a horrible movie. Notorious, in my opinion, ruined Biggies legacy. As a result, I started to hate biopics in general. When I heard ""Straight Outta Compton"" was coming out, I was a little skeptical about seeing it and I was pessimistic. I said to myself ""whoever is making this movie is going to mess it up, and ruin NWA's legacy."" But I was wrong, this movie is one of the best biopics I have ever seen. I went to see it with my girlfriend and she's not a big rap fan but she still enjoyed it. The movie is real, it's raw and it's something we need right now, all people of every color need to go and see it. ""F the Police"" I first heard when I was about 8 or 9, and I learned Ice Cube's verse word for word in a matter of months so I kind of was anticipating this movie. I'm glad I didn't treat this movie like every other biopic that ruins peoples legacy and not go see it. I had an open mind with this. Now about the actors, I think they all did an amazing job. Jason Mitchell, who played Eazy E had the #1 performance over the entire cast. I think his performance is Best Actor Oscar worthy. Don't get me wrong, everyone else did an amazing job but his performance was spectacular. If you think about, Mitchell had to have the most difficulty to play Eazy E because he was the only one who didn't have any guidance from the real person he was playing. Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella are all still alive so they could give the best guidance to the actors portraying them but Eazy E is unfortunately not with us anymore and is incapable to guide Mitchell and say something like ""Nah this is how Eazy does it."" But everybody else had that guidance. O'Shea Jackson Jr had his father to guide him, Corey Hawkins had Dr. Dre to guide him but Mitchell didn't have Eazy which is why I praise his performance the most. Eazy E has to be proud of Mitchell because I know every single person who watches this movie will be proud of him too. The producers of this movie were very careful and they really took their time. Dr. Dre is a perfectionist in the music industry and with him being a producer on this film, you know it's gonna be perfected. Most biopics usually slander a person's image and it's usually the person who isn't involved in the film that gets slandered. Many people know that Jerry Heller has his lawyers ready to sue but honestly, Heller wasn't slandered at all in this movie. I didn't walk out the theater saying to myself ""Wow that Heller guy was really a piece of work."" The movie depicts NWA accusing him of skimming off the top which Heller denies until this day but there was no actual scene of showing him do the dirty deed. This is why I say the producers were very careful, they weren't out to slander anybody. Like I said, I didn't walk out of the theater thinking to myself any less of Heller. I think the most of him now. I see how he stood up for his artists and really represented them in a positive light. I love the scene where Heller defends NWA against the cops who were harassing NWA. It made me see Heller as a semi good guy, not the evil Jew many people think of him. I don't really see a lawsuit between the producers and Heller, there was no defamation of character. I pray to GOD this movie hits big in the box office, and I certainly hope, this movie wins big at the Academy Awards, it deserves it. It should be the first movie about rap to win Best Picture. Mitchell deserves Best Actor for his portrayal of Eazy E, F. Gary Gray should be the first black director to win Best Director and they deserve many other awards. All in all, this movie was exceptional and it will go down as one of the best movies ever."
"etrusley112402","9","13","49","14 August 2015"," Almost Perfect! If all history could be that fun to learn.
","I have been waiting 2 plus years to write a review for this film. 1988 changed my life when a friend dubbed me ""Straight outta Compton"" and Eazy Duz It. My 9 year old brain blew! I was worried that this film would come off corny. Knowing the characters has such a big part in the scripting and production made me nervous. This is not just a biography of a rap group, this is the birth of West Coast Rap and Gangsta Rap period! Enough props. Let's get to it...<br/><br/>The acting is amazing! The actors portraying the subjects are on point! Never does it seem overwritten or polished. Everyone is given their respects for their parts played and emotions aren't held back for the point of toughing these Gangsta Rappers. The human element is ever present and encouraged. Jason Mitchell deserves praise for his portrayal of Eric Eazy- E Wright! To go from crack dealing gang banger to the legendary figure dying from Aids, that tall order is filled almost effortlessly. Corey Hawkins as Dr.Dre was a great fit. O'Shea Jackson Jr deserves credit for his efforts to play his father. He deserved the role. Neil Brown Jr. (Dj Yella) and Aldis Hodge (Mc Ren)aren't as big of a role in the film which feels awkward if your a fan because they feel less important (In My Opinion). Paul Giamatti ( Jerry Heller) played the role well. Jerry was more a faceless character. Interviews with him at the release of the film didn't seem optimistic. He wasn't consulted about the part and I personally think it was a fair and just portrait. All in all, the actors did an amazing job translating the real life to the screen. So why the 9 instead of a 10??<br/><br/>I have learned to take reviews of movies with a grain of salt. Different strokes for different folks. Everyone gets their opinions based on their views and beliefs. As a huge fan of the genera as well the group, I wished the entire 4+ hours that was filmed was included. Of close to 4.5 hours of footage, the movie was trimmed to just under 2 and a half hours in length. Certain aspects were missing to me. Members like Arabian Prince and others had no mention. The film jumps straight into Straight outta Compton without mention of the first effort ""N.W.A and the posse album, which is available to hear. During a performance, the original version of Dope-man from said L.P. was performed rather than the Remix version available on the featured title. Small things like the World Class Wrecking Crew and things that led to the point in which the film highlights are absent. F.Gar Grey defiantly had his job cut out trying to give us all of the goods within an appropriate time span. All the small things aside as a lot of people aren't hip hop heads like myself, the major opinion from other reviews is the transition of the movie's plot. Characters like Suge Knight, Snoop Dogg, and even 2Pac seemed needless. Without spoiling the plot, there are a few minutes where information seems less important or unnecessary considering the intended story. Periods were you kinda wish they'd just move on come and go. Certain story lines aren't necessary and may dull the emotions being built up. For this reason, I gave it a 9. I don't say that to make anyone question seeing the movie though! If you've wanted to see the film for a reason or another, I highly recommend you do. The overall goal was achieved. The overall presentation is on point. This will make good money and most people will be pleased with their viewing. For all the hype over Suge Knight's reckless killing on the set to overall anticipation, the wait was worth it! I expected to possibly be let down and left feeling like I got what I asked for. Hopefully all parties involved were pleased with their portrayal. The effort is there and everyone who had a part in making this movie should be proud. Everyone who has a film made in their legacy should hope to have the same results."

At the very least it can be taken as an example of the rise, fall and aftermath of a band, and the pluses and minuses of the music industry, especially its seedy side.<br/><br/>Good performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr, playing Ice Cube, his father, Corey Hawkins as Dr Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E and Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, NWA's manager. Solid supporting cast.<br/><br/>Not perfect though: the movie does drift in the latter third or so. It's as if the writers and director didn't know when to end it, or at least know how to compress the post-breakup era into something succinct and engaging. I realise that the story of Eazy-E had to be told, but there surely must have been a quicker and/or more engaging way to tell that part of the story."
"Seth_Rogue_One","7","12","46","9 January 2016"," Good enough but a tad overrated
","It was decent enough but I expected it to be better than ""decent enough"" considering the sky high ratings... <br/><br/>The acting was okay but I didn't feel like any of the actors truly became the real people they were portraying in the same way that for instance Jamie Foxx did when he did Ray, or Jamal Woodard for that matter when he did Notorious... <br/><br/>But they did okay, Eazy E was the only interesting character though for me... And maybe Ice Cube (who actually is my favorite in the real group but in the movie it's definitely Eazy), they clearly took out any negative things about Dr Dre to make him the ""nice guy"" of the movie or whatever but it just made him a bit boring... <br/><br/>It didn't feel like they went into the depth of the characters either too much; you didn't get to know who MC Ren was at all... <br/><br/>They pressed the issue about police always harassing them a lot which to me felt like a trick to trick the viewers into liking the characters when to me at least it takes more than that.<br/><br/>But there was always something happening, for better and worse, better because it doesn't get boring worse because it all becomes a bit superficial and lacking true introspection.<br/><br/>It's a lot though to take almost 10 years of time from 5 different people (although mainly focusing on Cube, Dre and E) and squeeze it into a movie so it's somewhat understandable.<br/><br/>No real surprises though, at least if you like me know your N.W.A. history."

","Absolutely loved the first three quarters of this movie. However, it seemed as if some parts and scenes were dragging on towards the end. It gave off an almost conscious, lengthy feeling. It was brilliantly casted, and I was especially impressed with O'Shea. His Ice Cube mannerisms and facial expressions were uncanny. Jason Mitchell also did a damn fine Easy E in my opinion, and no complaints can be offered about Corey Hawkins' Dr. Dre. I feel as if Ren got skimped; regarding his amount of lines in the film, face time, and overall portrayal of his importance and how heavily he contributed. Overall, it was definitely worth a watch and the first half was superb, just schedule a bathroom break around 3/4 of the way through watching."
"ThomasDrufke","9","12","46","16 August 2015"," Records Left on the Table
","Part of the reason we love and hate celebrities deals with the fact that we live extremely different lives and it's just hard to relate to people who don't go through the same life obstacles as you. This film does a phenomenal job at taking that problem and turning it into one hell of a film, because not only does it bring you directly into the lives of Compton natives turned rappers N.W.A, but it tackles their lives in a way that feels approachable. All things considered, growing up in the suburbs of Chicago doesn't give me much perspective on Gangsta Rap, but I'd like to think listening to N.W.A's music gave me insight into the atmosphere in late 80's LA. Luckily, F.Gary Gray takes their lyrics and creates a masterful world around the beloved rappers. Straight Outta Compton is one of the best films of the summer and easily the most surprising film to come out in 2015 for me.<br/><br/>When I was in high school I listened to rap all the time, and being a white male, Eminem appealed to me the most. But I listened to my fair share of N.W.A, 2Pac, Nas, Jay-Z, and even some Wu-Tang. So I knew enough about the golden age of hip hop to be extremely excited for the film. But I was nervous, none of these actors had proved themselves before, and taking on the roles of some of the most iconic artists in rap or just music history is a difficult task to say the least. But all of them, and I mean all of them, absolutely killed it. O'Shea Jackson Jr playing his dad was also a big question mark. He obviously looks the part, but could he capture the mannerisms and personality his father had? Dang right he can. Acting comes from the eyes, and you can make or break a performance depending on how you play a scene with your eyes. Well, Jackson and Corey Hawkins, playing Dr. Dre, were terrific at selling each and every one of the emotional scenes. Jason Mitchell was also really good as Eazy-E. Talk about having to deal with emotional material, Mitchell probably had the biggest challenge considering the fate of E, but he nailed everything. And unlike another film that just came out (ahem Fantastic Four), I really bought into this group as a team and the bonds they all shared. It was clear from the beginning that these characters were from the same background and understood each and every one of each other.<br/><br/>Obviously being a huge rap fan, hearing all of the old songs in a theater with great sound systems was really gratifying. The Detroit concert scene was definitely one of the best scenes I have seen all year and a thrilling one at that. But I was so impressed by the way the actors were selling the fact that they made the music and performed it. I know none of them are actually rapping or spinning beats, but the actors and directing sucked me into the performances and studio sessions. It was cool to see 2Pac and Snoop make cameos as they both had a good amount of collaborations with Dre and the crew. I thought those scenes may take me out of the film, but the actors once again sold the performances so well. The film does take a step back in third act because it focused on everyone's solo adventures and veered away from the group dynamic. But that's the material and it doesn't translate as well to the screen as the first half of the movie did. I still loved nearly everything else about the film, especially all of the rap easter eggs and nods to other artists they included.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the emotional layer to the film as well. Like I said, usually it's hard to relate to characters like this, but the family like dynamic between the group brought me along with the good and bad times. So I felt for the guys when stuff hit the fan. I was glued to the screen just as much for the dramatic sequences as I was for the insane concert scenes. So overall, I really loved Straight Outta Compton. It surpassed my expectations and is one of the best films based on a music group or artists that I have seen. It's also one of those stories that you wish could have turned out a different way. I wish N.W.A could have figured things out and gave us more music. Because they were pioneers for not only rap but for people to have a voice in music and not care what other people may think or react to what you say.<br/><br/>+Surprisingly deep performances <br/><br/>+Thrilling concert scenes <br/><br/>+Surprise cameos <br/><br/>+Rap Easter eggs <br/><br/>+Great biopic <br/><br/>-Third act stumbles just a bit<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"Amari-Sali","8","12","46","15 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton presents what happens when Hip-Hop artist get the budget they want for their biopics, and end up with too much control over how their stories are told.
","While the film is certainly too grandeur to seem like something VH1 would produce as an original movie, all the flashiness, nudity, and jokes, don't necessarily elevate this film into something which should be taken as a serious film. For with so much nudity that this damn near seems like the soft core porn HBO and Cinemax have late at night, with a better story; and it seeming that none of the NWA members are ever taken to task for their less than scrupulous past, to truly call this a biopic would be a bit of a joke.<br/><br/>With that said though, it is a very entertaining movie and does remain consistently engaging over its two hour length. Something which cannot be said for too many films. However, being that the film tries to rewrite history by making it seem NWA was just a bunch of young men whose lives were about getting out of the hood, getting laid, making money, making music, and dealing with police harassment, it becomes far too difficult to say this is Worth Seeing. Hence the TV Viewing label for the movie does hold far too much back, likely for the sake of Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's current images, and being that the emotional scenes don't hit you hard in the gut, Straight Outta Compton just ultimately seems like a TV movie which had the type of budget hardly any network would ever approve for the subject matter."
"ironhorse_iv","8","11","42","17 August 2015"," You're now about, to witness the strength of street knowledge and you will love it. Straight Outta Compton was a pretty good movie
","The subject matter inherent in most gangsta raps, has always caused a great deal of controversy of the years. Criticism against the genre, has always accused it as a foul way of promoting crime, street gangs violence, disregarding law enforcement, profanity, misogyny, homophobia, racism, drug abuse, etc. etc to today's youth. I can understand, their concerns, but clearly, I feel like, music like that, has always been unfair singled out, because how often the music reflects, the reactions of deep problems within urban society not being addressed or resolved, within those in power. While, it's alright that some people can condemned the genre; it's also, alright that a lot of people see it, as a way, to protest or address the several civil injustices within America and its dealing with race relations. Like the late 1980s, where the genre gain a lot of steam, many in the present day seem hungry for a smart look, direct or indirect, at the black experience and race relations today or at least in recent history. It's no wonder, why this movie became an internet sensation, even before it's released. People want an outlet! People want to see people rise up, against the system, and tells how things, really are. Directed by F. Gary Gray, this biographical drama film, tells the story of one of gangsta rap's most famous hip hop groups, the N.W.A. from their rise from Compton to their fall from the Billboard charts. Borrowing its title from the name of the group's 1988 debut studio album, the movie follows, the same often popular music theme biopic film clichés. Still, it does delivered something new, by presenting and addressing a more relatable topic that been in the news as of late, which is the relationship between black communities and mostly white police. This is by far, the movie's greatest hooking point, and the reason why this movie made so much, money. While, yes, the inner-money struggles of the rappers, might be engaging to a point; in my opinion, the majority of people, probably coming in, are more likely to relate to the group's 'F*** the Police' message, than anything else, that the film is delivering. After all, it's not like these rappers, are as popular as they were in the early 1990s; while yes, they still have their cult-following and, still able to sport some main stream status, but majority of their music skills has somewhat died down. Ice Cube became more of actor than an artist; Dr. Dre does more backseat-producing than anything else, and Easy E, well, we know what happen to him. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have a great cast, and the actors chosen to portray these real-life men were amazing. O'Shea Jackson Jr as Ice Cube was a near-mirror image of that of his father. Corey Hawkins really look and act, the part. While, Eazy-E's son, Lil Eazy-E didn't get the role, Jason Mitchell, who portrays his father in the film, really looks the part. Still, while, the movie is technically about the rap group, it's more popular message about police brutality and racial profiling, outshine the inner dramas of the group or the group's music. The movie rarely focus the songs, if any. The film play small bits of it, but the majority of the music use in the film, comes from later albums that, each member of the NWA did, on their own time, when separate from the group. It's nice to see the inner-working of other studios such as Death Row, and the Bomb Squad, but it's has little to do, with the overall N.W.A story-arch. The movie focus more on the three members being apart, than the group, being together. It doesn't hurt the film, but it's somewhat noticeable. For those wondering how accurate the movie is, to real life, the answer is that, despite Hollywood injecting some of its flair into it, it's mostly a true-to-life. There were some changes, such as how the 1989's events in Detroit, really play out and how certain popular rappers were introduce, but the majority, is the same. Sadly, the whole 'Bye Felicia' one of the most famous scenes in the film, was totally fake. The supporting cast for this movie was pretty good, as well. Despite, looking odd with the dye white hair, Paul Giamatti as the group's music producer, Jerry Heller was alright for the most part. R. Marcos Taylor as the sinister Suge Knight, was just crazy. I really hope, to see more from this actor in future films. One thing, that the movie loves to do, is have cameos. Don't be surprised, if you see, actors portraying real-life rappers such as Snoop Dog, Tupac, Public Enemy, and others have some small screen time, in this film, even if they don't really connect with the main story. Even at one point, the script, call a scene between Dr. Dre meeting Eminem. However, the script was changed, at the last second. The movie pacing is pretty good. It never felt long. Overall: While, this movie has strong language throughout, strong sexuality/nudity, violence, and drug use that might turn away, some viewers. For me, it's was very enjoyable. By far, one of the better hip-hop biopics, I have saw, and I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but it is must-watch for any NWA fan. You will like it."

","The (mostly) true story of N.W.A is the sort of film that never let's up. There is no real downtime within the near two and half hour run time. For fans of classic hip-hop this feels like a non-stop roller coaster ride through iconic stories and important moments in the genre's rise into the mainstream. That said I can totally imagine that for someone who is less familiar with the key players in the story the fast paced nature may be slightly off putting.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this might be one of the best musician bio-pics ever made and a must see for all hip-hop fans."

","I liked watching this film enough to keep watching it. But, this film has a few historical inaccuracies because it has been Hollywoodized to some extent. What this film lacks is the full brutal reality of how the members of N.W.A. did terrible things to become famous and have powerful careers during a time where white supremacy influenced the American government that caused black people to be unrealistically depicted as criminals, gangsters, and drug addicts just because they were black people even though black people were the ones being unfairly oppressed by white people and black people who worked for the American government. Honestly, this film didn't pay enough attention to all members of N.W.A. It focused on Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice cube the most. Speaking of members of N.W.A. Members of N.W.A, Snoop Dogg, black activists, and other people were finishing what Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael started after the 1960's to make sure that black people had equal access to opportunities in America. However, this film made Eazy-E look increasingly weak in this film in an insulting way. Ice Cube became a Hollywood sell-out and was a pugnacious jerk to girls and guys. Dr. Dre was arrogant when he was young until he got screwed over in the music industry that had censorship, soul-selling contracts that underpaid artists, and manipulative perverts who were discreetly doing drugs, pedophilia, brainwashing of their clients, sexual harassment, B.D.S.M, and other things. That's why the celebrities got psychologically screwed up in the music industry. Celebrities became drug addicts, pedophiles, brainwashed, sexual predators, and immoral opportunists in the music industry. I feel that members from the N.W.A. got psychologically screwed up and got more corrupt in the music industry. I could feel the pain, struggling, hustling, and sincerity in the actors when they portrayed the characters in this film. So, I appreciate what the actors did in this film. I don't think O'Shea Jackson, Jr. looks like Ice Cube. O'Shea Jackson, Jr. and Ice Cube have their physical differences if you pay good attention to both of their bodies. From my experience, I think O'Shea Jackson, Jr. and Ice Cube are both handsome, talented, smart, and assertive hustlers who get things done. Jerry Heller looks like the Hollywoodized Jew that would screw someone over in the music industry. Besides that, this film has great music, good enough writing, talented actors, scenes that are convincing, and a diversity of characters representing real people to some extent."

I wasn't aware of Eazy E before, but poor guy. And obviously, the music is wall-to-wall rap, so if that's your jam prepare yourself for an aural treat.<br/><br/>And that's not even to mention the constant violence and bad language... but I suppose, considering the rough neighbourhood these guys came from, the racism of the police and the various 'grudges' the group members had along the way, it does kinda come with the territory.<br/><br/>This genre of music and gang culture is not really my thing, but by the end of this two-and-a-half hour 'epic' I didn't feel bored, and indeed I was quite enlightened as to what life was like during this period in history when N.W.A's and their contemporaries music began making it big.<br/><br/>Or in the unique wording of our profane protagonists 'this  is DOPE'. 6/10"

","I should note that having watched for instance also ""The Dirt"" about Mötley Crüe and checking some of the background story, that not exactly checking out a 100% of the time but touching the truth instead, I don't know what part of this story is real and what part isn't. I can only say how it felt watching this movie...<br/><br/>It didn't feel like Straight Outta Compton sugarcoated anything. It was more like a straight-up kind of experience with people using, abusing, walking into every single pitfall you may imagine no matter what ""side"" they choose to be on. The choices the based-on-real-life characters make are wrong a lot of the time, undermining the very opportunities presented to them by themselves, which is something they needed to recognize or maybe learn not to ignore.<br/><br/>Pitfalls... Not knowing that as an artist you're the business, not some manager, any manager, that steps up to you saying that say, ""Hollywood"" or whatever is the business. You have to have produce and you need to sell. That's something they themselves had to figure out. They were doing good, doing better didn't mean signing with a manager, it meant hanging in there. Did they need a manager? If they did, why had the manager already heard of them then?<br/><br/>Acting on impulses, listening to bad advice, that all led to trouble. Some lived to learn, some died, in real life too as we all very well know. I'm sorry to see not all lived to learn, but the movie, even though it can only be partially true to life, I think it's a fair warning. Do the business, enjoy your life but don't live it up beyond, sorry but I have to say it, love, keep working, don't fuck it up.<br/><br/>That's the one thing the movie didn't do that I do : rub morals into your face.

","It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but reading the other reviews, it didn't get a fair treatment in my opinion. It started pretty well, wonderfully highlighting the difficulties these young men went through at the beginning of their careers. The first maybe 45 minutes or so was pretty good. I believe we get to the record deal, but it may have been a little longer. <br/><br/>Then the movie kind of slows down. It seems to take forever, and honestly I kind of forgot what happened in the middle. I think the producer dude sells them out and the group breaks up. I'm not sure what happens, I just remember sitting in the theater wondering how much time has passed. <br/><br/>Near the end, it seems like the writers realized their movie was over 2 hours and they needed to finish it up. It felt like they quickly mentioned that Ice Cube made Friday, and Easy-E contracted AIDS. Then they wrapped it up in the last thirty minutes with Easy-E's death and I was left wondering if I watched an Easy-E documentary. <br/><br/>But all in all, it was a decent movie that was excessively drawn out."

","A interesting look into the band and the many struggles it faced. However, it's debatable if the film is completely accurate or not. <br/><br/>Has some good editing but not much unique cinematography, just rather conventional. The settings and lighting were very well done however; it has some very thoughtful locations that really add to the immersion. Some of the scenes are very well executed and extremely memorable. Most of the actors were quite good and look similar to the actual performers. The themes it focuses on were powerful and really added a deep layer to the film. <br/><br/>However, the portrayal of women is awful. There are either completely objectified or absent through most of the film. It can be quite degrading watching how they are shown."
"kmtw","7","6","20","19 July 2017"," Conflicted - Good movie but would Eric Wright wanted to be portrayed that way?
","As a movie, it's great. The casting was spot on and the actors are perfect. It keeps you on the age of your seat for the first 1hr 45 mins and then winds down from there. It has some humour in it and shows the human side of them all. They all have their flaws, but they have qualities that outweigh them. <br/><br/>I loved this as a movie. 7 is a high score for me and I would have given this movie an 8 if not for the last hour of the movie. The portrayal of Eazy-E struggling seems very disrespectful to me. If Eric were alive, would he have wanted himself being portrayed that way? He had a good solo career, he was working closely with Bone Thugs n Harmony who were nowhere to be seen. <br/><br/>It skipped his rap beef with Dre and his diss records to Death Row and Suge Knight. He even ends up bagging up cannabis to sell and make ends meet. It's very disrespectful to a man who isn't here to see that his legacy get's shown tastefully. He was a very proud man and would want to come across as stronger. <br/><br/>When Future generations watch this movie they will think Eric was a struggling solo rapper who couldn't function without NWA. The truth is he wasn't doing too bad financially, he had a successful solo career that was only slowed down due to his deteriorating health, and was helping many up and coming artists. He was still being paid for every record Dre sent out for the time he was under contract with Ruthless.<br/><br/>Despite it being a very good movie, it isn't the best biopic due to their portrayal of Eazy-E."

","Overall this is an eight out of ten movie but the problem is this is a film based on a true story. And they change a lot of the story. It wasn't like they changed the story to make the plot more entertaining or for continuity problems. They flat-out change the story for the sol reason of not making Dre look like a punk. I remember seeing an interview Dre gave about how Suge Knight knocked on his front door with a baseball bat in one hand, and a document saying Dre willing gives him the copyrights to all his songs. Dre admitted during the interview that he signed the contract right there and then. It is public knowledge. There really isn't a reason why the film had to depict Dre standing up to Suge. That just rubbed me the wrong way. Which is way I'm officially giving it a five."
"Challenger2013","10","11","45","18 August 2015"," Excellent Rap Biopic
","There are a number of very good period biopics out there. Here is another one. However, there are not many period biopics that reflect and define both the era in which they take place and the era in which they are released. ""Straight Outta Compton"" joins that short list. The film perfectly displays the rise of N.W.A. in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It also fits into the scope of where we are now in 2015. A year after the Ferguson shooting, and amidst the rising accusations of police violence, the film's message and content could not have come at a better time. <br/><br/>It may seem hard to believe that N.W.A. released their debut album 27 years ago, considering how much their influence is still felt. This extremely well-made film, directed by F. Gary Gray, leaves out a few factors of the group's rise to prominence, but does not take any shortcuts. These characters are presented as misogynistic gangsters, some of which previously had lives selling drugs, and are taken as they are. It's quite remarkable how the film still manages to present these guys as heroes despite their flaws and upbringing. That's what the film is all about, but I did not expect it to be done so well or convincingly. <br/><br/>Every performance in the picture is exceptional, but I'm choosing to focus on the main three. First off, O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father, Ice Cube, in a strong, convincing manner. He steps into his old man's shoes and develops the role. We see Cube's shift from a kid trying to survive in Compton to a furious, influential man who advocates against police brutality following the Rodney King shooting (in an excellent scene in which he argues with a reporter) and pumps up the crowd with a ferocious tone and booming voice. Next is Corey Hawkins, who feels the role of Dr. Dre. This character is special because he is the most relatable. He's the one who gets caught in the middle with the feud between Cube and Eazy-E. He's the one we're still thinking about the most when the picture ends and the one we want to succeed most. Hawkins delivers a commanding, yet perfectly subtle performance that sticks with us long after the credits roll. Last but not least, there's the excellent Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. In a film full of stand-out performances, he delivers most. As the leader of the group (mostly) a strong performance is needed from Mitchell, who gives more than is necessary, in a good way of course. He delivers the biggest laughs and the deepest sobs. He is exceptional and deserves to be noticed for future big roles. <br/><br/>Not only are the actors spitting images of the real-life artists they portray, the embody them completely with the help of a terrific script filled with surprising laughs and deeply moving moments. The new ""Fantastic Four"" film happened to be released a week before this film. After seeing the two films on consecutive nights, I must say that I would take this rag-tag group of gangsta superheroes over that un-unified group with amazing powers. That's what these guys feel like in this film: flawed, raunchy superheroes that take on the world.<br/><br/>A film not only of its time, but also of the moment, ""Straight Outta Compton is one of the year's best thus far, and one of the top three films of this summer. Like Eminem's excellent 2002 film ""8 Mile,"" you do not have to be a fan of rap or N.W.A. to enjoy this movie. Whether or not you agree with what these guys stood for, give their film a chance."

","This is a landmark film that will have staying power beyond the history of rap music. In order to understand the power of this film it is essential to understand the history of the environment from which this music genre emerged. South of the City of Los Angeles is a small city of about 100,000 called Compton. A quarter of the residents live below the federal poverty line. About a third of the population is less than 18. Although demographics have changed to a latino majority recently, the African American community found available housing here after WWII. Situated near Watts and South-Central, the area has suffered the ravages of gang warfare, drugs, with internal corruption and mismanagement of the City. As the Civil Rights Movement slowly got started during the last century, voices began to speak out: James Baldwin, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Black Panthers, Angela Davis and Maya Angelou. In the sixties, the Black Panthers shouted out black pride. The popular music from the sixties (R&B, Motown) was never an overt statement of protest, but the message was there although veiled (""Dancing in the Streets""). Around the time of the Nixon administration, it became the mantra of politicians to ""get tough on crime."" The end result of this misguided and ignorant approach is today's mass incarceration of Black men and the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. <br/><br/>With this history as a backdrop, the film begins in 1987 and explores the driving forces that pushed this artistic movement, a movement driven from the street by young men, straight out of Compton and into mainstream America.<br/><br/>From Compton, many rap artists emerged but among the first are N.W.A., Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. The cast give performances that stress the reality of the daily life in any community ravaged by illicit drugs, society's benign indifference regarding basic social support services and always the presence of the police. Rap and hip hop have now continued for thirty years. It is time to acknowledge this history and listen to the message very carefully. This film may be the finest production to date on this theme. The young men who created this sound in Compton and other cities speak in a coarse street language about anger, fear, humor, love, sarcasm and frustration. But there is a warning: things must change. The film is divided into short stories of the forces that caused the artists to write verses in a percussive rhythm where melodies have largely been discarded. They immediately found a following in Compton. The actors portraying the rappers made their characters very real. Paul Giamatti portrayed their first agent ""Jerry"" and nailed his part. Mr. Giamatti is probably the finest character actor on the screen today. Sadly, the women in the film were dehumanized and made ornamental and insignificant. The middle of the movie slowed a bit until Eazy E's story. If this had been fiction, it probably would have seemed contrived. But the fact that his death at just 31 from HIV was true, skillfully drove home the fact that life is short and temporary. The photography could have been a distraction with the hand held jiggling camera, but it worked and complemented the coarse reality of the story. <br/><br/>This film's release turned out to be perfectly timed. It is much more than a Saturday night date movie. It is a historical reality check. It is a cinematic chapter in the special history of the Black equality movement that is far from over. But for now, these artists spoke to America and the world, straight outta Compton in a 6-4 Impala."

"jadepietro","9","10","42","7 September 2015"," Straight Up...One of the Year's Best
","(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: The film doesn't play straight with the facts but it is superior filmmaking.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+<br/><br/>Now I should say straight out that rap music is not my particular inclination when I want to hear some songs. (Honestly, I'm more a Broadway show tunes and R & B type of listener.) With that in mind, I went to see this movie with some trepidation and found it to be involving and yet riveting in a detached way. <br/><br/>And boy, did I feel old watching Straight Out of Compton. Resembling a wannabe Barbara Billingsley jive lady, I felt out of sync with the rhythm and rhyme, a genuine generational relic ready for the scrapheap of life. Let me state upfront that the film does have its flaws: All of the characters and their attitudes in this film were an unpleasant lot, off-putting and repellent people with very little remorse for their actions or possessing any redeeming values other than their passion for their art. The film also takes its subtle glorification of these real life boyz-from-the-hood and their pro-drug life-styles to some exaggerated heights without showing the ramifications of their actions, which I found slightly disturbing. But the film's many assets outweigh some minor missteps along the way.<br/><br/>Straight Out of Compton takes place in 1986 and shows the origins of the hip hop music industry. It's the beginnings of gangsta rap, with lyrics laced with profanity and urging violence acts against the establishment, specifically any symbol of authority be it the police or any embodiment of law enforcement. A group of street-wise musicians broke new ground with their unique brand of music that is all too commonplace today. The group was called N.W.A., formed by three friends: Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr, Ice Cube's real son), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell). and this biopic depicts their rise to fame amid adverse conditions, many caused by their own making.<br/><br/>While the film paints an incomplete picture of true events and its facts are somewhat skewed, it remains a powerful look into a time when revolution and unrest became part of the mainstream. The film never truly delve into the darker side of these performers and their complicated lives, skimming across some of their more violent acts and anti-social behaviors. The historical accuracy is a bit lax with misogyny and homophobia present in the storytelling but downplayed in this film, especially in the case of Dr. Dre's record of abuse toward women. (Perhaps the reason may lie with two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre themselves who could only go so far as to depict the real story behind the music which diminishes the film's real impact. The truth obviously could not set them free. It also plays fast and loose with the pivotal roles of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and their contribution's to N.W.A.'s mega-hit status. (A sixth member of the group, Arabian Prince, is not even mentioned.)<br/><br/>That said, the movie is expertly directed by F. Gary Gray. The direction keeps the action moving at a brisk and showy pace. He encompasses his narrative with a vital raw energy and much cinematic style, successfully incorporating the music within its plot. Many of the incidents shown on the screen are fascinating to watch without emotionally connecting to this moviegoer.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff is literate and riveting while loosely based on the facts. They create believable characters and capture in their dialog the street jargon with much authenticity and bravado. As the group begins to splinter, so does the film in its third act. Still it is strong dramatic fodder as it takes these real life characters and makes their roles bigger-than-life, giving the performers plenty of opportunities to showcase their musical talents and acting abilities. The casting is very strong throughout the film. Particularly outstanding are the three leads who all give break-out performances, especially Jason Mitchell as the trusting member of the group. R. Marcos Taylor plays Suge Knight as pure evil and Paul Giamatti plays their ambitious and shady manager, Jerry Heller, and makes his interpretation of a predictable role even more intriguing.<br/><br/>Did the film make me appreciate the world of gangsta rap more? No. But I was enraptured by the cast and its talented director. Straight Out of Compton is a well-crafted film and worthwhile viewing, especially for seriously-minded film-goers and fans of this musical genre. It deserves many of the accolades it is presently earning. Straight up, this film is one of the year's best."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","10","42","15 August 2015"," A biopic that educates and resonates with some small errors
","Biography adapted films are sometimes risky depending on the topic. The biggest risk is making sure that all events related to whomever the biography is about are true. For this to work there are a couple of factors that need to be considered. First is the time period. Depending on the time period, certain events and facts may be difficult to research. Second are the people being portrayed. For individuals that have never been heard of before, the only way for someone to know how to portray them is by studying records of their behavior and then interpret it themselves. However, for more recent times it has been a lot easier for such access to various information. Then again, there is no greater person to help with this kind of project than the person themselves. Take it from Ice Cube and Dr. Dre who produce this movie about themselves, when they went from the bottom straight to the top in the rap group Ruthless & N.W.A.<br/><br/>There really is no better way to make a film about yourself other than directly being involved with it. Then add F. Gary Gray as director with writers Jonathan Herman (his first writing credit) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center (2006)) and you have a recipe for successful storytelling. It's quite a feat considering only one writer had a credential that showed promise. F. Gary Gray was a nice choice due to his work in other films and his best known film to date being Friday (1995), which also starred Ice Cube. For a biopic on a group of artists, it has a natural tendency to educate audiences (especially the ignorant ones) about why Ruthless & N.W.A. acted the way they did and why they did it. The main plot is about how Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, MC Ren and Eazy-E rise, fall and recover from their fame after making a name for themselves. Specifically, the music they would create related to the people being oppressed by the police officials in Compton California.<br/><br/>This section of writing is what really the educational part of the story is. As displayed throughout the film, for those who were not aware of the situation going on in California, many considered Ruthless & N.W.A. pimps that glamorized and emphasized the negatives in life. But as clearly stated by one character, ""Our art is a reflection of our reality"". It does not get any more real than that. Along this being its strongest element, it is also its weakest because that particular social undercurrent is not focused on enough. The rest of writing analyzes the rest of the characters from startup and separation of paths. This is fine and develops its characters, but in some ways it feels like it slights the main point. That's not to say the actors that play the characters aren't noteworthy though. Playing Ice Cube is his son O'Shea Jackson Jr. who can not only act but (thankfully) shares his father's looks as well. Along side Jackson Jr. is Corey Hawkins (as Dr. Dre), Jason Mitchell (as Eazy-E), Neil Brown Jr. (DJ Yella), and Aldis Hodge (MC Ren). All of which have great chemistry with each other and all act with true emotion.<br/><br/>The only other actor who has almost the same amount of screen time with them is Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, Ruthless & N.W.A.'s first producer. Giamatti as Heller is convincing in his role and does play a significant part in the groups history. The only thing that doesn't look right is Giamatti's horrendous looking wig. It just looks too fake to be his. Couldn't there have been another wig that looked more realistic? And just for fun there are a bunch of other references either to past events or nods to other celebrities. There's (not real) appearances of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) head of Death Row Records, Tupac (Marcc Rose), Snoop Dog (Keith Stanfield), mentions of Boyz n the Hood (1991) etc. For those who remember those moments and enjoy revisiting the past, the nostalgia will be memorable.<br/><br/>Matthew Libatique is credited as the director of photography for this production. For all of Libatique's camera-work, there's great lighting, and an exceptional demonstration of showing the transitions that went through the artists lives from beginning to the end of the movie. For the scope that the camera captures, ranges. There's a mix of wide panning shots but only to show the scale at which events were occurring. There's also shaky-cam effects, which although aren't welcome most of the time, end up doing okay for the moments that call for them. This usually involves frantic scenes but that's it. The music, of which this biopic is based on definitely has the beats. Although the soundtrack music is mostly lip-synched to the actors, it feels authentic. Joseph Tranpanese composed the film score although there were not a lot of scenes that needed instrumental music. Trapanese just fills in for the sentimental and tense moments. It's the usual cues but all anonymous and that's good since it's a biopic on rap music.<br/><br/>Aside from the writing's initial social undercurrent that is unfortunately let go of over time and Paul Giamatti's awful looking wig, it is a well made film. The actors have authentic chemistry with each other, the music has catchy beats, the camera-work is well lit and a lot of its writing paints an educational picture about the ups and downs of the fame life."

","I have read a bunch of the reviews. An awful lot of the reviews are trying to start a race flame war that with ignorance and just sad, sad words. Let's get something straight. This movie doesn't glamorize the time that it is portraying. It doesn't paint the members of N.W.A. as saints and healers. They are the product of what was around them. They are men who took their talent and made music that entertains millions and reaches across racial lines to unify us as a people to understand that we don't have to be oppressed. We don't have to be scared. The used the weapon of the time to strike back and the MAN did not like it. He came after them with and tried to intimidate but they didn't back down. None of them. This movie took me back to that time. I remember all of that turmoil. The strife the change in music. Now, I look at it and say these guys did something. This movie may take a few liberties with the stories. They change a lot of things but it captures the essence of N.W.A. If you want to taste the late 80's - mid 90's. To get a feel of how it was check this movie out. You'll be impressed."
"jwwes","10","10","43","18 August 2015"," One of the best biopics of all time!!!
","First just let me say that there are a lot of haters on here. While the movie in a few instances is not exact historically because of creative license it does an excellent job of putting 10yrs into under 3hrs. I question whether some of you have actually seen the movie by the ratings and vague summary you gave. Yes the movie has violence, guns and strong language but that is mostly from fist fights, news footage from the LA riots, personal conflicts and the use of casual swearing by adolescents and young adults. Heck, it's a movie about the life story of a rap group growing up in South Central LA during the height of gang activity and the crack epidemic. The criticism of the sex in the movie is over exaggerated as it is only actually seen in ONE scene throughout the entire film. Of course there will be naked women around during parties and women showing their breasts at concerts. I've seen another movie from last year in particular where the swearing was used ridiculously just to add affect to weak dialogue and it didn't get the same criticism. The only drugs you ever see is marijuana (weed) and that is it. In my opinion there is nothing over exaggerated in the movie so it is what you would expect of the environment surrounding an up and coming popular music group with the usual groupies and drugs. If they didn't put it in you would complain that the movie was fake and tried to glamorize these legends.<br/><br/>With that said I found the movie very entertaining. There wasn't a boring moment where you were thinking to yourself ""just get to the next scene"". There were highs and lows. There were plenty of funny moments, sad moments and moments that made you reflect even on your own life especially if you grew up with nothing and may have possibly turned your life around by using your talent to gain wealth.<br/><br/>The acting of these up and coming stars was superb in my opinion. The casting was almost flawless. Corey Hawkins killed it as Dr Dre. He was very believable and I'm sure it is due to his Julliard background. O'Shea Jackson Jr. does a great job of portraying his father Ice Cube especially since he already has his likeness, but it even took him some serious training just to get the part. Jason Mitchell does a great job as Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright to which the movie pays tribute to and he dramatically handles the contracting of HIV and dying. The only major actor in the movie; Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, was great but what can you say, it's Paul Giamatti. The entire dialogue and cinematography was great throughout and made you feel like you were watching history unfold.<br/><br/>The director F. Gary Gray does an excellent job of compiling the life stories of this historical group and transcends their legacy to the screen. The scenes shot directly in LA and Compton were captivating and gave you a since of what it was like in the mid to late 80s with the police brutality and gang violence. There are several scenes of nights on Crenshaw Blvd with low riders hitting switches and people out having a good time.<br/><br/>I didn't won't to completely give anything away about the movie but wanted to give a since of what the movie is supposed to convey to the viewer. Use your own judgement and go to a theater to watch the movie for its cinematic value. I'm looking forward to purchasing this on Bluray to add to my collection and I hope to get an extended version to see the scenes which were edited out."

","I am noticing a pattern with all the 1 star reviews here. They all seem to be writing a line and then missing a line and then writing on the next line. Why would every 1 star review be written like that. It makes me think that there are lots of fake reviewers trying to bring the score down.<br/><br/>OK over to the review. This film is excellent in highlighting the behaviour of the good old American police and their treatment of young black men. It shows that people just want to get on in life and it should matter not which neighbourhood they come from. Unfortunately there are people in the US that are already at a disadvantage just because they happen to be born in a particular area.<br/><br/>This film has a very powerful message and deserves to be seen.

Now that I am an adult NWAs music is a but much for me, but their message about police brutality and growing up as an African American in America is much needed. People want to bring up members past but the movie is about NWA not each member individual issues it would turn into a 10 hour movie. SOC is 2 1/2 hours and I didn't want it to end and I've seen it 3 times already because it was so inspiring and good! The acting was superb and the storyline/directing was even better! The film focused mainly on Ice Cube, Dr Dre and Eazy E because they and Eazy's wife were the producers, but I wish they would have given MC Ren more shine he was made to look like a hype man with occasional speaking scenes. Great movie can't wait for the DVD Directors cut!!"

"owen9825","6","9","39","7 September 2015"," Too much is unexplained
","For a movie that lasts so long, it was somewhat of an achievement to leave so much unexplained. I had to keep asking myself why various events were happening, especially the forgiveness towards the band- member who seems to arrange a greedy structuring of the profits. I was also left wondering what DJ Yella and MC Ren contributed to the band.<br/><br/>I really only felt any sympathy or connection towards Ice Cube and Dr Dre − perhaps this was because Ice Cube apparently had a big part in the making of the movie and perhaps Dr Dre put up a lot of the cash for the project.<br/><br/>The end of the movie felt incomplete, as so much was left unanswered. I know that Dr Dre is successful now and I know that Ice Cube did some acting later in life, but I don't know what ended up happening to pretty much everyone else in the film. I believe a film should be complete, I don't feel that I should need to take a pop culture history lesson to enjoy it."

","First of all, if you don't like gangster rap from the eighties nor biographies you probably should not watch this movie because you probably won't like it. But if you do like that kind of music then you will love this movie. I for sure did. It brought me back to my youth and it got my attention for the whole entire movie. It could even last for two more hours to me, I would still be pleasantly entertained. Of course you get a movie with a lot of music and that's the real bonus for me. I love N.W.A. , Ice Cube, Dr.Dré etc... so it was like listening to my CD's and watching a documentary about the gangsta rap movement. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is definitely the star of the movie. Maybe because he is Cube's son and you definitely can tell he is. His physic and mimics are just the same as his father. Really well played I thought. I miss those bands when I think about it now. Those were the best days of Hip Hop. So if you're a fan of this music then you should watch Straight Outta Compton. You won't be disappointed. To me it was one of the better movies/biographies I saw for the last years. Word!"
"erinkay641","10","9","40","26 September 2015"," Beautiful & Moving Story
","I saw this yesterday and I am so glad I did. The one star reviews of this movie are honestly making me very angry. It seems that people have very narrow views of the world and are upset they were exposed to a slice of peoples' lives that don't align with what they think is right. People comparing it to a porn have obviously never seen any actual pornography. This movie is poignant and moving. Yes, there are scenes with women wearing little or no clothing. People have sex. NWA blew up and surrounded themselves with beautiful women, as many celebrities do, but these are the same people who don't say a word when reviewing Wolf of Wall Street, James Bond movies, etc. <br/><br/>The top review right now that is showing on the MAIN PAGE for this film on IMDb says ""Were black men so aggressive and shameless during the 1980's?"" Are you kidding me?! If you go to see this movie and that is what you come out with, then you have some prejudices that are deeply embedded in your personality and a movie, unfortunately, can't change that. <br/><br/>First things first - the casting was spectacular. O'Shea Jackson Jr. and his dad could be twins, I swear. The entire cast actually look very similar to their real life counterparts. The actors and actresses in this movie were incredible and obviously felt a deep connection to the roles they played. The talent in these men, especially those playing Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy E, is off the charts. I hope to see much more of all these actors. These men lived hard lives and were born in a rough part of the world. They struggled and suffered a lot of hardship. They worked hard to get to where they did. This film doesn't gloss over any of the less pretty aspects of their lives in Compton, nor the fact that people continued to try to silence them and refused to see past their skin color even when they started to become well known. I love seeing the camaraderie between these young men - they look out for each other when no one else will. I cried twice during this movie - if there were people who weren't touched by this movie, they must have hearts of steel.<br/><br/>Are they angry? Of course they're angry. Look how they got treated by police, by people in general! Look how black people today STILL get treated like that! This movie is incredibly relevant to a lot of the issues going on in our society now. Anyone that thinks this movie is glorifying the thug life obviously missed the entire point of the movie and apparently turned their ears off during the scene where they LITERALLY discuss this exact sentiment. This movie seems to have offended those who live in a bubble separate from the real world where bad things happen to people and where people sometimes don't behave in ways that you think are ""upstanding."" News flash, it's a movie about NWA. If you didn't think there would be swearing, sex, and alcohol and drug use, you didn't know anything about the group or the time period or the places it was set in and you seemingly know nothing of the world in general. Sometimes people don't talk and act and experience things in the same way as you, and that doesn't make them inferior, it doesn't make them thugs, and it doesn't make their voices any less valid. <br/><br/>In summation, this movie is beautiful. It's real. It's raw. It's not whitewashed and toned down so as not to offend racist people's views of what black people should act like and what roles they should be relegated to. That's what NWA was all about anyway, not putting up with other people's crap and not allowing people to put them in a box and tell them what they can and can't say/do. I love NWA's music. My sixty year old white parents loved this movie. It's actually long enough to flesh out a complete story from beginning to end without racing through things like a lot of movies seem to do nowadays. The acting is brilliant and the camera doesn't pan away when things get real. I think everyone should give this movie a chance. I'm so glad I caught it while it was still on the big screen. It's a brilliant story about the hardships and the triumphs of a group of men who overcame a lot and fought hard to be successful. I will absolutely be buying this movie on DVD when it comes out."
"bardia-moose","9","9","40","16 September 2015"," An Unapologetic Biopic That's As Powerful As The Group It Follows
","In the 80s, a revolutionary new group enters the limelight, changing music and pop culture forever. Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A's first ever album, proves controversial with its brutal, yet honest, depiction of life in Southern LA . With guidance from their manager, band members Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and MC Ren trail-blaze their way through the industry, scoring fame, fortune and a place in history. <br/><br/>Cleverly devised and rhythmically paced, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is one of the most powerful biopics in recent memory. The cast is fantastic. Watching these guys perform really makes you believe they went through all this; you lose yourself in the story, and find yourself transported back in time. <br/><br/>O'Shea Jackson portrays his own father, Ice Cube, and while there's an uncanny resemblance in his appearance, it's ultimately more than how he looks; it's how he acts. One could say the only reason his performance is as good as it is here is because he knew his father better than most, perfectly channeling that and delivering something genuine. But I, for one, would like to see more of him in other roles. <br/><br/>Visually, the film is beautiful to look at; which comes as no surprise once you realize who the cinematographer is. Matthew Libatique, who's worked on Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, as well as Iron Man, shoots this brilliantly; giving each scene it's own unique voice. There's a noticeable haze during the earlier moments, when they're on the streets of LA, that gives these scenes a nostalgic tinge. And then there's the electrifying use of vibrant colors during the larger- than-life concert scenes that completely immerses you, making you wish you were there to experience it all. <br/><br/>If I had one gripe, it'd be that the film loses some steam towards the end. That's about it. I don't care if it sugarcoats things that happened with the real N.W.A; I judge movies on what they show, not on what they don't. This is an important, educational, and, at the same time, great movie that unapologetically touches a sensitive nerve that's, sadly, still relevant to this very day."

","'STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Music biopic about the popular 80s/90s hip hop band N.W.A. (an abbreviation for Niggaz wit' Attitude), from Compton, California. The film focuses on rappers Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren and DJ Yella. It was directed by F. Gary Gray; who also directed the 90s' comedy classic 'FRIDAY' (which was co-written by and starring Ice Cube). The movie stars O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (Ice Cube's son), Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins, Aldis Hodge, Neil Brown Jr. and Paul Giamatti. It was written by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge and Alan Wenkus; Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Gray were all producers on the film as well. I really enjoyed the movie and found it educational (and inspiring) too.<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1986; when friends Easy-E (Mitchell), Ice Cube (Jackson, Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Hawkins) formed the rap band N.W.A.. MC Ren (Hodge) and DJ Yella (Brown Jr.) later joined the group; although this is not covered in the film (as their parts are not fully developed). Easy-E first bankrolled their project; and formed his own record label, with producer Jerry Heller (Giamatti), called Ruthless Records. After releasing a hit single, 'Boyz-n-the-Hood', and doing a successful show; the band was later picked up by Priority Records. The movie covers their entire rise and fall from fame, as they caused a music (and social) revolution. <br/><br/>I've never been a huge rap or hip hop music fan, and I never followed (or listened) to the group N.W.A., but I did enjoy learning all about them in this film (and I do now like their music). For me the movie was very informative, and I also really liked the style (and look) of the film (thanks to Gray's excellent direction). The performances are decent enough, and the social commentary couldn't be more fitting to the times today; the film largely deals with race relations and police brutality (and it doesn't seem like much has changed, between then and now). The movie's a little long, and slow paced in places, but for the most part it's very entertaining and inspiring; what's more beautiful than watching talented rebel artists change the world?!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/iHtyjLDJ1Ko"

","Eazy-ly one of the best movies of 2015 but I always been a fan so I still remember all the fuzz around the group and the impact it had on hip-hop and also in my personal life.<br/><br/>A lot of things shown in the movie really surprised me because I was worried they would make it unrealistic by making them bigger than they are. Luckily this was not the case and you get to see how how they get beat up and even how both there managers take advantage of them because they're ignorant about the business world.<br/><br/>The length of nearly 3 hours went by in a flash and besides the story being good I wish they gave a little more time to Ren and Yella and more from their background would not have hurt the movie. On the other hand maybe they did not want to tell it and than I'm definitely cool with that.<br/><br/>There was a lot of talk on the violence and sex in this movie and I red reviews saying it was pornographic and it really makes me wonder if we watched the same movie or it was just written to demonetize the group and there for this movie.<br/><br/>I also do not understand why you would watch this if you have nothing with gangstarap other than to trash this because it's not your flavor.<br/><br/>I somehow get the vibe that what was being done with their music is now happening with this film,people coming with strange arguments to not have to say that they fear strong black individuals.<br/><br/>For me this was one long party of recognition and it just looks wonderful what the power of music and rap can do. The drama is really well dosed in this film and you laugh and almost cry but most of the time I was just nodding my head, agreeing with it all,and enjoying the dopebeats by Dre.<br/><br/>The acting ,the story and the decades of good music all combine very well and make this a must see for any real hip hop fan out there.<br/><br/>N.W.A.s music will always live on but now you have also something to watch while listening.<br/><br/>N.W.A. 4 all Eternit.E."

I'm not the biggest fan of rap music but still found myself interested in the origins of this group that spawned a popular culture. The Rodney king incident shown during the film really did reflect on how far things still haven't moved on since those days and how much police brutality goes on not just against the black community but also people of all races especially from poorer backgrounds. If only they'd done that to the Wall Street bankers before the recession Maybe we would not have have such a crash. One rule for the rich and for the poor.

","If you're interested, then this movie will be interesting; at least for a while (more or less the first 90 minutes of this 2 ½ hour bio-""epic"". ""Straight Outta Compton"" tells the story of revolutionary rap group, N.W.A. (Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dj Yella). Kicking off on the streets of Compton, California 1986 and documenting the groups rise as the pioneers of ""gangsta rap"", their tumultuous break up, allegedly due to underhanded management from Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and introducing branches of rap legends which expanded from the N.W.A. tree, e.g. Snoop Dogg, Tu-Pac, etc. Problem is (much like that last sentence) the movie is just too damn long! And once Eazy-E starts coughing, the whole thing turns into an after school special, primarily due to an overarching repetitive atmosphere which director F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off) seems to choose over subtlety more often than not. <br/><br/>There were a few sequences that made me lean forward in my seat (The live performance of ""F--- the Police"", for one) and the script itself from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center) does its job; even going above and beyond at times, inserting a few ""audience winks"" throughout (I mean, there's even a ""bye Felicia"" joke thrown into the mix). But it was the acting which was undoubtedly the stand-out aspect of this movie, highlighted by a performance from Ice Cube's own son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., who, in his first ever acting gig, hits it out of the park playing his father. <br/><br/>Here's the problem: The difference between ""Straight Outta Compton"" and an actual N.W.A. album is one carries a gritty, raw authenticity, and the other stars Paul Giamatti. <br/><br/>Not to say that there aren't guns in this movie (or drugs or police brutality for that matter) but the fact that ""Straight Outta Compton"" looks so cinematic is an issue. <br/><br/>When comparing this to a movie like ""Boyz n the Hood"", which while ""fiction"", portrays an honest and personal look into the streets of Los Angeles during a similar time frame, I can safely say that I remember finding myself absolutely immersed in John Singleton's depiction of said setting; to the point where by the end I felt as if I knew the neighborhood without even setting foot in the neighborhood. In retrospect this form of direction aided in my bond with other aspects of the film, acting as the connective tissue between me and the characters on screen. <br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" portrays true to life characters, all who actually grew up in Compton, but Gray's glossy (and viciously repetitive) direction really gives viewers more of a distracting XD version of a story that deserved a grittier presentation. Final Thought: It is obvious that Gray has a talent for music video direction and the cinematography here is technically perfect; just not for this movie, and thus curbing my viewing experience and creating a disconnect which resulted in me getting bored after the 90 minute mark. <br/><br/>By the way: Everyone who isn't dead, in prison or white gets out of this film scot-free. And while I am not an expert on the breakup of N.W.A. (I was around 5 when it actually happened) the fact that this film took 10 years (as stated by Ice Cube himself) to make, leads me to believe a multitude of financial parties had to come to an agreement as to what could be shown and what past actions could do damage in the court of public opinion, and thus would need to be left on the cutting room floor. So, just a heads up: this is not a scathing expose detailing Dr. Dre's abuse towards women, or anything like that. That said, this fact should not be held against the film itself, as it really has no bearing on ones viewing experience. Still, I believe that audiences have the right to know before entering the theater."

Music is universal and we can all communicate/understand ones life & struggles through it. Especially for these song writers. Back then, they were risking their freedom and reputation by playing/rapping about their lives or whatever they wanted.

"brando647","8","6","24","15 October 2016"," A Solid (but Over-Long) Music Biopic on the Origins of N.W.A.
","N.W.A. hit it big with ""Straight Outta Compton"" in 1988. I was only about four-years- old at the time and, by the time rap music fell on my radar, I was in high school and, with a few exceptions in that era, I wrote the genre off as something I wasn't interested in. I was a classic rock kid. Sue me. Anyway, modern rap hasn't done anything to change that but I have gone back to check out some of the earlier stuff I'd missed thanks to STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON and realized I might've been a little hasty in dismissing an entire genre of music. That's how I know this movie is good; it was able to ignite a respect for something I previously couldn't be bothered to care about. It was the same with Ron Howard's RUSH in 2013. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, from director F. Gary Gray, details the meteoric rise and eventual divide of West Coast rap phenomenon N.W.A. Aspiring artists Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) band together with their friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), who's developed business acumen from his time as a dope dealer in Compton, to bring a message to the people that they're tired of the oppression and abuse of power from local law enforcement on the black communities. We see the power behind their music inspire a generation of people to rise against their oppressors, while at the same time shady dealings between Eazy-E and their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamiatti) lead to fractures between them.<br/><br/>N.W.A. was a five man team but STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON seems to focus on the three key players: Dre, Cube, and Eazy-E. If you're a fan of MC Ren or DJ Yella, I'm sorry to tell you but they're essentially background players in the scheme of the movie. At least Ren steps up as N.W.A.'s main writer once Cube goes solo, but Yella doesn't get a whole lot to do. As long as that doesn't cause you too much grief, you're in for some amazing performances from Hawkins, Jackson, and Mitchell. Hawkins gets some meaty material for Dre as a man dedicated to his craft and determined to be successful, and Jackson (real life son to Ice Cube) is spot on as an angry artist and the only member of N.W.A. with the gumption to call out Eazy-E and Heller for ripping them off. But, in the end, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is Mitchell's movie. Eazy-E is the most compelling character in the roster and Mitchell is given the most engaging character arc in the film. Eazy-E goes from street-smart dope dealer to millionaire, stepping on the backs of friends to get there, and comes to realize what he's sacrificed for success. Mitchell is a scene-stealer and, despite the way he cheats his friends, he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie. The character is complex and, as someone I'd never seen act before, Mitchell nails it. Even Giamatti pales in comparison as the group's self-serving manager, a man I can't pin down as genuinely evil or just playing the crooked music industry games.<br/><br/>The story behind the rise of N.W.A. is a pretty awesome one. Seeing as how most of the members are still alive and probably had a certain light they insisted on being painted in, you'll know you aren't getting the full story but, at two and a half hours long, you're still getting plenty. The movie covers what are, I figure, the more important points. We get key moments in the studio, including a reluctant Eazy-E's recording of ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" line by line and the birth of ""F**k the Police"" after the guys are harassed by some cops outside the recording studio. We see the rise of hard core rap and the effect it had on the populace, surely contributing to the outrage of police harassment and abuse. The movie focuses primarily on the Rodney King event and the following riots in Los Angeles where the guys saw their dire warnings come true as the oppressed fought back. The movie also manages to stuff in scenes with appearances from Snoop Dogg and Tupac so fans will have something to nudge their friends and point at the screen about. One of the better story elements in the movie comes in the form of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) when he poaches Dre over to Death Row Records; Taylor has an intimidating presence and can pull off crazy eyes that'll stop anyone in their tracks. The last half hour or so starts to drag when the movie starts going down Eazy-E's redemption path and introduces his AIDS but that first two hours is pretty solid. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a movie I never thought I'd love but there you have it. It's even got me listening to some of the early west coast rap to have come out of the era. And if that's probably the best compliment I could give the movie."
"storm_mica","5","6","24","27 June 2016"," Okay musical biopic..
","Okay... ""Straight outta Compton"" meant nothing to me before I saw this film. The rapping sounds of NWA and their tales of woe weren't near as popular outside the US as there; plus I'm a Jazz and R&B musician so regarded most rap music as s h i t; plagiarised grooves and riffs with someone yelling words over it; hardly original and far less soulful than the original... And a turntable / sampler is NOT a musical instrument... however; it is what it is.<br/><br/>I found the back story behind NWA and the offshoot acts from Compton quite compelling but no more so than most other musician bioflicks... (Ray; Walk the Line; The Doors etc etc..). The movie was enlightening to me and the characters were painted and acted well. <br/><br/>I found it dragged toward the end and it sort of petered out in a way."

","I was hyped about this film ever since I saw the trailer a few months back and finally got around to seeing it. Very satisfied with the end product. I'm a big fan of N.W.A., Ice Cube, and Dre so seeing young portrayals of them was riveting. O'Shea Jackson Jr. looks so much like young Ice Cube it is ridiculous. He had all the mannerisms and voice of his father down. The film offered a view at the creation of some of the wonderful tracks in the groups catalog like ""Fuck Tha Police"", ""Express Yourself"", and the title track. Its crazy to think that the group was around for a short time, yet became such an influential and iconic group in hip hop. I was very satisfied with the portrayals of the members of the groups. There is some stuff left out with events that transpired with Dre, and the more misogynistic element of N.W.A.'s music but its no biggie. Its so nice to hear some classic tracks from not only N.W.A., but the various solo efforts of the group, among other West coast acts that are featured in the film. Music biopics are usually hit or miss; I can safely say this one was a hit. Dramatic elements, the music, the rowdy atmosphere of the late 80's, and the raw energy of Compton and aggressive hip hop was all captured in this film."
"cultfilmfan","10","10","47","22 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton
","Just like I commented on last year's film Selma, I feel that the new film Straight Outta Compton about the rise of the rap group N.W.A. and it's group members including Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, could not have come out at a more crucial time. The film does indeed work very well as a musical biopic of the group's rise to fame, but as well as being a powerful film about the lives of the members of this rap group, the film also touches on key issues that were happening in the late 80's and early 90's and that are still affecting America today. The film depicts police brutality and the racism of the police at that time toward the African American community. People being stopped on street corners and harassed by the police for doing absolutely no crime, or misdemeanor other than the fact that they were standing at the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also incorporates the famous beating of Rodney King by police officers into it's story as well and the film works just as powerfully as Selma, as a statement against racism and against the powers that be that are suppressing and promoting racism, but I would argue that out of the two films, Straight Outta Compton is the better film and while some may argue that this film glorifies violence and gang behaviour, I would instead argue that it definitely depicts the everyday lives of these people and shows how they have made themselves in a society full of violence, narcotics and racism and how they struggled against these things and still managed to come out on top as one of the world's most influential groups and that was very impressive to me. The film still does depict the violent and sometimes offensive lyrics of N.W.A. and shows people trying to live the gangster type of lifestyle, but I think at the same time that some of these people were definitely a product of their surroundings and the home environment and world where they came from and how the system and society around them was often times failing them, yet at the same time these men grew for the most part out of the stereotypes and made names for themselves. Another interesting aspect of the film that it touches upon is the whole issue of censorship and freedom of speech. As anyone familiar with the group's lyrics and public performances can tell you, the group and it's members were often getting themselves into trouble over their lyrics and content which later resulted in arrests and threats from the Federal Bureau of Investigation against the group. One song in particular that addresses the corrupt and racist nature of the police of that area around the time was a particular instigator. Yet again, these young men were saying through their own type of poetry and street wise language and commenting yet again on the here and the now and because there was so much racism in that area and the police were at times racial profiling and just brutal towards the African Americans, it is not surprising the that particular song was so powerful and almost in a sense became an anthem for young people at that time. The film when it works as a musical biopic is also very powerful and well done. All the usual elements are here including arguments amongst the group and the shady business people they encounter and the typical lavish and yet unscrupulous way of living that resulted from the tons of cash their music was bringing in. I was surprised at how well this film turned out and how much I loved it. Everything about the film was done right. The acting which was mostly from an unknown cast (except for Paul Giamatti was the group's manager) all deliver exceptional performances here and of the films I have seen so far this year, I would have to say that this film has the strongest acting and ensemble cast of any film that I have seen so far this year. So kudos to these up and coming actors as they really got their stuff together and knocked it out of the park performance wise. F. Gary Gray's direction was also very impressive to me. I wasn't sure how the film would look and turn out with him as a director, but I would say this is his finest accomplishment and best direction to date. The film is at times gritty and very suitable for it's urban setting and at other times can be flashy and lavish as these young men are taken out of the ghettos and moving into more established areas and also doting more money to their homes and way of life. Yet those earlier parts of their life still affect and are part of their lives which is another powerful point of the story and the film does a good job of balancing both worlds. The film while it is longer it length certainly breezes right past you and is certainly the most entertaining two and a half hour film I have seen in awhile and it is so involving and captivating that it feels like there is not a single wasted moment, or frame in this whole picture and the pace and rhythm of the film is just perfect. Straight Outta Compton works as the most entertaining film of the year so far definitely, but it also works on a social scale as well and delivers a message that was important at that time and is still incredibly relevant today and just as powerful also. One of this year's best films."

","This movie accurately chronicles the rise of N.W.A. and the aftermath that has come out of it. O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s portrayal of his father, Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Sr.), is uncanny. His look, ,his mannerisms, and facial expressions were all spot on. All of the actors they found to represent the members of N.W.A. and other rappers portrayed in the film are all spot on in my honest opinion. I know this movie is getting a bad rap for the way it depicts law enforcement, particularly the LAPD, but those were different times and things have come a long way in the last 30 years both in law enforcement and racism. I would recommend any fan of N.W.A. see this film."

","I can understand the backlash of so many for the depiction of the LAPD and Torrance police. Being from California and witnessing a lot of police brutality I can say that there are just as many people that can vouch for this picture's portrayal. If you were to ask me about my encounters with law enforcement it would sound like a movie, a lot worse than SOC for that matter and I'm not a criminal or gangster. My thing is that if you've never lived in an area that you have an opinion about do me a favor and do a little more research because your online knowledge can only widen the social gap. Being a story about the African American ""American Dream"" I say it was a great story and will be happy to see the rumored sequel."

Reviewers are complaining about language, violence and nudity in the movie...Really??? Have you ever heard of N.W.A.? If you liked NWA, you will like this movie. Even if you didn't like NWA, the movie is still very interesting. I took my wife to the movie (She did not want to see this at all and was not a fan of the group) and she loved the movie. Yes, there is a lot of bad language(Have you heard their lyrics?). Yes, there is some sex scenes(bare breasts is all that is seen). Yes, there is some violence (mostly police harassing the members of the group). The movie itself focuses on the most famous members of N.W.A in Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Easy-E. The movie is 2-1/2 hours and could have kept my attention for longer. There just wasn't enough time to focus on MC Ren and DJ Yella. There was not much new information on the group that an avid fan wouldn't know already. But if you were an avid fan, you won't care. The acting was very good and the script was well written."
"jamie-96378","6","8","37","29 August 2015"," Tale of two halves
","Just as this film is a tale of two lifestyles (poor to rich) it is also a tale of two halves.<br/><br/>The first half of this film up until the Detroit concert is excellent, I really enjoyed it and the chronology was sound and character arcs well developed.<br/><br/>The second half however lost focus a bit, while still good, it became more a TV movie biopic rather than the class act that the first half was.<br/><br/>I think the original cut was over 3 hours long and they reduced this down - however maybe they should have left it 3 hours as there are some crazy omissions from the film. The LA riots aren't given appropriate screen time or gravitas, Cubes album the Predator isn't mentioned - despite being the most successful and relevant album any of them made bar Dres The Chronic. Speaking of Dres Chronic, the whole lyrical beef with Eazy is omitted, F with Dre Day isn't in the film and nor is Eazy's rebuttal Real MuthaFu**in Geez. These were pivotal dis tracks in the whole affair. The years from 91 to 95 are glossed over - it would be interesting to see what was cut from the original version.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of focus on Suge Knight - but this doesn't really work as it could do with a movie of its own, in fact, they should maybe have done two movies - one up to 93 one from 93 to now, then again they obviously and understandably wanted the film to end with the demise of Eazy which wasn't until 95.<br/><br/>It also became somewhat an ode to Eazy E for the last part, which I understand but it was like Cube and Dre are using this as catharsis for whatever guilt they may feel, it doesn't quite ring true though.<br/><br/>Also, if I were MC Ren I would be pretty annoyed at this movie, the guy comes across like a bit player who was just Eazy's sidekick - no back-story at all. Shame.<br/><br/>Anyway as said, the first half of this film was brilliant - gritty funny obscene raw, the second half - well it just felt like a made for TV drama. They should have left the film a good half hour longer so that more of the crucial events between 91 and 95 could have been expanded upon.<br/><br/>Worth seeing though."
"jmoneyjohal","6","8","37","14 August 2015"," An entertaining watch, but the producers Cube and Dre looked out for there best interests. They forgot to give proper footage to Ren and Yella.
","Straight Out Of Compton, while entering the theatre as a fan boy, I told myself that I was going to leave all biases aside and I did,I just looked at the movie as any other story, not a story of a group I idolized since a young age.Therefore whatever I saw on screen was still pleasantly entertaining. But I would still like the point out that since film was produced by Ice Cube and Dre, they where shown to be the smart good guys, and the likes of DJ Yella, Mc Ren had almost no screen space, we didn't get to know any of there back story etc. However the film did outline the ups and downs of Rap group NWA in a fast, and entertaining manner. The 2hr 30 min length time breezed through. Also the film outlined many things that even fans didn't know about the group, like the involvement of Suge Knight in NWA, how Jerry Heller was reason of the rise and destruction of the group etc.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is pretty much about the rise and fall of the Rap group NWA. The story mainly follows the life of Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and Ice Cube.<br/><br/>Acting wise all the newcomers have done a decent job, the experienced Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller is the best of the lot, he comes up with a mature act.<br/><br/>It was nice to see that the film was not only limited to just NWA, we got to see the emergence of Ice Cube as a solo artist, how Dre started Death Row with Suge, how Snoop Dog and 2pac came up in the rape game. Also seeing topical issues in the film such as the violence against blacks by the cops, the huge gang and drug culture in the area of Compton. With this one gets too see how NWA came up with the music they did.<br/><br/>Overall even though the second half of film does began to sink a little, with a slow pace, and not much entertainment on screen. Somes scenes in the film do seem corny also.The film as a whole does stay on to be a very entertaining and well done. Dir F Gary Gray has made an authentic film with the story he was given, even though it seems the producers interest where looked after more in the film, with a lot of scenes either made up for entertainment reasons or blown out of reason. Seem like the producers want to make themselves look the best. But I did love the Eazy-E tribute, RIP E. So if your a fan of the group its a must watch.<br/><br/>3.25/5* or 6.5/10"

","Chasing the American Dream; 'Starting from Nothing and Making it Happen', is an obvious theme in STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON. And while the movie displayed New York's B-Boy representation of Hip Hop Culture from the East, something else was brewing out West. ""Reality Rap"" or Art, as Ice Cube described it, exposed an underground culture in South Central Los Angeles, that up until that time, no one knew existed. Although set in California, this was no Hollywood film, as vivid images of real obstacles hovered over five young dreamers, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and Eazy E, who, despite these obstacles, managed to change Hip Hop's course. No Graffiti Artist, no Break dancers, no MC. Just a 'Dope Beat' and a Rapper with lyrics to match, which ironically held the story line that explained NWA""s journey. The casting was on point as well as the writing and direction. Everything you thought about NWA's persona is erased as we learn that these young minds were well equipped to deal with and combat any and everything that came their way. This film shed exposed America's complex situations and NWA's 'Straight Out of Compton' delivered the commentary."

Even still, there are several humorous moments throughout the movie. Although the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, I still want more. The song selection was poignant and focused mainly on the music from the NWA. This movie is NOT for kids so please leave them at home. There is quite a bit of nudity and explicit language.

"Quinoa1984","8","8","38","18 August 2015"," powerful and entertaining, if less than great
","Straight Outta Compton is about Three guys growing up in the hood of the Compton section of Los Angeles - Eric Wright (Easy E), Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and O'Shea Jackson (Ice Cube) - who come together through some various reasons (trying to get out of selling drugs and getting almost run over by police-driven bulldozer; the frustration of continuing with the basic R&B dance music of the day; writing lyrics that will push the envelope) and try to make some rap music that challenges the norm. There are ups, there are major downs (including death), and in the end it's all like 'wow, we came THIS far?'<br/><br/>This is a refreshing, hard-R rated trip into not simply a little rap group who sold a few million records and burned out after a few years (technically anyway, Dre and Ice Cube went on to monumental careers). This is a piece of modern history that has to be told: how 'gangster rap' came into its own in worldwide public consciousness. Like much of the best aggressive music for young people, though certainly not exclusive to them, it addresses what's going on in the world that group's in, but here with the added social-political edge: what are cops doing? What has happened to where people have to be ""thuggish""? Or, in a sub-textual level, do people from places like Compton act super-hard and angry and act super-tough to make up for what little power they have in their neighborhoods? But anyway, back to this movie...<br/><br/>This is a blend of the conventional (but often quite good and challenging) musician bio-pic, with the highs and lows and egos that become too big for everyone and how money comes into trouble and so on (not to mention the manager who isn't all he says he is), and an all-too distressing look at how nothing's changed with regards to urban/COP violence and conflicts (and actually, I think as a reaction to Obama honestly, has gotten worse). Arguably, the cops are really the villains here, certainly for this group of people, though Suge Night kind of takes over that mantle in the second half with his scenes of thug-life.<br/><br/>What makes it so compelling is that we really get invested in these three main guys, and manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) - Dre, Cube, and Easy E - and then we see how invigorating and exciting it is for them to get together, which makes them coming apart so sad (though inevitable). These aren't card-board gang-banger types; even Easy-E, who has maybe the least talent of the three main guys (Ren and Yella are kind of less than one-dimensional), they have humor and pathos to them, they care about how their messages are getting out there, not being censored, and then... sure, the parties, the women, the drugs, they're there.<br/><br/>In the third act - 1993, as soon as it comes on the screen is actually the cue - is not as strong as the first two-thirds, when even as the group comes apart the individual sagas of how they try to keep going on as solo acts is fascinating and funny and frightening and so on. But somehow in the last half hour the film becomes rushed, and the feeling that a LOT got left on the cutting room floor becomes more apparent. And there's one cliché involving someone getting rather sick - spoiler, it's Easy, another spoiler he died in 1995, this is a matter of public record and all - that doesn't gel with the rest of the movie. But until then, Straight Outta Compton is a spectacular look at how real art and discourse can come out of a place as hellish as Compton; these guys made real protest music, and it resonates today for good reason. If nothing else, the movie does a masterful job of getting the audience to care about what the music has to say.<br/><br/>One last thing: 98% of this cast fills these real-life roles so well it's hard to see anyone else, certainly with Ice Cube's own son. The 2% exception are two scenes with Snoop Doggy Dogg. When he comes on screen, it's a wonder why they didn't just get the real-life Snoop to come in as himself."

","""I can make you legit."" Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti)<br/><br/>So he does make the gangsta rappers legit and wealthy and famous. Straight Outta Compton is a chronology of the hip-hop movement from unknown songs about LAPD oppression of black youths to big-business music, whose money makes for distorted friendships and cut-throat tactics. N.A.W. (Niggaz with Attitude) grew universally popular, similar to the Beatles, so fast as to be almost unbelievable.<br/><br/>It's all in the lyrics. For some of us not versed in the vernacular and history of rap, this biopic is helpful putting the history together. Less helpful than that is the film's depiction of how the powerful lines were formed. Only a few shots of Ice Cube's (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) notebooks give you an idea of the process. The irony of Cube's creating his famous anthem, F--k Tha Police, after several abusive run-ins with LAPD, does help me see origins.<br/><br/>But then, I am always disappointed that these musical biopics don't give enough insight into the creative process of its artists. Maybe that's an impossible task.<br/><br/>However, I should say the sequence involving Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) coaxing out a performance from Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) of his groundbreaking hit, ""boyz n the hood,"" is instructive and humorous. As bad a boy as Dre might have been, his stewardship of the rappers is clearly fundamental to their success. I would have liked more imagining of these crucial creative moments.<br/><br/>Not to say, however, the film slights the influence of such moguls as Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor), who built the success of Death Row on the backs of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dog, too many times with violence a main ingredient.<br/><br/>The film, to its detriment, downplays the importance of their crime glorification and misogynist themes (tossing a naked woman into the hallway and locking the door behind her!). The absence of the competition such as De La Soul, Public Enemy, and Eminem is lamentable. Then, what could be expected from two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre? Straight Outta Compton is an energetic, informative take on a musical movement in the USA that rocked the world.<br/><br/>""Nothing wrong with being from the hood.

I loved everything about it; the performances, the musical cues, the writing sessions, Ice Cube's film career, where he is seen writing the script for Friday, everything was very well done. The only true gripe I can find is that; I was disappointed that they didn't show Ice Cube writing one of his most popular and most critically successful songs; ""It was a good day"", but other than that, Straight Outta Compton is an emotional, funny and touching thrill ride, that is well worth the price of admission, I give it a 9.5 out of 10"

","Straight Outta Compton is the story of N.W.A, a group of 5 men growing up in Compton and the struggle they face with the police as well as their rise to fame and how they influenced the world. As controversial as the group is, they have inspired many including myself, this film is a perfect reflection of that. <br/><br/>From the beginning we get a glimpse into how the police treated these people because of their skin colour. This was a very real thing and the film does a perfect job at showing this, to an almost shocking degree. First off,the cast is perfect. O'Shea Jackson shines in particular. He plays Ice Cube and is actually his son in real life. It can't be easy playing your father, but he makes it seem that way. His mannerisms and look are just brilliant, it is almost as if we are seeing Ice Cube himself. Dr. Dre and Eazy-E are also played brilliantly and i could not see anyone doing a better job. This film is very much based around those three members of NWA, whilst DJ Yella and MC Ren do have parts to play it was a bit odd that they didn't get nearly enough screen time as Cube, Dre and E. Paul Giamatti also appears as manager of NWA Jerry Heller. I'm not entirely sure how accurate his role was in the movie but Paul Giamatti does great at being part caring manager, part corporate douchebag.<br/><br/>Around the third act the film slows down in pace as it shows us the fall of NWA and the feud with Ice Cube. Where many people saw this as a flaw, i was as entertained with this portion of the film as i was with the rest of it. We start to see how the members of the group are dealing with their own personal issues, so as a result we get a good look behind the scenes of the glamour and music as well as the personal lives of people we thought we knew. For example, we get to see Ice Cube writing the script for Friday which shows how he is moving on from NWA. A character in the film talks about how NWA is glamorising drugs and violence, as producers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre do brilliantly at showing us how this wasn't the case. You can really see in the writing that they are passionate about this story.<br/><br/>Overall, Straight Outta Compton is one of the gems of the year. The soundtrack is brilliant and had me rapping along to the lyrics on more than one occasion. It made me laugh, it made me tear up at points and in a way it really inspired me to be what i want to be. I highly recommend this film to absolutely anyone who will listen. It demands to be seen in cinemas and is one i will most definitely be buying on blu-ray. One of 2015's best movies and that is no exaggeration. Time to go home and blast out the old NWA records.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"drawlife","9","9","45","21 August 2015"," An antidote for summer blockbusters.
","Raw. Very raw. <br/><br/>I'm not the biggest rap fan, but I do enjoy it from time to time. These guys were something else back in the day. I think people don't really realize that, but this movie will show otherwise. <br/><br/>The story of the rise and fall of the rap group N.W.A. is wonderfully told through the solid direction from F. Gary Gary, and the excellent performances from the talented young cast. It really grabs the honest portrayal of their days as a group and as individuals. What makes Straight Outta Compton different from other biopics is that, most biopics rely on the nostalgia, but this film reels us in with the raw reflection of that particular era. Right from the beginning we're hooked in with the trio of leads, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube, and as Ice Cube nicely puts it, their art is a reflection of their reality and it's immediately shown when the movie kicks in. <br/><br/>The three leads equally share the load of this film and to see the three of them take separate directions in life, one would think that's a lot to juggle, but here, it's paced so eloquently. I liked the natural progression and evolution of the these characters, showing that people do change. When you have three guys coming from the same neighborhood with the same career goals, give them fame, stardom, and money, they're gonna end up in different places, forging their own destiny. The film showcases that inevitable outcome and the usage of logos, ethos and pathos are also at play, as the trio represents one of the modes. <br/><br/>Dr. Dre is the logos of the film. Portrayed by Corey Hawkens, Dre showed the most maturing and growth of his character, dissolving into his own man. Jason Mitchell who is Eazy-E oozes charisma and charm, if anyone is familiar with Eazy-E, Mitchell's performance certainly brings the pathos into the film. The one who stole the show for me was O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube showcasing ethos. During the hype of this film I wasn't too sure about Ice Cube's own son portraying him who really had no acting experience. I had no doubt that he would be the weakest link, but I was certainly wrong. I did not see O'Shea Jackson Jr. in this film, I saw Ice Cube. I heard he took two years to prepare for this role, and it really shows. He brings the most attitude and energy to the screen, by standing up to authority, and writing powerful lyrics. Plus his uncanny resemblance to his father helps as well. <br/><br/>Aldis Hodge as MC Ren and Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella are obviously aren't in the limelight as the trio, but to my surprise they weren't underdeveloped as I thought they'd be. They have some moments to shine within the group and provide decent supporting roles. Paul Giamatti as their manager Jerry Heller brings the almost fatherly, and caring figure to the group, especially to Eazy-E, but also evokes the dirtiness of a cheating business man. R. Marcus Taylor brings out a chilling, cruel performance as Suge Knight. <br/><br/>Is this movie completely accurate, I would assume probably not. When it comes to bringing a famous person's life on screen, there is some revisionist history going on, but it does a good job showcasing the brutality of living in a neighborhood like Compton, and how music was an escape for these guys. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are also producers on the film and I appreciate that they portrayed themselves and the group without as much filter, despite the fact that some of it was probably omitted(Dre's history of violence against women). It only makes their development much more engaging. This is a film that has a real feel for the creative process in the studio. Their tour performance scenes rock, particularly the depiction of a tense show in Detroit where the group is warned in advance not to perform ""F*ck Tha Police.""<br/><br/>F. Gary Gary had a difficult task of making a biopic about N.W.A. He pulled it off. Biopics more often than not tend to elaborate on the rise-fall-rise-again structure, the sex and the drugs, disputes within a group about money, ego, it's all there and to be fair we've seen it many times, but with the solid, all around performances, and F. Gary Gary's execution, you probably won't mind. <br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is one of the better musical biopics out there, and easily in the top ten of 2015. Sure, the last hour loses just a tiny, tiny bit of steam showcasing some side melodrama, but it's packed with performances you can't take your eyes off, stellar concert scenes, nice cameos from future rappers, a strong narrative, just an electrifying film all around, Straight Outta Compton is a hell of a ride and the lyrics of Ice Cube's ""F*ck Tha Police,"" which was written almost thirty years ago, is still sadly relevant today. <br/><br/>9/10"

","I usually don't write much reviews, but I'm tired of seeing all these bad reviews on the movie. Most of them do not seem fans of NWA or of the whole gangster rap scene that happened back in the day. The movie is nothing different then most of the rock star movies you see when it comes down to nudity and all the partying, one reason it is Rated R! I mean you should know by the history of the group a lot of controversy followed them; however, they did open the doors to rap music and started a whole new music scene and artist that came with it. They were not scared! Hell I think everyone listened to them back in those days and knew at least one song or another that they performed, even the ones that hated them. Man when they broke up in their own different directions rap blew up and all kinds of artist we listened too then Easy and Dre produced. I think the movie was a great movie which actually hit a lot of our curiosity about the groups trials and convection's right on the nose. I always wondered about most the history of NWA and this movie explains it right down to the language,nudity, and criminal activities. They were gangsters trying to come out the ghetto not Disney characters. If you want to see a good movie and especially if you like NWA watch this!! Forget all these haters on here that have nothing nice to say about it, who probably don't know much about NWA or have never listened to them."
"powermandan","10","8","39","22 August 2015"," The Best Rap Movie Ever Made!
","That's right, this is the best rap flick ever. It tops other flicks of its kind such as 8 Mile and Notorious. While I don't like hip-hop music, the SOC documents the days when it had a technique and was had meaning. Aside from that, Straight Outta Compton has so many things to offer.<br/><br/>NWA was a rap band in the 80s and 90s that was part of the hip-hop explosion during that time. Public Enemy and Run DMC were other hip-hop groups around that time, but NWA broke new ground with aggressive, shocking, and truthful lyrics. They were just a group of guys from the inner city that dealt with poverty, drugs, racism and crime. Sure these things are shown in nearly every urban movie, but the way SOC deals with these issues is better done as it helps enhance the plot and evolve the characters. All other flicks have these elements but are not used best like in here. You feel like you are watching something truly excellent. Each member of the group is developed well (some more than others) and the relationship with each other and society is awesome. As a bunch of black guys from the ghetto, they are often harassed by racist cops. It is things like these that they write about and rap about with lots of conviction. There's meaning, not just wining about a bad life. This movie really takes us into what inspires them to rebel and be themselves.<br/><br/>When they get to be famous, we get to see life on the road and parties just like in other musical biopics. One thing I loved was the subplot with exploitive managers and producers. Biopics hardly ever show this. If they do, they don't dive deep into like this does. Doesn't sound interesting? SOC make it very interesting. That is ultimately what breaks them up and moves them to different record companies. Something I loved was they showed NWA's influence of society. Not just rappers, general society. In the backdrop of the last little bit is the Rodney King Controversy and how NWA's rebellious attitudes could have influenced shock waves in society such as the Rodney King Case. Most musical biopics hardly show the influences on society and relationships with other groups this well.<br/><br/>I hate rap music, but I love this film. Easily one of the year's best.<br/><br/>4/4"
"SnoopyStyle","8","6","27","19 June 2016"," solid biodrama
","It's 1987. Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) are trying to put out reality rap. They get reluctant Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and they form N.W.A. Faded producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) helps Eazy-E create Ruthless. They sign with Bryan Turner at Priority Records. Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) is a hustler always around. During their initial success, Ice Cube refuses to sign with Jerry and later decides to go on as a solo act. These young men rise out of the gang-infested, LAPD-harassed Compton to give voice to a new generation.<br/><br/>There is a great energy surrounding this biopic. The actors are solid. The fact that I don't recognize them as actors make it easier for them to fade into the roles. Of course, the story is compelling. There seems to be a little bit of papering some parts of their history. That's perfectly expected especially with the participation of these artists. Without them, the movie wouldn't be made. Nevertheless, the story is still fascinating. The music is awesome. The last act is a bit slow. It could have trim some of that to intensify the ending. It may also be more compelling to end sooner. Overall, it's a solid watch."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","6","7","34","9 September 2015"," Flawed and generic narrative of NWA, praise for O'Shea Jackson Jr.
","NWA was the pivotal rap group in the late 80's to mid 90's that created the sound of the generation. Straight Outta Compton attempts to tell their story from their roots in Compton to their eventual and inevitable break up.<br/><br/>The members of NWA that the film follows are MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy- E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, but the story primarily focuses on the latter three and the disagreements that led to NWA's demise. Simultaneously, Straight Outta Compton examines the societal landscape and cultural turmoil happening at the time that led to the voices of NWA being heard and celebrated.<br/><br/>The sheer volume of narrative that needs to be told in the film is gargantuan. Unfortunately for the screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, they are not successful and the whole story feels like a Wikipedia version of NWA. A film of this size should reveal some additional unknown information or motivation, and it fails to do so. Further the constant contemplation upon the LA riots and that time period feels overly forced to reflect our current situation, a heavy handed and unnecessarily graceless approach.<br/><br/>The other greatest criticism is its dollar store approach to the costume and hair design on the film. Perhaps it is because the 90's weren't that long ago that those alive recall the style and fashion, but it's pretty abominable in Straight Outta Compton. None of the actors look to be comfortable in their garbs and the limited diversity in outfits leads the audience to believe each character only had one costume each. The whole look of the time created in Straight Outta Compton is immediately off-putting and difficult to get past.<br/><br/>The film isn't all bad, and the best decision the filmmakers made was to get Ice Cube's real son to portray Ice Cube in the film. Not only does O'Shea Jackson Jr. look startlingly similar to his father, but his performance is the only complex one. Rather than reverting to a constant scowl and mean mugging the camera, his performance is of a man across many years. O'Shea is the only actor able to rise above his poor costuming and inhabit the role completely, then again, he has had his whole life to observe his father.<br/><br/>The story behind Straight Outta Compton was always going to be a difficult task, but to those aware of the NWA story, it could have been better. In the end, it feels like a highlight reel, glossing over the details to help audiences fully understand the inner- workings of its downfall and the complex happenings between Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. And for a film about a music group, more rap and hip-hop music from the time would have been greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."
"girlisonfiremeka","9","8","41","24 August 2015"," check it out you wont regret it!
","One of the best movies I seen this year. I am a 80's baby so the tone and music of the film were on point down to the coloring of the screen. The actor's acting abilities were average for their first major movie. The film shows how every member equally contributed to the success of the group. Its crazy how people are calling this a racist movie because NWA displayed their interactions with the police they encountered during their times in Compton. Its their movie therefore their story. Even in a society full of technology of video and camera phones people still refuse to recognize the full picture in front of them. The movie never said all cops were that way just the ones they encountered. The nudity is the same for any high rated movie and similar to Boogie Nights."

","Wow, what a movie. Where to begin? So I saw highlights of this movie on HBO and what drew me in wasn't the actual backstory of N.W.A. but the soundtrack. I love music so that drew me in immediately, considering that I knew most of the songs. I don't know how true to life this movie is, but I was impressed with both Ice Cube's and Easy-E's character. This movie explains (to me anyway) why Ice Cube hardly ever smiles, and I had no idea he was a key contributor to N.W.A. Ice Cube was and still is a really talented dude. Same with Dre - his scratching - was amazing to watch. To be honest, this movie has some emotional elements to it, despite the Compton feel and hardcore background. I cried when Dre got the bad news and when Easy-E found out he had AIDS.<br/><br/>It was a completely riveting movie and all the actors did a phenomenal job, especially Ice Cube's son. He pulled off his Dad perfectly!<br/><br/>Great movie 10/10."
"ahejna","7","5","22","11 November 2016"," If you care about rap you will enjoy Straight Outta Compton
","""Straight Outta Compton"" is a true story directed by F Gary Gray and is about the formation of the group NWA in the late 80s and the early 90s. The movie focuses on the three main members of the group Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. And the movie shows how this group changed the way we think of music In the first part of the movie you can see some of the members writing songs and practicing on the turntable to see the passion that the members wanted to be artists. Ice Cube is played by his actual son and did a great job. All the cast actually did a great job playing a real characters. Including character played by Eazy-E played by Jason Mitchell who is asked to do most of the intense acting, and he gives a very impressive performance. The NWA and the after the NWA dissolved the artists went on to create things by themselves but I knew very little about the actual members of the NWA. This movie for being about music has a great soundtrack that shows the music of that time. I loved hearing all the music again.There are a lot of cameos from artists that would become great that we're not in the NWA including Tupac, Snoop Dog, Warren G. and Jimmy Lovine who is a major record producer. For people are age not alive during the beginning of the NWA and the Rodney King Riots this movie does a great job at showing what it meant to be in Compton at that time. The movie shows the audience that what the NWA wanted to speak the truth when rapping. But the movie never says what the members do outside of rapping is okay but shows what the group had to go through to get where they got. Some of the problems facing ""Straight Outta Compton"" is the truth behind some of the history behind the members can be false. The problem comes up because of Eazy-E passing he can't be there to give some of the truth and because the real Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are producers on the movie and probably wanted some of the story left out for their sake. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is number one at the box office as it deserves making it the highest-grossing musical biopic of all time. ""Straight Outta Compton"" tops the other two movies coming out the same time including the prayer based film ""War Room"" and the electronic music dramedy ""We Are Your Friends."" This movie shows what the actual people were doing. Never this movies try to show that they were good people but do show how their music has impacted modern rap."
"james_scott_mcs","7","7","35","8 January 2016"," OK movie, riding the Empire / Black Lives Matter train.
","Overall it is an OK movie, especially if you lived thru this era. But most of the film is simply pulled from the headlines. And the parts that aren't are clearly over exaggerated. I was in my late teens and early 20s during the time period of this movie, so I remember a lot of these events. Especially when a lot of my friends were really into NWA. But there is a clear bias. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there was a lot of police harassment during this time period. And I wasn't there to see what happened in these situations. But you can clearly tell they over exaggerated some of the situations.<br/><br/>As for the acting, they picked some perfect people to play each NWA part. You recognize them right away and their mannerisms were great. The only part I found to be over the top was Paul Giamatti. Which is sad, because he is one of my favorite actors. But if you imagine Paul playing an over the top corrupt producer, that's exactly what you get. It wasn't much of a stretch. But with Jerry Heller suing because the portrayal of him in the movie. Maybe they went to over the top.<br/><br/>This movie is clearly riding the Black Lives matters and Empire Train. If this came out 3 years ago, it would of gotten a lot less attention. Like the movie Notorious. But it's another case where the critics are afraid to give an honest review, or else they'll be called racist. Same with the awards shows. But I keep my reviews honest and I think this deserves a 7 out of 10 at best."

They show easy-e taking pot and you see some cousin in the beginning but otherwise no other drugs. There are two horror movie trailers before it but there both only a minute. The movie is 15 minutes too long but this has an amazing ending. Flat out amazing film with a truly amazing message. Children under the age of ten shouldn't see it. It starts off with easy-e selling drugs and the police invading the drugs. To see this movie and understand it you have to know about what's going on at that time."

","Some of you people giving bad ratings know nothing about rap music or what the streets are about. Why watch a movie about something you know nothing about. Then call them thugs and whatever else you can think of. This movie is about real life and what they went through to get where they wanted to be and should have been. You tell me if you lived like they did and had your money played with you wouldn't be angry also? They rapped and spoke about what was going on in their lives everyday and what all minorities went through and till this day still go through. Something i can say that most of you have not been through and probably never will. Rap was their outlet and they did it well. Yea i know what type of people rated this horribly. I love this movie although a lot was untold about how E really got aids. Just ask Suge he knows the truth. They should have received an award for this, it was a great cast and the music made me want to pull out my old CD's. I appreciate everything in this movie and wish it was more added but to tell every detail probably would have took forever to do."
"eatakmakova","9","7","36","14 December 2015"," ""Our art is a reflection of our reality"".
","What is the main purpose of art? Yeah, right, to express yourself and tell the world your story. This is what ""Straight Outta Compton"" movie is about - to show people the reality as it is and to inspire everyone to fight for their rights and better life, with no fear. And this is what guys from Compton did. They went against the system. They weren't afraid of anything, they just decided to become ""the voice of their streets"" and change their reality through music and make other people believe they were able to do the same as well, if they didn't like the situation they were in. Of course, it wasn't that easy. There was a lot of misunderstanding, refusals, protests, but at the end it all was worth of that. Guys were accepted and supported by people. But, as it usually happens, nothing good last forever. Within the group there was a lot of controversy, plus dishonest manager who just used the guys to enrich himself. All this affected the group and, as the result, the group stopped its existing. And then everyone went on its own. <br/><br/>I should stress out a great director's work. The way the camera moves, scenes sequences - nothing special, but still it looks so real that you feel like if you were inside the action. Such effect is also due to the great actors' performance and well thought script. I think there could't be any other movie telling N.W.A. story. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially to those who appreciate hip-hop music and its culture. The movie makes it clear how hop-hop appeared and what the main message is. And it will also be very interesting for common people, because the film is very tense, it's full of action, drama, it has a real story to tell."

","Well, they delivered! I finally seen this uplifting film based in the late-eighties, early- nineties, of the rise and fall of one of the most notorious groups LA has ever breaded. NWA.<br/><br/>To start off, the acting is on key and is done well by all the main characters of the story. I especially think Corey Hawkins (Dre) and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Cube) in general were phenomenal; really ballsy on his (Jackson) part - following in his dad's footsteps // and for the first time, as far as I know - I don't think Ice Cube would be steered in the wrong direction, regardless.<br/><br/>I found a lot of heart in the film. Not any romance, but the love for the game. You can really see who was the true artist and who was just lucky to be there for the ride. In a way, even though he doesn't seem like he's doing his part, Easy-E was a formable asset to the group. He was a spokesperson; a symbol, if you will; a person to look up to and have speak for a broken generation all around.<br/><br/>I must mention that the film was roughly two hours and thirty minutes. Let me just say, that time flew by from how entertaining this film was. And it had nothing to do with the same bullshit; gang-war; violence; drugs; rioting. This film was interesting for it's dialogue. YES, MY FAVORITE. - It had heart, and that is how I know they found the right actors for the part.<br/><br/>You see, this has been something that has been around for a long time now. Adults are not growing into their dull. boring lives // and it is good to reassure them that at one point, they were all about standing up to the system. Falk it!<br/><br/>I gave this movie a slightly off-generous 4 out of 5 stars. There maybe have been a few things I needed closure with, such as Dre.'s story. But I hope to see better black cinema films after this. F. Gary Gray kicks ass at it again in this coming-of-age tale.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy!<br/><br/>-- Michael Mendez"

"view_and_review","7","7","36","19 August 2015"," Extremely Captivating to the Nostalgic Folks of the Gangsta Rap Era
","It's hard for me not to be biased when rating and reviewing this movie. N.W.A. was a huge part of my musical nurturing as a pre-teen and teen. I remember the first dub of Boyz in the Hood that a fellow elementary school classmate gave me. I was so blown away by the cords, the beat and the lyrics. What? Are they cussin'???? Give me more!!!!<br/><br/>Now, to divorce that part of my upbringing from the movie... It's hard. They could have played one track after another all the way through to The Chronic 2001 and I would have been attentive and enthralled. Throughout the movie I think every track from the first album, ""Straight Outta Compton"", was at least sampled and each time lyrics just poured out of me like I was 11 again. Music I don't listen to at all anymore and seldom think about just all rushed back to me like the amnesia patient that has a break through.<br/><br/>Besides the head bob inducing music the actors chosen were perfect. From Ice Cube, to Dre, to Eazy-E, to Suge Knight, to Snoop Dogg and Tupac; the actors chosen were stupendous. Nevermind the fact that O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube) could be his father's twin, the other actors were expertly chosen as well.<br/><br/>I liked the story because it was very relevant to me for reasons I've already stated and it was relevant to the music industry as a whole. They pioneered Gangsta Rap and helped elevate rap and hip-hop to new heights. They also took the reigns off of all artists to come. Yes, there was profanity in music before them, but they were so gritty and raw and gangsta that it gave every ghetto boy after them something they could identify with and rap about themselves. Then the N.W.A. family grew. Then came the D.O.C., Snoop, Tupac, WC and the Mad Circle, Mack 10, Eminem, 50 Cent, Beats by Dre, Boyz in the Hood the movie, the Friday movies and so much else.<br/><br/>The movie's relevance was further solidified with the re-airing of the Rodney King beating, the subsequent trial and the subsequent riots. It was eery how that video, 24 years old, could be played today and we wouldn't be shocked. Replace the grainy camcorder with a cell phone and how much is different? I remember shortly after the Rodney King verdict Ice Cube came out with a song and one of the lyrics was:<br/><br/>""Go to Simi Valley and surely <br/><br/>somebody knows the address of the jury.<br/><br/>Pay a little visit <br/><br/>""Who is it?"" <br/><br/>Fool it's Ice Cube <br/><br/>Let me talk to the Grand Wizard <br/><br/>Then ""boom!""""<br/><br/>I remember that line so clearly because 1.) The song was that dope and 2.) it embodied what I felt.<br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for everyone. There is a pruder part of me now in my adult age that even shied at some of the language and nudity. Its appeal may be limited to a nostalgic few like myself that were so impressed by N.W.A. Or just maybe its appeal may be more encompassing being that it would be a history lesson to the hip-hop lovers of today that may have never known a world pre-bling hip- hop, or to the curious individuals who want to know how Gangsta Rap came to be. For me, it was not only a walk down memory lane but it was a historical lesson as well."
"Kray_Kray","9","7","36","20 August 2015"," Fabulous film-making - a must see
","There is a moment in Straight Outta Compton when Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) glances up at a billboard boasting the recent recording success of Dr. Dre . The look in his eyes captures all the wistful regret, enveloping envy, thwarted ambitions, and lost dreams of any former ""teammate"" who either from personal flaws or uncontrollable conditions (or both) killed the golden goose. If you sense Shakespearian level tragedy in this well-crafted biopic, you are not ill tuned. Eazy-E stands at the center of this film as the rags-to-riches-to-near-redemption-to-ruin boy from the 'hood whose fault lay both in himself and in his stars. If the overwhelming film message is of hope – of how impoverished, marginalized young men used as yet unappreciated poetic talents to combat institutionalized racism and immediate poverty to mark out a musical and cultural frontier, there still remains that reminder of the fate of E - that perhaps only one in a hundred thousand talented rappers ""make it"". That those who fabulously did, Dr Dre and Ice Cube in particular, wanted their story told with their late friend as the film's beating heart, serves Eazy's memory well.<br/><br/>Biopics have no inherent suspense. We know what is coming because we know the characters and their trajectories. So the mark of the successful biopic has to be the ability to share the known in a way that engulfs the audience in both recognition and delight. In any biopic allowances for time and tightness will be made, liberties taken with fact, embellishments adorned on less than sterling characters – and we see all of these in this film. Dre is portrayed perhaps too self-sacrificing and courageous, Cube too soon financially attuned and consistently aware, and Ren's and Yella's essential contributions neglected, but the overwhelming response to this film for most viewers is an exuberant high–five, an appreciation so intense for the story and the artists who made it that you want to ""hold your middle finger high in the sky"" at Joe Louis Stadium, even as you already know at exactly what moment the police are going to storm the stage, and assault and arrest those artists. Even if you don't care a whit for rap, you should be able to relate to this well told, brilliantly acted version of the American Dream, because that is exactly what it is – an innercity realization of the American Dream.<br/><br/>The director, F. Gary Gray, draws wonderful performances from the entire cast. R. Marcos Taylor's Suge Knight oozes brutal menace, Keith Stanfield's Snoop exudes early Dawg charm, Marcc Rose's Tupac blasts a shock of grieved remorse. Paul Giamatti, masterful as always, brings a combination of avarice and tender concern to his portrayal of the all too typical record producer, out to cover ""his end"" first and foremost, utilizing every shady accounting trick because, hey kids, ""that's the way it has always been done"". Giamatti's character's uncomfortable complexity reminds us this combination of pure greed and sporadic avuncular ""regard"" most likely had to be the profile of the slave owners' self-deceiving rationale as he tried to convince himself his property was better off under his control than free. O'Shea Jackson Jr. will be compared to his dad so much we may lose track of the son's unique talent and spitfire energy, ability to use justifiable rage articulated in flaming verse. Corey Hawkins' Dr. Dre allows the underlying genius of his character to slowly draw itself out. But Straight Outta Compton is really Mr. Mitchell's show. It is in this young actor's lightening smile, expressive eyes, hunched swagger and plaintive striving that we see captured not just the saga of the enormously talented rapper, but the plight of so many who just never made it ""outta Compton""."

","Now me being a bigger fan of rock and roll rather than rap, especially old-school rap, I went to see this movie with my friends with limited expectations. I went in thinking it would be a lousy documentation about the lives of N.W.A, one of my few favorite artists. After watching this movie however, I was really excited. The story was fantastic and matched the history of the guys perfectly without making it boring. The music was top-notch and the true feeling that you get when you watch this makes you feel like you actually feel for these men. This is a fantastic drama about the men who made it 'outta Compton' and I highly recommend it to everyone, even if you aren't a fan of rap you'll love this movie."
"pguims85","9","7","36","18 August 2015"," ""A sharp, evocative and compelling biopic about N.W.A.""
","Straight Outta Compton is a masterful adaptation of a complex history. It may be another underdog story but it depicts its material in its crudest and most honest form. It portrays how musicians and artists change the world around them, but the music in the film is the type far from being sweet and ass-kisser. Deriving wisdom from the streets, the songs are brutally honest and shamelessly profane. They are violent, undiplomatic and fearless.<br/><br/>With their album ""Straight Outta Compton,"" N.W.A. told their thuggish life in South LA through music. Later forming a subgenre known as ""gangsta rap,"" their songs are filled with rage and anger. Subtly, it is also enlightening and inspiring. With its violent nature, it is no wonder it earned a ""parental advisory"" tag and a ""letter"" from the F.B.I. The film is sincere in its depiction as it shows both sides. It does not sugar-coat its wild, unfriendly themes or make the rappers heroes with their struggles.<br/><br/>The group's 1988 song ""Fuck tha Police"" is prominently featured in the movie. It is energetic, groovy and high in spirit. The story behind the song is one of the film's most chilling moments. While taking a break from recording, the group is humiliatingly searched and taken down by the local cops. Heller comes to his talents' rescue but the police only ridicule the existence of hip-hop music. Motivated by the incident, the group put voice to the abuse experienced by black Americans in the hands of law enforcers and ""Fuck tha Police"" was born. As seen in the movie, the song became an anthem in many riots and demonstrations.<br/><br/>The film may be unrepentant in showing rage and violence, but it also has moments of tenderness and quiet. When Ice Cube launches his own career, the remaining group are quite appreciative of his songs. When Dre loses his brother to death, the others are sympathetic. And when Eazy-E confesses his battle against HIV, his friends-turned-enemies-turned-friends-again are quick to lend support and love.<br/><br/>The characters are put life with the vibrant and compelling performances of its young cast. Undoubtedly, they exude tremendous chemistry and contagious camaraderie. Hawkins is warm as Dr. Dre and Jackson Jr., the real-life son of the rapper, is volatile as Ice Cube. Mitchell is a revelation as he holds the film's best performance. Through his ups and downs, he is dynamic, brave and sweet as Eazy-E. Long-time actor Giamatti is effective as the part-villain, part-angel Heller. He is fishy at first glance but his sincere willingness to help is also not unacceptable.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is a relentless and brutish piece of art. It is sharp and effervescent, honest and shameless, stirring and tender. Fan or not, one can't help but admire the vivid lives of the men behind the revolutionary gangsta rap."
"wannasurf2","7","7","36","17 August 2015"," Straight Outta Time
","All in all, this was a pretty good movie if you can think of it like a high budget VHI biopic. It serves the music very well, and hits most of the high points in the lives and careers of the NWA alumnus. Be forewarned however, quite a bit of artistic license is taken as to how various events developed. So if you are like most people that will be paying to see this in theaters - people that already know all of the beats (pun intended), expect to roll your eyes a couple times.<br/><br/>Regardless, the film does an excellent job of displaying the feel and look of the various periods. For the most part, the movie keeps one riveted throughout. Most acting is quite good, and the fact that the producers didn't feel a need to use older, well known actors (as usually the case with rap oriented movies) goes along way toward keeping you ""in the movie"" as you watch. The standout acting performance is Giamatti. If in any other movie, he would probably be Oscar nominated.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton does have the same problem as the recent Entourage movie...trying to cram too much into two hours. This means there are giant leaps through time that would likely be hard to follow for non-fans. If you haven't watched every Behind the Music doc covering all of these people, you will likely be lost. To compound this, the time period after the NWA album up the end (Dre announcing he's leaving Death Row) is jammed into the last quarter of the movie...and only a few high points are hit. For example, the release of the Chronic was barely even mentioned...and you only see Snoop very briefly. Once again, had I not known the back story, I would have had no idea what was going on at times.<br/><br/>It almost feels as if the movie was written initially to end as soon as the group became commercially successful, and then it was decided to tack another 10 years of history on. For what it's worth, the name of the movie is Straight Outta Compton, so had the movie ended at the point that album was successful, it would have been much better. What you have here is a movie that would have been better off as an HBO mini series with room to breathe...or at least it could have been served up in two parts (sequel). After seeing the movie, I have to wonder if one of these things were not the original intention, and the studio's insecurity about it's potential popularity caused it to be truncated and released as a end of summer flick.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that you are probably not going to walk away from this film totally satisfied, but there are some really strong scenes, great use of the music, and solid performances. It's clearly worth seeing at a theater if you are a fan, for what that's worth. Unlike the aforementioned Entourage movie, this one will not tarnish the legacy. What it will do however is make you dig out those old CD's."

","Yo, this movie is dope. It teaches us how they use to treat people of society years ago, even though things never changed.I applaud the actors for doing such great work & I commend the director for producing such a great biographical film.It truly shows that you should always be proud of where you come from & have faith in yourself, some rappers should really look up to them because they continued to support their background, they never abandoned their hometown and I really appreciate that.Ice's son played a really good role and all the other cast members y'all the real MVP's.

Its not meant to be. This shows a great representation of life down in the streets of Compton which made me interested throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I believe that this is a pretty accurate representation because every single scene in this movie had a say by Dr Dre and Ice Cube.Before this movie Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy E were getting the fame. I hope this helps expose how great Mc Ren and DJ Yella really were. I wish Eazy E was here to see this. R.I.P Eazy E.<br/><br/>Would recommend you go see if you a fan of Hip-Hop"
"kassiedwarika","9","7","36","16 August 2015"," Intense Social Commentary with a Great Soundtrack
","Straight Outta Compton was so much more than I expected, I was looking for an excuse to listen to some classic rap really loud in a theater. Like ""Mamma Mia"" for Abba or ""Across the Universe"" for the Beatles, this movie gives you that and a stylized documentary. It paints a picture of a world most of us can't relate to, with a soundtrack most of us have heard. <br/><br/>From the first minute it hits you and keeps you hooked. There are so many dark and tense moments that almost hurt to watch but is broken up with characters that add humor/hope to these situations. Obviously this is set in the past but it also speaks to a reality people still live with: racism, abuse of power, poverty, exploitation and a lot of issues touched on in the film/music.<br/><br/>That being said it was great I laughed/ smiled countless times. Though not a die hard fan of NWA but really enjoyed the story, music and loved watching the introductions of new artists over time. <br/><br/>This was my first movie review, primarily in response to the reviewers who gave this movie a 1/10. There is a lot of irony in the fact people would be so hostile about an NWA film, when the movie is about people being hostile towards NWA music for similar reasons. Take a step back and realize you agree with the oppressive society of 25+ years ago... who are (kinda) the bad guys in this movie."
"emartin-1","9","7","36","16 August 2015"," A riveting soundtrack of life
","I've seen about 30 movies this year, but this one is by far the best. As somewhat of a movie aficionado, I know it's very easy for a film to fail. Some have a good story but bad casting, or vice versa. Some are good stories but have a bad director. This movie is excellent in all three areas. I don't know how director F. Gary Gray elicited such great performances from his cast of mostly unknown actors, but he pulled it off. He also shows restraint when it comes to the gratuitous violence another director might resort to, considering the subject matter. Straight Outta Compton is not a PG movie by any means, but it uses stellar storytelling, solid performances and a sprinkle of humor as its vehicle. I'm not a big hip hop fan by any means but I enjoyed it as the producers pulled back the curtain and revealed how some hit songs were inspired and also gives insight into the music industry, where greed and intimidation are as commonplace as lyrics and videos. Lastly, I cannot forget the performance of Jason Mitchell as Eazy E. What a wonderful job this guy did of capturing a multi-dimensional man, bringing grit, humor and vulnerability in a totally believable display that is Oscar-worthy. As someone who has been a movie fan all my life, I always know when I've seen a good one. Because it stays on my mind for days after I leave the theater."
"Screen_Blitz","10","8","43","30 August 2015"," Gripping and powerful portrayal of a legendary rap group
","It was 1987 when the legendary rap group N.W.A took the nation by storm with their astonishing hardcore rap performances that redefined the genre of rap. This gripping and powerful biopic tells the story of the five young men: Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr, Ice Cube's real-life son), Easy-E (Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.), growing up in the ghetto streets of Compton, California, and forming their rap band known as N.W.A. With the help of their manager Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti), the group becomes an smash-hit success and begin performing on a nationwide tour. While the group makes their way into massive fame, they also become a target to the law enforcement agency who condemns their music as acts of defiance. This film follows how this group on their success and how they left a long-lasting legacy on the music industry.<br/><br/>The story behind this genre-defining rap group is quite fascinating and definitely deserves a movie deal. This film brings an incredible amount of energy to the story, and the narrative is so riveting and engaging that it strongly grabs your attention. It begins with the five young men who are struggling with their home lives and having frequent run-ins with law authorities and gang members, and it authentically depicts their lives in the violent streets of Compton. The best example would shown in an unnerving scene with Ice Cube on the school bus. The story then dives into the start of the group's career. As the story goes on, we watch as the characters rise to fame, but then gain unwanted attention by the law enforcement agency in the process. The agency becomes highly offended by their music, claiming it to influence gangs, violence, and crime, and begin taking legal actions on the group as well as their manager. The group responds by claiming that their music reflects on the reality that they are living in. The film has some comedic moments and dialogue that will have you laughing, then there are some dramatic moments that could have you choked up as well as some thought- provoking moments like the depiction of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the beating of Rodney King.<br/><br/>The cast brings some outstanding performances as the N.W.A members. I was particularly impressed with O'Shea Jackson Jr, who is the real- life son of Ice Cube. It's very interesting to see him portray his father. The cast brings such incredible energy to their characters with not only their acting, but their rapping performances; especially during the scenes when they performing live. The film's soundtrack really leaves a strong impact, particularly the song ""F@#% Da Police"".<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is quite a powerful film and maybe one of the most captivating biopic films I've seen in a long time. Complete with superb performances, enthralling storytelling, and a killer soundtrack, this movie is certainly a must-see and guaranteed to do huge at the box office. Even if you are not a fan of the band or the rap genre in general, this film is still worth your attention."

From the mean, gang infested streets of L.A., these young men will hone and use their talents to rise above the killing fields and forge a new path for rap that is still felt today. Brutal cops, vicious gangbangers, a sketchy manager (played by Paul Giamatti), jealousy and infighting among NWA members, and censorship will test the bonds the group members have. Some will get stronger, some will fall by the wayside; but their music lives on.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when NWA is harassed by the LAPD just for standing around a building that houses a recording studio they are using. That harassment inspires Ice Cube to write the lyrics for the song ""Fuck Tha Police."" <br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the best biopics to have come out in the past decade, filled with a raw energy that can suck you in even if you are not a fan of rap songs.

There are so many people, who write uselessly negative reviews, and for what? Aggressive, throwing stuff like, I'd rate it negatively if I could, and such. Talking about the NWA like they are 5 happy misogynists, having sex all the time, depraved bums and are proud of it. Talking about them sinning and having sex all the time.
Listen to yourself.
This film shows the dark side of the 1990's. Look how people were treated back then. This film shows what shit people went through back then. This shows who they were. So what is they had sex. Look where they came from. This is trying to show how much of a shit-show America was back then. 
This film is trying to tell you about that.
The 80's and 90's weren't having a new brand systematically destroy America. America was destroying itself. These men were rappers. These men came from the streets. They grew up in a shit-show, and so they rap about it. They don't rap to prostitute their way to become millionaires. 
Look a little closer and stop focusing on all of the sex scenes for fucks sake. It's X-Rated, what do you expect?
It's the history of the NWA. Nothing is ever completely white and pure. 
For all of you that say that this film shows 5 misogynistic men, fucking their way through life and destroying America. These people were rascals, sure. These people were thugs sure. These people rapped about their troubles.

I can't hardly find a flaw in this film, every aspect was just done so darn well. I have to put this up there for movie of the year and I really wonder come Oscar time if we will be hearing about this one. Maybe not for the music category, being NWA and all lol but I can see some other categories for sure. I can't say enough about this truly captivating story and how the movie does such a great job telling it right up until the end. No spoilers in case people don't know the real life story.

","Straight Outta Compton is a inspiring, sad, but hilarious story about the world's most dangerous group! When the movie first open, you'll be on the edge of your seat.

It's a very educated film. <br/><br/>Although a 90's baby, I've been a fan of NWA. When I heard they were making a film about them I was ecstatic. For people who are not familiar with the group, I recommend you watching this film to get a better understanding of the group and who paved the way for society. Although they weren't most of time positive, or what I considered them ""Anti- Public Enemy"", the were honest. They spoke the truth about what was going on in not only they neighborhood, but turns out every neighborhood that was dealing police brutality, culture, the law, and people. Straight Outta Compton demonstrates all of that. Not only was it well produced and accurate, but the acting from the main and supporting cast was realistic and somewhat Oscar-worthy.

"Solnichka","5","5","25","18 July 2016"," Eh ... movie just makes more noise than anything else
","I was a teenager in the 1980s, but I never heard any of this music until the early 2010s (unless you count 1992 Lollapalooza when I was forced to listen to Ice Cube?). While the film is interesting in its exploration of the culture surrounding N.W.A, it's also pretty inaccurate from what any common-sense viewer can discern by simply doing some research. But hey, that's what sells these days ... Jason Mitchell, however, steals this movie with his portrayal of Eazy-E, and that character was the most interesting of the film, truthfully. We all know they toned down Dre's character for some reason, and they overplayed Cube's character (to the point of annoyance, no less as he comes off as a huge jerk in this movie). But E was N.W.A, in all its glory—for better or for worse, and Mitchell really lights up the screen. I've read all the lawsuits that are flying around about the film's misrepresentation of people, and then I wonder why the filmmakers just couldn't tell the truth. Is it because the facts wouldn't sell? Is it because the facts don't meet the myths that people have been buying for years from Cube and Dre? Too bad Eazy-E died two decades ago, because I get the feeling he was the only *real* one of the bunch. Watch the movie for E, basically; the rest of it is kind of just trash. Thankfully, I didn't pay a dime to watch this film, and thankfully, I've never given a dime to Cube or Dre. But I'd give some money to talk to Eazy, that's for sure."

","Straight Outta Compton is a failed attempt to tell the story of NWA/Eazy E's story. A rap group of the late 80's through to the mid 90's. This came across more of a highlight reel, with facts thrown together, than a flowing film. I am not sure how a screenwriter could tackle the daunting task of telling this story without it losing something. The story and people are very complex.<br/><br/>I like NWA and I like their music. Having been there through the whole story, there isn't one thing in this movie that I didn't already know. Which was disappointing. <br/><br/>In the beginning it felt like I was watching theater more than a movie. Soon it would pick up pace and the music kicked in and it helped keep my interest. Without the music the film would have been terribly dull to watch. <br/><br/>O'Shea Jackson Jr. not only portrays his father, Ice Cube, superbly, but the depth of his acting was so on point he became the best part of the whole movie. He, in my opinion, is the star of this film.<br/><br/>If you are not aware of the story, go see this movie. But don't expect more than an encyclopedia insight into what really happened."
"MediaPanther","Null","6","33","13 August 2015"," An Excellent Film!
","Making a biopic is no easy accomplishment. There are always going to be yells that certain people, places, things were left out or shown in a bad light,etc. There's no guarantee that the filmmakers will have the blessing from the actual living persons or estate. There is the chance that the person or persons cast won't be able to convince the audience. And of course, can the filmmakers pull the whole thing off? In the particular case of Straight Outta Compton, there's no need to worry from the audience or the cast and crew. It's phenomenal. With only one known entity, albeit an amazing one, director F. Gary Gray (Law Abiding Citizen, Be Cool), screenwriters Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff and the entire filmmaking team used almost all unknown actors and zeroed in on a group, time, and place that unfortunately and uncannily is still relevant to this day.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is the story of the groundbreaking rap group known as N.W.A. The group started in the mid-80′s with the hardscrabble life of growing up with gang violence, drugs, and police brutality as their backdrop. Using their street knowledge, talent for writing, sound mixing, rapping, and some capital courtesy of one of the members, N.W.A. set themselves apart from other groups and styles of the time. Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella, Ice Cube and Easy E combined infectious beats with incendiary rhymes to give a voice to a generation of urban youth who were waiting for someone to tell it like it is.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, the die is cast that Straight Outta Compton is going to be an intense, detailed slice of life. A police tank equipped with a battering ram knocks down the whole front of a house and knocks a woman all the way across the room. It's not overseas, it's in the 'hood. It's a powerful scene and amazingly done. Counter that with Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) laying on his back, headphones on, amongst albums strewn across the floor. He's listening to a Roy Ayers classic, deep in thought, then his mom turns off the record player killing his vibe. The movie is rife with these kinds of details, including Jheri curls and activator.<br/><br/>This being a film about a musical group, it would be remiss if there was no mention about the score and soundtrack. Straight Outta Compton not only has N.W.A.'s music, it also has R&B, soul, jazz, and some disco. The music is there and it sounds really good from a quality perspective. Kudos to the music and sound people.<br/><br/>The film is rich with characters. Each member of the group gets his due and others that were on the periphery get a nod. Props to Cindy Tolan for the casting choices because to mention everyone in this review would be difficult and to single out certain performances is almost impossible. This is especially true for viewers who might not be familiar with who is who. For instance, N.W.A.'s encounter and dealings with Marion ""Suge Knight. R. Marcos Taylor not only looks like the imposing, maniacal, mountain of a man, his performance is menacingly spot on. However, because Straight Outta Compton centers for the most part on Easy E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and their manager Jerry Heller, the spotlight is on them. Making these characters come to life and leaving an indelible impression on you is the work of Jason Mitchell, the aforementioned Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., and Paul Giamatti, respectively. It was a stroke of near genius and enormous confidence to shoot a 2 1/2 hr film about rappers with unknowns and then ask Giamatti (John Adams!) to sign on. The scenes involving these actors are funny, poignant, and intense. None more so than when the group is outside the recording studio and get harassed by the police, or finally getting Easy E to step into the sound booth. All four of these actors deserve recognition but especially Mitchell and Giamatti.<br/><br/>For those who might not like rap or to be more specific ""gangsta"" rap, the film is more than that. From start to finish Straight Outta Compton is an amazing film. Timing is everything and with what is going on right now in society, makes it that much more profound."

","Straight Outta Compton is a terrific journey through the music, and culture of the 80's and 90's despite it's stereotypes. This movie is fun to watch, for multiple reasons, but the biggest is the music. While you watch and jam out to the awesome music, you also get to see the culture and society of the 80's and 90's. Besides the music, the acting is also surprisingly good, as all of the actors are given moments to shine. My biggest complaint is the portrayal of police in the film, I understand that a large majority of police in Los Angeles were corrupt, but not every cop was a racist pig, I think the racist cops would have been even more resonating if we saw a normal cop every once and a while, not just a bunch of growling, racist, asses. In essence Straight Outta Compton is a funny, well acted, engrossing, music jam fest, that chronicles one of the more important rap groups of all time, but could have layed off of the stereotypes."

But over the years I gain knowledge about the Group and listen to their songs it makes you go wow this group really had something.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is a Biography/Drama film that tells the story of how N.W.A. emerges from the streets of Compton in Los Angeles with their music and tales that explain the life in the hood. I went into this movie knowing some history but what I got here was I never saw coming <br/><br/>The movie theater wasn't full but it had a good crowd<br/><br/>The five men would be Ice Cube, Dr.Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and Dj Yella. <br/><br/>The film present itself very well and it is crafted to match the tone of the story where we learn about the history of N.W.A. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are actually so well done that you can feel the emotion. It really hit home in some scenes plus with some impressive performance it is easy to forget that you were watching a movie.<br/><br/>The music in the film has a collection of the classic Hip Hop songs from the mid 80s and 90s. It really good how they gave other classic songs some play time in the movie<br/><br/>My main complain about the movie is the slow down that take place. It was like they stall the film for a while perhaps it's me but that's how I felt. <br/><br/>But if you enjoy movies about music than this should be consider seeing.<br/><br/>While the film does lack in some areas it does make up for being truth to the style of N.W.A.<br/><br/>With strong acting, raw music and good history on the group that made Hip Hop like it is you will be quite surprised I give Straight Outta Compton an 8 out of 10"

","I'm only writing this as a kind of response to the outrageously low marks, and occasionally racist reviews. I know a little bit about the story, I followed this stuff when I was growing up. I was about 10 or 11 when I started to listen to rap music (I listen to ALL types of music not just rap! I have a very wide taste in music and a huge record/CD collection to back that up!)... OK, basically, I LOVED this film. I enjoyed how the story was told, all these crappy reviews on here are very suspicious indeed as some of them are virtually identical to each other! People moaning about the swearing? You've got to be f**king kidding me! People moaning about young angry black men being glamorised for their choices in life and how they act? F**k. Off. I don't see people slagging off mafia films like Goodfellas or Casino in the same way! And some people on here complaining about it being an 'Adult' movie!?! Swearing, sex, nudity, gang activities etc. Of COURSE it's and ADULT MOVIE! SO F**KING WHAT!? There's even some reviews bringing the good lard G- zuz into it! How? What the f**k does Jesus have to do with it?! Less Jesus, More G's, please!<br/><br/>It's a film, it's Hollywood, even I expect errors in these biopics because of that! The acting was very good indeed I thought. Certainly no problem there. Some things were left out, but as I said, I kind of expect that from Hollywood.<br/><br/>These 1 star reviews are suspicious cos they certainly don't reflect accurate feedback. If my mate, who didn't know who NWA were and has never ever listened to rap music, can become engrossed in this biopic, and actually say to me at the end ""Man, that was actually really good! I found that thoroughly enjoyable!"" We watched it late at night when he was dropping off to sleep. Instead, he got into it and woke up cos he was enjoying it so much... So, ultimately, I'm not going to say much about the film as there's no real point. It was just a reaction to the 1 star, bordering racist, filled with crappy personal irrelevant opinions reviews...

","A lot of people are saying that this movie glamorizes the thug life, and it portrays the protagonists as heroes even though they're bad role models etcetera etcetera. The truth is, this movie is down right amazing. The plot, the casting, the producing, whatever, it's all good. Straight Outta Compton simply shows the struggle that the rap pioneers endured in their era. Racism was a big deal, and so was police brutality. The 80's and 90's had the same problems that we have today. that's why 'Fuck Tha Police' was so controversial. This movie is telling it how it is, or was. People are just mad because this movie shows the reality of America and its police. Alright, the movie is a little embellished. They exaggerated some of the events, and cut out others, but that doesn't change the struggle. That doesn't change that the police were dicks, and that doesn't change NWA's talent. Nobody likes to look in the mirror, and that is what this movie is; it is a mirror for white America."

As a character says : ""it's police harassment"" that the young Black Americans have (had) to endure. Racism everywhere, showing its ugly face. These very days you can see it a lot on social networks, such as Youtube, but even here in the comments. Because it is impossible to deny this movie its artistic qualities, the amazing acting, and the creative camera viewpoints. And so if you dis all the cinematographic qualities of this, it might very be that what bothered you first and last was this was a movie with black people (not ending poorly).<br/><br/>I am glad that the movie showed the real video of the poor man beaten by the police, and showed it not once, but two or three times. Because that can't be forgotten. Especially as that keeps happening! I tell you, I find that Black Americans are quite gracious about all they have to still endure.<br/><br/>You may not be a fan of rap culture, and then not really appreciate this movie.

","""You are about to witness the strength of street knowledge."" The 80's was dominated by groups like Bon Jovi and Wham. When 5 kids from California burst on the scene they not only changed music but attitudes as well. The meteoric rise to the top changed everyone's lives, and some friendships. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I love true stories, music and bio-pics but I was never really a fan of NWA. Growing up outside Detroit I heard them a lot growing up but I never really connected with it. All that aside this movie is outstanding. It grips you from the beginning and really keeps you until the end, which seems to come to quickly. Paul Giamatti is great in this, as usual, but the actors they picked to play the group are incredible and are the ones that really make the movie. I could really go on and on about this but just watch this. Even if you don't like the group, just watch it. The fact that this movie got overlooked at the awards is a travesty.

"Troy_Campbell","8","6","34","4 September 2015"," Captivating rap biopic.
","This engrossing biopic from F. Gary Gray looks at the rise and fall of Compton-based rap posse N.W.A, an innovative group pivotal in the emergence of ""gangsta rap"" in the late eighties. Their music, inspired by the violent L.A. streets they grew up on, caused major controversy due to its advocacy of authority-defying behaviour, and Gray wisely utilises this turbulence as the anchor of the whole movie. Like all true stories, a fair amount of artistic licence has been taken by the filmmakers here, yet the ticking-time-bomb atmosphere and larger than life characters have been captured with an indefatigable energy. It helps that the casting is absolutely spot on; the iconic trio at the forefront of the story – Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-E – are portrayed with charismatic gusto by relative newcomers Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Jason Mitchell. A smattering of soon-to-be-famous rappers (such as Tupac and Snoop Dogg) pop up here and there to emphasise the central role the N.W.A members played within the rap game, but it thankfully stops short of being gimmicky. And then there's the soundtrack. It's obviously amazing, with the famous tracks given extra oomph via multiple concert scenes (where the actors performed in front of real crowds) that are thoroughly captivating. It may not be completely warts-and-all with Dre and Ice Cube producing, however Straight Outta Compton is an enthralling look at a seminal influence on the rap industry."
"emmanuelhenry","9","6","34","19 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton is a well done bio pic with fantastic performances by new comers
","Straight Outta Compton tells the true live events of the rap group N.W.A and is produced by Ice Cube and Dr.Dre members of the group. Not going into too much detail but if you are a fan of N.W.A like me here is the movie for you. The film is directed F. Gary Gray and stars O'Shea Jackson JR (Ice Cube's son) Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown JR, Aldis Hodge and Paul Giamatti. Thought this movie is a little bit too sugar coated and leaves out some events that I wish were explored in the movie, But now let's talk about what works well the first hour is close to amazing. The acting is incredible, O'Shea Jackson JR prepared for this role for 2 years and I was a little skeptical because he is the son of Ice Cube and I thought other actors should have been cast instead but I was totally wrong he owned it. Corey Hawkins was great he did not feel Hollywood is his performance natural like an actual person and Jason Mitchell was fantastic as well. Like really, really, really fantastic. The Editing, Pacing and cinematography is beautifully put together. Although the first act is top notch the second act lost some steam, some parts got confusing and felt like someone else directing it, and like I said this movie sugar coated a little too much. But those our my only complains really. Also forget to mention this but you might have figured out by now that the music is freaking awesome!! Straight Outta Compton might lose some steam at end and they missed some events that would have been great to see, none the less this is a must see for fans as for with great directing and acting I say check it out 8.3/10"
"jeannek6161","7","6","34","19 August 2015"," Good Movie, I was surprised. However...
","I had to give this a 7 out of 10 for historical accuracy. Too many inconsistencies which always happens in a ""true life story"". It just seems NWA, the band I remember and the movie Strait Outta Compton have similarities and also differences, a good bit of the story has been softened for the posterity of the band. I hope everyone is aware that these guys rapped ""gansta"" and were not really gangsters. Only Eazy E was actually considered a criminal in that sense. Ice Cube went to college for a year although in the film he is presented as very naive. These guys grew up in South Central LA, I'm sure they weren't alter boys. I think they got in over their heads with sleaze bags as well as criminals along the road to fame, which was greed. While it is downplayed in the film, they were not violent, even Dr Dre lost money on both NWA's label and later his OWN Death Row. <br/><br/>I liked the movie, it is one of the best biopics I have seen. Having seen them live, and not a kid during this time, I remember resenting these guys and their bitches and hoes. Until my husband made me do some research into the band. What they did, in a very backwards and accidental way was bring a new genre of music to people by offending the hell out of them. The more obscene they were, the more press they got and they loved it. But what they did was shed some light on a huge unspoken part of America, for those who stopped to listen, they threw a spotlight on a problem which would be caught on video a couple of years later and we still have to this day. They brought angry rap, to white America who listened, purchased music and tried to identify... There are a few music moments I remember with great clarity, one of them is N.W.A.and F**k the Police. Violence of which, I have seen and could identify with, its horrible to be disrespected in your own house by a cop..just because he can. Both the first time I heard it and seeing it live..it was extraordinarily energetic. These guys were in your face and it was NO JOKE that the police hated it. There were protests against these guys when you walked into the venue as a ticket holder. Iced -T (also very angry police)same thing. I cannot remember too many other bands that made that many people angry EVERYWHERE. That part was real.. This movie could have and should have centered more on the band, as a whole. So much was left out including some of the people either not mentioned or merely mentioned that contributed to them, such as The D.O.C. The movie could have remained centered on the band and the stuff they did, not so much with the side endeavors of Ice Cube and The Dr once the band split. They could have delved into the bands issues they had learning about show business, etc. Dealt with issues in a way that was not so vague or completely skipped as if history never occurred. I read they had to cut this from a 3:30 hour movie to a 2 hour movie..I hope they kept the cut footage. I know they did..this is NWA..$$$$, what am I talking about? It would be good to see an honest movie from two such people about the things that really happened. If you are going to tell a story, tell the story, not the stuff you think we want to hear. It could also have been more accurate, a good bit of the story has been tweaked and/or softened for the posterity of the band. Dr Dre left out the beating of a woman reporter for not giving NWA an opportunity to dispute or give their own side of an article her publisher ran on Ice Cube. Really Dre? While these guys were known as street thugs..they were young guys from middle income families. <br/><br/>I remember these times and all of the conflict. Dr Dre was supposed to be working with or had worked with Ice Cube and then there was the Tunnel discussion. But until recent interviews no mention of them reuniting as a band, at least publicly. Also, Eazy E did not fall into a keyboard and get rushed to the hospital, he had a cough for months and was taken to the hospital in February for asthma related problems, he was admitted on February 24th at Cedars Sinai. On March 1 he was diagnosed with Aids, WHICH HE WAS PUBLIC ABOUT, On March 15th he was was in critical condition in ICU and was conscious although unable to speak due to respirator. He lost consciousness one week later and lived until March 26, 1995. Dr Dre made an appearance at Cedars Sinai on March 17th, but no discussion on if he was able to speak to Eazy. Ice Cube related the same story (about them running into each other at the Tunnel in NYC)shown in the movie, in a call in radio talk show in LA called ""The Beat"", shortly after Eazy E's death. <br/><br/>I think the truth would have been better and made it easier to understand the legacy of this band, which is opulent, dangerous, sad, how -to -market -something and make millions ridiculous. But at the end of the day, it was always all about the money, with these guys, they ripped off their friends and each other. What a waste, if they just would have stuck together, you know like a gang?"

","Compton, CA. 1986. Eric ""Easy E"" Wright narrowly escapes the police when his drug deal goes bust. Back in his home Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young moves out of his mom's house. O'Shea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson witnesses first hand gang intimidation when his school bus gets cut off by gangsters who were taunted by his friends. Cube goes to Dre's new house and tells them about it and his new rhymes. At a club Cube raps the rhymes while Dre spins. There Dre, Cube, E, MC Ren and DJ Yella meet. Dre convinces E to invest in music. After E bails Dre from jail, they form Ruthless Records with E rapping out Cube's rhymes Boyz in the Hood. This draws the attention of a music manager Jerry Heller. In 1988, their group NWA has have solid fan base. Jerry invites recording people, who mostly pass except for Bryan Turner. A bodyguard Suge Knight is also there and offers the group his services. NWA records their album ""Straight Outta Compton"". But when they have their breaks outside the studio, they get harassed by the LAPD. This inspires Cube to write ""Fuck Tha Police"". The song goes number one but the FBI warns not to play it. Cube mentions there's something fishy about their contracts with Jerry, to Dre's dismissal. In Detroit NWA plays ""Fuck Tha Police"" despite prior warning, making them get arrested and rioting ensues. <br/><br/>Jerry gives a contract to Cube but Cube smells something wrong and refuses to sign it and ends up leaving Ruthless Records. He ends up with Turner's Priority Records in 1990, scoring a hit debut solo album. He goes on a lyric battle with the rest of NWA over their songs. Meanwhile Suge Knight now changed careers to managing talents and tries recruiting Dre. Meanwhile the Rodney King case takes place. Dre talks to E about Jerry's misgivings but E still believes Jerry, making Dre leaves and joins Suge to form Death Row Records. Suge beats E into releasing Dre from contract. Death Row soon has artists like Snoop Dogg. Suge's violence starts to irritate Dre. On April 1992 The Rodney King case has its verdict deeming the LAPD not guilty, triggering the LA riots. In 1993 E starts to have money issues while Cube gets successful in the movies and Dre's album is a hit. E's girl shows him Jerry's misgivings. E meets Cube at a club and they forget their beef. Cube agrees on NWA reunion but without Jerry. E starts to look sick. E soon fires Jerry, and soon meets Ren and Yella to work on a NWA reunion project. But E suddenly faints and doctors deems him HIV+ and has only about six months. E goes public with his disease. Dre visits E who's now in a coma. Cube also comes but refuses to see E like that. E dies at 31 years old.<br/><br/>As a biopic movie of one of the most influential groups, particularly to the black community and culture in the US, the story is really tightly knit and solid. The movie creators did well in not minding the duration to go through more than two hours in exchange for a solid story presented. It's also quite well executed, developing the movie's start and end points well without having to be vague and still within a reasonable duration time frame.<br/><br/>Yet I admit I was rather disappointed to see that the movie wasn't really like what I expected. Having seen Boyz n the Hood (1991) a few months back, I was expecting more depictions of the real life in the Hood down in South Central LA. The movie is like that for only the mere beginning sequences. For me it would have been nicer if the movie gets back to this location and mood fro time to time, like when T dies. The fact is the movie changes into a mix of Empire and some other band movies altogether.<br/><br/>It's quite nice to see how the movie finds look-a-likes and insert them to put more legitimacy to the entire depiction of the true story. The mood was really well placed with the younger Snoop Dogg and Tupac. But it's also a double edged blade since Corey Hawkins' face looks nowhere like Dr. Dre's. Ice Cube's character gets even better since it's being played by Cube's own son.<br/><br/>The acting overall is quite good. As a newcomer Corey Hawkins did a decent job in depicting the emotions of the iconic figure in Dr. Dre. O'Shea Jackson Jr. did well in acting out his father's life. But I really doubt that he can act other parts well enough with this level of performance. I think he nailed being Ice Cube here because he's Cube's own son who lived with him all these years and got to know the person quite so much inside out including his mannerisms. Jason Mitchell did quite well in providing he other angle in E's character. Paul Giamatti completed the required character angle that has significance.<br/><br/>My view for Straight Outta Compton (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10. It's really entertaining with a solid and tight story based on actual events. A recommendation goes out especially to you who are exposed to the culture. I don't think the movie can get much acceptance in communities rarely touched by the culture, though."
"RforFilm","7","6","34","17 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton contains the right beats and lyrics to rise outta the ghetto, even if it trudges in schmaltzy tropes
","We are what our environment makes us. I grew up in a small town that has grown, but I like to imagine how different I would have become if my parents would have stayed in the Los Angeles area. Perhaps I might have been more troubled or perhaps not. I grew up in Long Beach for a few years before we moved, but I wasn't old enough to have had any influence. The area wasn't dangerous, or at least nowhere near as dangerous as the city of Compton was. <br/><br/>Compton, California tends to have a reputation as one of the most ghetto cities in the world. I don't think it would be put on any list, but if you were to get off the 91 freeway twenty years ago for a car trip, it would be a bit easier to make a case. The entire city of Los Angeles was in a gang problem with the Crips and Bloods in an everlasting melee, yet Compton seemed to be the center of it. The area was a probably black community and it didn't help that the law enforcement was anything but sympathetic and came around to simple harass. Coming Straight Outta Compton was a group that would use it's message from the streets to create a different side of rap.<br/><br/>In Compton in 1986, five friends Dr. Dre (played by Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), Eazy-E (played by Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (played by Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (played by Neil Brown, Jr.) form a new hip hop group N.W.A with the goal of putting their hard views of city living and gang warfare within their raps. Their first single, ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" catches the ear of a music business man, Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti) whose been looking to get back into management.<br/><br/>Eazy-E works out the deal with Haller, making him the manager for N.W.A. while Eazy-E starts his own label, Ruthless Records. Haller gives them the resources to make their next album, but the guys are still harassed by law enforcement. The album, Straight Outa Compton, is a smash hit, making the group popular by mainstream crowds and giving them their first tour. When not paid for his written work, Ice Cube leaves the group to embark on a solo career while Dr. Dre signs on to Death Row Records. Each guy takes different route in the music business as L.A. continues it's crime problems leading to the 1992 L.A. Riots. Bio pics are a dime a dozen and need a hook to stand out. Straight Outta Compton has the right beat and does well as a storyfor a while.<br/><br/>The strongest elements here are the production value and acting. Straight Outa Compton has some of the best recreated concert footage since The Doors. When the concert in Detroit was commencing, I almost forgot I was watching a movie and that I was watching a documentary. All five boys resemble their counterparts in a way that adds to the documentary argument. Even watching O'Shea Jackion (who also happens to be Ice Cube's son) sing ""F**k the Police"" was freaky with how much he resembles Ice Cube.<br/><br/>The movie is standard as a bio pic I would have ruled it as an entertaining piece of music history had it not been for the unnecessary last forty five minutes. Without giving away who it is, one character coughs and the movie embarks on the trope of padding it until they die twenty minutes later. It's predictable and easily could have been cut and implied instead. As sad as a death in the family is, the movie needed to make it's cuts and choices a bit better for the sake of a flowing story.<br/><br/>I'll give it seven Straight Outa Compton albums out of ten. For what it is, I'm glad I saw this. It's a needed look to understand why a song like ""F**k the Police"" would be made and how people would misunderstand it's intention."

","The first few scenes of F. Gary Gray's Straight Outta Compton threw me for a loop, at first promising a different movie than I realized it was forming. It starts off dark, with Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright collecting on a drug deal gone bad before the police bust in with a battering ram. On a bus, Ice Cube is writing lyrics when gang members storm the bus and threaten the students. At first, I thought it was trying to show the background of the characters; but instead, it was cleverly introducing these characters while displaying the Compton landscape- a rotted, shady urban underbelly where gangs run the streets, hard-working adults lock themselves away from the oppressive world outside their walls, and all the while, the police continue to crack down on criminals and non-criminals alike, widening the divide between the people and authority. This is the world where these young men grew up, and it would become the essence of their art.<br/><br/>After getting a pretty strong dose of Compton, the movie brings together the four rappers; Eazy-E, a young guy who does what he can to make ends meet, and uses his money to help out one of his friends; Dr. Dre, a charismatic and brilliant young mind who devotes all of himself to music and the business of music, which proves fruitful when Eazy-E puts up money for a recording studio; Ice Cube, a gifted lyricist whose tough exterior doesn't override his good heart and sharp mind; and MC-Ren, who unfortunately, is far too underdeveloped to leave much of a comment on. He's a friend of the guys, and when they're all in the studio, magic happens.<br/><br/>Whatever casting director was brought on board was a genius; not only do the actors look very much like the younger versions of their real-life counterparts (in the leading and supporting roles), but these unknowns all bring a unique charisma to each character that's impossible to resist. They might be tough guys with some harsh words to say, but they're funny, they're real, and they're as loyal as friends can be.<br/><br/>That is, until Jerry Heller, played by the only recognizable cast member in the bunch- Paul Giamatti- signs the N.W.A. He brings success and publicity to the group, but there is more to what's on the surface. Though Giamatti does great in his role, I couldn't help but feel the role was a bit underwritten, as I found it nearly impossible to decipher if he was to be trusted or not in many of the scenes. What Jerry represents is the 'evil' music industry, how they might restrict their artists (ex: when Jerry freaks out because the N.W.A. receives a warning from the federal government), and how they can divide a group by tipping the balance of the individual members.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton touches on a lot of motifs- the music industry, police brutality, fame and all its decadence- but without much elaboration. Instead, it uses these things as a vehicle to demonstrate how certain tracks came to be. Straight Outta Compton doesn't offer much in the way of discussion or deep thinking about a lot of these topics, but instead focuses on the characters and their historical time together. It's not really a fault with the movie so much as a catch-22.<br/><br/>Still, it certainly is a riveting film that offers magnificent insight to the 'world's most dangerous group'- but perhaps it could have taken a magnifying glass to some of the ugly realities of the characters, not just the environment around them. It is completely neglected that Dr. Dre was brought up on abuse charges for throwing a woman through a door, and while it shows that he has a kid, he is seen partying like there is no tomorrow, without any comment on the correlation between the two. Eazy-E is a drug dealer in the beginning, and suddenly he flips the switch to musician? There are some unanswered questions- and some uncovered truths- about these young men that are never touched on for fear of turning the audience on the characters. It's a great biopic but as it is with most biopics, only gives us the glimpses of the things we want to see; it gives us some of the surface ugliness without digging deeper. These stones left unturned don't make the film a very complex one. <br/><br/>My only other criticism is that the film's end feels a bit abrupt. Perhaps there is no real closure cause there is nothing thematic overarching the movie, or maybe it's because it's not really the end of the story. Maybe it's both. But at two and a half hours, I was hoping for a bit more of an epilogue that left with me something to think about. Despite some of these setbacks, I can say I learned a lot and was entertained the whole way through. If you don't know anything about these four important rappers, or this genre in general, this is a must-see. And if you do know, then chalk it up to being just a well-done recap of the short but lucrative career of the N.WA.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","There were lots of debate over this film's snub from the Oscars, but I'm not here to talk about that. As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.<br/><br/>This film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"JonnyCampo","8","6","36","22 August 2015"," Straight Outta Compton is an awesome Music Bio Film
","Straight Outta Compton is a great movie. period. I'm not super surprised that it was good but i am surprised at how good it really was. This film is easily one of the best of 2015 maybe even one of the best music based films, or even one of the better biographical films of all time. The acting in the movie is pretty amazing given the fact that there is very little star power involved. The entirety of the cast is good in this movie, especially Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins who both have big futures ahead of them. Paul Giamatti was really good as Jerry Heller, but by far the stand out in this entire film was O'Shea Jackson Jr. just killing his role playing his own father Ice Cube. We cant forget about the music, The soundtrack to this movie is amazing and all of the live performances are really cool. i like the fact that they chose to play the actual music performed by the actual artist and just let the actors lip sync it, and this makes sense to me because i went in to this wanting to hear NWA and not some no name actors singing the songs. (which is what they did that screwed up the Biggie Smalls Movie *Notorious*). F. Gary Gray did a great job directing this movie its probably the best movie hes ever made and if not its the best since Friday. Though a few main points were missing from movie such as most of Dr.Dre's time at Death Row which was probably the high point of his musical career, working with the likes of Snoop Dogg who would become is most frequent collaborator and Tupac which came out to about 3 minutes in this movie. The Mid and Most Successful part of Ice Cubes Career where he hit album sales highs and starred in a bunch of movies, including two ground breaking movies with Friday which spawned 2 more movies and a cartoon show and Chris Tuckers Career, as well as Boyz N The Hood. Another couple missing points were Eazy E's helping legendary rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony get started, as well as MC Ren's Solo rap career or The D.O.C's anything really. all of these things are slightly hinted at but never fleshed out i can see that it would have been hard since the movie was already pretty long at a 2hr 27min running time, adding another 20 minutes would have made the movie drag to much. in conclusion this movie is great and is definitely worth a watch, i 100% recommend watching this movie at least once especially if you're into more old school rap. I rate Straight Outta Compton 8 out of 10"
"Stephen_Klein","9","6","36","22 August 2015"," Skillfully Executed Biopic
","Just a little background: I am a very avid hip hop fan, familiar with NWA's music and a huge fan of Dr. Dre's solo career. This certainly added to my enjoyment of the film, but my brother, who is not familiar with much of NWA or pre-2010's rap music, enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>About the movie: S.O.C. is a captivating chronicle of the formation and dissolution of one of hip hop's most notorious groups. Overall, I was very impressed with the casting and the acting was great, too. Each actor bore a striking resemblance to the artist they portrayed, even down to manners of speaking and movements This may have been easiest for O'Shea, who was acting as his father, but I was especially impressed with Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. I've heard varied critiques of the accuracy of story, but I was too young to experience this in real life, so I can't comment either way. Regardless of how honest the plot was throughout, it was fun to have musical milestones to follow, specifically in the form of each album released.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of hip hop and are even remotely interested in the history of NWA, you should find yourself enjoying S.O.C. That being said, if you are NOT a fan of hip hop culture, you might find this movie disgusting. I've seen so many 1 star ratings on here, citing the excessive profanity and glorification of violence, which I find humorous because it's no secret that this was the nature of gangsta rap and NWA. You can't walk into this expecting some polished and safe biopic like ""Imitation Game"" or ""Theory of Everything."" The poster itself has the movie's title written in the form of a parental warning sticker. I will say that as far as profanity and sexual content is concerned, this movie is actually below the level that we saw in ""Wolf of Wall Street"" a couple years ago; this leads me to believe that some folks are harboring extra offense because the film is entirely black (actors, director, subjects) and the ""enemies"" are white (cops specifically). As Ice Cube says during the movie, ""our art is a reflection of our reality."" Police brutality and gang violence continue to be issues today, so if these themes disturb you, you should be equally disturbed by the real events that occur in America.<br/><br/>I understand that this movie isn't for everyone, but if you've got thick skin and a respect for hip hop culture and the freedom of expression, you should have a great time."

","First, I'm not a fan of the music so I only knew parts of the story going in. What I did remember of these events were from those discussed at school or I saw in the news. And that gave me enough background to relate to the movie.<br/><br/>First, I found this movie fascinating and I left wanting to know more. It's a long movie, but felt pretty short to me. There is so much going on that I never felt bored. Unfortunately, that is the one thing I had a problem with. There was so much going on, so many individual stories, that none of the stories never were flushed out completely. So to Google I went to fill in the spaces.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a movie. Yes, I understand facts were probably changed, that's just the way these biopics go. But seeing events unfold on the big screen and remembering talking about them in the halls of my school was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Interesting movie, and I hope to see it again. Wouldn't even mind an uncut version if more scenes could be added."
"diac228","8","6","37","21 August 2015"," This film has got somethin' to say
","This movie would not have been greenlit 15 years ago.<br/><br/>And this movie took a decade to finally receive the full backing it needed to fully produce the story behind the rap group that started it all.<br/><br/>Perfect timing too.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton a surprisingly powerful and deep film that looks into the trials, tribulations, successes, and failures of the three main men behind N.W.A.; a group that fueled a short-lived but powerful revolutionary run of success with its urban attitude, strong lyrics, and absolutely biting commentary on devastating realities that music had never dealt with up to that point. N.W.A. became notorious for bringing light to living in the deepest parts of California while dealing with a society that constantly makes it difficult for them to branch out. This film doesn't just highlight their beginnings and eventual rise to success, it also deals with the outcome of their decisions and what happens when the wrong people are mixed in.<br/><br/>Some have argued that the aftermath bogs down the movie, that the third act becomes a slight drag. But truth be told, no storm literally or figuratively is at its strongest in the aftermath, but at the point of impact. From the first tense scene on, Straight Outta Compton holds very little back in terms of the lyrical content, the violence, the drugs, and the disturbing environment they have to survive in as they fight for a way out. Gang members pleading for the next generation to stick to their books, cops destroying houses they believe might have drugs, and a systematic cycle of violence and grimness that comes with the impoverished life. The script gives light on the good, the bad, and the ugly part of representing the hood culture that N.W.A. managed to (slightly) escape with their bittersweet poetry.<br/><br/>Movies representing this lifestyle and the people in it hardly get a good budget and good production value to back them up. But thanks to the powerhouse moneymakers that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube have become, it is now a hell of a lot easier for them to tell their story: and they got a great writing cast, great production team, and a superb director (F. Gary Gary has Friday and Italian Job in his resume) to back them up. Back then you couldn't have dreamed of an N.W.A. movie containing great cinematography, wonderful editing, and fantastic musical score (outside the source material) to follow a talented young cast that emulates the men behind the group perfectly. The movie is sleek, crisp, and sounds better than most of your biggest blockbusters.<br/><br/>There is no scaling back the content and the lifestyles during Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Easy-E's rise to the top. Some of what you see is concerning and slightly paints some ugly on their personalities, and that's why the third act albeit not as energetic is required. Consequences are indeed dished out, people are lost, friendships and partnerships are tested, and devils left and right challenge the foundation and wellbeing of our main cast. The story is never pretty, whether they are buying a new house or losing it. This is why Straight Outta Compton succeeds as a film, very little sugarcoating while giving each character their good side as well as their dark side.<br/><br/>The sugarcoating does exist though. With Ice Cube and Dr. Dre producing, I'm sure there were some skeletons in their closet that were not going to be revealed; especially when it involves the N.W.A. tours, the nasty rap beefs that followed (back when rap beefs had some actual meat), and especially during the darkest days of Death Row Records (led by rap music villain Suge Knight). Reputation is key, and I'm sure that Cube and Dre want to avoid any further controversies as their market value remains strong. They are now businessmen far removed from the dirty days of mixing records and avoiding arrest for being black. But hey, it's their money, so it's their story.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is a big budget biography that hits all the right notes, even though it doesn't aim to tell the entire story. But there's a lot that needs to be said, and plenty was unveiled within the 140 minutes of great acting, superb writing, and tight direction. It is a rags-to-riches story, except for the fact that the rags followed them long after the riches came pouring in. If you think it's just a simple movie glamorizing the gangster life then you aren't seeing this with an open mind and both eyes open. The story took a while to be displayed on screen, but thankfully the moment has finally come, and it definitely doesn't disappoint."
"gangstahippie","9","6","37","20 August 2015"," The Greatest Biographical Film of a Rap/Hip-Hop Artist or Group
","I credit NWA with introducing me to hip-hop back in seventh grade.Prior to this, I wasn't a huge fan of the genre (except for maybe some Eminem) mainly because I only heard the rap/hip-hop music played on the radio or music video shows, which by the 2000's seemed to decline in quality.I then saw the music video for the song ""Straight Outta Compton"" on TV one day and immediately I got into NWA which started me on a path to discover classic rap and hip-hop.So of course when I heard that there would be a biopic of N.W.A, I had to see it.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very impressed with the film. The runtime is 2hrs 27min but it felt much shorter than that. The film does a good job of detailing the beginnings of NWA, how a group of young men from Compton, Ice Cube, MC REN, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and Dr.Dre wanted to make music that would make people aware of the dangers of living in Compton and other ghettos, despite the fact that due to the use of gratuitous foul language and depictions of sex, drugs and violence in their music were thought to glamorize the ""gangsta"" lifestyle.The film shows the controversy which surrounded the group, the police brutality they and many people living in Compton faced on a day to day basis as well as personal issues regarding whether or not their manager Jerry Heller along with Eazy-E were skimming money from the rest of the group which eventually led to Ice Cube and later Dr. Dre's departure. The film also depicts the gangsta rap scene of the late 80's-mid 90's and other issues such as the L.A Riots.The performances in the film from a cast of mostly unknown actors are also very good.<br/><br/>The only issues I had with the film are that I would have liked to see at least some of the Eazy-E/Dr.Dre feud as well as more of MC Ren, who even took to twitter to complain about his reduced portrayal in the film.If you are a fan of NWA or rap/hip-hop in general, then you owe it to yourself to see this film. Even if you are not a fan of this genre of music but enjoy music biopics in general, you would likely still enjoy this film.<br/><br/>9/10"

","With The Wu-Tang Clan's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and the first N.W.A. album Straight Outta Compton being my first Hip-Hop albums, (I got them in Music Zone on the same day!)I was thrilled to hear that a film was being made about the NWA.With a friend celebrating his 29th birthday the same day that the movie reached cinemas in the UK,we both decided that it was the perfect time to pay a visit to Compton.<br/><br/>The plot-<br/><br/>Compton:the mid-late '80s.<br/><br/>Getting by selling drugs as a low-level street dealer,Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright is told by friends that he is not living up to his full potential.Gathering up some of the cash that he has made from dealing,Eazy-E gets friends Andre Young, O'Shea Jackson, Antoine Carraby and Lorenzo Jerald Patterson to form a Hip-Hop group called NWA, and to start recording an ep.Going to collect the latest pressings,Eazy-E runs into music manager Jerry Heller,who tells Eazy-E that he can help open doors to the music business for the group.<br/><br/>Accepting Heller's offer,Eazy-E and the rest of the NWA soon sign up to record label,and begin to record their debut album.AS they near the completion of the album,the group are slammed to the ground outside the studio by cops who want to show these ""street thugs"" who is in charge. Furious by the harassment that they and others in the African American have received from the police,NWA decide to do a track which will allow everyone's anger towards the police to be heard loud and clear. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Taking 2 years to prepare for the role,and having to consume 1200 calories a day and lose 15 lbs whilst filming, O'Shea Jackson Jr gives an extraordinary debut performance as his dad Ice Cube (with the scenes of his dad having sex with groupies probably not being the most comfortable scenes he has ever filmed!)Keeping away from a mere imitation,Jackson's gruff voice attacks every aggressive lyric with a charismatic fury,as Jackson balances Ice Cube's raging songs with a quiet calmness,which captures the friendship that the group feel for each other. <br/><br/>Lingering in the background during the formation of NWA, Corey Hawkins gives a wonderful performance as Dre,with Hawkins always keeping Dre with one eye on the music industry as everyone around him dives into the rap lifestyle.Placed as the heart & soul of the film, Jason Mitchell gives an excellent performance as Eazy-E,who Mitchell reveals to have a real humbleness over staying close to his roots,which leads to Eazy-E never being comfortable over stepping onto the worlds stage.<br/><br/>Opening up the run-down Compton landscape,director F. Gary Gray and cinematographer Matthew Libatique unleash an intense, burning-hot atmosphere,by soaking Compton orange and yellow water colours,which flair up when the police cross one line too many.Pushing the viewer right into the middle of the crowd,Gray and Libatique set the film alight with elegant wide tracking shots for the incredible gig footage,with Gray and Libatique cleverly bringing the camera down to earth in tightly-held coiled shots which brim with the mix of fear and excitement that the crowd feel,as they prepare to witness the strength of street knowledge."

","Phenomenal historical film on the birth of rap, its main characters, and the awful police abuse on black people that inspired the movement. It is a must watch for those interested in popular culture in the US towards the end of the 20th century. I assume that people who give this excellent film poor reviews are a resentful of talented black artists. The scenes of police abuse are tough to watch, but they reflect the realities of our country so they are an important historical element. The acting is excellent and the characterizations are amazingly close to the real people. The only part that seems strange is that when Eazy is diagnosed with HIV in 1995, he was not offered the medications that were available then and that would have saved his life. All in all, highly recommended film."

These things compel me to comment.<br/><br/>The haters of this movie need to get over the facts. This movie is not a documentary. Entertainment writers write to entertain. They are not required to pigeonhole the fact into a boring account of details. They make movies exciting by adding conflict at each and every turn. They write in extremes in order to entertain.

","8.5/10<br/><br/>I have been eager to see ""Straight Outta Compton"" since I first saw the trailers back in August. Despite having no knowledge on the subject of rap, hip-hop, or NWA, this movie attracted me, partially for the music, but even more so for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of life in real-life places like Compton, Los Angeles. The world that Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and the rest of the members of NWA grew up in is as foreign to me as one from a sci-fi or fantasy movie. The difference? This sh*t is real.<br/><br/>My first praise for this movie has to go to the actors. Everyone in this movie does a remarkable job of bringing the story to life, and their passion and dedication really shows through. There were times I found that I had to remind myself that this was a movie, that's how good they were.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself: this is a beautiful story, and you don't have to love rap to appreciate or enjoy it (though I imagine it certainly helps). I often find rap music too crass and abrasive, and there are a lot of times that it is. However, this ""reality rap"" that NWA brought to the stage is something else. One of my favorite lines of the movie comes from Ice Cube (played by the REAL Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr.) when, during a press conference, he says ""Our art is a reflection of our reality."" This message is pertinent throughout the entire movie. Growing up in Compton has given these young men a very different world view, and while to most of America the song ""F*** the Police"" may seem disrespectful and ungrateful, seeing the way these men were targeted, attacked, and harassed by the police shows where that anger came from, and even it's justification.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is both history and current events. While I would like to say that things are better now, there is no doubt that issues displayed in the movie are still present today. Police brutality/harassment, unnecessary force, racial profiling--we see these issues in the news far too often. And I would surprised if someone told me that the conditions in Compton have dramatically improved since the 80s. These are real struggles that people today are facing, and so the relevance of this film is undeniable.<br/><br/>This is a film about music, passion, dedication, ambition, overcoming adversity, injustice in the justice system, racial profiling, and life in dangerous areas. It is powerful and all too relevant."

","Even if you had no idea who NWA is (or what those initials stand for, be careful, you might be offended by it!), you will after watching this. What you won't get much out of this, is how some things came to be. This is not getting too much into the mindset or the making off (producing) songs or writing lyrics. You'll get the end results - and there is one song in particular, that is high on the ""diss-scale"" and as funny as it could be (especially considering the history).<br/><br/>But this is a movie and it's more interested in showing you were characters are coming from and where they go/went. Performances are great and unfortunately 2015 showed us, that some of the things that were happening back then are still relevant (and are still happening). If 22 Jump Street (and Queen Latifahs reply to where she's from), was your first contact - then be prepared to be amazed.<br/><br/>There is a lot of evil stuff happening and there is a lot of bad characters or at least bad choices. Some things never get fully explained or fleshed out, but there wouldn't be enough time for that. As it is (and having watched the extended Version already), this is a good if packed music Bio, with some very good music in it! Some things are surely comprised, I can't imagine everything happen exactly as shown, but the ""jist"" of it is surely right. So most ""issues"" the movie might have, are in it's time constraints ... but it does make the best of it!"

","I will admit fully up front my total, absolute, 100% ignorance about the events, the people, the context and the music portrayed in this film. It just isn't something that I ever heard or grew up on, living in Italy. Nevetheless I was actually looking forward to checking this out and understanding what this whole story was all about. Even though I cannot comment about the way the facts are portrayed I can call this a well crafted movie.<br/><br/>F Gary Gray does a very good job in making you part of this world, making you understand how things work and ultimately he simply tells an interesting true story and does it justice, taking out of it themes that everyone can relate to and showing a reality with complex dynamics which offer a great cue of thought and discussion. Even though the events in the film may be unfamiliar to the viewer he presents them with confidence and knowledge and makes them familiar and easily understandable. There is lots of commentary on society and discrimination, much of it comes to fruition even though I might add that I never had a full three dimensional dynamic of it.<br/><br/>All in all what really makes the film succeed is the fact that it has interesting characters in an interesting true story which is never shoved down your throat, you are treated respectfully, the story is told with passion. You won't get bored, you board the ride and you are taken through a satisfying, reflective and interesting journey which makes you come out with the feeling you just saw a good movie with some killer music that pumped all the more goodness in the film.<br/><br/>I just unfortunately can't get too excited about this. Firstly because from a filmaking point of view there isn't anything outstanding or flattering, there aren't stand out performances, or intense, breathless scenes. But that is OK, the movie is still very good. The main point is the fact that a little too many of its emotional beats and story beats require you to be familiar with the events to get emotional or excited. It doesn't explore its themes as much as it explores its story and that is way I was never fully engaged by it, other than the fact that it is a tad to long.<br/><br/>I will repeat the fact that my ignorance in the subject doesn't make me a valid judge for the film which is a good, sometimes very good biopic/muscipic, but I think that a slight edge more of attention to the themes and the issues it raises could have elevated the film a lot."

This film had powerful messages in it that a smart viewer of this of this type of film would take heed to. Like most biographical films this one wasn't 100% perfect. Being that I'm a huge Hip Hop fan (Anything Hip Hop from 2000 and back) I know of some things that should have and shouldn't have been put in this film. Other than that, the basic premise of this film was correct. This film should get an Oscar nomination simply because of the impact it had at the box office and for the musical history it put out. The acting in this film was OK but the likeness and mannerisms of what O'Shea Jackson Jr. portrayed in the film as his father, Ice Cube, was on point! He looked exactly like his father and I don't know if this would be a spoiler, but in one scene the actor who played Tupac was in the booth recording a song, with the dim lights and the bandanna on his head you would have almost thought that it really was Tupac. To me the resemblance these two actors had towards the characters they played and also the almost close resemblance Jason Mitchell had to Easy E and Neil Brown Jr. had to DJ Yella played an important roll in this film.

","The movie was great. It has only been showing for three days and has already pulled over sixty million dollars. I identified with the plot from the beginning when the late rapper Eric White; also known as Eazy-E found himself in a situation that I once found myself in as a kid. The movie brought back so many memories of my youth, I felt as though someone had pushed my replay button. My emotions ran wild as each exciting scene was played out. There was a steady fast pace that kept my adrenaline flowing. There were several morals to the story concerning money, friendship, and unprotected sex.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton,"" is a story of five young men that started a rap group in the 1980s. The name of the group was, ""N.W.A..."" Eazy-E is the star of the show and the owner of the company/rap group. The actors are the sons of the original N.W.A. Rap Group. The actors seemed to have a knack for the screen; they seemed to naturally play their parts. I felt the story was a tribute to Eazy-E.<br/><br/>A few scenes probably will stay with me for some time; Producer Suge Knight made a mockery of a man. The man obviously wasn't from the west coast. Suge made the man repeat after him, ""the west coast is the best coast."" It went something along those lines. I can't remember the exact words but I do remember getting extremely upset because it seemed obvious the man was from the east coast. There were several subliminal pot shots taken at the east coast that got me a little emotional. Weather the subliminal pot shots taken at the east coast was a figment of my vivid imagination or not those scenes were emotionally moving; and for that I'm giving the movie another star.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) This movie sparked some controversy concerning the police brutally scenes. Some theaters are reluctant to show the movie because the police brutality scenes may insight violence. Of course, the brutality scenes are of police assaulting young black men. I do understand the concern about violence in the movie theaters because there has been several shooting in movie theaters. I also agree with, Rapper Ice Cube, ""there has never been a black perpetrator."" Showing the brutality on screen can't make the situation any worse. America knows what's going on, besides we'll more than likely see it again on the news by next month. I was more upset about the east coast subliminal messages than the police brutality because police brutalizing young black men has sadly become the norm. Theaters and movie goers don't have much to worry about.<br/><br/>I recommend you go see this ten star movie. Do not buy the bootleg copy. It is obvious the team that made the movie worked hard for their money. I'm promoting these guys because they did a hell of a job. Let's give them their props! <br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/Never-Give-Up-Erik-Smalls-ebook/dp/B00H95FTLO"

","Five young men - Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E and DJ Yella - walking towards us, lined up in a row coming into the picture frame like modern-day gunslingers - full of swagger and the defiant air of adolescents that have grown up and experienced the brutality that comes with being black living in one of the poorest and most dangerous communities in 1980's America - the city of Compton, CA., south of downtown Los Angeles; these are the members of the pioneering ""gangsta rap"" and West Coast hip hop group N.W. A. (an abbreviation of Niggaz wit' Attitude) whose ""rags-to-riches"" story is told in the biopic STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON directed by F. Gary Gray. <br/><br/>A group of locals, some of whom had been friends since childhood band together to express the rage they feel at society's inequities; to bring to attention the destructive nature of racism practiced by the authorities in their neighborhoods; police who were the supposed ""enforcers"" of justice interacting with urban black men treating them like enemies with no regard for their civil rights. N. W.A. fought back with raw screaming authenticity - lyrics that told their stories, attacking with the rat-a-tat of drum-machine beats and rhythms - words sprayed out with the ferociousness of thundering cannons - gesticulating and shocking their audiences with facts that were harshly bitter, crude. and all too real. N.W. A. became heroes to an expanding audience - their voices had been unleashed - fighting back not with guns and flying bullets, but with music that had the power to slice souls. <br/><br/>I listened spellbound to N.W.A.'s sounds, inhaling their cries of intense fury, but at the same time cringing at the vitriolic lyrics aimed at women who were often referred to as ""ho's and bitches"" - buried in the same slimy abuse and disrespect, that the power structures so disdainfully thrust on them. The glamorized characterization of the relationship between the ""perks"" of fame - adulation, material acquisitiveness and indiscriminate sexual abandon - are depicted as becoming the roots of a Greek tragedy - hubris leads to nemesis.<br/><br/>The film follows the group's path to worldwide fame including the oft seen sleazy ups and downs of the managerial side of the performing business; the collaboration of the entrepreneurial Eazy - E (a terrific performance by Jason Mitchell) with a scheming white businessman Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) to form a production company called Ruthless Records. Once recruited into N.W.A., Dr. Dre (a fine Corey Hawkins) is portrayed as the anchor of the group handling the music, and Ice Cube (played by his son O'Shea Jackson, Jr. with an uncanny resemblance to his father) is the lyricist along with MC Ren, pen and notebook in hand constantly jotting down phrases for future use. All five members were uncompromising, never giving into pressure from institutions, (including the FBI), the press and other external forces to tone down their rhetoric, many of whom were shocked by the unrelenting capacity of street vernacular to propel the public into social awareness.<br/><br/>STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON also presents the personal battles and clashing egos among the rappers, with some quitting over ""royalty"" issues going off on their own, but over time we witness their strong ""familial"" bond which is unbreakable.The movie was not filmed in a vacuum - the turbulent history of the late '80's and early '90's is woven into the plot including the 1991 police battering of Rodney King, videotaped and seen on television by the whole country, and the subsequent acquittal of the four accused police officers in 1992 sparking riots in Los Angeles - clearly foreshadowing uprisings 22 years later, where a police culture is still too ready to shoot and destroy what they perceive as ""threatening"" men and women of color."

","Straight Outta Compton is a 2015 American biographical drama film that chronicles the rise and fall of the Compton, California hip hop music group N.W.A. The film borrows its title from the name of their debut studio album and its title track. Straight Outta Compton was directed by F. Gary Gray (Director of Friday and The Italian Job) The cast includes O'Shea Jackson, Jr. as Ice Cube, Corey Hawkins (Non-Stop, upcoming 24 television series) as Dr. Dre, Jason Mitchell (Keanu, Kong: Skull Island) as Eazy-E and Paul Giamatti (12 Years a Slave, Cinderella Man) as N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller. Among the film's producers are Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, with MC Ren and DJ Yella as creative consultants. The film was released on August 14, 2015, and received positive reviews from fans, critics, and is about to receive a positive review from me. <br/><br/>This is actually the same director who was supposed to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but he left that project to tell this story and I'm glad he did. I mean when you pass up Marvel money to do another film, you better be passionate about that project. I believe this is a story that should be told. It may make some people feel a little uncomfortable with the topic, language, sexism, and violence. However, this film is about art, history, reality, freedom of speech, and simply survival. If this is a difficult topic for you, don't go in judgmental (or don't see it if it upsets you). I would at least give it a chance. Even if you are not a fan of this genre of music, the story alone is worth investing yourself into, and it's entertaining. The viewer can learn about goals, music, history, fame, money issues, business, dreams, and more in this one film. <br/><br/>The strongest part of this film is the cast. These guys were like the Justice league of gangster rap music. O'Shea Jackson did an exceptional job playing his father Ice Cube. He really is a copy and paste of Ice Cube. Almost everyone in this film is so well rounded with character development and depth. You see the good and bad side of everyone. The entire cast does extremely well, especially Jason Mitchell portraying Eazy-E. <br/><br/>I do believe the first half of the film is the best. It's the origin story, the N.W.A. assembles! Then it becomes the typical biography drama film. It feels a little rushed at the end, and like they had to wrap everything up quickly. Such as Eazy-E getting sick, I think they could have built that up a little bit more, make it more sympathetic and have him be the emotional centerpiece. Also, the actor who plays Suge Knight is straight up horrifying. He could really play a super villain. He wore a red suit looking like the Devil, flared nostrils, heavy breathing, big bold eyes, muscular. Even the real Suge Knight even ran somebody over with a vehicle, so he practically is a crazy super villain. If I were casting director, I'd hire him to play The Kingpin in Marvel, and he couldn't even have to act, just be himself. The actor playing Snoop Dogg, was a little off in my opinion. He really didn't look like Snoop Dogg, and came off like a guy trying to do a Snoop Dogg impression. But Snoop really is just a cameo.<br/><br/>So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Straight Outta Compton. I really like this movie, even though it is a lengthy film I wanted more. Even if you are not a fan of this type of music, I think you can still find some entertainment value in it. I like the cast, directing, acting, music from Dr. Dre's The Chronic and 2001 albums, reminded me how good and real rap music use to be, etc. I would love to see more bio pics on musicians and music groups. I always thought Brad Pitt could play Kurt Cobain. Maybe a Rancid movie, Tupac, Michael Jackson biopic next? I would fight it. I believe Straight Outta Compton gets a straight up...<br/><br/>9/10!<br/><br/>This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie you real Muthaf#ckin' G's as Eazy-E would put it. Thank you for reading/viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always. :)"
"jboothmillard","8","4","25","7 July 2016"," Straight Outta Compton
","When I first heard about this film I didn't know whether it was a documentary or a biopic, so I was really looking forward to seeing it when I found out, produced by N.W.A. members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, directed by F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator, The Italian Job, Law Abiding Citizen). Basically in Compton, California in 1986, drug dealer Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) evades police raids at a crack house, Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins) lives with his mother and has no idea what to do with his life, and high school senior O'Shea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson (O'Shea Jackson Jr., playing his own father) lives a middle-class lifestyle, but in a neighbourhood full of crime and police harassment. Sometime later, these three are bought together in a club, where they meet Eazy's fellow Kelly Park Compton Crips member Lorenzo ""MC Ren"" Patterson (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Antoine ""DJ Yella"" Carraby (Neil Brown Jr.), they connect through their love of rap and hip hop music, they decide to form a group. Music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) approaches Eazy, who accepts his offer to manage the group, named N.W.A. (N****z Wit Attitude), they also meet with producer Bryan Turner (Tate Ellington) and sign up with Priority Records, and they commence writing and recording songs, with Tracy ""The D.O.C."" Curry (Marlon Yates Jr.), including ""Express Yourself"" and ""Gangsta Gangsta"" for their debut album Straight Outta Compton. The album makes a big impact and brings great success for N.W.A., they go on a national tour in 1989, but their record ""F*** tha Police"" has caused controversy, with the FBI demanding they stop performing it, declaring it encourages violence against law enforcement, but they refuse, resulting in riots and the group being arrested. Dre is devastated by the news that his brother Tyree (Keith Powers) is killed in a street fight, Cube leaves the group after finding out Eazy is making more money than the rest of them, he goes solo and becomes very successful, the rest of N.W.A. release EP 100 Miles and Runnin', in a song they diss Cube, in turn Cube disses them in a song. Following the release of N.W.A.'s second album, Niggaz4Life, The D.O.C. has a near fatal car crash, Dre realises Heller is taking advantage of him, leaves the group and forms Death Row Records with Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), Eazy is physically assaulted by Knight when he refuses an offer, Dre releases his solo debut album, The Chronic, and he begins producing records for other rappers, including Calvin Broadus aka Snoop Doggy Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and Tupac Shakur (Marcc Rose). Following the 1992 trial for the police beating unarmed motorist Rodney King, N.W.A. has disbanded, Eazy and his girlfriend discover Heller was embezzling money from the group, Eazy fire him, in 1994 Eazy rekindles his friendship with Cube, and calls Dre to revive N.W.A. In 1995, Eazy, Ren and Yella work on new material, but during a session Eazy is taken to hospital after collapsing from a seizure, where he is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, after the group making emotional visits, Eazy-E dies aged 30 on 26th March 1995, a year later Dre leaves Death Row Records to start his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. Cube still makes records and has become a successful actor, in films such as Boyz n the Hood, Friday and Ride Along, Dre still produces many great rappers including Kendrick Lamar, Eminem and 50 Cent, and Beats Electronics which he founded was bought by Apple for $3 billion, the largest deal in Apple's history. Also starring Alexandra Shipp as Kim, Rogelio Douglas Jr. as Chuck D and Sheldon A. Smith as Warren G. The performances are all great, and the soundtrack is brilliant, N.W.A. brought the everyday struggles of black youth in Los Angeles to international audiences, making controversy and acclaim in equal measure, it is interesting to see what would probably play out as a cheesy rags-to-riches story in the style of an action movie, complete with sex, drugs and violence, this is a highly recommendable biographical music and crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Very good!"

"vesil_vesalier","10","1","3","7 February 2019"," The story of how a storm gathers, strikes, and changes everything forever.
","It is an interesting and perhaps altogether mortifying thing to note that human progress, by and large, takes an awful lot of time. While our technological prowess grows exponentially by the day, threatening to overwhelm us and outrun us as we give it its own consciousness, we fail to understand that it is the very nature of the computer mind to NOT continue to make the same mistakes, over and over again, in pointless, deadly cycles. While that is very much the case for HUMAN minds.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a much better case for said behavior than I did in F. Gary Gray's majesty of a movie, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Even though there aren't any Terminators in it, nor are there any real technological threats to be seen. No, the threats noted here are the same, old, TIRED ones.<br/><br/>Inequality. Oppression. Indignity. Ignorance.<br/><br/>STUPIDITY.<br/><br/>You have to admire racism for its stubbornness. It's not enough that people hate each other based on skin color and culture, you have to remember that the people that HAVE the skin color and culture you hate were brought to America against their will. They didn't ask to be here. And you're nothing more than a damned fool to simply say, ""Well then get the hell out"", after ancestors and generations of idiots enslaved, raped, tortured, and murdered them simply to profit from their labor and rise into strong, almost morally bankrupt country as a result. There's a stereotype that's been created here, for African Americans, and this is a movie that's not shy about illustrating that.<br/><br/>It doesn't CHAMPION that, it ILLUSTRATES that. There's no judgment here, and that's one of this film's strongest points.<br/><br/>When five young men in Compton decide, eventually, to join together to create a new, completely original music genre based on what they have to go through in the America of the late eighties and early nineties, at the resistance of almost everyone who thinks playing it safe is always the best way to go, they create something truly original. Great art comes from great suffering, and these men suffer regularly at the hands of a society that treats them poorly based on appearance more often than actual behavior, illustrated not only by scene but by historical reference throughout the film. What comes out of their mouths and out of their speakers is an outcry of anger, defiance, and resistance, and it is POWERFUL. Great art is also the subject of great change, and that is what these men have started here, with their bravery and talent.<br/><br/>I think O'Shea Jackson Jr. (who plays Ice Cube and is, ironically, his son) and Corey Hawkins (who masterfully plays Dr. Dre) steal nearly every scene they are in. They are the brains of the bunch, the smartest and the most talented of the group, and you can see it and feel it in every scene. This is not to say that Jason Mitchell (who plays a touching, charming and moving Eazy-E), Neil Brown Jr. (who plays DJ Yella) and Aldis Hodge (who plays MC Ren) do not have their strengths, because they do. NOBODY in this production has a small role, from the extras in the backgrounds without names to the women that support our five stars as they battle their way to the front. Everyone is rich, the atmosphere is vibrant and alive, the soundtrack is perfectly placed and implemented, even the shots of city-scapes are those of beauty.<br/><br/>I've left out Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, the man responsible for managing the up-and-coming N.W.A. Without giving away too much of the movie, I will say he delivers as he always does, being the perfect middle-man antagonist, that starts out seemingly innocent as he slowly grows into something more sinister.<br/><br/>And finally we come to the message, which is this: Nothing is as simple as it seems. Nobody can be ascertained simply by appearance. Things just don't suddenly go wrong. Change does NOT happen overnight. And the biggest, most powerful message of all, the one that nobody learns, even though it's been repeated over and over again as we continue down this merry path to ever more creative means of self-destruction:<br/><br/>You can't keep punching people in the face without expecting them to fight back. You can't continue to try to use fear to hold everybody down while you walk away the victorious tyrant. Those that dared to hold these guys down will be forgotten, while the words they said and the music they made will last long after everyone involved in this era of Americana become food for worms.<br/><br/>STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is the kind of truth we need right now. And I absolutely loved it."
"nikeno71","9","1","3","24 August 2018"," Closed Minded people just won't get it.
","When you read the reviews on here, it's literally them complaining about the language, the message they were saying, it lacking and just hatred with rap music. Not stirring the political pot, right wings can have their voice but the left can't which is ridiculous. 1. The film depicts the reality of life on the streets so language is going to be strong (it is R rated), if that's a problem don't watch the movie. 2. They exercised their first amendment rights by speaking the truth about what's going on in areas that people don't frequent so it'll be a shock when viewing something that is new to you. 3. Too many people hate rap music for language, what they rap about, etc. Rap isn't for everyone but for those who can use it and channel their anger and express themselves, it gives way for some raw lyrics and great beats. But you can't go too hard or they'll get mad for speaking your mind in song. No one ever complains about all that Satanic rock music or rock music speaking about killing yourself and death but you hear the B word in a rap song and it's the end of the world. So in short, stop complaining about music you don't understand, and culture you choose not to associate with. Plenty of people of all color and background embrace rap music and this movie so what's the problem? I went and saw it amongst a mixed crowd and lot of men (white, Black, Hispanic) in their late 40's and early 50's watching it because the impact the group had on them which is powerful. Yes they left some things out, but what biopic is 100 percent accurate? The acting was on point especially O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins. So instead of bashing it because of language or what not, research the group and what the filmmakers captured instead of spewing your hate towards because you're offended. They didn't come together to make friends, they wanted to bring the reality or Hood and urban areas to the mainstream which still rings true today with police brutality and racism at an all time high."
"patriciabatemanyourattorney","10","1","3","19 April 2018"," THE ACCURATE REVIEW
","Dear loyal followers, <br/><br/>Its time for an accurate, real and correct review of this off the scale 11/10 masterpiece. Lets start by analysing the techniques used to bring us this joyous, heartbreaking, emotionally warming and politically correct societal blockbuster hit. The use of actors was rather exciting, especially O'shea Jackson Jr playing the Angel of the lord himself - Ice Cube. Now many of you out there may criticise my beliefs and ideologies of how the genius Cube himself, is portrayed on his past experiences and work but not forgetting his colleagues who have made big success. Being a black man in the 80s was known to be quite traumatic and racist, so to see a group of young black rappers succeed was simply absurd but developed to be iconically phenomenal and game changing for the music industry as a whole. The music can I say made me feel quite peaceful and the classic hit '*UCK THA POLICE' is a song I listen to every morning for my daily meditation but also what I share with my clients to show them whatever you are going through is not that bad and it will be okay in the end. To all the haters out here I have one message 'go suck a duck', I shall change that word by simply replacing with a 'd', because most of you have 7pm bed curfews, and can not restrain from powerful language. This movie was beautifully crafted to reveal the true struggles of ethnic minorities. I will tell y'all a little secret, me and Ice go back a long way we have had our arguments over creative talent - ice always wins, which I think is fairly evident in this review of our lives. Now I have his digits on my cell, I won't hesitate to give him a call and arrange a little meet up with all you dictators. Cause Patricia B is crazy! <br/><br/>Kind disregards <br/><br/>Her Majesty Patricia Bateman Vanilla the 8th<br/><br/>I gotta say it was a good day. <br/><br/>P.s me and homeboy remember writing this back in 92' Peazy P out<br/><br/>Its very hypocritical for this post to be declined multiple times due to other reviews being considered racist and patronising!"

After Dre's baby mama drove off the rest of nwa came out and asked what he did wrong and about 3 cop cars came from around the corner and harassed the group when everything was said and done cube comes up to Dre and thats how fuk da police came about. but thats not how the real story went"

","I would have given this film a better rating if the Dre/Dee Barnes incident had been included. Maybe a 6 for authenticity or something. I've been in South Central at midnight--and places in L.A. just as dangerous. So I've brushed shoulders with those who have been marginalized and have not looked to Jesus for their salvation but to drugs, sex, and money/power--all of which fail every one of us in the end. Anyway, this film should be Rated X even if for the one scene alone that shows actual cunnilingus and very possibly coitus, though the latter could have been simulated. But the Dee Barnes attack by Dr. Dre was never mentioned, and this is wrong. It should have been. It's an important part of the picture. Without it, the NWA crew are mostly made out to be good guys battling White America. But as rapper Sevin of HOGMOB so adroitly puts it, ""It's not a skin issue, it's a sin issue."""
"davideo-2","7","4","29","28 March 2016"," In depth, lengthy, but lacking a solid narrative structure to hold it together
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the late 80s, a group of young black men, including Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Junior, in his debut role), Dr Dre (Corey Hawkins), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Junior) emerge from the streets of Compton, South Central Los Angeles, to form the NWA, a hard core rap band who, in sharp contrast to the laid back, affable lyrics of time gone by, blast out sharp rhymes about police harassment/brutality, gang killings and drug slinging that get right in everyone's face, and even gain attention from the FBI. The content of their songs sees them struggle to get airplay, but Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a mainstream record producer, sees their potential and signs them up. But over the course of time, internal conflicts and different ambitions see the group dissipate and veer off in their different, destructive directions.<br/><br/>Hip hop culture certainly dominates the charts today, with its influence even present in other genres of music that are doing the rounds. Straight Outta Compton attempts to probe the origins of a group that subverted the genre, and used it as a platform to vent their anger and frustration at the issues that blighted their lives in the black community at the time, in a manner that some artists over time took out of context and warped into the gangsta rap genre. Director F Gary Grey has certainly compiled a thorough, in depth study of the group's life, which by the end has left you more drained than informed.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of story to tell, but somehow lacks the solid narrative structure to make everything have the maximum effect. For a film with such a length, this is a pretty big problem, and despite containing enough various, often veering, human drama to engage, at numerous points throughout, you're just left wondering when the ending will roll around, probably a natural reaction to not having the most structured story to follow. When it does roll by, you're left feeling completely depleted.<br/><br/>The young cast certainly prove realistic incarnations of the group, whilst as the most recognizable member of the cast, Giamatti turns in a surprisingly impassioned performance as the manager who believes in them, then comes to be regarded as sneaky and manipulative. The recreation and performances are all check, but it maybe needed some miles clocked off, and a better idea of where it's going. ***"
"joeravioli","6","4","29","8 September 2015"," A riveting ""rags-to-riches"" story that turns flat out decadent
","If you don't really think about it, Straight Outta Compton, this year's anti-action blockbuster, is the sort of movie that will completely blow you away. Its crisp direction, engaging performances, and snappy tracks seamlessly work together to pull the audience in, whether fans of N.W.A. or simply the casual viewer. This film knows how to grab and hold the audience's attention, inserting humour, drama, violence, and even undiluted emotion at such a perfect pace that makes it almost impossible to think about the movie at a critical angle, at least within the film's duration. Even the opening scene, which has no purpose other than to illustrate the violent and dangerous lives of the inhabitants of Compton is wildly intense, a pulse-pounding escape scene that I didn't see coming from a mile away. So this, in a nutshell, is what Straight Outta Compton does right: It is unexpectedly riveting, creating solid entertainment out of simple things like dialogue, soundtrack, and excellent visual direction.<br/><br/>However, when you think past the excellent filmmaking, Straight Outta Compton becomes rather childish and decadent, eventually losing its ability to showcase N.W.A.'s drama without resorting to silly, mobster-mentality fuelled scenes and opulent displays of wealth. It ceases to become a film about a group of young men overcoming cultural and racial struggles through music, morphing eventually into a tale about rich people who go around breaking things, beating each other up, engaging in gleeful misogyny, and getting richer. While it presented itself as a very promising ""rags-to-riches"" tale, the ""rags"" ended about a quarter of the way through, replaced by an irredeemable amount of ""riches"". As the film progresses, it loses its authenticity as a character drama.<br/><br/>The acting, however, is fantastic. Every member of N.W.A. has a distinct and charged-up personality. O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father Ice Cube, and it's obvious that the man knows the type of guy his dad was. Not only is his acting done with all the expected fury, his performance is deep, making him more than just a character in a story. The film mostly revolves around Eazy-E, played by Jason Mitchell. Mitchell is relied on for the emotional pinnacle of the film, and he gives it his all in a few heartrending scenes. The actors are amazing talented, but the screenplay makes the characters, and this screenplay sees it fit to make these characters into rich thugs.<br/><br/>The tagline for the poster reads: ""The World's Most Dangerous Group"". If this were to be so, I would assume that the group originally had some sort of ""ruthless"" political ambition. But it's hard to see that in the film. In fact, the underlying purpose of their musical ambition is kept ambiguous, never amounting to anything more than money, guns, and women. The political venom reflected in their songs never extends to their behaviour. They are unjustly treated, but by the way they carry themselves, it doesn't seem like they care. For a group called N.W.A. (and I'm assuming that the meaning of the acronym is universally known), they have surprisingly little attitude.<br/><br/>Although the film may be strangled by its decadence in its later stage, it has its best and most memorable moments on the streets of Compton. The director is attached to the place, and depicts it not only as a cruel place, but as a reluctant sanctuary. Gray paints a vulgar, yet beautiful canvas on these dangerous streets where life is rough, tensions run high, and dreams are no more than dreams."

","I think the sins of the various police departments across the nation are getting pretty well documented. That said, I have rarely seen a more thuggish, criminal and misogynistic portrayal of rap culture. Women have NO role in NWA beyond being sex toys. Dr Dre is portrayed as the good guy in all the chaos of cheating managers and out of control band members. That white hat portrayal is spoiled, however, by his motivations for cutting ties with the criminal elements around him. His motivation was that they were stealing from him, not that they were criminals. Had they not stolen from him, he was happy as a clam to be surrounded by criminals and thugs. But now he's a multi-billionaire ""legit"" Apple employee...wink, wink."
"dal_asher","8","4","30","20 December 2015"," Excellent History of Rap Music
","My husband and I watched this last night on DVD and although we aren't fans of rap music, we both found this movie an excellent history of the genre. It tells the story of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Easy-E, MC Ren and D.J. Yella, all well played by Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown, Jr., and Aldis Hodge respectively. The story begins when Dr. Dre leaves the home of his mother as she wants him to get a regular job to support his girlfriend and newborn son. He is frustrated by his need for self expression and his dream of creating something new that will speak to the young people struggling with unending police harassment and discrimination. He meets up with Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager who offers to manage Dr. Dre and his like minded friends, N.W.A. Dre is the producer and Easy-E and Ice Cube write and rap. They produce their first hit with Straight Outta Compton. As the police continue their harassment of them they express their feelings of anger and frustration through the lyrics and rhymes. This resonates with young people around the country and they are soon stars. The usual problems come up and they move away from each other and Jerry, some making better decisions that the others. Although they part ways, the bond remains a deep one that will eventually bring them back together after a tragedy. <br/><br/>This movie was well acted by all and even though we have never really liked rap, this was truly eye-opening. We understand and appreciate where it began now and can respect the genre in a way we never expected. This movie engaged us throughout and I can recommend it for any one that can get past the language and violence. It was needed for authenticity. Really good movie!"

","I grew up between Spain and Paris, but NWA was too hard to ignore even in a country where we did not fully understand the lyrics of their songs. We used to listen to their music with tapes and copy their dressing style, but with very little taste. As I look back now, I don't think we could have been tackier if we had tried. <br/><br/>About the movieÂ… It's hard to tell how much the director stuck to the real story of what went down in Compton in those years, but either way, I choose to believe it was like we see in the movie. The powerful force of rap music carving a hole into the roots of society at a time when police brutality was questioned more than ever. A group of guys who grew up with nothing and ended up being listened by millions. You can feel the power of their music, their passion and their message. All made for a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. <br/><br/>The story is still on going for some of them. Dr Dre is the one who succeeded the most, no wonder he gets to be the one that gets the last scene. <br/><br/>Watch it! You won't be disappointed."

I think it's insane, how pretentious people act like the movie portrays afro-Americans negatively when this is actually how some of them, from the ghettos, were. They are just trying to show that they are not racist, by writing that ""this is a racist movie"", etc. But in reality, it seems to me that they are hiding their true racism by writing negatively about this movie. I enjoyed the movie, I liked learning about the NWA, and I liked that they didn't portray the rappers as heroes, more like normal human beings. I can't really seem to find the right words for what I'm trying to say, but stop pretending like the movie was racist to hide your racism."

"maxastree","8","4","30","5 October 2015"," Excellent drama, unrealistically violent
","This is a well made drama, with an excellent cast, genuine depth and a powerful ending. Now for the not-so-great part: the makers of the film seem more interested at times in creating a filmic version of N.W.A's sensationalistic, violent music than authentically portraying the lives of the people in the group. That said, the film opened with record setting opening weekend sales, which is really something for a legacy hip hop group, and one that has a pretty selective audience.<br/><br/>For those too young or just too polite to know, N.W.A. sort of ""broke down the boundaries"" for offensive, sexist, hardcore street rap, partly spearheading the Gangsta Rap controversy of the early 90's. What that actually means in terms of studio recordings often boils down to old Funkadelic tracks (Funkentelechy Vs The Placebo Syndrome, anyone?) with expletive laden raps over the top - middle class white kids get off on the danger and power fantasy of gangsta rap etc, while major label record companies made off with millions.<br/><br/>Is it exploitative? Definitely, but also N.W.A. really did come from Compton (or pretty close to, anyway), and the film details their beginnings recording in rough neighbourhoods and playing dive bars to their later career, mentored by a middle aged Jewish-American music industry professional called Jerry Heller, who hid financial details from the group, both promoting them and ripping them off at the same time.<br/><br/>Discriminatory racial profiling, police harassment, and gang activity are all played out in a harsh, realistic style of combining hand- held shots, expert editing and a concise script. The casual sexism, nudity and obnoxiousness of commercial hip hop culture might be a bit tiresome for some; these people are actual adults but behave like overgrown 18 year olds themselves at times.<br/><br/>Two points: the film actually has dramatic power rather than sentiment, eschewing Hollywood gloss for a ""real, in the moment"" feel, but also there's a LOT of scenes in which estranged performers and dodgy record industry types get straight-up punched senseless on camera. It almost seems like the writers have included multiple scenes regarding the groups mismanagement and infighting to push the story forward, but it hardly seems realistic the sheer number of times people get angrily dealt to; even Dre, the most clean cut and work-focused of the group, apparently beats the crap out of people just for partying and making noise while he's recording. I highly doubt stuff this crazy actually happened so frequently, while at the same time the pertinent and very serious issue of wealthy producer and headphone sponsor Dre assaulting three women as a youngster is conveniently removed from history altogether. <br/><br/>Last thoughts: see this movie, its got a great character arc and some powerful themes that fall well outside of the standard rap bio narrative. Rated for nudity and strong language, I guess."

"keving4241","8","4","30","28 September 2015"," An interesting story
","First off I want to point out the negative reviews I've seen, opinions are opinions but honestly if you are not a fan of hip-hop this really isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>I love hip-hop but I wasn't a massive fan of NWA. I knew their music but I preferred KRS-One, Tupac, Biggie and Rakim. Regardless, I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The beginning of the movie has some good humor and you see some important character development. The acting isn't something I'd praise though, however they wanted to cast people who looked as closely to the young NWA crew and in that regard they did very well.<br/><br/>One thing that shocked me was the character Jerry (The NWA manager) and his character development. This isn't a spoiler he's well known to be shady when it comes to money. I was expecting him to be an evil mustache twirling villain but I was wrong. There's a scene where Jerry stood up against police officers that were harassing the young NWA crew outside their studio. He genuinely showed care for them as told the police officers they were a disgrace and they had no right to harass people by the color of their skin. They also showed African-American police officers being prejudice which was something you would see in the LA area at that time. So the movie wasn't anti-white people.<br/><br/>The drama is played up well as you see these characters be put into difficult situations. They covered the NWA song F The Police while later in the movie they show the LA Riots and what anarchy looked like. It wasn't too preachy though, there were scenes that had me laughing a lot. They mixed the emotions up enough to show the good times they had which made their moments of struggle more effective.<br/><br/>It's not a cinematic masterpiece by any means but I feel the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting moments as well. People say negative things regarding the party scenes, but haven't we seen movies with sex in them before? We're adults here right? Lastly, the comments regarding anti-sexism... there was a scene where they treated a woman poorly but it was inside a crackhouse. Later in the movie we see Dr. Dre with a nice respectable young woman who is treated like a proper girlfriend. They are not always degrading women in every scene.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of hip-hop I would recommend it."

"japamo","8","4","30","11 September 2015"," Rap Movie Adds Sobering Dimensions to Standard ""Rise and Fall"" Music Biography
","Country star Alan Jackson (I think) once remarked that the music genre ""rap"" should have a ""C"" in front of it. Besides that, many of us, including myself, have disregarded rap as ear- splitting, cacophonic nonsense. Although I will never become a rap fan, the movie ""Straight Outta Compton"" (hereafter ""Compton"") successfully demonstrated to me that rap is far more intricate, potent, and meaningful than its harsh, raw surface suggests, because a strong core of societal hardship and shrewd sense of injustice often powers it. Furthermore, ""Compton"" dazzlingly reveals that rap can give an intense, hard-to-ignore voice to an entire teenage generation of all races and ethnicities that has been fearfully silent for too long.<br/><br/>""Compton"" chronicles the progress of five African-American friends Eric ""Eazy-E"" (Jason Mitchell), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) as they endure life in Compton, CA's run-down suburbs. There, police tanks demolishing cocaine dens, gang leaders threatening schoolbuses full of kids just for calling out to them, and hostile cops trampling 1st Amendment and civil rights with impunity in their zeal to racially profile and harass groups of kids are just tolerated facts of life. However, instead of resorting to crime or joining/forming a gang, these high school guys decide to combine their DJing, lyric writing, and harmonizing skills to form the rap group N.W.A. (N-word With Attitude). Under N.W.A. these young musicians hope to educate the world about their pain and sufferings, especially in a way the current musical trend, R & B ballads and slow jams championed by dance hall owner Alonzo Williams (Corey Reynolds) just can't do.<br/><br/>N.W.A., led by Eazy-E, seems to touch a nerve with their musical audience as their song ""Boyz-n-the Hood"" becomes a hit. This success attracts the attention of Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) who, sensing a new musical trend, convinces the group to let him be their business and contract manager. Under Jerry's seemingly parental tutelage, N.W.A gets represented by Priority Records and turns out the giant hit album ""Straight Outta Compton"". N.W.A. surges to fame, fortune, and every pleasure money can buy.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, many factors conspire to impede, splinter, or stop the group. Because of obscene, militant, anti-authority lyrics, especially in their searing anthem ""F-k the Police"", N.W.A. runs afoul of not only their old foes the local police, but also even the F.B.I. Due to their negotiating inexperience, N.W.A. trusts Jerry to stand up for them and get them the gigs. But Jerry has a more unscrupulous side. Because Eazy-E trusts him most, Jerry immediately gets contracts signings for him while the rest of the group waits. Jerry is also less than democratic in ensuring that each N.W.A. member gets his cut of the profits while he himself embezzles more than his fair share. Disgusted, Ice Cube leaves N.W.A. to forge a solo rap career. Ice Cube and N.WA. become fierce (and humorous) rivals as they try to out-insult and ""out-diss"" each other in their song outputs. Seeking more artistic freedom, Dr. Dre also leaves N.W.A. and hooks up with rapper Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) to create Death Row Records. While the partnership proves productive (""The Chronic"" album, mentoring up-and- coming rapper Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and Tupac Shakur (Marc Rose)), Knight also proves to be a violent tyrant. Debt, sibling deaths, family strife, car accidents, and the specter of AIDS also hover over N.W.A. Can the group keep it together?<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""Compton"" follows the ""Musical Rags to Riches"" trajectory closely and indulges in some of its excesses (e.g. scantily clad and nude party goers, hotel and studio trashings, marijuana dealings). However, the movie succeeds in not glorifying these wretched excesses and showing that N.W.A really worked strenuously for their success, especially in the scene when Dr. Dre dares to chew out Knight and his hanger-ons for partying too much and not working hard enough. ""Compton"" also details quite well the exploitative realities of the music business through Jerry Heller. Heller may have been a cheating sleaze, but he also convinces us that he cared for N.W.A.'s members and DID help them reach the top. Any other music agent would probably have ripped them off more, and cheated them out of more. ""Compton"" also manages to portray N.W.A. three-dimensionally as people who are certainly not saints and swear a lot and certainly have their vices, but who are fundamentally decent, industrious, and caring of each other. Other posters have said that ""Compton"" has sanitized and softened N.W.A.'s image (e.g. Dr. Dre. was a misogynist in real life), but then again no movie biography, music or otherwise, tells the whole truth. Anyway, ""Compton"" was close- enough-to-life raw enough for me, while vividly and entertainingly proving to me that rap is a legitimate way to ""fight the power"" without sacrificing your soul."

","Being someone that doesn't care at all about the history of this music group, let alone rap and hip-hop itself, Straight Outta Compton was a little hard for me to settle into. At first it reminded me of eighties gangster films, before leaping into some 8 Mile type of film. Purely a personal thing, Straight Outta Compton neither made me enjoy the film, nor convert me to the hip-hop dark side.<br/><br/>Though I respect the film and the hardships the rap group went through, Straight Outta Compton was not a film I really would invest my time into. In a current society where the golden age of hip-hop is emerging, I find myself running behind the bus, or realistically taking a different path.

"matthewssilverhammer","8","4","31","21 August 2015"," Epic and Timely
","Straight Outta Compton is a musical biopic whose story not only supports the subject's songwriting, but deeply informs it. Individual moments drip with power as we see the shock of the supposed post-racial culture on these talented young men. The music itself is a punch to the ribs, with a liveliness that is beyond contagious. So even as SOC suffers the classic biopic problems of losing focus and cohesion, it overcomes its undeniable faults by being piercingly memorable, strongly thematic, and pulsing with dramatic life. The beat of the film captures what happens when justifiably and systemically volatile young men come into positions of immense power. All the while, we are essentially given a nostalgic history lesson in early-90's pop culture. Some of the dialogue and biopic clichés seem to come straight out of parodic Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, but the beautiful direction and fantastic casting skillfully cover over the weak script. Documentary-like at times, the interplay between the near-perfectly cast NWA members is funny and real. Each of the three core members (Easy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube) are so complex I wish we followed each of them individually in overlapping narratives over different films, negating some of its plot-focus issues. Luckily, where the story gets sloppy, the themes stay solid, never resorting to easy answers or morality tropes when trying to understand the complex (and sadly timely) relationship between race and society. Kinetic and vital, SOC is an epic warning about success that could make waves the way its titular album did upon initial release."
"CleveMan66","8","4","31","15 August 2015"," ""Straight Outta Compton"" almost hits the ball outta the park.
","There's a baseball expression that we've probably all heard: ""touch all the bases"". It's a reference to the rule that a player who hits a home run has to run around the entire baseball diamond and make contact with each base for the run to count. Every player comes to home plate wanting to accomplish this feat, but, over the course of the game, relatively few of them reach their goal. In order to be successful at telling its story, a movie has to touch all the bases too. A group of young men wearing baseball caps help ""Straight Outta Compton"" (R, 2:27) do just that although, in this case, an instant replay may be required to verify the accomplishment.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of the pioneering gangsta rap group N.W.A. and its five main members who rose above their circumstances on the mean streets of mid-1980s Compton, California to help create a new sub-genre within hip-hop music. Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) are spinning discs in a local club, while a friend, Ice Cube (Cube's real-life son O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), has been writing rhymes in spiral notebooks. When Dre gives Cube a chance to rap in the club, a couple other guys from their neighborhood, MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and small-time drug dealer Eazy E (Jason Mitchell), are in the club and are impressed with the music. When E bails Dre out of jail after Dre mouths off to a cop, E and Dre start talking about making something out of that music. With Cube and the others joining them, N.W.A. is formed. Cube writes, E raps and Dre produces their first song, ""Boyz-n-da-Hood"" which becomes a hit.<br/><br/>This began a relatively short, but eventful, impactful and timely run for the group. Their first problem was how to gain wider acceptance for a musical art form that few people considered music or art. The answer was a white Jewish record producer named Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti). E starts Ruthless Records with Heller, who becomes the group's manager and gets the guys their first record deal. N.W.A.'s star rises quickly. Maybe too quickly. Egos, greed and petty jealousies divide the group's members and come between them and Heller, all of which threatens all of their careers – and their growing fortunes. These problems become grudges which lead to anger, violence and the kind of tension and drama you might get in, say, game 7 of a Major League Baseball playoff series.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" really does cover all the bases, even if it just skims the tops of some. Along with the rise and fall of N.W.A., we get very good character development of the main players (including a family tragedy for one of the characters, the death of another and Cube's developing career as an actor), and we get to see what happens to these men post-N.W.A. We're also introduced to other rappers who became popular during this period, some of which are still recording today. A few soundbites of mid-80s news clips open the film and very quick video and audio clips, carrying forward the stories of several of the characters, close the movie. In between, we some news events and commentary which give context and significance to the group's music.<br/><br/>The problem is that the depiction of some developments is unbalanced. We see video of Rodney King being beaten by police, but there's no mention of white bystander Reginald Denny being beaten by rioters enraged over the outcome of the officers' trial. In fact, every one of the group's encounters with the LAPD (and police in other cities) is shown as confrontational, and every single police officer portrayed as racist and abusive. Understanding that their mistreatment by police is a major source of the anger that fueled N.W.A.'s music, this completely one-sided portrayal of police is as bad as recent movies ""Merchants of Doubt"" making everyone who questions climate change appear unscrupulous or ""Do You Believe?"" showing every atheist as depressed and immoral.<br/><br/>Then there's the ambiguous characterization of Jerry Heller. He is shown throughout the film helping make the group successful and caring about them as individuals, but a rising distrust of him from some of the group's members culminates with a scene that leaves whether he was in fact good or bad for N.W.A. very unclear. Were all the bases touched? Yes, but it would have helped the film if all were touched with authority.<br/><br/>But even these weaknesses don't negate what this film accomplishes. As a portrait of late 80s and early 90s rappers and the groups and record labels they created, their movement can be seen with a wider lens than in 2009's commendable, but limited ""Notorious"" (about the life and death of rapper Notorious B.I.G.). As a depiction of actual events and the people who made them happen, this movie is even more powerful than impressive and dramatic movies like 1991's ""Boyz n the Hood"" (which is referenced in this film's script). At the end of the day, as it takes a long, hard look at problems black Americans still deal with today, this is one of the most important movies of 2015. ""Straight Outta Compton"" may not have quite hit the ball over the wall in centerfield, but an inside-the-park homerun is still pretty impressive – and gets this entertaining, informative and very relevant film an ""A-""."

"robsta23","9","4","34","26 August 2015"," Two Different Issues at the Heart of an Intriguing Biopic
","The way I see it, Straight Outta Compton has two clear halves of the story of N.W.A. The first half revolves around the struggles the group faced shortly after its inception with racist cops (but in the cops' justification the group looks like a group of gangbangers), and the second half revolves around Ice Cube's fallout from the group due to not trusting the manager played by Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>The opening of this film deals with Eazy-E before he became Eazy-E, and while it seems out of place, starting a movie about a music group, it lets us know how the group came up with the money to get started. We learn Eazy-E is a big drug dealer in a sequence where he is getting scammed out of his money and then must make a run for it when the cops show up shortly afterward (and very conveniently). It is probably the closest the film comes to an ""action"" sequence, and it gives us a sense of the life the group members had in Compton before they came to be a popular rap group. The main thing to take away from the opening is that it is exciting for a biopic.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes of this film is towards the end of the ""first half"" I described in the first paragraph. A seemingly simple sequence which visually describes the band's inspiration behind their popular song ""F*** Tha Police"" paves way for a scene when police officers attempt to stop NWA from performing that song. Of course NWA doesn't listen to them and perform the song in order to give a stance for freedom of speech, and they do so very effectively, motivating their fans to riot against police once shots are fired. It is very satisfying to watch with all the unnecessary police brutality we still see today - the scene is relevant today even if it depicts events from the 90s.<br/><br/>The second half is just as interesting and focuses more on what each character wants independently of the other characters/members of NWA. It all starts when Ice Cube - played by Ice Cube's son - refuses to sign a contract with the Paul Giamatti character since it seems he and Eazy-E are ripping off the rest of the group. Ice Cube definitely has a right to take a stance since he is depicted as the best lyricist of the group, constantly writing lyrics on pads before NWA's rise to fame. Ice Cube even scares the group (at least Giamatti's character) when he produces a track that cleverly tries to put the rest of NWA in their place. Ice Cube's son dominates this half of the film as his father (they look like the same exact person by the way) and I feel he is deserving of an Oscar nomination - my guess is that if he gets a nomination it will be for a supporting role. The only thing I dislike about this second half of the film is that just like in The Social Network the business dispute is not well-explained, and this seems to be because the filmmakers try to dumb it down to just ""contract disagreements"" for the audience. I would prefer more detail, even if I wouldn't fully understand it at first.<br/><br/>You should go see this film not to learn about NWA, but because it is simply a great film which just happens to be grounded in a story about NWA.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"

Riots at gigs, groupies, misogyny, smashing up hotels, orgies, parties, you name it, they lived it. <br/><br/>Like many ground breaking acts before them, they were clearly living the rock n roll dream. Call it calculating marketing, they knew what they were doing, both musically and socially. If you wanted to sell lots of records, pi** off the parents, the kids will love it. We can go all the way back to Little Richard and the origins of rock n roll to find this out.<br/><br/>Its a good film, forget about how accurate or inaccurate it is. Problem I have is with all the idiots on here giving it bad reviews for the language and treatment of woman and the way the police treated them. Get real, what world are you living in? It happened, it still happens. If it was a film about about The Rolling Stones, The Who or even Elvis it would be OK, they would probably say, that was so rock n roll. <br/><br/>Its a good film, even if you're not into rap. The performances are excellent, the soundtrack is superb. If you are easily offended, then go watch a block buster with explosions and rap yourself in cotton wool, just in case it gets a bit risqué."

","The film is a masterpiece. Unlike what everyone would expect from a film bearing such a name about such an iconic Hip-Hop group of pioneers, Straight Outta Compton encapsulated both a strong emotional storyline and the raw gritty movement of street knowledge at that time. There are some scenes that certain viewers may find a little ""too far"" but both the director's (F. Gary Gray) talent and Jason Mitchell's (Eazy E) gift to add humour to the film really eased off what could have been a bit too hard to hear/watch. The music in the film is good and mixed in well. My initial fear was that the film may come across as a musical but in fact, this well written biopic entertains the masses. Hard core N.W.A fans will straight away pick up that some parts of the ""beef"" Dr. Dre had with Eazy E was written out of the film. Well, I guess if this was added in, the atmosphere of the film would have drastically change and make characters into villains. Overall, the film was well written and all the actors and director performed well."

","In the mid-1980s, the streets of Compton, California, were some of the most dangerous in the country. <br/><br/>When five young men translated their experiences growing up into brutally honest music that rebelled against abusive authority, they gave an explosive voice to a silenced generation.......<br/><br/>Being too young to understand the fundamental message that N.W.A. had to say on their debut, I was ignorant to their struggles with the police and other peers. Even in the early nineties, when The Chronic, Lethal Injection, and The Predator were realised, I was fifteen, still ignorant to what the artists were saying, but played it anyway because the amount of profanity used to vex the living daylights out of my mother.<br/><br/>But for some reason, I have always understood the message Singleton gave us with Boyz N Da Hood.<br/><br/>The film is an absolute triumph, not pulling any punches when it comes to dealing with the more touchier aspects of the film, so I'm sure there were a few old wounds re-opened for some of the legends when this was being made.<br/><br/>The cast are phenomenal, as are the Jerri-curl,wigs, and Jackson is the most perfect person to play his dad.

This is a great movie about KIDS following a dream in spite of the BS that is in the way. Well acted, I finally understood the lyrics thanks to sub-titles, and the grooves were infectious. As an ACP toting, anti-Obamite, white, conservative-Republican, Rush listener, I have always thought the racist card was over played but after reading all this negativity I just may be naive.

"Turfseer","7","3","26","4 June 2016"," Cogent chronicle of rise and fall of early Gangsta Rap group despite overtones of hagiography
","Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise and fall of the seminal hip-hop group, N.W.A., who broke on the scene in the mid-80s. N.W.A. was one of the first hip-hop groups to employ ""gangsta rap,"" a heavily street-infused parlance marked by blunt verbal jabs, often incorporating phrases considered ""obscene"" in more ""polite,"" white society.<br/><br/>The purveyors of hip-hop (i.e. of the gangster variety) have been criticized for encouraging violence, as often the lyrics involve one threat or another to an intended rival (whether that be a specific individual or a more generic group). Defenders of the genre maintain that ""gangsta rap"" merely reflects the realities of the street and should be considered ""artistic expression"" protected by the First Amendment. The reality is that this type of music is nothing more than braggadocio and is very much akin to a violent video game—it is of course up to the ""player"" or ""listener"" to recognize that the fictional content of a gangsta rap song or violent video game is exactly that— fiction—and is not necessarily intended to encourage violence in real life.<br/><br/>The story of N.W.A., particularly in its first half, pulls you in just like any good police procedural. There are the three principals, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, who come from completely different walks of life, and you want to know just how this diverse crew end up becoming successful in the music business. The first scene is startling as Easy escapes a police raid on a crack house. Dre is determined to follow his dreams despite the fact that his mother feels that he's not being practical by pursuing a career in music. And Ice Cube, a high school student with a notebook of clever lyrics, almost becomes the victim of gang-banger violence, when a thug boards his school bus, pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot some of the students on board.<br/><br/>When a more ""professional"" group of rappers decline to become involved in the new start-up, Dre convinces Eazy to perform a potential hit song himself. The song, Boyz-n-the-Hood, becomes a big hit, which attracts the attention of Jerry Heller (played adroitly by the ubiquitous Paul Giamatti), who gets the group a contract with Priority Records.<br/><br/>Police harassment is a constant theme in Straight Outta Compton, and when group members are harassed by members of the LAPD outside their recording studio, this inspires Cube to write and record another big hit, ""F—k the Police."" While members of the band and Heller despise the negative and overly aggressive stance the police take toward the black community, there is never a suggestion that there are any good apples at all in the police department. What's more, given the fact that police officers face ultimate annihilation by real criminals in places like Compton every day, it's understandable that many of them are on edge. The lack of professionalism and over aggressiveness can be justly criticized by rappers like Ice Cube, but there are always two sides to a story—and the juvenile exhortation to ""F—k the Police,"" is certainly not always a helpful one.<br/><br/>Indeed, the reality of a bigger problem than police violence in the black community (i.e. black on black violence) becomes apparent in the tragic scene involving Dre's younger brother, murdered by other youths from his community back home. Indeed, for all the Rodney King-like incidents (overly highlighted in the film), they pale in comparison statistically to the murders that occur every day between members of the same race in the so-called ""ghettos"" of US cities.<br/><br/>As we reach the mid-point, there's more fascinating stuff especially with Cube's decision to quit the band after claiming Heller is intentionally withholding his contract. Ice Cube subsequently becomes successful as a solo act and a ""rap war"" ensues between Cube and Eazy, with Eazy claiming Ice Cube is a ""Benedict Arnold,"" and Cube responding with his infamous ""No Vaseline"" track.<br/><br/>Heller turns out to be the film's main antagonist, with Dre and Eazy also eventually turning against him. The accusations against Heller are perhaps the least convincing aspect of the film; there is a rather lame scene where Eazy's girlfriend is going over the ""books,"" and claims, without any in-depth explanation that Heller gypped all of the NWA artists. In the face of a recent lawsuit instituted by Heller against the film's producers, we'll see who's telling the truth when the lawsuit is over.<br/><br/>The second antagonist here is Suge Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, along with Dr. Dre. Knight is ably highlighted as a thug, when he beats up Eazy who refuses to release Dre from his contract. There's also another good scene where Knight mercilessly beats up a man over an innocent dispute over a parking spot. I suspect however, there is much more to the Suge Knight story that the producers don't let on here.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton generally follows the basic history of NWA's rise and fall. But some things are left out to give the impression that the principals were not really such bad guys when they were indeed guilty of some rather noxious bad behavior. Dre's drunk driving is downplayed, a subsequent jailhouse stint is ignored along with a violent assault on a woman, resulting in a lawsuit and subsequent payment. To his credit, Dre has admitted that he did some things in his younger days he wasn't proud of, but it would have been nice to have seen some of those things in this film.<br/><br/>Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., steals the show playing his father in his younger days. The acting generally is quite good and the film covers most of the bases of the NWA history. Even if rap isn't your thing, this is a film worth seeing despite the limitations of hagiography."
"alexanderbrooks-80601","10","3","26","9 May 2016"," Film review
","For those who hear the phrase, ""Straight Outta Compton,"" it's practically impossible not to get an image of five young black males wearing Raider hats and jackets and a few jheri curls. The phrase also brings back memories about the rise of ""gangsta rap"" as a full fledged culture. Well, on August 14, 2015, producers Dr. Dre and Ice Cube along with famed director F. Gary Gray presented this image and more to the big screen with the N.W.A. biopic named after the group's debut album. <br/><br/>With a perfectly selected cast that included O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube, Aldis Hodge as MC Ren, Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, and Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella, the young men deliver star studded performances portraying the real life rappers. It helps that all five men not only gave noticeable resemblance to the characters they are portraying, but also mastered their mannerisms. Corey Hawkins comfortably sports an old school World Class wrecking crew jacket while still working for his club manager, Alonzo. Jason Mitchell brilliantly escapes the LAPD like it's simple exercise. O'Shea Jackson Jr. spits the No Vaseline lyrics and questions management in only a way the real Ice Cube could do it. <br/><br/>Besides the excellent portrayals of all the characters, including that of Snoop Dogg, the late Tupac Shakur, and Suge Knight, the film hits a home run for nostalgia's sake. Released fairly close to 20 and a half years after Eazy-E's passing, the timing of the film makes it enjoyable not just for those born in the 60's, 70's, or 80's, but 90's as well. There aren't too many films out there based on events from the mid 80's to the early 90's that many folks born in 1995 or later could enjoy. They might be able to if not for excessive social media and game consoles, but that's another story. By strategically timing the release, the remaining members of N.W.A. managed to get people to go crazy with anticipation over the ""Straight outta"" website, Dr. Dre's Compton album, and his Beats headphones. Since its release, there has been a dramatic increase in the purchase of old N.W.A. music. So, when you combine the box office money with that of the music sales, it's clear that an overwhelming sense of nostalgia has been sparked. <br/><br/>Aside from nostalgia and good acting, Straight Outta Compton sheds light on two other topics still relevant today. Racism and the corruption of the music business. The racism is outlined through the portrayal of the Rodney King riots as a result of none of the offending officers being convicted for a videotaped beating. It's also displayed by the several times the members are unjustly harassed by sworn officers of the law, simply looking for trouble. While corruption in the music business is nothing new, the film reminds us of how serious divide and conquer can really be, and how it stifled N.W.A.'s potential. To quote O'Shea Jackson Jr. during the film, ""We left a lot of hits on the table."" If not for Eazy-E's untimely passing, there's a good chance we would have heard some of these hits as the group attempted to reunite minus original manger, Jerry Heller. <br/><br/>Despite some of the antics, lyrics, and behavior of N.W.A. that some members of the general public may have found objectionable, one cannot deny the greatness of this film. Nor can they deny this group's relevance to Hip-Hop culture and the several years of free promotion they gave to then Los Angeles but now Oakland Raiders. Whatever your feelings happen to be about this group, one thing is for certain. It is more than worth your time to go see their nine year story played out in a two and a half hour film."
"brchthethird","8","3","27","8 May 2016"," A flawed, but loving, tribute to Eazy-E
","I've had an on/off relationship with hip-hop and rap music, and I'm certainly not well-versed in the history or behind-the-scenes goings-on with the artists themselves. However, I love a good musical biopic and STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly that. For those few unaware, ""Straight Outta Compton"" was the debut album (and title track) from rap group NWA, with members Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Easy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (there might be more, but the film focused on those five). It tells the story of how the group came together, created some of their hit records, and broke up due to various reasons, mainly involving money and contracts. If that sounds like a lot to fit into a two and a half hour movie, you'd probably be right. It doesn't just stop with NWA's breakup, then following the solo careers of the three most important members. If there's a strike against the movie, it's that there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do it satisfactorily. Still, the performances were excellent and I thought the actors did an incredible job of inhabiting their real-life counterparts. It should also go without saying that the film has stellar soundtrack. Narratively, the film seems to focus the most on Eazy-E, who the film is dedicated to, and most of the best moments involve him. There were many great moments, in fact, ranging from elation and awe, to a few that will probably have you tearing up. As for the film's Oscar snub, I can see why many felt it deserved a nod, but it honestly was a little too overreaching and bloated. Entertaining and fulfilling? Yes, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. However, Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) was most definitely snubbed. Overall, I feel like NWA's story would have been better served as a miniseries, considering how complex and large in scope the narrative is, but there is a 20-minute longer Director's Cut that I will be checking out in the near future. As for what I just watched, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a fascinating look at the rise of some music legends, an intimate look behind the curtain of the music business, and a loving tribute to a friend.<br/><br/>UPDATE (Director's Cut): I honestly couldn't tell where they added a lot of material. There didn't seem to be any new scenes, but what I did notice was extra material added to the beginning or ending of scenes, extending them by a small amount. As I had hoped, most of it fleshed out the story a little more instead of just adding extra material for the sake of it. Overall, I enjoyed the film more the second go-round, although the weaknesses in the second half still remain. Another thing I noticed, or considered, is the possibility that some scenes were probably constructed specifically for the film (all in the second half). Although maybe not 100% accurate to real life, I thought that some conversational scenes dealing with the prospect of bringing NWA back together (before Eazy-E's illness and death), regardless of whether or not they actually happened, worked dramatically and allowed some partial closure to what was one of music's most infamous breakups. Thinking back on the two times I've watched STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON now, I have to consider this a new standard for musical biopics. More than just relaying a series of events, it touches on issues that unfortunately still remain relevant, namely the struggle between artists and management and, more importantly, the often contentious relationship between cops and the people they're supposed to serve. In this way, I think the film really captured the zeitgeist of this day and age, and will endure as a staple of its genre."

","First, I would like to start off saying that MAYBE a 3rd of the reviewers truly know how it was back then.. <br/><br/>That being said, I grew up to NWA, etc.. I didn't always agree with all the gangsta rap, and truthfully I didn't grow up in a ghetto as bad as theirs was. <br/><br/>I did in fact grow up in a ghetto though.. <br/><br/>I clearly remember when each song came out, and how music changed from NWA. Its telling your story, on your life, thru your eye's.. Many don't get it, and never will.. <br/><br/>This movie shows how it was/is. Characters were AMAZING!! Wasn't feeling the Snoop character, cause he looked nothing like him, but everything was good with the body movement. <br/><br/>Pac... Just wow!! Marcc is awesome, and looks so much like Shakur that I literally replayed that spot like 5 times cause I truly thought it was actually him!! <br/><br/>Hands down one of the greatest biography movies ever!"

","I personally LOVED the movie. I've never been/have ever lived in the hood (so I can't relate); I can say that I felt the pain and struggle that was portrayed by the characters in the movie. The acting was AMAZING. It helped me get an understanding of the lives of black lives (especially males); even to this day racial stereotypes are still going on. The music might not be understood by people that haven't lived the life of N.W.A. But it's exactly what Ice Cube stated: ""their art reflects their reality."" Again, I've never been to the hood, but I do have an understanding of the struggles that these young black men faced; there are still crooked cops today. It was very informative and full of action. However, if you're not open to learning new things/narrow-minded, you probably won't enjoy the movie! The movie leaves me guessing at the end though, when Eazy-E contracted AIDS, and when Dr. Dre started a new company (Aftermath)..these black men rose to the top; coming from the bottom of the totem pole (labeled that way too). This movie shows anyone can achieve success; as well as how jerk-ish some dirty cops are. By the way, Ice Cube's son is IDENTICAL to him; the ""F*** the Police"" performance is historical."

I'm also well educated, but very open minded and realistic. Too many people are offended by this movie as if it's something personal. This movie is real and it's about all of their lives. I enjoy the fact that they didn't downplay or cater to those who are too sensitive. If they didn't show exactly how these guys were brought up, what they went through, how it all played out... It would be fiction! & to say it was disgusting, or racist, or ""porno"" like... That's ridiculous. You can have your own opinions of course, but the movie is called ""Straight Outta Compton"". What did you think you were going to see?! & it's rated R, so that was your warning. & you know you're lying if you say you didn't at least nod your head along to the beat!

Not because I am familiar at all with the ruthless ghetto reality that inspired the songs. I needed to see it because I understood that it's a hell of a movie. And it is.<br/><br/>I also understand that the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences did not deign this film worthy of neither a Best Picture nor any Best Acting Oscar nominations. And to paraphrase the real life characters composing the '80's pioneering rap band N.W.A. in this captivating story, ""That's some real sh--, man."" <br/><br/>Nothing wrong with being in your 60's, male and white as most of the Academy voters reportedly are. The problem is when you have absolutely no intimation as to what is happening on screen and can consequently generate no semblance of appreciation for it.<br/><br/>The exceptional performances in ""Compton "" were thoroughly authentic, resonate and impactful.

I mean, any film that deals with a ""real"" story is going to be altered for one reason or another so I don't bash any movie that changes things around. With that said, I thought the movie did a very good job at telling the story of this group and the impact they had on the culture at the time but it also serves as an education to the people who think current music is new or original.<br/><br/>Director F. Gary Gray does a terrific job at keeping the entertainment level extremely high throughout the picture and even with its long running time the movie never feels too long and in fact there are many elements that could have been extended on. I think the greatest thing the film accomplishes is that it gives people are clear idea of what the culture was at the time and how this group really knocked down all sorts of doors. I was a music fan when these albums were originally released and it was something fresh and original.<br/><br/>The screenplay manages to hit not only on the music side of the group but I thought it paid great attention to the three main characters as well as the manager played by Paul Giamatti. I thought the character development was excellent and not something you usually see in these types of movies. Another major plus were the performances with the entire cast doing an excellent job in their roles. The real stand out Mitchell who is simply wonderful as Eazy-E and really brings a lot of depth to the role. Giamatti also deserves a lot of credit for a very powerful performance.<br/><br/>As you'd expect, the music is wonderful and there's no doubt that it's a terrific looking movie. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly one of the year's better movie. What was so surprising is the fact that it really does have a heart to it and this is especially scene towards the end when Eazy-E begins to get sick."

"avik-basu1889","8","3","28","9 February 2016"," The Boys from the Hood !!!
","'Straight Outta Compton' directed by F. Gary Gray commences with police radio conversations about possible criminal activity happening on the spot which gets overlapped by reporters talking about the increased potency of the gangs in L.A. and the associated danger to society that comes along with that. So right from the get go, even before the arrival of any visuals, the director establishes the rough and chaotic surroundings that surround the characters in the film. 'Straight Outta Compton' portrays the rise and fall of the gangsta rap group N.W.A. and explores the band members, their natures, their motivations and also pays homage to their talent.<br/><br/>Although the film is basically about the group N.W.A., but the screenplay written by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff which is obviously based on real events has a very potent social poignancy to it that not only portrays America and L.A. during the late 80s and early 90s, but it also lays down the unfortunate relevance of the storyline and themes explored in the film with current times. We start off with the young men who before they became N.W.A. We see them living their ordinary lives in the poverty-ridden hoods of L.A. We can feel the discontentment with their lives in their eyes and can also feel their anger about the somewhat blatant racism in society which on many occasions gets perpetuated by cops, the upholders of the law. But they use this anger and oppression to fuel their talent through lyrics in their songs. But apart from the racism and the social inequality, 'Straight Outta Compton' also deals with the theme of what it means to be a celebrity. After the boys achieve success through their talent, we see them standing at the proverbial crossroads where they have to choose between continuing to work hard and use their talent, or allow the business side of their careers to overwhelm their art and reap the rewards of their success and drown themselves in money, random sex and parties.<br/><br/>The film is directed really well for the most part by F. Gary Gray. The pacing is good. The cinematography is also brilliant. The film starts out in the late 80s and then progresses till the mid 90s and we do get that period feel to it. The editing is also great specially in the concert scenes which are directed and edited with a passion and the viewer feels like he/she is in the audience.<br/><br/>The acting is also very solid. Although the film follows the whole group itself, but the main focus is on Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. The actors playing these characters are Jason Mitchell, O'Shea Jackson Jr.(Ice Cube's own son) and Corey Hawkins respectively. Although the film has been accused of ignoring some elements of the real lives of the characters, but as far as I am concerned Gary Gray never completely makes angelic and flawless figures out of these characters which ends up helping the actors to show their range. We see the darker and somewhat objectionable elements of these characters which allows the actors to venture into grey areas. Paul Giamatti also comes up with a very good supporting performance.<br/><br/>The film still isn't perfect. One reason for it is the fact that although the screenplay is based on real life events, but I still think the story gets a bit predictable from the midway point onwards. The storyline is very standard depicting the rise of a group of artists and then their downfall through in-fighting and the obscene excesses of wealth. These transitions could have been presented by Gray in a better way without some of the mainstream elements. There are also some guest appearance of real-life artists which felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped and looked a bit gimmicky.<br/><br/>I am not a rap/hip-hop fan. I have always been a classic rock fanatic. I have admired the poetry and depth of the lyrics that have been written by a number of rap artists, but never really have I gravitated towards hip-hop as a music genre. So if you can make a film which is primarily based on a hip-hop group and make me like it so much, you have clearly made a brilliant film. The brilliance for the film lies in its technical elements coupled with the substantial themes that are explored that range from individualistic to a broader social level. I don't think it's perfect, but it still is a significant biopic of talented musicians."

The music / lyrics I know have been the subject of the moral majority in years gone by, these guys were/are a product of their surroundings, IE they were moulded by their experiences where they lived. I remembered the same grumbles raised about the lyrical content when Stiff Little Fingers released ""Inflammable Material"" back in the 70's.<br/><br/>As far as the Oscars go, I agree with Ice Cube when he was interviewed on the Graham Norton show two weeks ago when He said the he makes movies for his fans, and that winning an Oscar is the icing on the cake however it isn't that important. well said Cube!"

Overall the characters where all played well and fleshed out, the script and direction was good, I would recommend it for everyone!<br/><br/>I did find the lack of Oscar nods disturbing, perhaps it's the films depiction of cops and police violence, which is more then a little one sided to say the least, it didn't effect my enjoyment of the movie however."

","Straight Outta Compton<br/><br/>Being a roadie for a rapper is easy because you only have to carry around a milk crate of old funk albums.<br/><br/>However, as per this biography, personal baggage counts as sound equipment.<br/><br/>In 1986 drug-dealer Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) enter the studio of producer Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) who pairs them with DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.). They subsequently release a hit single under the acronym N.W.A.<br/><br/>But when Eazy-E hires businessman Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) to be their manger, his misappropriation of their revenue tears the group asunder.<br/><br/>Spanning the social and racial issues of the early nineties with great aplomb, this O.G. origin tale may whitewash some harsher realities of the real-life situation but is ultimately a well-acted, keenly directed hip-hop masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, not surprising is the fact that all East Coast film critics dissed this movie. <br/><br/>Green Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","So for months and months people have been telling me to watch this movie and boy am I glad I finally listened to them. I love hip hop and the hip hop culture but the story itself is so much more than that. It's about the struggle of making a better life, starting a business, flourishing, and trying to stay on top. <br/><br/>Its about friends and family. It's about art. And it's about finding love and grieving those we have lost. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film. My emotions ranged from anger to pride to sadness and everything in between. The film was everything I expected it to be and so much more. <br/><br/>O'Shea Jackson Jr. was sensational and overall the acting was pretty stellar. Great movie. A film I would definitely recommend."
"cezr_ac","8","3","28","13 December 2015"," Some People Don't Realize How Hard It Is To Make An Entertaining 2.5Hr Movie
","Overall, this movie deserves all of the hype. There are some holes that you can poke at. They didn't get too deep into the story of each member. The storyline is heavily one sided. The acting was not academy award winning. Snoop Dogg's character looked nothing like him and was about 2 feet too short. <br/><br/>All that being said, the movie leaves you wanting more after two and a half hours. To me that is an accomplish. Most movies that go beyond the 2 hour mark, you find yourself wondering when are they going to put the bow around it and wrap it up. SOOC leaves you wanting more. Almost as if you feel there could be a part 2. <br/><br/>So rather than talk about what I thought was rather exceptional about the film, I feel it's best to address some of the negativity that it's gotten and in doing such, it will highlight the positives. <br/><br/>First up, not going deep into the story of each member. NWA was formed by 5 members. MC Ren, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and Easy-E. The latter three to be quite honest are the only people that the vast majority of people have heard of. I guarantee you that most of the people who went to watch the film couldn't tell you the names of the former 2. <br/><br/>Not only were Dre, Cube and Easy for the most part the only popular members, they were all pretty darn successful away from the group. It would have been too hard if not impossible to go into much more detail about each member prior to and after NWA without making it a 4 hour movie. <br/><br/>Number 2. The storyline being one sided. No disrespect to Ren and Yella, but again, no one really cares. The storyline was primarily around Dre and Cube. For the most part, everything in the movie was spot on with how things played out in real life. <br/><br/>Easy-E was not long time childhood friends with Dre and Cube. He was the neighborhood dopeman who happened to have money in his pocket to fund NWA. You can look at Easy as being the bad guy who stabbed his friends in the back by screwing them over on their contracts, but at the end of the day, he was just being who he was - a businessman. The dynamic between him and the manager, Jerry plays out very well. It's interesting seeing two businessmen from completely different situations come together and form a bond. <br/><br/>Lastly, people have complained about the acting being bad. First off, I don't feel it was that bad. All these guys with the exception of Paul Giamatti are new,unknown actors. They got the role largely in part because they happened to fit the likeness of the real members. Cube's son did an outstanding job but you also have to considering, he is playing his dad. <br/><br/>The one thing I did find funny is how bad snoop Dogg was casted. The guy playing him sounds nothing like Snoop and is about 5'7 and Snoop is about 6'6. If you play close attention, you'll notice that all of Snoops lines in the songs they play in the movie are edited out. It seems obvious that they didn't get permission to use his voice (with to me is an interesting story on it's own). The only time you hear a Snoop Dogg line is when it's being sung horribly by the actor portraying him. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a must see for anyone who likes rap music. If gangsta rap offends you, do not watch it. If you don't know anything about NWA, go look up what the letters standfor before pressing play. Even if you're not familiar with rap, it's a good watch because it's a good insight into life in the hood and the type of harassment by police that shape the mentality of how these people feel towards them. 8/10."

","This movie had gotten a lot of hyping up by people and advertisements, to me, so when I saw it, I already knew that I was supposed to be in love with it. However, sadly, I will say that it is stupidly exaggerated in most aspects of the realistic portrayal of a real life music industry giant that has gone on to now self- produce it's own movies and music videos in the capacity that the genre has begun recycling so many ideas, and still coming up with new ways to spin the story. I think that the best thing about this movie, is that it is the definitive story of the plot behind many sub-culture hip hop movies. To say that it had been anticipated would be necessary then, for the true understanding of a sub- culture, itself. It seems redundant, and misinformed with guidance and any methodology to ethics, in many ways, too, and glorifies violence in the same way as it's predecessors, but in the innovative true story element, and a big enough budget, it is truly quite spectacular of a movie watching event, for the very same reasons that you would dismiss it as being over the top or uninspired. Straight Outta Compton (2015) is a 10 out of 10, movie, whether you would like it to be, or not."

","Straight Outta Compton is the biopic about the controversial hip-hop group N.W.A and each of its five members. As far as biopics go, this one was very informative for the most part. It really opens your eyes to the influence and legacy the group has left on the music industry, both good and bad.<br/><br/>In 1986 Compton, California, five friends Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella form the hip-hop group N.W.A. Their first hit single, Eazy-E's ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" becomes a smash hit and gets the attention of music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), who is hired to become the group's manager. A short time after this, the group is picked up by label Priority Records, who help them to produce the group's debut album ""Straight Outta Compton"", which becomes a huge success both commercially and critically. With their newfound nationwide fame, the group begins to feel the pressures of the controversy they have stirred in their song lyrics, in particular, the infamous ""F--k Tha Police"". Many race riots ensue and the group is blamed for inciting violence against the police and other authority figures.<br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of hip-hop or not, the film still makes for a fascinating look into music history. It transports us back to a time when hip-hop seemed like the only real voice that young people growing up in Compton, California really had. Throughout the film, there is occasional inter-splicing of real news footage showing what was going on in Los Angeles at the time. This adds a feeling of realism to the film's narrative and makes you feel like you're living though what's going on. The film's lead actors, including O'Shea Jackson Jr, the real Ice Cube's son, all did a fantastic job in their roles. Paul Giamatti was great as well, playing the group's manager Jerry Heller. My biggest problem with the film, however, is that it only really shows us the lives of Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-E, whereas we're barely told anything about N.W.A's remaining two members MC Ren and DJ Yella. I am aware that they had nowhere near as successful careers after the group disbanded, but it still would have been nice to have known more about them at the same time.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10."

So going in to this film I was thinking it was going to glorify the rapper lifestyle like most other big budget music movies. But I was wrong, it plays more like a period piece and shows the hardships the young African Americans went through.<br/><br/>The story is compelling and is a classic rags to riches story. If you're not a fan of rap it doesn't matter, the drama, action and story will grab you and keeps you watching. Director F. Gary Gray makes you feel like you are in a world most people have never and will never experience. Some of the scenes he recreated are amazing, including sold out concerts and full out street riots.<br/><br/>This film focuses mostly on the rise and break up of N.W.A. and the life of Eazy-E. He also touches on Ice Cube's falling out with the group and writing his films ""Boys In The Hood"" and ""Friday"". Also, Dr.Dre's career in Death Row Records, which could be a full movie on it's own. The cast makes you believe that you are experiencing these chapters in music history.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton makes you appreciate the culture and yes it does glorify the gangster life and violence, but it's Hollywood and they have to put asses in seats. This movie stuck with me just like SLC PUNK did and gives you a glimpse into a world you may not know. Also, if you liked the police before this movie, this film will make you understand why the rest of us don't.

","""Straight Outta Compton"" is an entertaining biopic describing many of the challenges faced by the pioneering west coast rap group N.W.A. It's ""brutally honest"" portrayal of social injustice seeps to captivate audiences and their emotions. Each character is dynamic and has a unique composition to what created the origins of ""gangsta rap"". It bases their music on personal hardships and struggles experienced within the confines of Compton. The movie successfully represents social change that occurred through much of their west coast influences.<br/><br/>The story is told of a few friends composing smash hits with a few bumps along the road. It first gives a glance of police discrimination, invading their personal privacies and going through humiliating engagements. This later results in Ice Cube's hit ""Fuck the Police"". Soon after a series of events break off into a greedy downward spiral leaving the group to dismantle by going their own separate ways. Jerry Heller becomes the primary influence to the shadow of N.W.A's demise. <br/><br/>One of the biggest problems to this rags to riches tale is that it leaves out much of the detail the characters had. Eazy-E is a drug dealer turned MC who lets money get in the way of camaraderie, and Dre is just a gifted producer who only focuses on music. The only one who had a solid amount of depth is Ice Cube, who grows from a teenage rapper to an influence of social activism. It doesn't describe much of the violence that ruined the group's image, but only bits and pieces that affected them. Other than that, much of the details are left out (other than Eazy-E's character Eric). The movie focuses on a suburban audience who lack the idea of this lavishing lifestyle. It brushes on some of the detail but never involves the other side of what the rap group essentially went through.<br/><br/>While being a motion picture ""wonder-hits"" album, its still one of the most entertaining movies to date."

","This movie freaking rocks all the way to the very end. I was just going the whole time. I was crying like a baby the trumpet at the very end of the credits is one of the most beautiful trumpet sounds I've ever hear. The smoke coming out of the old 1970s era buses. Acadamy award vote from me! That was some awesome music and a story line that fits in pretty well to modern time.With the publicity the police are getting right now over the shootings upon throwing children done to shotting children and tasering and beating people. Maybe i went on the deep end but not really because all of those things actually happened and even more as you will see in this magnificent film of bravery, struggle and rising against all odds and the diffuculties that come with being rich. Although i don't really ever understand how people don't understand that they are getting taken for a rideso obviously there in lies a even bigger problem. This movie is awesome. Watch it again if you've already seen it. IT gets better the second time around. Im saying its winning big. Anybody else feel blown away?"
"r-kerr0992","8","3","28","14 September 2015"," A Surprisingly Great Biopic
","OVERVIEW This film sort of came out of nowhere for me. I never heard anything in regards to it's release and all of a sudden it comes out of the woodwork. Which is strange after watching a few interviews with Ice Cube addressing that the film took a long time to get into production. When I was younger rap was a contributor to my musical influence, specifically that of the NWA's debut album Straight Outta Compton. Very raw, unrestricted subject matters and lyrics gave it that global appeal, the right to free speech and expressing yourself (no pun intended in relation to one of the songs on the album).<br/><br/>The story follows the story of all members of NWA (MC Ren, DJ Yella). But more specifically Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and Dr Dre. Following each individual story interwoven with each other gave the movie a fresh and interesting perspective, and I'm glad the movie didn't just focus on one person's agenda and opinions of the group through it's rise and fall. This is not a typical BS Hollywood rise to fame film, it really is a gritty, interesting story with a no holds barred approach to the oppression of the black community of Compton. Half of the things mentioned in the film I had no idea about before hand, and it does make for a nice setup to what made Ice Cube and Dr Dre who they are and how big they became.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES The cast was solid, top to bottom, Cory Hawkins as Dr Dre, Aldis Hodge and Neil Brown Jr. as MC Ren and DJ Yella, as well as R. Marcos Taylor as the infamous Suge Knight who deserves a mention. However, in my opinion there were three standouts that completely towered above the rest. Paul Giamatti as the once great band manager of NWA Jerry Heller was just amazingly good. The range of playing a shallow business man yet sympathetic towards the racial cause as the framework of the music, taking more of his share of the earnings but being one of the catalysts for the groups success, it really was a great performance. Two scenes in particular was when Heller confronts the police in regards to the police's harassment of the group on the street and the argument with Easy-E when he finds that Heller has not been all of the way honest with him. <br/><br/>Leading me onto the next pick that is Jason Mitchell's portrayal of Easy-E. The mannerisms of his voice, movement and the emotional depth shown from aggressive, to funny, to the emotional conflicts of struggling with a serious health condition was absolutely great. You watch old footage of Easy-E from the early 90s and really understand why he was picked and how much he brought to the character. <br/><br/>Lastly, my personal favourite of the movie, O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his father Ice Cube. I understand that people would think 'well it's his son, how could he not be picked for the part?'. Watching interviews knowing that he was studying and auditioning for the part for over two years before he got it, taking vigorous acting classes and being more than just a familiar look alike really does show. His acting was solid, and that's a very difficult person to try and portray, the stern exterior of Ice Cube, solid vocal performances and giving the character much more depth than you would expect. It really was the highlight performance in my opinion, Jason Mitchell a close second.<br/><br/>NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS The edgy opening scene of a drug raid as Easy-E scrambles to get away, the confrontations between Dr. Dre and Suge Knight, and the consistent harassment from the police this group of people faced at all times were all great parts of the film. However there is always two scenes that stick in my mind.<br/><br/>Firstly the live performance of 'F*** the Police' in Detroit on their 1989 tour started a riot after the police warned them what might happen if they played it. As the song goes on gun fire is heard, and the concert turns into a riot with the group trying to run away, only to be wrestled to the ground and forced into the back of police vans. All the while fans on top of the over pass are shouting 'F*** the police'. It is a great cinematic moment, which didn't quite play out the way it did in the film, but it's a great scene to watch, and it's symbolic of the whole movie's premise.<br/><br/>The second was the hospital scene of Eazy-E, the whole sequence really, as he is diagnosed with HIV. Going through his internal struggle with the diagnosis and how all members of the group deal with the situation. It really is a heartbreaking part of the movie and they really did a great justice to his death. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT All in all 'Straight Outta Compton' is a great biopic that delivers on both the generational premise of the black oppression and the horrific Rodney King beatings where the group emerged to stand up and use there lawful right to question these authority figures in the only way they knew how. It's depiction of the police force is very negative, and it is totally understandable. There were some elements of conflicts between group members that were not in the movie, however to keep the film that faithful to the true life story from all who were a part of it is pretty impressive. <br/><br/>I would totally recommend this film as it's an extremely interesting story that you probably didn't know much about, and to me it's one of the most diverse (opinion- wise) biopics I have seen."

","Straight Outta Compton is a biopic about the careers of Eazy E, Ice Cube, and Dr. Dre as they started the N.W.A and became the voice of people in the hood. With songs such as Straight Outta Compton and F*ck Tha Police these men worked their way up to the top through friendships, break ups, and different labels. They faced controversy from the streets and the Police for their works, and fought through it. It shows the boys break up from each other, their individual career paths and challenges (money problems, corrupt managers, Suge Knight, and more). You hear mention of their movie deals, and it shows a list of other artists the rappers worked with, such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac. Let's talk about what didn't work. This movie glosses over some of the low points in each rapper's career, mentioning them, but not putting enough detail to give a fair representation. This is mainly due to Ice Cube and Dre's involvement as producers obviously not wanting to ruin their names But that wasn't a big deal because I loved everything else. The cinematography was fantastic. There was one scene involving gangs that I wont ruin for you, but it had a very cool and emotionally powerful shot in it that made me almost cry with pride. The acting was superb. Every actor showed such raw talent and emotion that was so powerful that as a viewer I felt empathy for the characters, and I truly believed the pain was happening to them, in the moment. It was moments like that that made me forget I was watching a movie at all. It felt more like the actual people really going through everything. A special shout out goes to O'Shea Jackson Jr. for giving a performance as his own dad and absolutely killing it. And the story? Fantastically put together, switching between each character flawlessly without letting any character be overtaken by another. Also, I am a bit biased towards loving the soundtrack considering I knew every hip hop song in the film and could rap along with them. Suffice to say I loved this movie, and would definitely go see it again. 10/10"

","Straight Outta Compton (2015): Dir: F. Gary Gray / Cast: O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr, Aldis Hodge: Tense powerful film about the talent that rose from the depth of a dangerous society of Compton. F. Gary Gray directs his best film to date with the true life events surrounding controversial hip hop artists who would become known as N.W.A. They come under fire for a song titled ""Fuck the Police"" in their address to being sighted on numerous accounts of police brutality. They answer media accusations claiming that they rap about their version of reality. They also tout the Freedom of Speech notion that is pushed to the extremes when they shove the anti-law stance too far. While the subject matter is controversial the screenplay is detailed and presents a great ensemble of young talent to portray the artists. O'Shea Jackson plays his real life father Ice Cube and the resemblance is remarkable. Cube is the first to break from the group for a solo career. Corey Hawkins portrays Dr. Dre who holds it together when everyone around him seems to be coming undone. He eventually forms his own company which results in numerous great talents found. Jason Mitchell plays Eazy E who died of AIDS in 1995. He was associated closely with their corrupt manager but eventually reunites when the wool is removed from his eyes. They are a group that faced harsh environments and found a voice that took them straight out of Compton and into a lifestyle of success that proves that where one comes from isn't always where they end up.

By about an hour I already felt overwhelmed because the film had traced so much story. This is one film that really felt its length. I also think throughout many instances, the film just overplays its melodrama completely. Some dialogue is shoddy, and some of the narrative structure gets messy in its second half (which is definitely overall more problematic). I think the cast is really great though, and the film does get across its overarching, most powerful message about brotherhood and friendship.

","I actually signed up with IMDb specifically to leave my thoughts on this film, after being completely perplexed by some of the strange reviews.<br/><br/>I will start by pointing out that this is the biopic of one of the most controversial groups in recent times, so to leave a bad score seemingly based on the fact the film features swearing, sex & violence is just ludicrous. Furthermore, I did not feel it was in any way gratuitous considering the subject at hand. Conversely, I thought these aspects were handled very well.<br/><br/>Cannot really give marks for the storyline because - as a huge fan of NWA, I can attest (from my reading at least) that what is portrayed herein appears to be a fairly accurate account of events. What I can confirm is that said-storyline & the way the film has been directed makes for compelling viewing from start to finish.<br/><br/>The casting is absolutely impeccable. From seasoned vet Paul Giamatti's incredible (as always) portrayal of Jerry Heller to O'Shea Jackson's impressive debut playing his father - across the board the casting is spot-on.<br/><br/>The music - which, let's be honest, was always going to be vital in a movie of this nature - has been handled brilliantly, featuring snippets from Dre's recent Compton album, original NWA recordings, & fantastically produced edits performed by the cast: who do a great job of sounding the genuine article.<br/><br/>The film has taken flack in recent weeks due to the omission of scenes detailing Dre's abuse of women, but I can't really see that this is directly relevant to the story of NWA in any event, & I don't think they'd add anything to the proceedings per se.<br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed this from start to finish. I would reiterate that I am completely confused by the negative reviews. If you have any interest in NWA, Hip Hop, or just inspiring stories period: do yourself a favour, disregard them & give this a go."

There literally isn't a good-hearted, genuine person to be found in this movie. Every single character is deplorable, it's simply a case of to what extent. Now, that's not an insult to anyone, these people would be the first to agree that they are far from reputable characters. And the thing is that that's what makes 'Straight Outta Compton' so enjoyable. <br/><br/>With a long run time of roughly 2 and half hours there are certainly varying degrees of quality at different stages of the film. The ending is certainly the strongest stage. The emotional story line that develops is well told and certainly does tug at the heart strings. The final word spoken before the credits role will also bring chills to anyone familiar with the rap genre. There are portions earlier in the film that certainly drag, and can have you at times wondering whether certain things needed to be included in the story line, thus making the film so long. I think a very strong ending does a lot to cover up the earlier indiscretions, and fair play to them for that. If you need one segment of your film to be especially strong, you'd be crazy not to make it your ending.<br/><br/>It's certainly a film that will resonate for people who are fans of rap, but will it do the same for those that aren't? I'm not entirely sure on the answer to that. Whether the story is interesting enough to carry the average viewer, purely from a story line perspective, I think would be split about 50/50. I thought the actors all did a fantastic job portraying their real life characters and I was especially impressed by the sound they managed to create with some of the musical reenactments. Altogether, it's not quite as strong as I had hoped for, but it still remains a very solid, and at times excellent, film."
"peefyn","6","2","16","12 September 2016"," Unconvincing version of an interesting story
","I know little about the story of N.W.A., and this movie might be on the money accurate - but it doesn't manage to present the story in an convincing way. You feel like you're watching the version of history preferred by the surviving members, and that it glosses over some of the negative sides of the relationship. Not all of them, mind you, as there's enough on screen to keep the drama going. But I don't buy it.<br/><br/>That said, the most interesting part of the movie was how it portrayed the police. That actually felt convincing, and helped explain some of the background for albums like ""Straight outta Compton"".<br/><br/>The acting was mostly quite good, and the rapping as well. Sadly, O'Shea Jackson Jr. isn't quite up there amongst the others, and it does distract a bit."
"stephendaxter","9","3","32","2 September 2015"," An incredible film and one of the best biopics around
","This is one of the best films of the year, that is all. Straight Outta Compton was just absolutely incredible. It was a biopic that told the story of how NWA came to be and what happened while they were active and after. Now i don't know the history of NWA to the point where i know what is accurate and what is not, but from looking stuff up if you are looking for the most accurate retelling, this probably isn't it as it is a biopic not a documentary. But with Ice Cube and Dr Dre as producers on the film i guess you could say some things were more accurate than not. The fact that this film managed to entertain me from start to finish even though i am not exactly an NWA fan speaks for how spectacular this movie was. It was intense at times, sad at times and in the end was just a really fascinating story that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It had incredible performances and covered many different events that all came together to tell a what is a really great story. Really, this film just had it all. I love a good biopic, and this is one of the best of them all, amazing. <br/><br/>Lets start with the performances by the actors because every damn actor in this movie KILLED IT as their character, especially O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his own dad. For a group of people who were relatively unknown they did a damn good job. Every single one transformed into their character (especially visually) and were so convincing that they may have actually gone back and gotten the characters' younger selves. Having that realism of these actors looking exactly like the real guys added even more authenticity to the film and the story they were trying to tell. Even Paul Giamatti was fantastic as always and the fact that all of these actors got me to care about or not care about every character whether i knew of them or not speaks again for the effort put into the film on the actors' part. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie was gripping and an undeniably exciting ride. The fact that all of this stuff (more or less) happened in real life is so fascinating that you just couldn't make this stuff up. These stories and events made for a plot that flowed so well all the way through and it was never too slow or too fast and never had a boring moment in its 2 hour and 27 minute runtime. Even though i had heard of some of the events that were coming up, the movie still had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation. The film also has a little drop of humour thrown in there to combat some of the darker more serious events that take place. Again, i'm sure they glossed over stuff and skipped certain things in order to not have this movie go for 4 hours but to someone not really familiar with everything going on with them at the time, it was all fine to me. Did it make me want to know more about these events? Heck yeh it did, mission accomplished. <br/><br/>So in the end, if you haven't realised already, i really really loved this movie, a story that was very well documented (or adapted), and fantastically acted right through to end up with an all round fantastic biographical picture and film - 9.4"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","18","17 September 2016"," The soul of Africans wounded by slavery
","This film is first of all nostalgic and that is good because we do not live on bread and water but also on recollections, as much as on dreams and projects. You will get the allusions to and mentions of ""Boys in the Hood"" and the famous video of the beating of Rodney King by the police in LA in 1992. You will have the right to wonder if anything has changed since now young black males are just shot to death by the police practically every week and just like in 1992 the police officers so far have gone through a judicial procedure that has cleaned them up of all charges or nearly.<br/><br/>You will also find the very strange community life in Black ghettos in America and the systematic raids of the police (be the policemen Black or white) to harass the young Black males they can see anywhere including in some Black neighborhoods.<br/><br/>But the film is a lot more than just that.<br/><br/>It is the real history of a group of rap music, N.W.A., that was probably the first to dare produce that music with these lyrics, the lyrics of the real street reality of Black ghettos and attacking the white dominant society for being racist, criminal, lethal and a few other nice totalitarian and dictatorial characteristics. Their most famous song was ""$...K the police"" of course. They were arrested in Detroit for it and they defended their first amendment rights, their total freedom of speech. That is the most important element at this point: the first amendment to the US constitution was understood at the time as being only for whites. Things have changed. But have they really? Note the freedom of speech is one thing, but the freedom of the distribution and circulation of all personal expression is far from being true because most people don't have the slightest possibility to really be circulated and distributed as much as Trump or Clinton, even with the Internet.<br/><br/>The second element that is interesting is that showbiz is a big stealing industry. You always find a producer who will help you though he will help himself first. But at the same time in your group there is always one who is going to help himself slightly less equally than the others since he is the one who has the power to sign all documents and checks. You will also learn that there is no contract for years because as long as you are not untouchable you are not someone who cannot fail tomorrow. So the producer prefers no contract since then he has none to break if there is some kind of difficulty along the road. <br/><br/>The third element is that artists like money but they sure do not know what investing and saving are. They get it, then they have to spend it, and spend it they do on parties, women and who knows what. So that Easzy-E is HIV positive and dies of AIDS because since he was not gay he did not have to take any precaution, did he or did he not? As the doctor told him a long time too late: ""You can get the virus from a heterosexual unprotected relationship."" Add to that alcohol and drugs and you have it. I guess 80% of the income is wasted on mostly useless and vain expenditures, including crazy ego-boosting cars and houses. Stardom in such cases is a long shorter than the stardom of a real star in the sky. It is true it cannot be taken to paradise in a backpack, but even so If all industrialists were like that we would still be living in caves.<br/><br/>The most fascinating fact is the music. Some pretend that rap or hip hop is no music. It is just humdrum drum machine noise plus a DJ scratching records in all possible ways. And worse of all the songs are not even sung, are they? Or are they not? For me it is an extremely strong and powerful form of music because the language is ""manipulated"" with the lips, tongue, larynx and glottis to get a special rhythm and a special cyclical flow punctuated by strong syllables or words generally carrying rhymes. Maybe it is not what the ""experts"" will call operatic singing. Maybe it is not what the connoisseurs will call music hall songs or even musicals songs. But it is tremendous work on language, on rhythm and even at times the use of melodious tunes on a guitar or some other instrument. <br/><br/>This leads me to say that when Blacks were slaves they used such rhythmic chanting to make all the slaves work at the same rhythm to avoid as many whippings as possible in the evening when the final cotton collection was measured, slave by slave. That insistence on rhythmic speech and rhythmic music is the purest African tradition that used to have the only polyrhythmic music in the world before it started spreading to the Semitic world first and then to all the places where African slaves were imported. Rap and hip hop is the very soul of African slaves and we can understand why in Europe so many second generation forced immigrants from the Maghreb or Arab countries find in rap and hip hop a way to express their soul wound, their historical alienation, their holocaustic traumas (colonization, forced deportation to Europe as overexploited menial unqualified workers, total alienation and deculturation of their own culture and the absolute acculturation in the standard European culture of the various countries where they are used as salaried chattel. <br/><br/>We are here at the root of the future because the victims of these soul wounds and of these historical traumas and genocidal holocausts are the future of this world. That's why gangsta rap is at least as important as Beethoven's ninth symphony or Verdi's Aïda.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"bartonj2410","8","3","34","1 September 2015"," A biopic of the highest calibre
","When it comes to sending out a message, music is one of the most powerful means of communication. Some like to use violence or force but never underestimate the power that music can have. Straight Outta Compton charts the story of one hip-hop group who would go down in history as one of the most vocal and influential groups in the history of music. That group is N.W.A. <br/><br/>When five friends; Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), combined their musical talents and formed N.W.A in 1986, they revolutionised the genre of hip-hop forever.<br/><br/>With the help of manager, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), N.W.A were signed by Priority Records and released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, in 1988. The album caused controversy upon release and gave N.W.A the reputation of being the most dangerous group in the world.<br/><br/>Their lyrics were said to be disrespectful of women while glorifying the criminal lifestyle and even speaking out about their deep hatred towards the police. This biopic depicts the trouble N.W.A had with the police as well as the big personalities that would cause a power struggle within the group.<br/><br/>As well as being a great film, Straight Outta Compton is a very good biopic. With any biopic, the actors have to do justice to the public figures they are portraying and in Straight Outta Compton, the performances are of a very high standard. <br/><br/>In particular, the three main performances stood out and show the passion that these actors had towards playing these iconic figures of hip-hop. Jason Mitchell is the one getting the most praise for his portrayal of Eazy-E, which is the hardest of the group to play in my opinion. There have been a few murmurs of award nominations and while I certainly think that might come at a stretch, I definitely wouldn't complain if Mitchell's performance was to get that sort of recognition.<br/><br/>Corey Hawkins is impressive as Dr. Dre while O'Shea Jackson Jr. proves that he bares more than just a resemblance to his father, Ice Cube, by stepping into his shoes with brilliant confidence and presence. Paul Giamatti is also worth mentioning with his supporting turn as Jerry Heller, the man who there is most definitely more to than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton was a real eye-opener for me when it came to N.W.A. I had no idea about what happened to cause the struggle within the group or how their run-ins with the police came about. A lengthy runtime of 147 minutes may put some people off however, with the film covering such an interesting topic and a fluid screenplay from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, the 147 minutes fly by pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I wouldn't class myself as a die hard hip-hop fan but I can appreciate the music and lyrics, all of which is made easier with some brilliantly executed musical scenes showing the group either recording their music or performing it to thousands in sold-out arenas. There is some wonderful cinematography from Matthew Libatique and the editing by Billy Fox that brings such an energy to proceedings that you, at times, might actually think you are watching the performance from the same arena.<br/><br/>You can sense the devotion that went into making Straight Outta Compton such a memorable experience and director F. Gary Gray really brings his A-game when it came to making the film. Gray has a history of making music videos for both Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, as well as the film Friday with Ice Cube back in 1995. Straight Outta Compton is Gray's most accomplished work yet and a film that he can be immensely proud of."
"nickyjohnp","8","1","6","28 October 2017"," The beginning of gangsta rap
","In F. Gary Gray's docudrama biopic, Straight Outta Compton, it tell's the story how six men from Compton, California (Eazy-E (singer), Ice Cube (songwriter, singer), Dr.Dre (DJ), DJ Yella (backup vocals), MC Ren (backup vocals), and The D.O.C. (backup vocals)) rose to fame their debuting album Straight Outta Compton by their band N.W.A. previously they all worked together on the hit- single Boyz In Da Hood by Eazy- E. After Boyz In Da Hood blow up, Eazy-E met with music manager Jerry Heller who was played by Paul Giamatti who I think did a great job playing the manager. Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr. play's his father in the movie and does a good job at it acting like his old man and capturing his charm, eventually the manager Jerry doesn't pay Ice Cube the money he deserves and the legal representation to sign a record contract. So Cube leaves the group and start's his own music label and becomes a film actor starring in Boyz N the Hood and also becoming a film writer for the 1995 movie Friday and the film show's both these event's. Before Ice Cube splits the group their controversial song f the police show's the crew getting arrested and fighting for their freedom of speech. Leading to other rapper's basing their material to what N.W.A. did. Dr. Dre would leave and would discover Snoop Dogg, Tupac, 50 Cent, and Eminem which I personally loved how they introduced them. N.W.A. would now just be Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, Eazy-E now finally realizes that Jerry was screwing him over from the beginning and Dre and Cube were trying to tell him but he didn't listen, he tries to reunite N.W.A. without Jerry being involved which I think is pretty cool, he reconciles with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but find's out he has HIV/AIDS dying shortly after he's diagnosed causing the group to grieve, but people will always remember him, finally Dr. Dre leaves Death Row Records because Suge Knight wasn't fair to him and starts his own label Aftermath which becomes very successful. The music for the movie was perfect, what wasn't was they never explained what happened to Jerry Heller after he was fired by Eazy-E. N.W.A. led a movement of modern day rap to let it be what it is, N.W.A. wasn't afraid to have changes in music which is what's great about the group."

The director shows the struggles not only of the rappers themselves but also the struggles their families had to go through to try to make it in racist America. There was never a boring part in this movie because it's about black people having a dream and pursing that dream. The movie is totally unpredictable and if watch it a million times. There's love scenes, dramatic scenes, this movie has everything you would want to see about a black person growing up in the streets of Compton trying to make it out. The beginning scene when they were in the trap house shows you that not everybody that becomes successful had a great life, and the scene where they were being harassed by the police shows the fight in to make it because ice Cube made a song to diss the police. The whole time throughout the movie even when RECKLESS the group made it big they kept fighting. This movie shows that you don't just become successful by luck you have to put the work in then you'll get the results you want."

Would have given it 7* but knocked off a star for the flagrant rewriting of history to favour the producers (Dr.Dre, Ice Cube and Tomica) Performances are generally good (esp. Ice Cube's son) Better editing and more honest portrayal of facts would have improved the film. Btw ignore the 1* reviews - don't watch a film about gangsta rap if it offends you so much!!"
"roman_meals","6","2","25","6 November 2015"," Inaccurate
","I was disappointed at the movie because the dress and speech of the place and time was not accurately portrayed. The people in Compton and South Central have a have melodious, funky way speaking (which maybe be the reason they make good rappers) which is not captured by the actors. Also Easy-E had a funny,unique way was speaking which was not depicted in the film. The style of dress in the late 80's was not baggy. Wearing a raiders jacket is not enough. Look at pictures or films from the 1980s gangs and people in general you'll see that the fashion is different. Much of the film took place inside closed rooms with the actors cursing at each other. It would have been better if they had the actors were doing stuff out in the street and showing the audience the streets of Compton. Also, a large percentage of people in compton are Latinos. Yeah, Dre does wear Cholo Nikes. But they could have included some cholo characters or hot latinas. Also, the movie does not explore the contrast between the on stage and off stage personas of NWA. Were they really Hudlums? or were NWA just rapping about the things they saw around them? The movie also dragged on too long. Oh, That being said, the film has some good party scenes and the cinematography, sound, special effects are pretty good."

Even though I didn't grew up listen to NWA back then like I do now. when I saw the movie they basically got beat up because they were black. Like one time during the movie the cops had ice cube pinned against the car and his mom was trying to figure out what was going on and his mom said that's my son and ice cube told the police not to talk to his mom like that. Also in the movie I feel like the whole group had their own set of problem especially Dr. Dre because he was upset when the mother of his child left him and took their child with her then his brother died to then after that they were trying to become friends again but before they fell out the all went their own separate ways then Eazy E was working when he passed out then he woke up in the hospital the doctor came back and told him that he has aids then in died in 1995 from aids I feel like if Eazy E was still alive then group would still be together and performing songs together and make way more money like they were when he was still alive."

"lesleyharris30","8","2","26","18 March 2016"," Engaging Story and Performances make this a Winner,
","Straigh Outta Compton is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast. This true story is very well told, the writing and directing is very impressive. At first i thought this was only going to be enjoyable for fans of these rappers, however it really is an interesting two and a half hours that will have your eyes peeled as you learn about a piece of history that is widely unknown by people outside of their fandom, it's great to have movies like this to make people aware of the struggles faced by both music artists and African Americans at this time. However, I thought the final half of the movie fell flat, and is the main reason I am giving it an eight instead of a nine, the story begins to drag on and becomes a lot less compelling than it was at the beginning, I found it focused on Eazy-É too much when I found myself more interested in seeing what Ice Cube or Dr. Dre were up to. Besides that, there is no denying that the cast is phenomenal, a group of widely unknown actors manage to portray these real life men to perfection, conveying their hardship very effectively, O'Shea Jackson Jr. shines as his real life father Ice Cube, his characterisation is perfect and is the highlight of the film for me, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell also deliver, and Paul Giamatti continues to prove his versatility as the NWA's manager Jerry Heller. Filled with stunning acting and and an engaging, interesting story, Straight Outta Compton may stumble towards the end but it is still definitely worth the watch, especially if you're looking for a good drama or biography film. <br/><br/>A rap group cause massive fandom as well as huge controversy across Los Angeles after they debut with their music about growing up in Compton. <br/><br/>Best Performance: O'Shea Jackson Jr."

It wasn't like these men grew up being taught to hate but, instead there situation was what led them to rise up and start something real. This group came up during one of the worst/best times in American history. This movie was an adaptation of a story that seems almost too unbelievable to tell. I never started listening to rap music to gain street cred or to consider myself ""hood"" or ""gangster"" I listened to it because I appreciate honesty and art and no matter where it comes from. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see this adaptation of N.W.A."

The movie is not for all ages as it has obscene and vulgar language but what do you expect from rapper's background the movie is all and all a great movie which lives up-to it's expectation.

"MUFCOK","9","2","26","8 March 2016"," A beautifully crafted movie, with clear storytelling, solid acting and an unmatchable soundtrack.
","There are a ridiculous amount of 1/10 reviews for this movie. To rate a movie 1 star it must be completely horrific, with almost all aspects of the movie being poor, no redeeming positive features and an insult to the viewers. How this movie has received ratings that low, is mind- boggling. It is not a bad movie, it may not be to everyone's taste, people may have expected more, they may be disappointed with many aspects, but it simply isn't a 1/10 rated movie. I cannot comprehend how so many reviewers gave it this score.<br/><br/>I'm a hip hop fan, the 90's – Early 2000's are the golden years for me. N.W.A were just before my time and I have never really had a solid interest in them – I knew of the members and was aware of their troubles with society and the American Government, but not to any real extent. Dr Dre and Ice Cube had huge hands on involvement in the production of Straight Outta Compton and their fingerprints show quite clearly. Much of the focus and heroism is focused around their two characters, which was to be expected in my opinion. Controversial story lines regarding Dr Dre were kept out which isn't surprising. It could have been seen as brave for it to have been included but you can hardly have any real shock that these scenarios weren't added into to the movie. Straight Outta Compton has a real epic movie feel about it, it's a huge production. It's vibrant and beautifully shot, the use of the music scenes is done to perfection, whether it's the studio sessions or the portrayal of the concerts. No expense is spared and this aspect of the movie cannot be faulted in the slightest. <br/><br/>Casting was solid, with a good balance of 'lookalikes' and acting quality. Ice Cubes son, who played his father in this movie did a very good job; especially when you consider it was his acting debut. It was a risk to use him in a film of this size but it definitely paid off which was nice to see. All other lead actors did a solid job, although sometimes the emotional scenes felt uncomfortable and unconvincing which was disappointing. <br/><br/>As you would expect the soundtrack was incredible! It's a shame that I didn't view this movie in the cinema to get the full experience. The concert scenes are especially great with many of their best known tracks being redone. Some other tracks from that era get cameos, such as Tupac plus Dre & Snoop tracks – offering some more nostalgic affection.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Eazy-E has been met with a lot of criticism from fans; people believe they exposed him as being too soft and the only band member who was ever in the wrong. As I previously said, my prior knowledge of N.W.A was minimal so I couldn't make any comparisons off of my own opinion of him as I didn't really have one! Eazy-E obviously wasn't around to tell his side of the story and we are forced to hear it from Dre and Ice Cube, whether that is extremely biased or fair, I have no idea.<br/><br/>It's a long film with a run time of over 2 and a half hours but the pacing is spot on and I didn't find it dragging whatsoever. It starts off at a blistering pace; it then slows down to introduce the band members one by one. There are parts which I felt were rushed and didn't get the attention/screen time they deserved but since watching this movie I have read that it had an initial run time of 3 and a half hours. It was required to be cut down significantly, over an hour of footage was removed which could explain why some scenes felt rushed and cut short. It has a real hood feel to it, set over the late 80's – early 90's, sets and styles are perfect to this time and you feel transported to this era effortlessly.<br/><br/>Also, people overly complaining about the final scenes when the credits role are embarrassing themselves. Criticising Dre for advertising his Beats headphones and describing the whole movie as 'an advertising campaign'? The credit scene was expertly done in my opinion, it shows a time reel of old clips and photos, followed by up to date clips showing us what the band members do in the current day. This includes Ice Cubes acting, Dr Dre's production and business ventures and it is ended with a fitting tribute to Eazy E. People simply love to complain about absolutely everything, picking holes in whatever they can.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie, a biopic of 5 young black males rising up in an era of racism, police brutality and society's general unacceptance of aggressive, gangster hip-hop music. It's of course glorified, and negative aspects are left out of the movie in order to create a more rags to riches, underdog story, making the viewer see these men more positively. But it is a very, very well made movie which is getting far too much stick from 100's of reviewers on the internet. The marketing campaign was huge and it was lapped up in the masses by a worldwide fan base. For example, my girlfriend watched this movie with me, she has next to no interest in 'old school hip-hop', yet she thoroughly enjoyed Straight Outta Compton appreciating the film for its fantastic features.<br/><br/>9/10"

A line from Moneyball comes to mind: ""The first one through the wall always gets bloodied"", and these guys were the right guys in the right place and right time to do it. The movie is a worthy testament to their accomplishments. There's a lot to fit in when telling their story, and I felt the script writers didn't want to be accused of pulling punches. Any missteps in that regard are attributable to the constrictions of the movie format itself. The direction is top notch. The acting is uniformly great across the board, and the actors look and sound a lot like the people they were playing (O'shea Jackson Jr is the spitting image of his dad!). Also, the cinematographer captured LA's hazy orange green perma-dawn halogen glow and the blue heaven brilliance of its hallowed hillsides nicely. The liberal use of NWA's catalogue along with other seminal tunes of the era keeps the soundtrack fresh. If you like stories about paths other than hoof beaten ones to the American Dream, check it out."

","My limited knowledge about hip-hop (or whatever it's currently called) is limited to the occasional collaborations of rap/metal implemented during the '80s and '90s by groups such as Aerosmith/Run D.M.C., Beastie Boys/Slayer and Anthrax/Public Enemy. Leaving that aside, I occasionally used to watch some minutes of Yo! MTV Raps!, but it has never been a musical genre I'm particularly interested in. So, I don't pretend to evaluate the veracity of Straight Outta Compton as a musical biopic, and I won't describe it on the basis of my personal tastes or any nostalgia. I will simply say I found it an exceptional movie which precisely captures the contagious energy of a new musical style whose influence would go much farther than anyone had expected... including its fans and haters. The structure of Straight Outta Compton follows the standard of any ""road to fame"" tale, with its obligatory scales on Triumph, Betrayal, Tragedy and Redemption. But the story isn't as important as the History (with capital letter)... the portrait of a moment in time when the seeds of a turbulent future which has unfortunately not changed very much were sowed. That's why I found it fascinating to witness the key points of this social/cultural revolution, accompanied by dynamic music, solid performances and F. Gary Gray's brilliant direction, whose deceptive simplicity hides an admirable attention to the details in the recreation of facts which still resound nowadays, proving that, like critic Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr once said, ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"": rap and hip-hop dominate popular music; but the racial tensions in the United States remain in the same degree as when they inspired Ice Cube to write his most famous song. One of the things I liked the most about Straight Outta Compton is the fact that it dedicates the same care to the sequences in concert of N.W.A. and the racial clashes between policemen and youngsters in the black neighborhoods of Los Ángeles. Actors O. Shea Jackson Jr. (who plays Ice Cube, his father in the real life), Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., Aldis Hodge and R. Marcos Taylor make a perfect work in their roles, bringing hypnotic and absolutely credible performances. In conclusion, I'm not going to say that I will start listening to rap music after having watched Straight Outta Compton; however, I enjoyed the experience very much in each one of its aspects: didactic, visceral, narrative and musical."
"tomgillespie2002","8","2","26","10 February 2016"," Pulses with anger and energy
","N.W.A.'s seminal 1988 hit F**k tha Police should now be, as well as a great song, a window into a darker, more brutal past that we can now look back at on in disbelief. Like Billie Holiday's haunting Strange Fruit and Bob Marley's Buffalo Soldier, the record paints an uncomfortable picture of the treatment of black people, specifically, in N.W.A.'s case, the willingness of police officers to beat on any young black teenager that happened to be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sadly, with almost daily reports of police brutality still occurring in America, F**k tha Police is just as relevant as ever, and F. Gary Gray's Straight Outta Compton - the story of N.W.A. - pulses with the same anger and energy.<br/><br/>Even though it runs at just shy of three hours, Straight Outta Compton is forced to cram in a lot of incident from the ten-year period it covers, but still maintains its attention to detail throughout. Beginning in a Compton brimming with racial and gang tension, a young Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins), O'Shea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson (played by Cube's real-life song, O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Antoine ""DJ Yella"" Carraby (Neil Brown Jr.) bring the house down with a performance of Gangsta Gangsta, much to the dislike of the club owner who disapproves of their aggressive style and confrontational lyrics. Seeking money to record, Dre turns to gang members Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) and Lorenzo ""MC Ren"" Patterson (Aldis Hodge) for a cash injection, and following the release of hit Boyz-N-The-Hood, the N****z With Attitude are approached by manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti).<br/><br/>What follows is the familiar biopic formula frothing at the brim with enough in-fighting, doomed business relationships, personal conflict and artistic milestones to fill twenty stand-alone documentaries. But Gray infuses the film with such ferocity and authenticity that its easy to forgive the films misgivings and be utterly enthralled by almost every scene. The live performances especially - and there are many - are utterly thrilling. Bolstered by the sheer raw brilliance of N.W.A.'s music and a terrific ensemble who all share an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts (obviously in Jackson Jr.'s case), the film truly comes alive in these moments, whether it be in the concert hall or the recording studio. When the group defy Detroit police with a literal middle finger and belt out the song they were warned not to play, you feel like standing up and chanting with the crowd as the police swarm the stage.<br/><br/>The first half of Straight Outta Compton is the best, as the gang rise to fame and speak out against police brutality (the beating of Rodney King being the breaking point). Darkness looms and is teased with the presence of ex-con-turned-producer Suge Knight (played a terrifying R. Marcos Taylor) and Cube's increasing unease with Eazy E's blossoming business relationship with Heller. As Knight lays seeds of doubt in Dre's mind, everyone apart from Eazy seems to be getting screwed out of their money. The film strides along with swagger and attitude, with highlights including Eazy's crack deal gone slight awry in the opening scene and a one-shot tour of the band's hotel room as armed strangers come a-knocking.<br/><br/>The film then gives way to some slightly overwrought sentiment and a who's who of the 90's West Coast rappers. Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and 2Pac (Marcc Rose) show up for no reason whatsoever, and Eazy begins his rapid descent to an early death of AIDS in some not-so-subtle scenes depicting the deterioration of his health . A end credits montage seemingly celebrating the wealth of Dre and Cube as well reminding us of some of the not-so-great things they've done over the years (Dre was responsible for 50 Cent after all) also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. These things stop it from being great, but this is still one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's best to let yourself get swept up in 90's nostalgia, savour the fantastic music (unless you're a rap Nazi), and watch the world only now seen in fuzzy music videos feel alive once again."

","A vicious blend of kinetic direction, smart writing, compelling performances, energetic camera-work & groovy soundtrack, Straight Outta Compton is one of the finest biopics to surface on screen this year that's captivating from its opening moments, is sprinkled with clever wit & offers an intriguing sketch of one of the most influential groups in hip-hop music history, and is amongst the most hip & entertaining movies of 2015.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise & fall of the hip-hop group N.W.A which emerged from the violent streets of Compton, California in Los Angeles during the mid-1980s and ultimately went on to bring gangsta rap subgenre into mainstream music. The plot focuses on three of its founding members namely Eazy-E, Ice Cube & Dr. Dre, the numerous controversies the explicit lyrics of their songs invited, and its decline due to financial disputes within the gang.<br/><br/>Directed by F. Gary Gray, this biographical drama features a deftly structured story that's smoothly narrated & swiftly paced and is totally devoid of any dull moments. Driven by its electrifying tracks, the whole ambiance of the picture is highly charged & aggressive in tone and manages to make its voice heard loud & clear without going in your face. The gang's critical stance against the police is relevant even today and the reflection of the volatile society it emerged from is evident in their songs but there's more to this flick.<br/><br/>Straight Outta Compton does succeed in offering an in-depth glimpse into what N.W.A was trying to express with their explicit, provocative music but it also doesn't shy away from illustrating the flaws of its own members, albeit not as extensively. The background research is carried out in exhaustive detail but a few artistic license is taken here or there to enhance its drama which do work out in its favour in the end. Another positive sign about its quality is that its story is told in such an engaging manner that its 147 minutes of runtime simply flies by.<br/><br/>Cinematography exhibits dynamic use of camera that remains in sync with what's unfolding on the screen for it is chaotic when things are on the verge of explosion & easygoing when dealing with calm moments. Every scene accompanied by N.W.A songs is better than the ones without it and the tracks are arranged in a fitting order plus greatly assist in enhancing the whole experience & keeping its potent vibe alive. Editing keeps the plot closely-knitted for the most part & paces it amazingly well but it does slow down near the end where it appears as if having spent all its energy.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Straight Outta Compton features a relatively fresh ensemble in Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell & Paul Giammati, with all of them chipping in with very convincing work in their given roles. Whether it's the chemistry these guys have with each other or the sequences that require them to prove their mettle individually, Hawkins, Jackson & Mitchell are able to keep the audience's gaze firmly fixed on them and render their real-life figures with sublime effectiveness while Giammati provides reliable support as Jerry Heller, the manager of N.W.A.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Straight Outta Compton is a delightful surprise for it's far better than expected and is told with such passion, confidence & panache that it's difficult to not be swept by its strong tide. The script is an absolute gem for it brims with elements that scream N.W.A from first frame to the last, wisely handles the positive & negative escapades of the group, and puts just about enough meat on its characters' arcs. Highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly rewarding, Straight Outta Compton is an instant classic that's destined to garner a cult following and will stay around for years to come. To summarise it all in a sentence, ""Damn, that sh*t was dope."""

","Review: As I was into Hip Hop when N.W.A. first came out, I was really looking forward to watching this movie and the fact that Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and Yella, all contributed there services to this movie, it really did make this a no nonsense, straight from there mouth, enjoyable movie. It certainly brought back some memories! I wasn't really into the whole LA scene until I saw Colors, which really opened my eyes to the gang problems over there. When I first heard ""Straight Outta Compton"", mixed with Dre's beats, I was completely sold and I bought my LA Raiders hat, along with there singles and albums. This lengthy movie gives a step by step rise to fame of N.W.A. and how there popularity affected each member. MC Ren decided to stick by Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright's side, during his time with music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) but after releasing a couple of albums, Dr. Dre went with Suge Knight to create Death Row and Ice Cube started his single rapping career with Bryan Turner at Priority records, due to money and contract problems. Death Row records became an instant success with rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Doggy Dogg on board and Ice Cube's debut album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted is a huge success. To cut a long story short, they both have problems whilst pursuing there career in music and the roads that they all had chosen, took away the enjoyment that they first felt when they started out in the music business. When Eazy E finds out that Jerry Heller has been embezzling money through the group, he decides to cut all ties with the him and he approaches Ice Cube and Dr. Dre to work on new material but Eazy collapses during a recording session and is taken straight to the hospital, were he is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. He finally dies on the 26th of March, 1995 and a year later, Dre cuts all ties with Death Row records because he doesn't like the way that Suge Knight runs the company. To make sure that Suge Knights evil ways doesn't put Dre's life in danger, he gives him full control of all there previous material, which basically leaves Dre with no power of his hit records. Meanwhile, Ice Cube's career is a huge success and he has also entered the movie world with hit films like Boyz 'N Tha Hood and Friday. Dre's new label, Aftermath, sees new artist Eminem and 50 Cent, become a international success along with his Beats franchise, which is eventually sold to Apple for a huge $3 Billion. To see them come together for this project, proves that they have put there previous ""Beef"" behind them and it's great to see that they have dedicated this movie to Eazy E, who really was the root to there success. Anyway, the performances were top class from the young N.W.A. cast and the director touched on some delicate matters involving the police, the L.A. Riots and the violence involving Suge Knight. For the people who didn't follow the group back in the early 90's, this movie must be an eye opener but I personally knew about a lot of the material in this movie after following them for so many years. That's not to say that this detailed film wasn't put together well and I appreciate the fact that the director is celebrating such a talented group that brought L.A. Hip Hop to the forefront, so I hope that it gets all of the recognition that it deserves when it comes to Oscar time. Enjoyable! <br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, 46, whose first movie was Murder Was The Case, back in 1995, starring Snoop Dog, so it's ironic this his last movie would be about N.W.A. He also directed Friday in 1995 and Set It Off, the Negotiator, a Man Apart, the Italian Job remake, Be Cool and Law Abiding Citizen. He doesn't seem to shy away from the big projects and he's tipped to be directing the next Fast & Furious, which they haven't started to work on yet. I would like to see him celebrate other Hip Hop artists, who made the movement special during the 80's and 90's, because he done a great job with this film. It didn't seem like it was over 2 hours long because he covered so many different elements of the group, which made it interesting and a joy throughout.<br/><br/>Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $200million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their Biography, Drama, Music movies starring O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., Aldis Hodge, Paul Giamatti, Marlon Yates Jr., and R. Marcos Taylor. 7/10"

","Hello there! I am coming to you live straight outta Punton! Yes, there will be several straight corny puns in my movie review of the music biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"", but please don't leave and call the pun police! Director F. Gary Gary's movie tells the tale of the late 80's gangsta rap music group N.W.A.- their rise to stardom, and the turbulence that tore the group apart. The group's infamous artists Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E are the main premise of the movie. Gary's direction was not ""outta this world"" but it was very commendable on how he provided a integral perspective of the group's history, and its biographical tunes (I mean, tones) on Dre, Cube, and Eazy. The ensemble acting from young thespians O'Shea Jackson as Cube, Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E was sweet music to my ears; well, maybe not ""sweet"" but definitely hardcore effective. Moreover, Paul Giamatti was his usual brilliant self as group manager Jerry Heller; and the hell with all of you who think Giamatti is too loud! I guess that angry rap is getting to me. Anyways, I think it's time to ""rap"" this review up, before you get straight outta reading this (if you haven't already). Just keeping it straight! Outta here! **** Good"
"naysbaghai","7","2","26","12 December 2015"," A hardcore and truthful story
","My fascination with rap artists like NWA has been reignited for good by the highly anticipated Straight Outta Compton, which promised to deliver a hardcore and truthful story of one of the most well-known rap groups of all time. My expectations generated by the trailer were not let down, with F. Gary Gray's memorable biopic hitting on all the elements, including the iconic rap numbers, police brutality, and the personal lives of the rappers.<br/><br/>The principal strength of Straight Outta Compton is its sporadic portrayal of scenes that add to the historicity of the film. The rapping scenes are cool and drive the energetic nature of the film, forcing you to bob your head to the beat, or in my case, rap along to the lyrics. We are subtly reminded of the notion that ""our art is a reflection of our reality"", and fortunately, the message doesn't wear out its welcome.<br/><br/>The scenes in which the police arrest the rappers for no good reason are portrayed in a grizzly and spine-chilling fashion, especially if you consider how police brutality continues to stain American society. However, in a similar fashion, one of the most memorable scenes for me personally, is when Ice Cube demolishes Bryan's office, enraged that he has not been paid his money, yet despite this barbaric act, Bryan still operates as Cube's manager. Holding my breath as the scene unfolded, I was jolted not only by the foreshadowing of Jerry Heller's deviousness, but how the unscrupulous nature of the music distribution/copyright industry is an alarming reality. Speaking of Ice Cube, the decision to cast O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his own father was a decision that paid off immensely, as the actor brings an enormous amount of veracity to his character you don't often find in cinema. <br/><br/>While the story and ideas of Straight Outta Compton are interesting, there a few flaws hidden in the script's nooks and crannies. In addition to the worrisome runtime (2 hours 30 minutes), the engagement starts to dwindle during the more monotonous conversations. I also feel like the whole subplot of Eazy-E dying of HIV received too much attention, with its sentimental tonality betraying the passion that is present in the first half. Although the editing makes you feel like a participant in the conversations, the overall cut of the film feels like a tender, well cooked rack of lamb that still has a bit of fat that could have been trimmed off. While the filmmakers' difficulty in achieving a steady pace is noticeable, the themes, characterisation and historical weight more than compensate for that, cementing its reputation as one of the best rap films history has seen so far."

","If you cannot relate to the culture of what hip hop meant to that era, then you really shouldn't be posting a review or opinion of any sort on here. F. Gary Gray's masterpiece fails to disappoint those of you that can understand the angst of what hip-hop represented back then and still to this very day, right now. <br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is a story of four young men that floated on beats rhythm and rhymes to find their way up on out of the ""crabs in a barrel"" neighborhood. Plus the price they paid along the way to fame. Truly an enjoyable story that seems too good to be true because it actually was.<br/><br/>See it, embrace the story and the characters, you will not be disappointed."

","This is an extremely well done film that accurately depicts the the life of the members of the N.W.A. I am really unsure as to what all these people degrading the film and calling it 'pretentious' and other things were expecting? Perhaps if they had to look into the history of this internationally loved rap super- group, and the circumstances in which they were born into, they might see that what they were able to accomplish in such a short time together as a group really was incredible, and this film more than does it justice. I thought in particular O'Shea Jackson Jr's portrayal of his father Ice Cube was phenomenal and Jason Mitchell's performance as Eazy-E was exceptional also."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","2","26","16 October 2015"," When Gray focuses on greed and race, Straight Outta Compton becomes a classy addition to the genre
","F. Gary Gray proves himself worthy of standing above most musical biopic directors with his undeniable Passionate, occasionally stirring and throughly engaging Straight Outta Compton. The film studies the stratospheric rise of N.W.A, a group whose names I'd heard of but whose cultural impact remained elusive to me. Gray, who I'd only ever heard of as the director of stoner comedy Friday, proves himself a directorial force to be reckoned with in his film which boasts at least four or five hugely powerful scenes. Scenes of police racism are among the scenes best, depicted with such flagrant injustice that I wanted to leap from my seat and rail against them. In one particularly powerful scene, a black police officer leads his white colleagues in demeaning NWA for doing nothing but standing on the sidewalk. For some reason, hearing racial slurs come from a man who should be your brother makes them so much more hurtful.<br/><br/>Gray gathers a stellar and relatively novice cast for his film. Honourable mention should go to the huge menacing R. Marcos Taylor as Suge Knight, who manages to win over the audience as a gentle giant before revealing his hulking bullying nature. Paul Giamatti was incredible in Love & Mercy, but I think he's just as good if not better here - those guttural Giamatti Yells fit in beautifully during police harassment scenes and he has one ""Oscar scene"" at the very end of the film, where despite all of our knowledge, he almost convinces us of how he sees himself. <br/><br/>Biggest props goes to Jason Mitchell, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Corey Hawkins as the three main NWA guys. Mitchell is incredible as Easy-E (with an incredible Oscar scene when he learns of his AIDS diagnosis), Jackson a near-perfect embodiment of his famous father (especially as the film ages him throughout) but my favourite performance of all was Hawkins as Dr. Dre. I know that Dre in particular was saint-ified during the making of the film, with many of his less savoury traits dialed back or erased altogether, but looking at Hawkins' performance alone I was blown away. Hawkins' carries grief, mirth and furious reckoning with equal class and poise, making him the character I most enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>The movie has no lack of enjoyable standalone scenes, but sometimes I felt a bit stretched thin - the Rodney King subplot in particular felt very shoehorned into the story. Easy-E's sex life is really only ever hinted at and therefore his AIDS diagnosis comes not surprisingly but undeveloped. Dre's romance felt much the same. I also never felt passionately invested in the musical side of the story - but perhaps that's just because I can't stand the stuff. Its when Gray and his screenwriters focus on money, greed and race that the film becomes something very special. I certainly know enough about film to recognise Gray's work as a classy addition to the genre, certainly above more dull fare like Walk the Line.<br/><br/>Twist my arm for my favourite scene though and I'd change my mind every few minutes. Its the scene where Dre confronts Suge's posse in the recording studio. No, wait, its the scene where they sing ""Fuck Tha Police"" in rebellion against censorship. No, its the TV interview where Cube shreds the ambitious reporter. No, wait, its Cube smashing up Bryan Turner's office! Argh!"
"billygoat1071","8","2","26","12 October 2015"," Cultural Impact of N.W.A.
","Straight Outta Compton is a biopic about one of the most influential hip hop groups and also a remarkable history about how their music became the voice of how unfair young African-American people are being treated. When it centers how this group impacts the music industry and the American culture, it's all downright interesting. But when the story shifts to a more personal outlook, the movie somewhat struggles juggling these other stories, which sometimes get lost from what is supposed to be the center. But it still pictures this story compellingly which alone made it intriguing to watch.<br/><br/>The movie opens exploring their ordinary lives until it leads to forming the group they are now known for; from their rap music, they could represent their home, their lifestyle and also the awareness of law enforcement's oppression towards arresting young black men, which results with an outrage from the authority, while at the same time more people defending them and their music; with a studio wanting to make them bigger. The impact of their music is the strongest part to look around in this story, but when things get personal, it takes things to a lot of different directions, sometimes away from the center to talk more about the business in this industry and their other issues. These interconnected subplots can be interesting, except it's less easy to concentrate and also robs the supposed momentum.<br/><br/>It's still well put together when you're just trying to comprehend the time it recreated. There's no apparent good guys or bad guys, we're basically seeing shades of gray within these people; even the ones who are supposed to be antagonized are given some sympathy (except for the police, probably.) Either way, there's real engaging humanity being presented in this biopic. The direction makes it look stunning to watch. Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins and O'Shea Jackson Jr. did a well job as the three leading roles, though Mitchell as Eazy-E is the real standout among them.<br/><br/>Maybe the only major disappointment can be mentioned is the ending; sure it's meant to be emotional, but it's rather rushes, even to how it was setup, which failed to contemplate on the situation, plus being sneaked in with some more subplots. It would have been more powerful, but either way, Straight Outta Compton is a pretty good biopic, whatever it covers or not. Again, the influence of the group is the remarkable feat of the entirety; while the personal stuff hints some intrigue, it could have given a consistent rhythm to handle these stories all at once. Though it's still not all bad, because again, it's put with great effort into it."
"craig-ferndale","7","2","26","4 October 2015"," I would have give this a higher rating but ...
","...I think it's a fair rating nonetheless. Nostalgia and emotion might have contributed to this rating, but then again, I have not over-analyzed my other ratings to determine if any emotion was at play there so... yeah ... my rating remains as is. <br/><br/>There were parts of the movie (it's loooong) where I noticed the acting and was dragged out of their world into the real world for a minute or so. To be fair, this only happened some time over the hour mark when my brain's ADHD kicked in while sitting on the same spot in an environment where I have to be on my best behavior (the theater).<br/><br/>The cast were on point, for the most part, I did however judge the one actor to a stricter set of criteria than the others as I was a bit nit picky over the portrayal of the one artist who filled the void of older brother as I was growing up in a heavily censored environment without any father figure or older brother to mentor me and/or help me deal with my early childhood anger issues.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed in that the character development of that said artist was very limited and felt rushed over in order to focus on the other two characters instead. Without the context or familiarity or celebrity of that artist, the lack of character development would have left huge gaping holes in the plot. On the other side, I do however think that Jason Mitchell did an exceptional job. I was completely immersed in his world whenever he appeared on screen. The same goes for Corey Hawkins.<br/><br/>In hindsight, parts of the drama seemed a bit after school special-ish, but I decided to attribute that to difficulty of nailing drama without it coming across as even the tiniest bit cheesy in this judgmental age of instant gratification.<br/><br/>Overall, it was extremely enjoyable and nostalgic and quite an achievement given that at least 3 of the main characters have led such interesting lives to cover even a fraction of it in just over 2 hours and retain context is a bit ambitious."

"manansalareivyn","8","2","26","15 September 2015"," A great story of art and music
","Straight Outta Compton is best throwback for all the old schools out there. Of course, we all know who is in the Group of NWA. It's all about art, music, and their story on how the group NWA made progress into making their voices be heard. This movie is interesting not only the story, but also because of the elements in it. Recommended for all the people out there.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie consists of the story of NWA reaching success. there are some things that lack information in the movie. The focus is in Dr. Dre, Eazy E, and Ice Cube. Some information about Dj Yella and MC Ren is not shown. But even if some focuses are on Dr. Dre, Eazy E, and Ice Cube, Dj Yella and MC Ren is not removed from the picture. They are always together, through tough and sad times. We can understand through their music on how they fight everyday struggles of police brutality, struggles in their personal life, how they express what they feel, violence in their surroundings, and how to speak and spread the things that is happening in reality. It started from creating the group, how the group breaks, and how the group reunites. We can relate in this movie if we experience the same.<br/><br/>Second, is the portrayal of characters. The actors did a great job on how they portray their roles. Even if the some actors will just appear in less than 30 seconds, they still did great. This goes for Tupac and Snoop Dogg. Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's portrayal was great. You can easily determine who is who on how they speak, talk, walk, act and their attitudes. It is also because we know how they act in real life and they perfectly impersonated each and every one.<br/><br/>Third, is the environment. They provided the same setting on how people live in these places in reality. The time is mostly at night. The concert grounds, houses, recording areas, and even the party place is accurate. It Started from a chaotic place, which soon turns into a peaceful place. The camera angles are also great. It captures the great scenes and characters.<br/><br/>And the fourth is the message. The message in this movie is how we can reach success even if we are in our hard times. We stay together because we can't be happy when one of our family leaves. We keep pushing forward, no matter the situation is. We fight our own rights as human beings and have our own way of expressing in through music and words. We should know what is happening in our surroundings, and how to make a change for the better.<br/><br/>There are some things that are missing in the movie. The movie focuses on the good side of the characters. But overall, It was a great movie.<br/><br/>note: I don't know why some stories are not shown in the movie and I don't know some of it. Maybe it's inapropriate."

","So Dr. Dre, Ice cube and easy E's- wife decided to make a movie about their past named and is directed by F.Gary Gray. It's a biopic about N.W.A. which stands for Niggaz with attitude. Overall I loved the movie, especially the first half. I thought the first half was more interesting than the second half. Not only because I love the origin of the group but also because of the directing. The casting was great; I felt that they had a good representation of the rappers that they play. What I love is that Ice cube son is acting as his dad. The film is focused on the main 3 characters: Dr.Dre, Ice cube and EaZy-E. I really loved the first half of the movie. It showed the problems they faced on the streets, the passion they have for music. You start to understand where their anger and frustrations come from. The influence they had on the music industry was huge. But not only to the music industry but also to the media and this movie does a good job by portraying that. Some people didn't want to accept ""rap"" as music. People lost their mind and were hating on them. N.W.A. just didn't care about it and shared their story/life experiences through rap music. The scenes with the police violence were amazing.They showed us how cops treated black people in some neighborhoods. The abuse of their power and the hate that N.W.A. had against the cops that they even made a song ""F the police"". The Detroit scene for me was the best scene of the movie, I just wanted to sing with them. The group fell apart. First Ice cube left for financial reasons and later on Dr. Dre left. In the movie you can see each member go their separate way. Cube going solo and Dre joining Death Row Records. All 3 of them still had problems. Cube was destroying that office with a baseball bat so they would pay him. Dr. Dre dealing with the problems of Death Row Records. And Eazy-e who finally found out that Jerry was stealing from him and fired him. I even heard of an Ice cube interview that cube didn't knew about his before they started shooting the movie. And let's not forget the great dissing songs that they made. The scene where N.W.A were listening to Ice cube's song about N.W.A. was just hilarious. I'm going to be honest I started listening to the N.W.A songs as soon as the movie ended.<br/><br/>Off course some parts were left out to make them look better. I honestly understand why they did that because let's face it: they are the guys who are producing it."
"Oberrated","9","2","27","21 April 2016"," Important
","Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie in my opinion. N.W.A represented life as it happened in Compton but not only there, what is happening in life all over a nation. They represented the people who did not have a voice during the time of their come up. This film showed every important aspect as to why N.W.A. existed and how much talent these men really had/have. It was great to see the early stages of some of the most notable songs and sounds in hip-hop that is commonplace in many households. For N.W.A. it was more than just making music and getting popular. It was about putting music out that had purpose, their music meant something, meant something for someone. Gave mistreated individuals a voice. Whether you agree or disagree, that is obviously your choice but I can at least tell you; You will be the minority in this case."

","Let me begin by saying that I am a young white female. This movie was not meant to relate to me and in most ways it does not. However, I still found it extremely entertaining. I, like most people can relate to an underdog story. <br/><br/>I sat on the edge of my seat when there was any tension between cops or rival gangs. I listened to the lyrics and laughed as the rappers slung witty insults at each other. I felt for the characters and found myself rooting for them. I found myself wanting them to be successful and thinking ""Yeah! F*** the police"". This movie was able to draw even me (being as sheltered as I am) into situations I've never seen, in a time before I was born. <br/><br/>As I watched the movie I found myself wanting to know more about the people whom this movie was based on. I spent more than an hour on Wikipedia and Google. I read biographies and watched interviews. I found a lot of truth behind the movie which leads me to believe much of it is based in reality and taken from several points of view. This is something I look for when watching movies based on actual events. I want to know I watching history and not just dramatizations. <br/><br/>The hardest part about watching this movie was bearing witness to the police brutality these young men faced. For a moment I thought ""But, it must be different now."" Then I was instantly hit with the reality that police brutality (especially based on race) is ever present in many communities. My hope is that people watch those scenes and realize this is still happening. The fight for racial equality is not over."
"JackRice100","9","2","30","1 September 2015"," The Story of N.W.A. on a Grand Scale.
","Straight Outta Compton follows a group of young adults trying to put their hometown Compton on the map through there love of the music gangster rap. <br/><br/>I wanted to see this film from the moment I saw the trailer on my Facebook news feed back in February. I was very excited to see it as I am a life long hip hop fan. This biopic was overall very good. To start this film is not just about N.W.A. you see their love for Rap and Hip Hop, and a true inspirational story filled with gangsters, drugs, money, greed, manipulation and police brutality.. <br/><br/>Firstly the acting was top notch like I think apart from some of the extras (some of the 'party girls') the acting was outstanding not only could they act but they sounded just like the real people they were playing I didn't think the people who played Snoop and Tupac LOOKED too much like the real people but they had there voices spot on! and there mannerisms down to a tee especially Keith Stanfield who played Snoop the scene where he starts rapping the opening lines to Nothing' But a 'G' Thang were brilliant. As for the main cast of N.W.A. They all looked just like young versions of the real life counterparts Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre was superb I really believed he was a young Dr Dre the same goes for the rest of the group. Jason Mitchell looked so much like him it was scary, the concert scenes when they zoomed in on him rapping I couldn't believe how much he looked like him. <br/><br/>What helped you believe the actors these iconic stars, is the script. It felt very real, for the most part. The times it didn't feel so real are the scene when Dre stood up to Suge Knight (I have my doubts that he really stood up to the infamous Suge Knight anyway, like that at least) For the most part tho it did feel very real, talk between Ice Cube and Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) about his contract, Eazy-E when he was trying to rap Boyz-N-The-Hood all felt very authentic. The crazy parties in the hotel rooms are just how you'd imagine they'd be people saying the film disrespected women or whatever I have to respectfully disagree I think that was just what it was like in the late 80s and early 90s. <br/><br/>The film looked incredible the cinematography was fantastic the shots of the Compton area and N.W.A. concerts were ace. The directed was very good too I loved the scene when Ice Cube was recording his diss track 'No Vaseline' how he cut between him recording it and Jerry, Eazy and co. were listening to it for the first time. I loved it. <br/><br/>This film is not without faults. The film showed them making Straight Outta Compton and then blowing up then splitting up and then making up. but everything that happened, to me at least, was common knowledge. Now I know to the majority of the audience that see this film wont know a few things but I felt having the likes of Dr Dre and Ice Cube working on the film its self and after seeing it obviously having a rather big say in what goes into the film why they wouldn't add things that happened that you cant find on a wikipedia page. Just little things that only Dre and Cube could of told even if it would of been a 10 second thing like a joke or a scene but something so you got something more than just what you can find out on the world wide web. (Like the guy with his pants on getting made to make a toast stuff like that that actually happened that is not common knowledge.) The whole Dr Dre beating thing I think could of been added in but really I don't think its THAT necessary I think ether way the film didn't lose anything with taking it out. They handled the ending so well with Eazy's death and them mending feuds. The fact MC Ren, DJ Yella and D.O.C went completely missing for large chucks of the film frustrated me not so much during the last half of the film but the production of Straight Outta Compton the reason I love the album so much is the fact everyone had a role to play and they didn't show that enough/at all for me, even if it was little clip like Ren on the drums would of sufficed. I don't think this could of been helped but I did think it dragged for portions of the film. this wasn't helped by me seeing one of the later showings after a busy day. <br/><br/>Overall this was a very successful Biopic with fantastic acting, directing and of course music."

","The critically acclaimed film, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an unlikely blockbuster for its ""R"" rating and timely depiction of the mean streets of Compton, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Although taking place in the mid-eighties, the clashes with the police resonate today. Chronicling the rise of N.W.A. (""niggers with attitude""), this biopic of music pioneers belongs in the company of ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", ""8 Mile"" and more recently , ""Love and Mercy"" and ""Muscle Shoals"". The seminal South L.A. hip-hop group N.W.A is the story of the creation of rap and hip-hop culture. Composing controversial lyrics, through word wizardry and brilliant poetic rhyming, N.W.A. music rages about the daily lives of young black men and the fears and violence they confront. Truthful, and not pretty, the music of N.W.A. was often censored, and considered dangerous and criminal. Read my entire review at www.unhealedwound.com"
"renuka-44","5","1","13","15 July 2017"," Worth a watch but not too accurate
","All in all, the movie isn't so bad... Especially considering how awful some biopics are. However, I don't believe the film is very accurate. Now, before you go like ""What?! the films' producers are two of the main characters, of course it's damn accurate!"" to which I'll say: That exactly is the problem..."" Besides not including a pivotal member in the formation and release of NWA's first record and pretending he never existed (I'm referring to Arabian Prince here), the movie focuses too much on Dre and Ice Cube, since they're the two members that achieved the most fame as solo artists, and Eazy E of course, since 1- He's deceased and it's out of respect for his legacy, 2- His - controversial and not really liked- widow serves as a producer for the film also. The film really takes away the importance of DJ Yella and MC Ren and minimizes their roles in NWA to focus on Dre and Ice Cube probably because it was assumed that it'll attract the audience more as to this day these are two huge names in the hip hop world whilst DJ yella and MC Ren -despite being real OGs- aren't as known to the mainstream audiences. So, overlooking the fact that history is re-written, the cast does live up o the expectation, especially Ice Cube's son: He does a wonderful job portraying his father, so does Paul GIamatti as Jerry Heller. Some scenes are a little cliché (Ice cube listening to NWA dissing him and hopping in the studio to spit ""No Vaseline"" and NAW in turn listening to it sitting in Heller's office arguing if Ice Cube knows what anti-semitism is... -,-' ) Conclusion: it's worth a watch but to get the real NWA story and beefs, it's best to do some reading from around the web."
"patomartinezfgo","6","1","13","25 June 2017"," Entertaining movie but not a great script
","I watched this movie because I wanted to know a little bit more about N.W.A and their history. After finishing the movie I can say I was pleased with the movie and had a good time while watching it but there is nothing really great about it.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good and everyone portrayed their character in a very good and realistic way. The way in which they incorporated the rap music was very good and the soundtrack is great of course.<br/><br/>I have to say that the most interesting parts of the movie are the beginning and the middle. When we can see the whole group together and we see them do all kinds of crazy sh*t. In the third act of the film, you get what happens after N.W.A gets separated and everyone goes in their own path and it wasn't really that interesting. I really wasn't that invested in the story by the third act.<br/><br/>I think that the main problem with the movie is the pacing and the story itself. The pacing is kinda off and sometimes you couldn't tell how much time had passed between different events. Also, the story does not lend itself to a very straight forward narrative. I think that they tried to cover a lot of events that happened and that led to damaging the story-line of beginning-middle-End.<br/><br/>The problem is this: The beginning is the formation and rise to fame of N.W.A. The middle is the golden years of N.W.A and the album ""Straight outta Compton"". The end should be when Ice Cube leaves N.W.A and the whole group disintegrates, but they preferred to cover the story until the death of Eazy-E, which makes the third act feel like a whole different movie.<br/><br/>Also, since the producers of this film are Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, they decided to take out a lot of events and things that they did in order to protect their status. I think it is okay to protect yourself if you are the producer, but because of that they kind of make themselves look wiser and on top of the situation when they really weren't.<br/><br/>In the end, it is an OK movie. You can watch it and have a good time with it, but do not expect anything great."

","This is a sort of biographical tale of how rappers Ice Cube, Easy E, and Dr Dre came to fame. I'd say you need to be a fan in order to really like this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with them as teens living in South Central. The part I didn't like was how they portrayed all the cops to be bullies with no cause. I seriously doubt it's like that in South Central.<br/><br/>Anyways they get popular in clubs and a music producer, Jerry, wants to sign them (but is really only after Ease E). So of course with money involved the friends grow apart and they get mixed up with thug, Sug Knight. Eventually E dies while the other 2 have even more success.<br/><br/>I thought the actors portraying the rappers really played the part. And I didn't know it was Ice Cube's son playing him until looking here. Now I know why he looked so much like the real Ice Cube.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK, better if you were one of their fans."

","I watched this (with great caution) on On-Demand. To say I was blown away, would be a huge understatement. To say this is one of the best films of 2015 doesn't do the service this film deserves.<br/><br/>""Straight Outta Compton"" is a music bi-op about the rap group N.W.A., which was formed circa 1987. That group consisted of Eazy- E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and others. The group hit profoundly with fans because of their no-holds-barred lyrics and the messages behind them. They were the first balls-to-the-wall gangsta rap group. They did not apologize for their lyrics, their songs messages, of for themselves. Their music reflected their lives--what they lived, breathed, and witnessed every day in Compton. As a 62 year-old white dude, my eyes were opened to a life I did not understand simply because I did not have to live it. Constantly harassed by policemen--even black policemen--simply because they were young and black AND pigeon-holed into every stereotypical category imaginable, they learned to fight back with their music.<br/><br/>There is quite a stink concerning the fact that the Oscars failed (again) to recognize ANY black actor for their performances. I can honestly say they certainly failed with regard to this movie. O'Shea Jackson (as Ice Cube), Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E), and Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre) ALL deserved at least nominations for supporting actor. I actually thought Jason Mitchell's performance was worthy of a Best Actor nod. Director F. Gary Gray did an absolutely incredible job in keeping the pace, the flow, and acting at a believable pace. Both the good and uglier facets of this lifestyle were examined, and Gray never shied away from anything. <br/><br/>I saw (and recommend) the unrated Director's cut of the movie, which lasts 167 minutes. This is the best movie I have seen in 2015. It's a shame it will not get the accolades it deserves. The unrated version contains constant graphic language, nudity, violence, and drug use. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

"adean81","8","1","23","8 March 2016"," Review for Straight Outta Compton
","Anyone that has listened to rap music in the last few decades has heard of the group N.W.A, but not every one knows their story and the impact they have had in the music industry. The film Straight Outta Compton shows the rise and fall of the infamous rap group. The movie starts out introducing us to each of the five members one by one, and shows us how they came to form the rap group, N.W.A. The first person introduced is one of the three main central figures, Eric Wright, a.k.a. ""Eazy E"". Wright is portrayed by actor Jason Mitchell who gives a great performance. O'Shea Jackson, jr. the real life son of ""Ice Cube"" plays his father in the movie. He does a good job not only looking like him, but also with his voice and mannerisms. The third main member is ""Dr. Dre"" played by Corey Hawkins. While he bares a similar resemblance to the real Dr. Dre, he managed to play him with a lot of compassion and drive as a person. All of these actors do a great job interacting with each other and brings a realistic feel to the movie. The other two members of the group, MC Ren and DJ Yella are given little screen time and character development, probably because they are the least known members of the group. <br/><br/>Some other notable performances are from the actor that portrays Suge Knight. Known as a threatening person, the way Knight is written in the movie comes off very looming and menacing, captured well by the actor that plays him. The audience really feels like this guy will kill anyone for anything and is ruthless. Small cameos are made by actors playing Snoop Dogg and Tupac, both of which did well with what they were given. The last main character is the manager of N.W.A, Jerry Heller, played by the talented Paul Giamatti, who gives a solid performance. Playing the caring yet manipulative manager, who claims that every thing he did was ""just a part of the business"". The character runs a fine line of being a caring person towards Eric and a sleazy business man. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie plays out like a straight drama narrative building to the formation of the group, depicting their life struggles as well as run ins with gangsters and the police. As the movie progresses it becomes more about showing the major events that occurred starting with the concert riot in Detroit. From there most of the events shown were basic media covered incidents, that is publicly known. Such as Ice Cude and Dr. Dre leaving the group and starting their solo careers. The ending of course comes with the death of rapper Eazy-E, which played out well and was very emotional. This is one of the better music biopics made, while some liberties were taken, not everything is 100% accurate and many smaller details left out, it is still a solid story narrative. <br/><br/>For the most part the pace of the film is good. The first act moves along well, while there is a bit of a stumble later in the movie but it never drags along. At a length of 147 minutes, the movie is so engaging that the time flies and next thing you know the movie ends. By the time the movie is over, you are left wanting to know more of what happened next with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. Not only is the pacing well, but the movie is shot well and has very nice cinematography, that draws you into the world that these characters live in. <br/><br/>There are several good comedic moments that help lighten the movie and allows the audience to be entertain in more than just the dramatic scenes. The movie also does not down play the way African Americans were treated by the police, and how that inspired the graphic lyrics to some of the groups most popular songs. This is a well directed, well shot and well acted biopic that deserves the recognition and acclaim it has earned. The original running time was over three hours long and could have easily been made into television miniseries. Hopefully when it is released, it will include the extra footage. Overall this is a very good movie and character study based, on true events that left a mark in popular American culture."
"estreet-eva","6","1","23","3 March 2016"," The song remains the same
","Remarkably the movie version of the rise, fall and redemption (at least of Dr. Dre) of the hyper-politicized, most radical musical artists of their time still follows a natural trajectory of fame you see in many other musical acts. Or to put it another way: ""it used to be about the music, man!"" ""NWA"" rose to prominence in the racial charged atmosphere of Los Angeles and tapped into a broad discontent about continuing disparate treatment throughout the U.S. Instead of writing metaphorical songs of protect, their lyrics directly challenged authority with blunt threats of violence. The movie, focused around founding member ""Easy-E""'s brief life and experience with the group. Interestingly that group's experience follows a seemingly natural course you would find in other musical biopics such as ""The Doors"" where the band struggles together to break through and then quickly struggles against one another once successful and then finally struggles with drugs, drink and the hard partying that comes with the lifestyle. While the story feels to have fidelity to actual events in the pre-Kurt Cobain era, apparently, much of the misogyny and actual physical violence against women surrounding the band is reduced to a cheeky line ""bye Alisha"" as Ice Cube throws a woman out of a hotel room. Much has been made rightly over Ice Cube's son's performance as his father. Corey Hawkins neither physically or in mannerism quite nails Dr. Dre and R. Marcos Taylor never quite captures the natural intimidation that Suge Knight exudes. The writing and direction keep the story moving well across a long running time and juggles multiple subplots well as we see Ice Cube and Dre branch out from the group and become huge stars of their own. The music never quite comes to the forefront and plays a less prominent part of the film than similar biopics. Those looking for musical nostalgia are better off just buy the old albums. In short, while never bringing a lot of emotional resonance, the film captures a familiar pathway for a novel-for-their-times band."
"classicsoncall","7","1","23","14 February 2016"," ""Even a great talent can crash and burn.""
","As a sixty five year old retired white male, I'm certainly not part of the targeted demographic for this movie. However since it came my way I took advantage of the opportunity because I think one can gain perspective from most anything that's new and unfamiliar. Without knowing a single thing about any of the performers depicted in the picture, I'd have to say that if one's goal for society is to improve racial harmony, you won't find a champion here. The idea that First Amendment freedom is the flip side of inciting people to violence and anarchy just isn't going to cut it with this viewer. Now granted, the portrayal of both white and black cops in the picture, if accurate, demonstrates that there are bad apples in all segments of society. The problem I have is that some proponents on both sides of the black and white divide see only all the bad, all the time, with no apparent room for compromise or reason to work things out. Taken as a biopic of the founders of rap music, the picture does a credible job I guess, but I don't see how it would inspire an appreciation of the music for non-rap fans with it's vile and disgusting lyrics."

","Straight Outta Compton is most certainly pretty dope It's long though so make sure you got ample popcorn and coke The story of these pioneering rappers is a story worth telling Even though there's far too much intent starring and yelling This is a tale filled with music, drama and boys from the hood It's important that the film then casted so good Filled with up and comers, unknowns and a scene chewing Oscar nominee Straight Outta Compton really creates a believable hip hop company Stand outs are Jason Mitchell as Eaze-E, Corey Hwakins as Dr. Dre and O'Shea Jackson Jr as his father Ice Cube And Keith Stanfield as Snoop Dogg really is quite the dude Director F. Gary Gray directs with a steady and well-tuned hand No doubt steaming from the time he had once spent with the band He makes the group feel alive and the streets of Compton as well Without this energy and attention it could've been the films death knell The problem with Grey's film is that it steadily loses steam There's also a lot of glossing over details that make the group seem a little too clean And you can't help but feel that the boys from N.W.A were slightly more mean For in many ways the film feels gritty, realistic and raw But the group itself only show glimmers of what made them enemies of the law Overall the film shines most when the music takes centre stage and the creative process takes hold And in the end you're glad that this story was for the big screen told One of the better music films of recent years Despite its melodramatic TV movie nature, Straight Outta Compton brings the tunes, the laughs and the tears.<br/><br/>In Summary – Straight Outta Compton is a slick and well-made biopic that does a fine job of handling so many stories in one cohesive narrative. After bursting out of the blocks Compton does eventually start to run out of steam however and it would be hard to argue against the fact that the films best scenes are held within the first half.<br/><br/>It's hard also to not feel slightly ripped off by the fact that these men are made out to be slightly to pristine from their colourful background with crime and misdemeanours but with Mr. Cube and the Dr on board behind the scenes they clearly had a say on what the final cut looked like.<br/><br/>With a winning cast and fine direction from Gray, Compton is overall a winner and no doubt a great event for those array of fans of N.W.A that have for many years waited for this story to be told.<br/><br/>3 ½ Nash Edgerton's out of 5"

","This is definitely a movie worth watching. The cast is very well chosen with young, quite unknown actors,which not only have a look remarkably similar to the original group but act very well. Especially O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father well and very authentically. The movie tries to depict the situation in Compton in the 80s and early 90s with crime and racism against young African-Americans all around, especially coming from policemen. A situation which nowadays the public,thanks to N.W.A., among others, at least is aware of, though it has not changed dramatically since then. It is a good feature of this movie that it tries to explain N.W.A.'s fight for freedom of speech and against racism by using their music as a medium. The negative part about this movie is that it maybe describes the political aspects too short whereas the house-partying-part is way bigger than it should be, therefore the second part is too long with too unimportant features. Apart from that a movie definitely recommendable since it is still on point 25 years later."

Plenty of violence, political controversy and enough cussing to sink a fleet of impala's, if that's your thang.<br/><br/>In short, the movie was worth watching, but question the accuracy of the events throughout, however, if you take them with a pinch of salt then you will enjoy it for what it is."

","I saw ""Straight Outta Compton"", starring O'Shea Jackson Jr.-In his first movie and he is the real life son of Ice Cube, which is nice, since he is playing him; Corey Hawkins-Non-Stop, Iron Man 3; Jason Mitchell-Broken City, Contraband and Paul Giamatti-San Andreas, Rock of Ages.<br/><br/>This is the story of how the rap/hip hop group NWA formed. If you know me, you know that I am not a fan of this type of music but the story is interesting. I'm sure you know what NWA stands for but just in case you don't, it's the 'N' word, With Attitude. Straight Outta Compton was the name of their first album and Compton is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California that is famous for the rough street life, what with all the gangs and drug dealers, not to mention corrupt police that would harass people just because of their skin color. Remember the Rodney King beating? O'Shea/Ice Cube, Corey/Dr,Dre and Jason/Easy E were the core members that formed the group that used their music to talk about life in the hood in the late 1980's and early 1990's. They paved the way for lots of other stars and they were arrested during their concerts for their lyrics-some of which were 'F The Police!'-and inciting riots. Paul plays their manager. Other artists during this time period are shown, including Suge Knight, Snoop Dogg and Tupac. It also shows some stuff after NWA break up, including Ice Cube's getting the acting bug. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes. If you are a fan, you will probably like it more than I did.

Ice Cube is played by his son, making the film even more realistic. But there are still errors.<br/><br/>The NWA members are all played well and made the scenes believable.

","Since I'm not a hip-hop fan the movie was a not sublime to me. The story line, showing the 'front yard oppression' was the true punch line of the movie.

Gary Gray and a stellar cast all around, especially the leads: O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell. It baffled me how they looked exactly like their real life counterparts. This goes for everybody apart from Keith Stanfield, who plays Snoop. But I can't blame them for that because Snoop has such a unique face.

"maxwelloreocookie","4","0","7","27 September 2019"," Dissapointing with a very convoluted plot.
","Just recently rewatched this and my main problem is lack of character development and the ""plot,"" if you even want to call it that.<br/><br/>The plot isn't cohesive whatsoever. The plot starts out okay, I did like the introduction to all the main characters, but after that, it's all downhill. It's like this movie just skims through the NWA Wikipedia page very sloppily. That could work for a documentary, but it doesn't work for an actual feature film/story, it gets so boring. A feature film needs a cohesive plot and narrative. Even just random scenes happen just cuz they happened in real life or based on real life events. Just because something happened in real life doesn't mean you should put it in the story. When you're telling the story based off real life, you need to trim the fat. Like for example, Snoop Dogg randomly shows up, then we pretty much never see him again for the rest of the movie. His character and appearance adds nothing to the plot or anything. They just put him there because he's Snoop Dogg.<br/><br/>Also lack of character development. They are just mostly angry most of the movie, and no real growth near the end. I would've gave Easy-E the most to do, most character development, and humanize him the most because he obviously dies at the end. They also sidelined MC Ren and DJ Yella. I know they are the lesser known members, but that's an ever better reason to give them more to do, they had do be doing more behind the scenes that most don't know about. That's another problem with this movie, they mainly just skim through most stuff that NWA fans and most Hip-Hop fans already knew, like the basic stuff. If you're an NWA fan, you're gonna learn nothing new in this movie about them. So what's the point? Unlike the Prince movie, ""Purple Rain,"" you learn so much about his life and struggles that most people didn't know before the movie's release. ""Purple Rain,"" an actual good music biopic. I would've forgave ""Straight Outta Compton"" for just telling us the basic details of their life if the plot and character development were amazing and engaging, but they weren't, they sucked.<br/><br/>Then the movie ends with Dr. Dre saying, ""I'm gonna start Aftermath."" Cool, how does that even correlate with the rest of the movie? Barely anything correlates in this movie. As I said before, just because that's what Dre did in real life doesn't make it okay. If I made a story of my life, I wouldn't include so many random details all randomly stringed together, that's just bad writing, doesn't matter if everything I said actually happened. There still has to be a cohesive narrative.<br/><br/>And don't tell me I don't understand this movie because I'm not from the hood or not a Hip-Hop head, etc. That's irrevant, a good story is a good story. I'm not from the Hood, but think ""Boyz-N-The-Hood"" is a 10/10 movie. Doesn't matter what walk of life anyone is from, a good story is a good story, and a bad story is a bad story. Execution of a story is very important. I'm sure there is a great story of NWA somewhere, but this isn't it, because it's executed horribly. It seems like a cheap straight-to-MTV movie."

","This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I missed it at the cinema, as I was doubtful it would be any good but having now seen it three times, I thought I'd add this review.<br/><br/>I had bought the album of the same name some years ago but never knew the background story, which turns out to be very inspiring and thoroughly engaging.<br/><br/>Rap legends Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Easy E formed NWA in the late 80s. This biopic tells the riveting story of the band and their stereotypically manipulative manager Jerry Heller and we see some appearances from other characters along the way, like Snoop Dog, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine. It focusses on the formation of the band, their music and the events which drove their creativity. Fans of the original album, like myself, will probably get bonus enjoyment from seeing some tracks performed during the movie.<br/><br/>The gangster myth surrounding the band is put in the spotlight here. These kids were no saints but they weren't hardened gang members and had the sense and drive to take their lives in the right direction. There's little difference, aside from the music, between the likes of NWA and other controversial bands like Motley Crue, yet the establishment's prejudice saw them as thugs and criminals.<br/><br/>It's nothing entirely new - other band stories follow a similar theme of inception, climb to fame, controversy and turmoil, band splits, etc. but Straight Outa Compton has fantastic performances from all the cast - especially Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti - and is gripping on three levels.<br/><br/>The first is witnessing the birth of the joint genius of Dr Dre, Cube and Easy E and where it takes them as the story unfolds. The second is the rise of the band and the usual issues that arise from fame and money in the music industry. The third and most powerful is the band's battle against the authorities and, in particular, the FBI. There are no dull moments in this movie and, at nearly 150 minutes, is a solid achievement for the writers and director F Gary Gray.<br/><br/>Don't expect the uplifting vibes of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's aptly gritty in places and the movie's tone is in keeping with the hard edge of the band's music.<br/><br/>For me, it does justice to their story and is an impressive film."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","1","22 December 2018"," You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.
","Though 'Straight Outta Compton (2018)' may not be one-hundred percent historically accurate (with some 'undesirable' events being omitted seemingly simply due to the people producing the piece), this extremely entertaining bio-pic cuts to the heart of its story in an impressively acute way, always feeling innately cinematic and properly engaging as it weaves together its complex characters and events into a single narrative. It does brush past, and even entirely omit, a couple of its key players in an effort to focus on the trifecta of Cube, Dre and Easy, but this is just a casualty of a more concise narrative and is, essentially, completely necessarily, if unfortunate, in order for the film to work as well as it does. The two-and-a-half hour picture flies by as it really drives home the messages found within its focal group's music (even the ones they couldn't write into their lyrics) and paints a clear picture of the time, place and general situation that lead to its creation. Plus, all of the flick's actors give near-perfect performances that aren't just imitations and actually recreate the iconic songs themselves. 8/10"

There was a constant fight in growing up in the ghetto and dealing with police brutality. But with the fame and fortune there were new conflicts that quickly emerged.

It makes on wonder, if the N.W.A. members had never broken up, where would the rap game be today?"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","21","13 April 2016"," An Interesting Film About an Uncommon Subject
","Public Enemy's Chuck-D once said ""Hip-Hop is the CNN of the ghetto."" If that be the case, N.W.A. and the talented artists that composed the super-group are the Walter Cronkite of urban black youth in the early nineties. Formed with the collective talent of Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, MC Ren and Arabian Prince, the music of N.W.A. would become infinitely notorious with its anthem F*** tha Police. While comparatively short-lived as a group, they became pioneers, forging a new subgenre of music known as gangsta rap.<br/><br/>It makes perfect sense that a movie would be made about the group, their tumultuous first tour, their breakup and their eventual (kind of) reunion. Though with all but one member of the group alive and well, the history of this films development is arguably more interesting and more hectic than the movie itself. The film originated in the mind of writer S. Leigh Savidge who wanted to concentrate on the partnership between Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and manager Jerry Heller (Giamatti) as they forged Ruthless Records. After rewrites, Tomica Woods-Wright (wife of Eazy-E and owner of the lions share of N.W.A. song rights) was approached to head the project as producer. As rewrites mounted, more screenwriters were hired and the scope of the film got larger, more and more producers joined the project. A total of sixteen producers are credited for the making of Straight Outta Compton; and yes two of them are former members of N.W.A. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre.<br/><br/>I say all this to point out how good Straight Outta Compton is despite its long crooked journey to the screen. You would think that all the cooks in the kitchen would make for one confusingly disjointed film. Fortunately after years of development, and a number of rewrites the film itself is a well-made, well-told, well-oiled machine. It recollects the impact of the group's rise with gusto while keeping with the ethos of the group. O'Shea Jackson and Corey Hawkins do wonderful jobs portraying Ice Cube and Dr. Dre respectively. Energized by the force and rawness of the story, the two manage to find equal footing in a crowded field of actors walking on as living legends of the gangsta rap movement. Jason Mitchell also does a fine job giving a sense of pathos to Eazy-E though he falters a bit when the third act flirts with aspects of melodrama. The real find here however is R. Marcos Taylor who portrays the lawless Suge Knight whose disreputable antics as the co-founder of Death Row Records were legendary.<br/><br/>Yet despite the film's stellar ensemble acting and despite it's break with commonplace music ""rise-and-fall"" stories, the film still feels like an assortment of compromises. Halfway through the movie, after Ice Cube's exit from N.W.A., Eazy and Ice take to the studio releasing tracks meant to diss the other in an escalating battle of oneupsmanship. Yet we're never too aware of the reasons for such resentments. There's vagaries about contracts but nothing concrete that allows us to really take sides. All the members of N.W.A. as portrayed in Straigtht Outta Compton, are uniformly hungry for the limelight, suspicious of authority and aggressively misogynistic. Yet rarely do they cross a line of good taste and good humor that would make us think twice about rooting for them in the first place.<br/><br/>All those compromises stack up and are ultimately dumped on the sniveling lap of Jerry Heller who by the end is treated by the film as a pathetic, simpering but somehow maleficent power broker. S. Leigh Savidge had stated publicly that half the battle of getting the film made was getting Ice Cube, Dre. Dre and Tomica Wood-Wright talking to each other. I suppose among the arguments, negotiations and breakdowns in communication, the one thing all producers could agree on was s***ting on Jerry Heller; a man who I'm sure is far from innocuous but apparently has grounds for a defamation lawsuit against the film.<br/><br/>Don't get it twisted, the film, if ignoring the drama behind the scenes is still a real humdinger. It's a fine story about the birth and proliferation of gangsta rap sure to have fans of the music genre drool over the likeness and portrayals of various rappers at the beginning of their career. And let's not forget the soundtrack which not only features tons of N.W.A. hits but manages to insert some Snoop Dogg, a little of Parliament and a sneaky insert of Tupac Shakur's ""California Love"". Even if you're not a fan of gangsta rap, Straight Outta Compton is still worth your time, I'm just not sure it's worth all the fuss."

","If you want to see a film that give you a tiny bit of insight in the start of one of the most important hip hop groups, this is a must see. The challenge is of course to be able to represent all different artists and their background, and some things feel it barely scratching the surface of some interesting details. But it does focus on some really important things like showing what actual role each artist brought to the table, and important events which manages to actually convey the feeling so well that you are grabbed and taken on a musical revolution. The portrayal of race and gender has more nuance than might meet the eye at the first glance. Of course, some people with a narrow view will say that the N.W.A. members are portrayed as violent thugs with no respect for rules and people. This is however a story about young men from areas where you probably don't even let yourself dream of a tenth of what N.W.A. accomplished, and you also neglect to understand the reality of black people. Really, white people are not subject to the same treatment as black people. The gender representation is actually pretty OK, the main characters are the men in N.W.A. and of course you could wish to see more women in the film. Straight Outta Compton does manage to show anything from the character Felisha, who is represented as an object to Dr. Dre's mother who is a working independent woman that try to raise her sons well, and Eazy E's wife who is the one that gets to have the traditional logical male quality of logic while Eazy E has the passion. <br/><br/>In short, Straight Outta Compton is a really well made try rags to riches film with music and real anger at it's core. See it if you want the basics about N.W.A, then find their discographies and individual biographies. Enjoy."

","Great movie. I've always been an Ice Cube fan and kind of held off watching this because I thought it wasn't going to handle the NWA 'aftermath', only how they kicked things off.<br/><br/>But I couldn't have been more wrong - the film covers it from the perspective of Cube, Dre and E in great detail. We grow to hate Jerry for the worm that he was.<br/><br/>Which is ironic, because for me, the casting of a comedy actor (Giamatti) as Jerry was possibly the only weakness of the film. In an otherwise serious and realistic film, he stands out and casting would've been better served choosing a more serious actor.<br/><br/>Nothing against Giamatti incidentally, who is very talented - good on him getting the gig. This falls on the people casting to me. Goes in the same category as Vince Vaughn in True Detective, for those who get that reference.<br/><br/>That said, this film still gets a nine from me.

","When the fallout between Cube, Dre, and Eazy takes center stage, however, the script's zeal is camouflaged by the actors' impeccable familiarity and comfort with one another. A fast-forwarded montage during the recording of the title album suggests their tight-knit mantra, but it's moments such as a darkly comic armed hotel confrontation with an angry boyfriend or watching Eazy step up to the mic for the first time only to whimper the opening line to the amusement of the on looking group that makes these performances work so well. Even Paul Giamatti as crooked manager Jerry Heller get involved, bringing reason to the aggressiveness and maintaining a vulnerable stature underneath his alternative motives. But where this chemistry comes into play most effectively is making the group's various conflicts impactful despite being given minimal attention. Boldly bumping 'Fuck Tha Police' in front of an FBI head, Cube effortlessly telling a CNN reporter to eat a dick during an interview, and, most notably during hospital visits to a bed-ridden Eazy when personal vendettas climaxed only a few scenes prior.<br/><br/>Perhaps 'Straight Outta Compton' would have worked better as a mini-series or, at very least, a film that reduced its battles and increased its attention to the alluring crew dynamic from a plot standpoint.

","I see a lot of negative reviews about this film which I deduce came from a single individual, or group of people, who hates on the black community or the ideas they inspire. (Statements contain the same flow of idea, etc. as if it came from a dedicated hater. You could take a look at them yourself.)<br/><br/>Really, this movie shows us a slice of life from the people who are oppressed; the ones whose voices would have otherwise not be heard if they didn't do something about it. And this film does not support violence. In fact, the whole point was to be against it. (Which makes me think those last 1 starred reviews didn't even watch the whole film and understood it.) So what if violence was their way of life? They we're born into it. It's what they have known ever since. If people would actually treat them as people, violence wouldn't even exist among them. And it all goes way back... What sets them apart is instead of succumbing, they voiced it out. And they struggled to get away from it. Make a change for the better, not just for them, but for all the people who face the same crises everyday of their lives.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for all those who'd want to step back and rethink about the next time you judge people just because of their color or way of life, and for all those whose voice want to be heard too."

","Straight Outta Compton was a compelling story about one of hip-hops most iconic groups to date, the NWA. The story pays close attention to the lives of Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. The movie is a behind the scenes look at what the music industry and the group were going through during the 1980s. Straight Outta Compton gives a true account of the individual and professional development that the R&B moguls experienced during the peak of their careers. There is a way in which the producers establish psychological affects when such problems plague them from their childhood. While each of the individuals nonverbally communicated how their realities had shaped their lives, they all followed a common goal; surviving through their shared hell and succeeding, no matter what the cost was. The need to survive while pursuing their passions put the NWA at risk several times, which eventually led to the group to go their separate ways. Even after the group disbanded, communication between individuals was still portrayed. This communication gave great insight into the relationships that the members had established and maintained. <br/><br/>Diversity amongst a singular community was also represented in the film, which made everything about the character development emphasized in a natural capacity. The diversity was both geological and familial. Several characters in the film hailed from East Lost Angeles, while the majority of the NWA were from Compton, California. Although there were no diversity in socioeconomic status or in life experience. The relationships they had with their families (or did not have) was the primary type of diversity. Dre. Dre's relationship with one motive for him to work hard on his own to move out and pursue music on his own without any sort of familial support, outside of his younger brother who later died as a result of gang violence. The death of his younger brother weighed heavy on Dre, but also inspired him to pursue his path. The rest of the group's family lives were not disclosed, which I'm taking to mean their stories were not told in order to preserve their memory, given that two of the original group members (Ice Cube & Dr. Dre) assisted in producing the film. <br/><br/>A lot was being shown about how the music industry used rhetoric to pursue artists as well as rob them of their well-earned funds. Manager Jerry Heller employs several types of rhetorical tools used when manipulating Eazy E and in barricading members out of NWA out of his exclusive deal with Eazy. Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records, also showed the ways in which an aggressive and often intimidating leader can exude control over a large number of people while proving to be a truly ineffective leader. Ice Cube's final manager in the film also used rhetoric to withhold Ice Cube's earning from him, which gave an insight into the industrial systematic racism that was occurring during the time period. His outrage, and spontaneously demonstrative breaking of his manager's property, served as a louder indicator of his need to have his needs met. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the film was excellent and inspired the general population to look at the way they view music icons. It was a tribute, in some ways, to all celebrity figures who have had to start from a horrible youth into the iconic faces and media faces that they become in the future. It was a telling tale about the horrors that these people witnessed and partook in in their youth, but gave a certain humanization to the world surrounding individuals from their backgrounds. Jonah Hill once gave an interview with Jimmy Fallon, and said that Ice Cube never laughed much or said much, but the one thing that made him laugh was watching Friday. After gaining insight into Ice Cube, it is easy to see how such a figure might become a stoic, and why the best time of his life, with his friends, would be one of the things to bring ease to him."

","In the movie Straight Outta Compton you learn a lot about the rap group N.W.A. The movie not only gives you an insight on how they came up from the dangerous streets of Compton to making millions but also shows you the immense impact they had on they're surrounding culture and fans. As the movie progresses it shows you the historical importance of this group and how the individuals were able to strike an uproar within the fans and listeners of their music. Many of it spoke about the race inequality and the imbalance that authorities had on African American's still. Many of the songs they made had hard lyrics and crazy beats. They wrote a lot about their frustrations of being from the hood and the daily struggle that was their lives. <br/><br/>In the beginning of this powerful movie it follows each character as they are trying to make a dollar hustling whatever jobs they can. Whether it's making beats at their house, to rapping at local clubs, to making money at whatever they do. It wasn't until one day they all came together to make a song combining all of their talents to make what then became their powerful group called N.W.A. which consisted of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E , MC Ren, and DJ Yella. After playing a show at a small club they were found and heard by Jerry Heller. He gave them the money and publicity they needed to succeed but as things grew it began to fall part. As it appeared to many he was siding with Eazy-E and only paying him so in the end after the success they all split up. Most of the N.W.A character went on to make millions in their respective careers but one , Eazy- E , passed away at an early age due to AIDS. <br/><br/>The rap group N.W.A not only wrote very good music but also began a historical culture movement. They were a group many people across the national across the nation could relate to and get behind to rally. They formed a movement against abusive authority and created what many believed to be a cultural war for human right and was found to be successful as even the government was sending them warnings to not play their song called F*** The Police. Another big thing that this movie taught me was that as the money came in, people began to develop egos and forget why they started the movement. They were also very heavily influenced by one of the most controversial people to ever be around the rap game, Suge Knight. He would twist peoples words and make them believe one thing to try and gain trust so he could then follow to make money from them. As the movie comes to a close it is apparent that when famous it is not easy to maintain your original personality. We see in the end the group sort of comes back together after the passing of Eazy-E. As Ice Cube famously said, ""How you go from selling rocks in a dope house to eating dinner in the white house?"". <br/><br/>Overall I left the movie theater feeling very inspired and well informed about their whole movement. I enjoyed the whole experience and it was so well done I didn't think the 2 1/2 hours was too long at all. If anything I wish it showed a little more of their lives after they all split up but I also understand that the movie was not necessarily made for that purpose. Great watch and I would recommend it to anyone."

","Straight Outta Compton<br/><br/>""F*ck the police, coming straight from the underground"" (NWA). These explicit yet powerful lyrics are featured in the famous NWA song F*ck the police. NWA was an influential rap group that was formed in the late 80's and consisted of the rappers Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. The rap group was extremely controversial for their time but they became pioneers for what is now known as gangster rap. NWA popularized the rap culture in the late 80's and utilized music to voice the issues of growing up in the hood. The movie Straight Outta Compton gives the audience insight on the rise and fall of NWA and the controversy that surrounded them. <br/><br/>At the start of the movie, the audience follows Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. During this back story, the audience is able to see the daily struggles that each rapper faces. The daily struggles that each rapper faced ranged from having low income, gang warfare, and police brutality. These struggles inspired NWA to embrace music as their emotional outlet and voice the problems that revolve growing up in the hood. A music manager named Jerry Heller recognizes NWA's talent, so he decides to be the rap group's manager. As NWA starts to bring in millions, Eazy-E becomes blinded by the money and doesn't realize Jerry is manipulating him. Jerry destroys the brotherly bond between the NWA members and this leads to Ice Cube and Dr. Dre leaving the group. NWA goes into a downward spiral and bad blood between the members continues to grow. Once Eazy-E realized the intentions of Jerry, he cuts ties with Jerry and then tries to patches things back up with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. (SPOILER ALERT) The group decides to get back together but the comeback soon gets derailed when Easy-E is diagnosed with AIDS. Eazy-E dies shortly after being diagnosed but is immortalized as one of the greatest rappers and pioneers of gangster rap. Ironically, NWA strived to have money and power but in the end it was the money and power that destroyed the group. <br/><br/>The acting in the film was great. Ice-cube was played by his real life son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., which is why Ice Cube's character was spot on. Straight Outta Compton has a strong theme of police brutality and the everyday discrimination that African Americans faced growing up in the hood. NWA was seen as a controversial group because doubters believed that their explicit lyrics glamorized the gangster life: violence, drugs, opposition to the authority, and etc. In reality, the group was shinning a light on the daily struggles that occur in the hood. The movie referenced a clip of the Rodney King beating, which was a monumental case that fueled a riot and showed the racial discrimination that plagues our society. Even though this movie is set in the 80's, the problem of police brutality is still prominent in our society. If we want to prosper as a civilization, we need to address this problem so we can continue to tear down the issue of racial discrimination and corruption of law and authority."

","Straight Outta Compton is directed by F. Gary Gray and stars O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, and Jason Mitchell. During a tense time in racial equality, a group of boys from Compton in Los Angles, California, starts a music group called NWA. Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E lead this group to the forefront of the music industry. They rap about their hard lives on the streets and the unfair treatment they receive. Their music causes controversy everywhere and they revolutionize the Hip Hop genre.<br/><br/>Although the actors in this movie were relatively unknown, they managed to pull the audience into the film and play their parts very believably. The characters, however, were hard to connect to individuals, because there was a large cast. But the three characters that stood out were Dr. Dre (Hawkins), Ice Cube (Jackson), and Eazy-E (Mitchell).<br/><br/>Corey Hawkins played Dr. Dre, who acted as middle ground between the two extremes of this movie: Ice Cube and Eazy-E. His acting was very convincing and there was never a moment when the audience didn't believe the character was real. This character also had the most dramatic arc in the film. The audience can clearly see him develop from a homeless street kid into a very successful music artist. Everyone loves an underdog and this adds to the audiences' appreciation of Dr. Dre (Hawkins).<br/><br/>Ice Cube was one of the extremes in this movie. He was played by O'Shea Jackson Jr.: the actual son of Ice Cube. Being related to his character really helped his performance: Not only did he look the part, but his mannerisms and expressions deepened the character for the audience. However this was a very confusing and ill- paced character. The script never seemed to decide what type of person Ice Cube (Jackson) was, and it kept changing personalities until it was hard to understand or relate to. One scene he would be calm and reserved, but the very next scene he would be raging and violent.<br/><br/>The other extreme character in Straight Outta Compton was Eazy-E played by Jason Mitchell. Mitchell's acting throughout the film was by far the best and most heartfelt. His character had a very clear motivation and drive: his desire for money. This was a breath of fresh air from the confusing characters in the film like Ice Cube. Once the group takes off, Eazy-E (Mitchell) gets lost in a world of contracts and lawsuits, but his pursuit of money always remains strong. However, this money seeking side of Eazy-E (Mitchell) causes him to come across as greedy and unlikable to the audience. The script tried to address this in the character's arc, but the finishing of the arc felt rushed. Because of the rushed ending, the audience never really got a chance to connect with the character.<br/><br/>The tone of Straight Outta Compton can be summarized in one word: Intense. Any scene with police officers in it was extremely high-strung and had the audience breathless. The tension in those scenes poured out of the screen and wrapped the audience up and didn't release them until the end of the scene. The best parts of this film were the intense scenes that took the audience's breath away.<br/><br/>The film had one major error: It's run-time. This film would have been more enjoyable and left the audience on a better note, if it had cut its 2 hour and 27 minute run-time to an hour and a half. In the first hour, the film focused on the creation and popularity of NWA and how the public responded, but after that it became joyless drama that wasn't engaging for the audience. The last twenty minutes of Straight Outta Compton was very enjoyable and it tried to wrap up the story. Unfortunately, the ending felt rushed and didn't cover some plot points from the beginning of the film. If the film had avoided the boring drama that took place in the middle of the film, it would have been more interesting.<br/><br/>The surprisingly good acting and the intense tone made this film a highlight, but the way the film dragged on and made it hard to connect with each character dragged down the film. Straight Outta Compton gets a 7.0/10 stars"

","In 1988, an innovative new musical group revolutionized pop culture, changing the way we know hip-hop forever. The group, N.W.A's first album, ""Straight Outta Compton"", created some controversy because of its honest depiction of life in Compton, California. With the assistance of their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), members Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Easy-E (Jason Mitchell), DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.), and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) have to steer their way through the music industry while acquiring fame, fortune and a place in history along the way.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about this film was how authentic it was. It definitely sounds and looks like the late 80s with the soundtrack, the decor, and the wardrobe. I've never really been a fan of rap music ,or even music in general but I don't think you have to be to enjoy this film. The group in question has 5 members but the film really focuses on 2 (Ice Cube and Dr. Dre) and also Easy-E to a lesser extent. The performances were great across the board where O'Shea Jackson Jr's Ice Cube and Jason Mitchell's Easy-E standing out. Despite some of the dramatic moments coming off a little cheesy (a common complaint I have with certain dramatic films), there were still decent moments with the acting making up for the others. I thought the story flowed well for the most part even with the 2 and a half hour running time. I thought the beginning and end were strong but it lagged a little in the middle. The story was told in a way that felt real going back to the point I made about authenticity. You get to see what they had to live through and how they were able to overcome it and make something out of themselves. The dialogue was authentic in that it featured certain words that are not in my vocabulary but I would think they would be in theirs and I assume that was where the film's 18A/R rating came from. My favorite thing about this film other than the acting was the musical performances. I think they were well shot in that they made you feel like you were there and what added to that feeling was the sound work that captured the crowds and their noise. What I didn't like about the film was how they depicted police officers. They were a little too over-the-top for me which came across a little unrealistic in that I understand what that time was like but it's unlikely that they would all be the way they were. Some people may be offended by the language, nudity, drugs, and/or violence but that was what they were like and not having these would mean not telling the story properly. People should not be surprised by any of this considering the rating and the subject matter. I did not mind this and I think that most wouldn't either.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

",". . . STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON links the Unprintably-named N.W.A. gang to most all the U.S. social ills of the past 30 years. Why, just this summer two home-grown American shooters--one Black and one White--tied their massacres to an on-going Race War, which many if not most Americans believe is being covered up by our government and media. COMPTON makes clear that its Mob of Seven intentionally began this ruckus to sell rap ""music"" to the bored Youth of the Monied Races. (N.W.A. is shown to be in cahoots with Jewish people in their plot, and this anti-Semitic angle will give Eichmann--wherever he is--a good laugh.) The N.W.A. Seven are portrayed as the instigators of today's shoot-a-cop craze, which claimed its latest victim on the day I saw COMPTON. (This grass roots terrorist movement is shown reaching a fever pitch in Detroit, which declared bankruptcy after N.W.A.'s visit.) As many if not most of today's ""law enforcement"" officers spend the majority of their time cowering inside the relative safety of their police posts, N.W.A.'s rampant drug dealing, AIDS-spreading sex orgies, and reckless driving faithfully depicted in this flick make it a deadly mission for a normal person to attempt a milk run to their nearest store. COMPTON documents how this metal ball bat wielding thug behavior has thoroughly eaten away and trashed America's soul. You'll never get on an elevator alone with someone who looks like a ""rapper,"" and you'll cross to the other side of your street when you see them approaching, after you've witnessed and learned the lessons of COMPTON."

","First of all I'm not the biggest music fan but I was really looking forward to this film because if just how important NWA were to change social interpretations in America. The premise of the film sees the rise of NWA band members eazy e, ice cube and Dr dre and the conflict that they go through. Now the guys who play these three are all completely new and they were all fantastic. The characters were all different and unique, I thought they were all completely unique and different which was impressive. Paul giamatti plays there manager and I really liked his character. He was an interesting character who had allot of depth to him. The story of the groups rise Is fantastic and really great to watch. Also I thought the film portrayed the conflict between the group and the authorities. However, the film goes into more individual stories and yes while it is pretty interesting it felt much slower and more dull until the end of the movie which was great. The script was great with all the dialogue feeling real and true. There was allot of dramatic moment which were fantastic and quite a bit of well done humour. The style was alright, the concerts with the group were amazing and they really were the best part of the movie. However, there aren't too many of them and this film feels a choppy in its pacing as well. Overall I really enjoyed this film and if you're interested you should see it."

","Folks, this was a really good one. I give it a 9 just because i'm hard to impress ... And yet... I have to do a big memory effort to remember when was last time i have seen such a good musical ( or about music ) movie . Very strange, all these young actors, where just right, the music , the action , the drama parts well balanced .The acting was top, director top, screenplay top also. The only minus, maybe, is that it was too sugary sometimes. There may be some ultra PCs with their""oh my GOD ! "", but hey ! THIS IS THE REAL LIFE! Not everybody is wearing tutus and walk on their toes . Sometimes you have to hit hard to pass the message, and the NWA and the movie makers did just that. If someone thinks that "" we the people "" in the streets, or the factory floor , stop at every word coming out , then there will be no communication , will be no music .Yes, we may stuff it up sometimes, but hey , that's the way we are, and that movie reflected just that. To cut it short, satisfaction guaranteed. For the rest , just stay home and play Bridge... or knit some socks , or listen to some Barry... P.S. I'll step on some toes and i'll go and PAY again to see this movie. Dixit."

","The film illustrated the ongoing conflict and tensions that still exist in the USA between the urban black youth and the police.<br/><br/>The central characters in the movie were Dr Dre, EazyE, Ice Cube and Jerry Heller. There were great performances from the actors who played Ice Cube (Jackson Jr) and EazyE (Mitchell )steeling the show. <br/><br/>NWA didn't create 'Gangsta Rap'but they were the ones that took it to the masses and made it popular. Central to this revolution was Dr Dre played by Hawkins and the rhythms written by Ice Cube.<br/><br/>The key to this movie was the relationship that existed between each major protagonist how that relationship developed, matured then fell apart.<br/><br/>The break down in the relationship of each major character was very public at the time this wasn't properly captured in the film, this is what lets it down. This is probably done not to give rise to any new disputes (beefs) and to respect those that have passed.<br/><br/>As the central focus of the story was on the relationship of the group and not those that existed in conjunction with the group so relationships that the rappers developed with their spouses were not fully explained, spouses appearing out of the blue making you wonder were did he or she come from<br/><br/>The film isn't overly violent or nudity jumping out at you each minute. Overall it was a good movie and I was surprised how quickly 150 minutes flew by. From the way the movie concluded I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel in the near future"
