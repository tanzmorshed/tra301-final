","This movie is so real..at least to this person, who lived these things that happened in the movie. I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the Thirties<br/><br/>I think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. <br/><br/>We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.<br/><br/>We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own HutÂ…this was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.<br/><br/>Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.<br/><br/>That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.<br/><br/>Gene McDaniel"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","133","151","13 February 2001"," John Ford's stark portrayal of a poor family in the depression remains one of the most moving films in history.
","The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time. <br/><br/>Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad, a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film, only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior, otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation, as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country, on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about, provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely well-structured.<br/><br/>
The family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey, from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there, at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as `Okies,' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending, because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film. <br/><br/>The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns, and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place, while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together, seeing it as the only thing that they really had left, but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing, which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers. <br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film, but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless, and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn, but there comes a point, at least once in a great while, when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing, and in such cases, The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice."
"bkoganbing","10","76","89","1 October 2006"," Economic Dislocation
","John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.<br/><br/>For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.<br/><br/>This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. <br/><br/>America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.<br/><br/>Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. <br/><br/>Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.<br/><br/>Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.<br/><br/>John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.<br/><br/>Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film."

","It's difficult on a first viewing of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the ""gee whizz"" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.<br/><br/>Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"29055","10","89","107","5 January 1999"," A marvellous production of Steinbeck's epic.
","Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad captures perfectly the humanity and compassion of the Steinbeck character, an ex-con who breaks his parole conditions by joining his family in their epic journey across the southern US to a ""better life"" in California.<br/><br/>This is not the usual Hollywood fare. Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out. Fonda's role is particularly understated, and we see, as in Steinbeck's masterly epic, the maternally robust figure of Ma holding the family together.<br/><br/>The performances all round are wonderful, and Ford's direction and sense of space under the big sky of the Midwest is breathtaking.<br/><br/>This film is now largely a testament to the time in which it was set, but like the war movies that were soon to follow, a story that needed telling lest we forget."
"jluis1984","10","28","33","4 May 2007"," A masterpiece...
","During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.<br/><br/>In ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.<br/><br/>Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.<br/><br/>In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed ""Stagecoach"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" in less than 12 months. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.<br/><br/>While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.<br/><br/>As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.<br/><br/>With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10"
"RHKLWK","10","71","91","18 May 2002"," A Triumph in Record Time
","They say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting to capture an historical event on film.  That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the ""feel"" of Viet Nam (in ""Platoon"") so soon (13 years) after America's withdrawal.  Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.<br/><br/>But, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 ""dust bowl"" to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.    <br/><br/>Of course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man.<br/><br/>
One of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society.  That completely misses the point.  Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.   <br/><br/>
This is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit."
"willwoodmill","9","8","8","26 February 2016"," The definitive Great Depression film
","Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake ""Hollywood"" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichÃ©s. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. <br/><br/>If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. <br/><br/>Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.<br/><br/>John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

This is as down as you can get and still survive. We are taught to be grateful when watching this and to also consider the other guy, whoever he is and at the least, do not add to his burden. Actors are on their game as is the Director. Of course, none of this exists if it wasn't for John Steinbeck and his book. I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls. Have something to eat while watching to appreciate that you have food and the people in the movie do not, a tasty drink and a snack which is unheard of back during the depression days will help you connect more to the movie theme.

","Do I have your attention? Okay: Go out and watch this movie immediately because to not do so is, well, it's un-American. John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. <br/><br/>The sweeping vistas, the excellent editing and pacing, and the acting are of the highest caliber, as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time. <br/><br/>And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless, it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko (it's been done before), but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah, the ideology promotes a type of socialism (ahem, I mean, let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea, then fine), but, really, the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone; it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden, and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry."

","This classic adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" features a fine cast as well as a skillful production headed by director John Ford. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.<br/><br/>Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.<br/><br/>For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.<br/><br/>And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film. Ford clearly appreciated the potential in the material, and he and the cast work together to make each character count, and to give meaning to each scene."

","The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.<br/><br/>Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of ""homicide"" could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.<br/><br/>The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.<br/><br/>Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as ""people are going to win rich, people are going to die"". - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema."

","In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the ""writing types"". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the ""lies"" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation.

","The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and ""we're the people that live."" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.<br/><br/>From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called ""false consciousness,"" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the ""fambly"" together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers ""class consciousness."" It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic ""sanitary units"", and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have ""a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole."" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about ""Who is these Reds, anyways?"" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!<br/><br/>No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. <br/><br/>This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who ""don't look none too prosperous."" <br/><br/>If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?"

","The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is a Drama History film in black and white starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned. He learns that the land is no longer producing enough crops to provide for their family and the whole family heads to California to look for work. The best parts of the film are the acting, the plot, and the cinematography. <br/><br/>The acting and casting are excellent. The entire cast is full of life and they deliver their lines with perfect execution. When Tom Joad returns home to see his family, they are all lit up and full of smiles. You are able to see the happiness and utter joy that they are feeling to be reunited with a family member and you can sense the fear and anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move.<br/><br/>The plot is riveting. Rarely do you see a historical film that is as much of a work of art as The Grapes of Wrath is. The story will take you into the Great Depression years ago and give you a glimpse at what a poor family during that time might have gone through. The timing of the script is great and will have you hoping for the main characters to be able to keep their home some way or at least find a nicer one. The plot allows for many emotional performances.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and professional. It proves that not only the cast and actors were perfect for the jobs, but the crew must have been as well. There are no shaky shots and there are no scenes where something is out of view that should be able to be seen by the camera and there are no scenes that were too zoomed in that you couldn't see anything. The camera pans between characters based on who is talking.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested in history. Although this film is long (over 2 hours), there are no boring or dull parts in the film and it is definitely worth taking the time to watch it. Also, this film was made in the early 40s and it is in black and white. Even if you usually don't like or watch black and white films, I would recommend that you watch The Grapes of Wrath. This would also be an excellent film to show in history class when teaching about The Great Depression.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent classic film that I would recommend to anyone regardless of whether or not they enjoy old films or black and white films. This film is worth the 2 hours that is takes to watch it because the acting, plot, and cinematography are phenomenal. The emotional scenes were executed to perfection and will leave you feeling sorry for the characters. The plot will have you interested in the beginning and the cinematography makes it easy to understand and see what is going on in the film. Overall this is an excellent film and deserves 10/10 stars."

"mizzcaramel33","7","3","3","27 March 2011"," A testament with the wrong moral..
","The Grapes of wrath is a film based on the novel written by John Steinbeck. The film follows a family westward as an exodus of lower class families are forced out of work and their homes due to the firm hand of ""the man.""<br/><br/>While several cinematography elements used within the film, such as the use of black as white as well as some camera tricks, elevated the 'run down' feeling of the Joad family it is my feeling that although the film was an homage to the novel it did not capture the intended thesis of Steinbeck.<br/><br/>Throughout the plight of the Joad family the movie focuses simply on the obstacles and hard times that only the Joads had to encounter. I feel the lack of the strong sense of a community in the film really detracted from the moral of the book. The book has a strong lesson of the ""I"" becomes ""we"", whereas the film lacks the sort of artistic ability to really capture that phenomenon. The film puts forth a plot of the Joads against the world and the most important and striking part of the book was realization that a community of perfect strangers had come together, bonding over their nothingness and had become a greater 'fambly' of their own; a unit to reckon with. <br/><br/>It is because the Director's cut of the film failed to bring to screen Steinbeck's message of the human nature: of a people coming together when they have no means of living and yet there they are - still fighting the silent fight. <br/><br/>While the film has an impressive cast of actors and several other noteworthy aspects of the film which are quite beautiful when speaking the film in parallel with novel, the film has fallen short. This could justly be because of the times period and other circumstances but in short while this film pays homage to this timeless literary work the film is due for a remake with the world being in a place where one is not fearful to expose the truth. To truly honor Steinbeck's work this must be done."
"ironhorse_iv","9","5","6","17 October 2012"," Tom Joad will be there and so will this movie for you
","I'm will be thereâ€”to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are theseÂ… it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity."

"Artimidor","9","4","5","21 August 2012"," Just a taste of Steinbeck - flawed, but great enough
","John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" undoubtedly ranks among the greatest works of American realist literature. It stands as a testament of the Great Depression era where tenant farmers of the dust bowls suffer under drought, then are brutally dispossessed and driven from their Oklahoma homes, forced to find their luck elsewhere. In the end all they have is themselves, as the trip to find the blessed land California demands a heavy toll, is accompanied by tragedies and setbacks and the outlook is bleak in the face of the greed that exploits honest workers to make a buck. John Ford tries the impossible - to go for an authentic rendition of the multilayered, detail packed, all around magnificently written Steinbeck material, and definitely succeeds in delivering an indispensable heart-wrenching film portraying the never ending struggle of the Joads. Any direct comparison between book and film however is moot, enjoy both for what they are. On board in this road movie of the existential kind are Henry Fonda as an ex-convict, John Carradine as a disillusioned preacher and the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, all first-rate acting with strong support of an array of bit players who help the crude reality take shape. Highly recommendable! There are downsides, though. For one the two hours of screen time can barely correspond to the epic proportions of the novel. However, the entry is still much more complete than Kazan's adaption of Steinbeck's other epic drama ""East of Eden"", starring Jimmy Dean, which only shows a fraction of the story. The one real liability however is the diluted ending which was tucked on as a concession to the mass audience while Steinbeck's epic hits you with full force. Well, if you want the real thing, read the book. With the film you get a pretty good taste of it."

","This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as ""Ma"") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as ""the Preacher""). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.<br/><br/>I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the ""Okies"" had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement.

","The Grapes of Wrath, starring Henry Fonda, is a raw depiction of the Joad family's displacement from their home and journey to find work and start a new life in California. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that moved me the way The Grapes of Wrath did. The director, John Ford, along with cinematographer Gregg Toland used the timing of natural light to capture the raw images and create an almost documentary-like look. The actors wore no makeup to maintain the authenticity of their characters, and many scenes were shot on location in the areas the family travels through in the story. In this current era of big-budget films with stunning special effects and high-definition visuals and audio, it is refreshing to be riveted by exceptional screenplay and execution by the actors. From the beginning of the film, when Tom Joad is introduced as a man re-entering society after a stint in prison, you are transported to a time when the environment in America was rapidly changing. The great depression was in full swing, and class lines were being clearly defined, with rural Americans dropping to the bottom of the food chain. The Joad family, who for generations lived and prospered off of their land, were being forced to leave by big business and mechanized faming, leaving them with very few options for prosperity. Following a lead for employment in California, the entire family packs what they can fit into their truck and sets off on the long and dangerous journey. There is a particularly poignant scene when Mama Joad (Jane Darwell) is going through her belongings, deciding what was valuable enough to take, and what needed to be left behind, where you can feel the apprehension and sadness through the screen. That scene solidified how Jane Darwell won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role. The Joads were simple people, who worked hard and knew nothing about the world that they were being forced into. At many points along their journey, they are mistreated and judged for being rural Americans. In a scene where the family stopped at a gas station, when they pulled away, one of the attendants looked to the other attendant and said ""they ain't people."" That line encompassed the general attitude towards families like the Joads during that time period. Not only does The Grapes of Wrath provide viewers with an illustration of life during the depression, but the movie gives the timeless lesson that hope along with the bond of family will persevere in the end."
"signalshd","Null","2","2","13 January 2019"," Film about Dignity
","The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford. It is based on a novel written by John Steinbeck. The story follows the plight of the Joad family during the 1930's in Oklahoma. The family is impacted by the return of their eldest son, Tom (played by Fonda), as he returns from a stint in prison at the same time they are being evicted from their land as a result of the ""Dust Bowl"" drought and the Great Depression. The film explores the conditions and displacement that many midwestern tenant farmers endured during this period.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this film is dignity. Tenant farmers during this period were evicted from their land due to a long running drought and the advent of mass agriculture. The drought caused the farmers to lose income and not be able to pay the landowners. Simultaneously, the ability of machines like industrial tractors and combines decreased the value of the tenant farmer's labor. This swirl of devaluation was exacerbated by the Great Depression. The film shows how this extended to entire families being so devalued that they essentially became refugees in their own country.<br/><br/>For example, there is a scene where the patriarch, Pa (played by Russell Simpson) enters a diner at a gas station and asks to purchase a loaf of bread for 10Â¢. The waitress curtly replies that this is not a grocery store and they don't sell bread by the loaf. She then adds that, even if they did, they only have 15Â¢ loaves. Pa movingly asks if he can buy 10Â¢ of a 15Â¢ loaf. His sincerity and dignity in that scene are apparent. He is clearly a man not asking for charity but compassion.<br/><br/>The film's portrayal of a family struggling to maintain dignity is what makes it so timeless. Although the specific incidents may not resonate for every viewer, it is possible for anyone to empathize with a family fighting to stay together and lead meaningful lives in a chaotic environment. Also, the notion of technological advances displacing communities and tearing apart families has been seen in this country many times since the release of this film (use of robotics in manufacturing, globalization, etc). The Grapes of Wrath gives the viewer a glimpse of life in the Midwest during the 1930's. However, its timeless theme of maintaining dignity during periods of upheaval and its questioning of how society should treat workers displaced by technology make the film relevant today.

","Great drought has brought endless dust storms into the state of Oklahoma. Many families have been driven from their homes by banks looking to reap profit despite the miserable conditions. As such the Joad family packs itself onto an aging truck and sets out towards California in hopes of finding a Golden Land. Based on a novel by the same by John Steinbeck, although I've been led to understand that the book is a lot more depressing and politically minded than this film. And if that's the case, what a depressing book it must be. Because the film isn't exactly a ray of sunshine either.<br/><br/>And yet it is a triumph, in a sense. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell play the leads as Tom Joad and his mother, and in them crystallize the themes of the film. All good things will end, nothing lasts forever and when hard times come, it's up to us to pick ourselves up and journey through them. Individual humans may falter, may fall, may perish, but humans as people have always survived. The film has some truly great monologues and speeches about this, and as an overall film it's all about that willingness to rise up, to bear the load, to survive. The Joads travel from one tragedy to another, and it is truly heartbreaking, but yet they endure. And that's what matters.<br/><br/>The film also questions the basic necessities of life. When it matters, what do we need? We all need to eat, we all need to sleep. And if those basic needs are fulfilled, what then? It's natural for us to look after ourselves, including our families, perhaps our closest friends, but it takes something extra to care for anyone else. And yet, that extra caring has a meaning. Is that meaning needed, warranted or even essential? That's the question.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath shines as a rare gem. A film brilliantly acted, brilliantly told, with brilliant themes. If you aren't moved by this film, one has to wonder."

","This is a beautiful looking film with lots of wonderful acting performances! It's one of the rare times that a classic book has been turned into a classic movie, in my opinion! John Ford really captures the essence of the novel, even if some big parts are left out. And when Henry Fonda delivers that ""I'll be there"" speech near the end, well that's just cinema gold!

","Even though good books rarely ever turn into good movies, the Grapes of Wrath sheds such a belief with beauty and charm. Granted, the acting may have been hokie in some parts, but the message is clear: the world is full of haves and have-nots. This is easily one of the few `old' movies I could watch on a regular basis. Even after all of the suffering the Joad family goes through, the clinging hand of hope still firmly hangs on. Certainly one of the best films ever made."

","I hesitated before writing this, because I really didn't much like this movie, and I assumed at first that it was because I find its politics so appalling.<br/><br/>But the more I think about it, the more I realize that even cinematically, I found it compelling only on a purely visual level (Ford's movies are always at least visually compelling).<br/><br/>I think Ford spent so much effort trying to make his characters into symbols that he failed to make them people. At no point did I care whether the Joads made it to California; the deaths of the old folks made no impression on me. The villainy of the local cops and those who ran the work camps was much mitigated by its obvious artifice. The only emotion any of these people inspired in me was a deep desire to punch that self-righteous jerk Tom Joad right in the mouth--which I don't think was what Ford was going for. I have to admit that I did like John Carradine, but I always like John Carradine.<br/><br/>And when the Joads drove into that federal government work camp, and it was like arriving in heaven with an obvious FDR lookalike (sans wheelchair, of course) as God, I completely lost it. That was about the unintentionally funniest thing I've ever seen in a classic film.<br/><br/>Am I just too cynical?"

","Painting a gritty yet authentic portrait of family life ravaged by economic hardships, The Grapes of Wrath covers the strenuous ordeal faced by one family as it struggles to keep itself together when everything around them is falling apart. Steered by John Ford's assured direction & powered by a couple of stellar performances, it remains one of the most memorable works of its era.<br/><br/>Set during the Great Depression, the story of The Grapes of Wrath follows Tom Joad who's out of prison on parole, only to find out that his family has been forced off their own land. Managing to reunite with them eventually, Tom & the Joad family set off to California in search of better work, opportunities & a hopeful future but face one misfortune after another, each testing their strength.<br/><br/>Directed by John Ford, the film doesn't even try to sugarcoat any of its events and brings back the gruesome memory of living through the Great Depression for its viewers. There's constant friction between hope & hopelessness in the script but it is deftly written & wonderfully balances the arcs of its characters. Ford's direction also makes sure that the narrative is always on point & not tread around the edges.<br/><br/>The production design team & location setting work in tandem to recreate the era that devastated thousands of lives while further assistance comes from its smart camera-work & patient editing to help the movie achieve its desired look n feel. But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda & Jane Darwell, especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Grapes of Wrath is tragic, heartbreaking & harrowing but, despite its bleak appearance, it isn't entirely devoid of hope & optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a strongly-bonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed, deftly written, brilliantly performed & culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues, The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended."

","In what has to be one of the greatest adaptations of a novel ever, we follow the Joad family, and more specifically their ex-con son with a heart of gold made infinitely likable due to an outstanding performance by Henry Fonda. This is the kind of film you just don't ever want to end. Nunnally Johnson does an incredible job making John Steinbeck's words ready for the screen and John Ford never fails to do justice to the narrative. When a character performs a longer dialog, you can tell you're seeing it with the same impact readers felt reading it. When Tom Joad walks across a lonesome road under the dim blue sky of an early morning you just have to imagine Steinbeck was proud of the people who worked so hard to bring his work to a new medium.<br/><br/>The story of the Joad family is a rough one. It begins with Tom fresh out of prison for what is described as self defense. It seems hopeful, but this is the last good fortune he'll see for a long while. Upon finding his family displaced and staying with an uncle, he learns that they've been removed from the farm where the Joad family had been sharecropping for decades. Their seemly only hope is a sizable journey towards California, so they load up a 'jalopy' far past its breaking point to set out on a trail ripe with misery in hopes of rebuilding. You start out rooting for the Joads, how could you not? But the film subjects them to a myriad of misfortunes along the way. Your hope turns to pity quickly, but you can't help but appreciate how much you admire their courage. It's remarkable how much I came to feel for the Joads. Tom is an outstanding protagonist, and you're with him till the very end.<br/><br/>A film with a story this great would do fine without being technically impressive and pleasant to look at, but those aspects are wonderfully done too. The film looks incredibly crisp. I didn't manage to forget it was black and white, but I couldn't take my mind off how great it looked. You can see every mark on a person's face, every detail in Tom's scar, and California's ugly brown hills and beautiful green pastures are both presented just as they are to this day.<br/><br/>I genuinely loved this movie. It had such an emotional impact. It was hard seeing the Joad family suffer, and it was such a relief to see them finally catch a break. Tom Joad was such a great character that by the end of the film he actually felt like a brother. The film really makes you feel like a Joad yourself, looking back at the family's history. I've been lucky enough to see Cannery Row on a few occasions, and I've seen with my own eyes the fields that the migrant workers of the time would have gone to in search of work. It gave the film a great impact. I'm glad I took the time to watch something so well done that I enjoyed so much."

","Those shacks with their scrawny kids and threadbare mothers are right out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay of the Great Depression. Now, I'm no particular fan of director Ford, but he does nail this social protest film, which remains an affecting classic even 70-years later. Production notes indicate Ford had to battle TCF to get as much realism into the movie as he did. Yet, without those revealing touches, the dramatic impact would be sorely undercut.<br/><br/>What impresses me is the similarity of conditions between then and now, that is, between the great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession (housing bubble) of the 2000's. Instead of a stock market collapse and a rural Dust Bowl, our era has seen a collapse of housing prices and a loss of jobs that has wiped out trillions in home-owner wealth. The collapse has created a new class of dispossessed as banks move in to repossess overdue mortgages. At the same time, the unemployed hope to find a job before government compensation runs out.<br/><br/>In the movie, uprooted families pack up and move west to new horizons, living in tumble- down shacks along the way. Nowadays, uprooted families are either homeless or live in cars, there being scant new horizons to move to. Meanwhile, nameless bankers and Wall Streeters hover in the moneyed background, profiting off the general misery from behind gated communities. The movie goes easy on the contrast between the few rich and the many poor, but the implications remain embedded in the screenplay, especially when the sheriff evicts the sharecroppers from the land.<br/><br/>This brief comparison is not meant to be political. Rather, it's meant to suggest that certain economic dynamics are still with us, even 70-years later, a parallel making the movie's social topic as relevant now as it was then. Of course, as yet there's no Steinbeck or Ford to dramatize the plight in the moving way of the novel or the film. But then, this new era of collapse is still pretty young.<br/><br/>The film itself remains a triumph of casting, staging, and scripting. It's really Ma Joad's (Darwell) film, her strength and sensitivity a stand-in for migrant resilience as a whole. I'm so glad Ford refused to prettify her appearance in any fashion. Fonda too provides just the right humorless edge, that of a good man rendered an outlaw by onerous conditions of the time. Carradine's preacher may be the most interesting of the characters. Having lost ""The Call"", he's a lost soul amidst the general collapse of all that was familiar. Yet, he retains the capacities of a visionary leader, someone who can help guide the new Israelites into a land of milk and honey. It's part of the movie's tragic sense of dislocation that his new understanding is cut short. <br/><br/>Among many memorable scenes, my favorite is the kids at the roadside diner. The hash- house waitress is a typical sassy type, used to fending off jibes from weary truckers. So, when the deal-making Pa Joad comes in with his two hungry kids, she's at first resistant. But then with the cook pushing, her resistance gives way to the humane person underneath. At the same time, the sentiment proves infectious. And instead of the diner losing money by befriending the needy Joads, the truckers leave a sizable tip. In short, a layer of everyday life is peeled back to show a seldom seen solidarity beneath.<br/><br/>To me, not everything is roses. Ford shows his penchant for broad character humor with Grandpa Joad (Grapewin). I know Grandpa is supposed to be borderline senile; however, his overdone antics threaten to undercut the movie's concern with realistic effects. Also, the waitress's scene ending tribute to the generous truckers is unnecessary. Letting the audience grasp the humane gesture would have been more effective.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, these are small blemishes within a beautifully wrought canvas. My lingering image is the final shot of Tom as he crosses the skyline, a silhouette of the reformist spirit now loose upon the land. My hope is there are many Tom Joads still among us."

","While the movie was still controversial for its time, it was too censored to fully convey Steinbeck's message. The movie reorganized the scenes so that instead of the Joads going from Hoovervilles to the government camp (Weed Patch) to the boxcars they went from Hoovervilles to the Ranch to the government camp (Wheat Patch). They changed the order in the movie and took the hard-hitting tragedy of the book and made it into the feel-good-movie-of-the-year. This censorship happened with many scenes in the movie. The Joads, in the book, ended by fleeing from flooding boxcars to the sanctuary of a damp barn while in the movie they leave a clean, nice government camp to go get 20 days worth of work while driving off into the sunset. The movie also completely leaves out the ending of the book where Rose of Sharon gives birth to a stillborn baby and then has to flee with some of the family to a barn to get out of the ""wet"". When they reach the barn she nurses an old man dying of malnutrition. This is a very powerful ending that was completely written out. <br/><br/>Another major criticism I have for this movie is the lack of emotion and connection. When grandma and grandpa die in the movie, the audience feels nothing; there was no emotional connection between the audience and the characters. I also feel that by leaving out the land and by not connecting the land with the people we lose a crucial part of the story. Not once in the movie do we see a peach.<br/><br/>The censorship of the movie destroyed Steinbeck's message. The book has a strong message of community, working together and building relationships to get through hard times. Steinbeck's way of saying this was ""I"" turning into ""we"" and if the ""we"" didn't form than everyone would fail. The movies message was that the Joads ""are the people"" and the people live on and that they were winning because they were still surviving. <br/><br/>I do understand that if the movie wasn't censored it would never have been produced but I feel that if you cannot do a novel like The Grapes of Wrath justice then don't try."

","What a powerful and moving story this is!  Steinbeck's novel of the harsh conditions that were faced by the migrant farm workers during the Great Depression is brought to life in a very convincing way in this movie.   What is especially good is how the victims are portrayed as real people with real faults and passions.  Tom Joad was a convicted murderer whose past crime is trivialized because he was drunk when he killed another man in a fight.  But yet, he was basically an honest man just wanting to make his way in the world without causing trouble.  The preacher is a fallen man whose sin destroyed his faith.  In the book, Grandpa was a vile and obscene man.  The mother put up with all the faults of her family as she fought to keep them together.  They were real people who were simply caught on the wrong end of the stick. <br/><br/>Life was very hard at that time, and unfortnately the ""have nots"" were at a serious disadvantage.   Human nature being what it is, there are people of all political stripes who will take advantage of one another in the name of economic necessity. <br/><br/>At the same time, the movie shows the real struggle of people on both sides of the problem when faced with limited resources.  One fact of life is that those who are most educated and know how to work within the system are the ones who are best able to survive.  This movie is excellent at showing the struggle of one family who is unfortunately caught up in forces that they are unable to understand and are unable to get themselves out of.  It's more than a story of ""good poor people"" versus ""bad rich people.""  It also shows the real fears of the land owners who did what they thought they had to do to protect their rights and property from an invasion of homeless and hungry people.<br/><br/>The person who wrote the review here saying that George Bush stole the election seemed to be writing his own ""sour grapes"" of wrath.  There was no stolen election.  His swan song about the glories of the Clinton economy ignores the fact that it was the previous administration's climate of moral decay and ""it's the economy, stupid"" policies that created the environment for all of the Enron-type corporate crimes that are just now being uncovered.   He blames the current administration for the recent recession but evidently doesn't realize that the economy had been heading for the tank during the last year of Clinton's watch; it is now coming back under Bush. <br/><br/>
I only mention these inconsistencies because it is tempting to view this film as a condemnation of conservative politics, when it is nothing of the sort.  The person writing that review is simply irresponsible to suggest that a George Bush presidency fosters the same conditions that caused all the suffering depicted in The Grapes of Wrath.   Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter:  Those who own wealth will do whatever they can to keep it, while those who don't will do what they have to do within their means to get it.  Some people are just more honest than others in how they go about it. That's the human condition, and this movie depicts it in a very powerful way.<br/><br/>Watching the movie, you can identify with the hopelessness of the Joad's circumstances.  You can also identify with the hope that no matter how badly they get pushed around by forces they can't control, they will ultimately survive.<br/><br/>
Very highly recommended.  IMO this is Henry Fonda's best role!"

","I am deeply thankful that Gregg Toland walked the planet and found himself to me in multiple projects. Its somewhat easy to pocket his presence when in the company of a great director. Its why you need to see something like this where his influence is so obvious it is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Ford isn't a BAD director, so much. He's actually something of a genius in taking life and simplifying it into one or two tosses of simple objects, then framing those simplifications in an effective way. His films work, pure and simple. But that's what they are, pure without challenging ambiguities. And simple in the sense that so-called conservatives politicians mime.<br/><br/>Once you escape the pull of those simplified values you see that his films are a huge waste, fake values manufactured only to support a story strategy; values that have since taken on their own selfish lives.<br/><br/>And here. The story is vapid. The acting trite (excluding Carradine) and offensively staged. Its actually demeaning as if these people suffered not in vain because they can ""teach"" us something. Suffering is suffering, not lessons. <br/><br/>But you won't see the frustrating reduced, artificial here, even with all the obsolete stagecraft. Its because Toland has rendered this so with such remarkable richness that the art of photography overcomes the thing. He captures nuance that Ford cannot see. His documentation surpasses the fact that it is film extras and constructed sets in front of the lens; the lens sees beyond that and gives us genuine pathos, disconnect. Its never in the parts manipulated by Ford in the foreground, but the background elements, the world in which our little play is staged.<br/><br/>There's something about the quality of the film that I think we will never see again. Even the Coens, when trying to reproduce the textures in ""Man Who Wasn't There"" Had to shoot it in color and print it in black and white. In a few years, it will all be digital. It may even look like this sometimes. <br/><br/>But what was happening then, in Kane, here, was that there were chemical memories being formed in catalyzed emulsions in a device, while a master of that device had similar chemical processes working in his brain, and he was able to coordinate the two.

The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song ""If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me."" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them."" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help."

","The Grapes Of Wrath is an interesting, beautifully-filmed, powerful movie, but a story so marred by obvious liberal bias that it takes away from the presentation.<br/><br/>GOOD NEWS: With the fabulous black-and-white contrasts here, I wish John Ford had directed a bunch of film noirs because this sure has the feel of one. Great photography. Henry Fonda is the lead character and does a fine job as usual but Jane Darwell steals the show as the matriarch of the family. John Carradine almost does the same with his ex-preacher role. The scenes of the family all piled on this old jalopy is one that will stay with you.<br/><br/>BAD NEWS: This film was way ahead of its time, left-wing-wise, and it's no wonder it's still such a favorite with the liberal/secular population. Let's start with the ""preacher."" Right off the bat, we get the typical Hollywood fallen preacher role in which the man has lost his faith and then admits he doesn't have a clue. Later, he gives some of his theology which no Oklahoma preacher would ever believe in. For example, he has no idea what grace is. <br/><br/>Then we have another modern-day Hollywood staple: everyone in authority is portrayed as a ruthless, sadistic thug, from the cops to the leaders of the camps.

","Forget the politics behind the stories of Steinbeck or the politics of films of Ford. What truly lies at the center of this classic American film is not a socialistic message but rather a universal message; one that says that all people suffer in one way or another and it is the defiance and resistance that separates us from anyone else and our ability to choose not to take this lying down.<br/><br/>The story is well-known: the Joad family is forced off their Oklahoma farm along with thousands of other Dust Bowl victims and decide to move to California in search of jobs and wages. Along the way they encounter kindness, hatred, peace and anger. There are times when the tribulations they face in California are more difficult than trying to survive in the Midwest, but push on they do led by the recently-paroled Tom, played quietly and most effectively by the great Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for her role as the mother who also does her best to try and keep the fit together despite serious situations that could force them apart. Every other role is well-cast and adds a rich realistic tone to this movie that only makes you feel even more for these people who are just trying to get by each day, hoping for some sort of break or providence as a sign.<br/><br/>I can see how this was such a politically-charged story but I don't think Ford intended that to be the priority of the film. Rather, I think it can all be summed up in the words of the two gas attendants early in the film. One says he thinks Okies have no feelings because no human would live like they do. Really, he was complimenting them as they believed the same way and this whole movie is about them attempting to rise above that which they were previously part of and become part of something better or at least more substantial.

"Lechuguilla","4","7","17","24 November 2014"," Misrepresentation Of History
","This hyped classic has a number of problems seldom acknowledged by reviewers and serious film historians. Only the first 45 minutes or so take place in Oklahoma. Well over half the plot is set either on the road or in California. This is a curious plot structure for a film about ""okies"".<br/><br/>Very few of the Oklahoma scenes were actually filmed in Oklahoma. Indeed, the Joad farmstead and surrounding landscape look nothing at all like Oklahoma; these scenes were all filmed in California. In point of fact, John Steinbeck was born and raised in California. His novel is based on second-hand information, distorted even more by a Hollywood cinema machine interested only in money.<br/><br/>Viewers have come to assume, implicitly, that Steinbeck's book is factual. It is not. The story is fiction. The Joad clan is fictional. Their journey to California is fictional. The specific worker camps are fictional. The only elements of the film that are based on truth are the era setting and the struggles that most people from the Great Plains endured during the 1930s. That part is real.<br/><br/>There was genuine hardship and suffering. But it's a mistake to assume that everyone who migrated to California during that period were as destitute as the Joads. I personally have ancestors who lived in Oklahoma in that era; some moved; some stayed in Oklahoma, but none were indigent. The Joad's decrepit car is a symbol of the film's visual misrepresentation, in addition to the fake Oklahoma landscape.<br/><br/>The exaggerated impoverishment of script characters results from a Hollywood establishment eager to send a political message about social class inequity, a way to manipulate viewer perceptions. But the downside to that manipulation is that it has had a profoundly negative effect on Oklahoma and other Great Plains states in the subsequent sixty years. The resulting cultural bias against these dust bowl states has caused damage that far surpasses the damage done by nature and the economy. Such is the power of Hollywood and the gullibility of viewers to trust filmmakers.<br/><br/>That said, the film's B&W cinematography is quite good. The story is rendered mournfully bleak, largely as a result of Gregg Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and dim lighting. The song ""Red River Valley"" is ideal for the locale and era. I also like the absence of actors' makeup, which adds a subtle touch of realism. Casting is acceptable and so is acting, except for the two most elderly of the Joads (Grandpa and Grandma), who overact dreadfully. Their portrayal of old people is insulting.<br/><br/>I consider ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" a Hollywood sacred cow, critically untouchable. But Steinbeck and Hollywood combined to do far more damage to the dust bowl states than the hardships that actually occurred. The cultural residue this film has left has been most unfortunate."

","(part of 30 essays I'm writing on what I consider the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order)<br/><br/>The film begins quietly. The time: The Depression. The setting: The Dust Bowl. The screen is filled with empty space, lonely and windy, as the camera keeps its distance from all of the characters. A man convinces a truck driver to give him a ride, even though his boss doesn't permit it. Finally we see their faces up close. The hitchhiker is Tom Joad (Henry Fonda). Some way to their destination Joad tells him he just got out of jail. The truck driver gets nervous. Joad says ""Bet your just dying to know what I was in for, well I'll tell you."" It's his stop. As he gets off, he yells behind him ""Homicide!"" He got into a fight with a man when they were both drunk, and the other pulled a knife, and Joad killed him.<br/><br/>This is how we are introduced to ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" a dark, lyrical and beautiful film that seems light years ahead of its time. An outspokenly socialist film, one may be surprised to find out the director, John Ford, was a republican capitalist. He did leave more of the incendiary parts from the book out, and toned down much of the original books anger, but there is still much of the same work here. The film is sad and gripping in the way it handles scenes like the one where they bury the grandfather on the way to California. His wife wants to buried with him, but they have to continue. Hundreds of miles away in California, the grandmother dies and they bury her. The sadness in this scene is underplayed, without too much weeping or excessive Hollywood-like tragedy, and it works. Death has become something these people are used to. But the depression destroys them in the way it separates them. Separation is something they are not used to, because they have lived in the same place for generations and generations.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath follows the Joads, who are kicked off their land and whose homes are destroyed like everyone else's, to make way for a huge field that will profit a wealthy landowner. Some refuse to leave. One man hides out it the fields, his family gone to California, not accepting he has to leave the land that was fought for and built by his great great grandfathers. When Joad encounters him, he is a little insane.<br/><br/>The Joads, like many other families, get fliers advertising work for farmers in California. So the 9 of them and Casy the ex preacher (played brilliantly by John Carradine) pile into one truck which they worry could break down any minute. On the way there, they are warned at a camp from a man who received the same flier, and says they gave out twice as many fliers as they needed men, the work was taken, and if you did get it they would put you under inhuman conditions. They head on anyway and arriving they find he is more or less right. Once in, they are not allowed out, and are guarded by armed guards who tell them they will shoot them if they leave the house when its not work time. Joad escapes and finds Casy trying to organize a union. For doing so, he is shot by cops as he stands surrounded, with his hands raised. Joad helps the whole family escape.<br/><br/>The next time they are incredibly lucky and are taken in by an FDR lookalike who treats them benevolently and kindly, and offers good pay. Just when it seems everything is going to turn out, Tom Joad's past catches up with him and he has to run away, alone. He bids farewell to Ma Joad (Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar for best supporting actress):<br/><br/>I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beating' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eating' the stuff they raise and living' in the houses they build - I'll be there, too. <br/><br/>So will we, Tom. So will we."

","When I first saw this in the 1970's I was an impressionable teenager and it affected my social thinking greatly. The performances stayed with me for years, and the power of the film too. I read the book and it showed how great a film they had made from a long, wordy, social tale. Recently re-watching the movie, it looked fresh and just as powerful as when I first saw it. Henry Fonda, John Carradine and especially Jane Darwell, give career heights performances and they add truthful weight to the characters. The story challenges the way we treat migrants and how we force them to be what we think they might be, in England we have a lot of this in recent times. All the character parts are effective, for example the caretaker of the government camp, who at last shows some understanding of the migrants problems and quietly helps them settle in. Unfortunately he is virtually the only kind soul the Joads meet on their journey. It is a solid drama, never adding any comedy or music to heighten the action, sticking truthfully to its source. I am sure Steinbeck was proud of this version."

","I think it is most ironic that independent filmmakers claim to despise ""the Hollywood"" film in favor of making ""personal cinema"" when one looks at the films of perhaps the most Hollywood sytem ingrained and yet stunningly personal films of John Ford.His films hold up because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting and searing narrative.I agree with many of the other IMDB reviewers, there is much in this film that is pure leftist propaganda and that Reifenstahl and Eisenstien's influence can be seen.  This is certainly true in the masked stormtrooper bulldozer montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another. The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionism. There are so many frames that could stand as works of photographic art. The look of the film stands proudly next to the work of Benton, Hopper, O'Keefe, Capa, and Bourke-White as examples of American visual art.The cast is uniformly honest, sincere and utterly real in thier inhabitation of character. John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from a Actor's Studio graduate.Enough can not be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American pop culture icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.The script captures much of the best of Steinbeck's novel with fantastically illuminating and human quotes. It preaches to be sure, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many ""serious"" film makers have yet to learn.The film has not dated in terms of its impact on the heart. Grapes of Wrath is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense, it transcends nationalism and is fine work of World Literature. It is on equal with Citizen Kane as one of the finest films ever made. A 10 out of 10."

"avik-basu1889","7","2","3","2 June 2016"," An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!
","The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford from a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was the film adaptation of the very well known and renowned book of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film like the book is set during the era of the Great Depression in the 1930s and follows the Joad family from Oklahoma as they deal with poverty on their way to the 'promised land' of California after being thrown out of their own land and property.<br/><br/>The themes of the film revolve around the concept of the loss of home. After the Joads get uprooted from their home like many other farmer families, they head out for California in their truck. This truck becomes their mobile home. They become wanderers in search of a real home. It is unreal how the issue of migrants that enrich Steinbeck's novel and Ford's film is still extremely relevant to this very day. We see the local officials mistreat, mislead and exploit them and all the poor migrants like the Joads go along with it with the hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. The Darwinian concept of the 'survival of the fittest' also comes very much into the equation. Once the Joads leave their land, some members of the family lose their grit, hope and conviction like Grandpa, Grandma and Pa, while on the other hand, the misery and sorry plight of the circumstances emboldens Ma and makes her the source of strength for everyone including Tom. Tom Joad is a very interesting character. He starts out as the angry loner. He then comes into contact and becomes a part of the family unit. But the misery and struggles force him in an ironic sense to re-embrace the identity of the outlaw loner to bring about a change. The purity and sweetness of the mother-son relationship between Tom and Ma is given a lot of attention by Ford and Johnson, even more so than Steinbeck did in the novel.<br/><br/>Ford's direction in the film is understated and not very flashy. There are moments of great artistic imagery, eg: the 3 shadows trampled by the tractor marks, Gregg Toland's brilliant cinematography under Ford's direction involving shadows specially in the scene where Tom and Casy meet Muley, the brilliant shot where the Joad family leaves on their truck bidding adieu to their home and Ford decides to hold the shot a few seconds longer after they have left to show the wind, dust and garbage blowing towards the house,etc. Ford's direction in the scenes in the Transient Camps is absolutely brilliant. He uses the moving camera from the perspective of the Joads to introduce them and the viewers to all the other migrants. The other aspects of those scenes involving the hungry kids are very touching.<br/><br/>But the film I thought is flawed. First of all, clearly due to all the restrictions that films of that era were plagued by, there are a lot of crucial aspects of the original novel that get watered down a bit. I am certainly not someone who gets annoyed when the film is very different to the original source material because I have the maturity to understand that cinema and literature are two completely different fields. But I do think if the political aspect of the novel was explored more boldly in the film, it would have worked to its benefit. Another aspect of the film that put me off a bit is some of the hokey nature of the written lines. Nunnally Johnson's writing at times gets too cheesy and overt. The overt nature of some of the lines spoken by the characters might work on the page of a book, but on screen, it does stick out in an ugly way. The acting by the ensemble cast is also a bit too theatrical at times which made it difficult for me to maintain a constant emotional attachment with the characters. <br/><br/>Although the quality of acting is not consistent from everyone, but Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Qualen as Muley are the ones who stand out. Fonda accurately conveys the repressed anger and frustration that makes up Tom's character with moments of touching emotions. Darwell is as likable as ever as Ma. She exudes a caring and loving quality that is impossible to avoid. She also plays the character with some strength as Ma does in a way become the backbone of the family after they leave their home. Although John Qualen has a peculiar appearance, but the power of his performance forced me to really empathise with Muley's pains and struggles.<br/><br/>'The Grapes of Wrath' is not flawless. In my view it has its fair share of issues much of which was down to rigid restrictions that were imposed upon the films of that era. But even with its flaws, it still is a very solid John Ford film which made me feel for the characters. Just like the novel, it forces the viewer to put themselves in the shoes of the central characters and live the struggle with them."

","Watched ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" (1940)<br/><br/>Short Review :-<br/><br/>Not a film but an Inspiration to beat out tough time, because ""We are The People"". John Ford is the man who does it and who else it could have been. He brought possibly the most inspirational film for people in the beginning of 40s decade. Next year he also brought another people's film 'How Green Was My Valley"" and these 2 films changed some people's lives forever. When you make a film from experiences of people gone through tough times it becomes mandatory to end the film on high note and if it's inspirational then there's no stopping. The Grapes of Wrath is just not a film, it is something more than that. I can imagine how people would have reacted to the film in 1940 if i am reacting so enthusiastically in 2020. A story of poor family who have been thrown out of thier own land and how they battle out all the difficulties will surely leave you with an heart wrenching experience. In a feature film aspects, The Grapes of Wrath is work of a genius, truly. There are some brilliant scenes in the film that will force to you take a note that this kind of genius filmmaking was done in 1940 and anyhow you have to believe it. Acting of the long studded cast is fantastic but Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are too good. The writing seems fantastic even after excluding few scenes from the novel. Dear John Ford why you so awesome? How did you manage to pull out an inspiring tale in early 40s like never before? That last speech of Tom Joad while leaving the family and Ma Joad's Inspirational words in the last scene will always stay with me. ""I'll be around the dark, I'll be everywhere"" and ""We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out"". Inhale with pride and i am done here.<br/><br/>RATING- 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

","In which John Ford holds up John Steinbeck's black mirror to America at the end of a decade which started with the Stock Market Crash, continued with the Great Depression and ended with the nation contemplating its world position as Europe entered into war. The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.<br/><br/>The story is naturally episodic but the simple journey that the Joad family has to undertake to the much heralded promised land of California after being evicted from their land by the bank gives the movie a natural flow, although with this tale there are many more ebbs for the family to endure.<br/><br/>My criticism of other Ford films has sometimes been the sentimentality and forced masculine humour he frequently inserts but there's no room for either of these traits here. The nearest we get to one of his familiar tropes is the weekend dance at the ""clean"" government camp at which the Joads eventually arrive and are for the first time treated humanely by the staff, but even amongst the high spirits there's danger in the wings as the state troopers seek to gatecrash the party to make an arrest.<br/><br/>While there are twelve in the extended family which first hits the road, there are only eight of them alive by the time they reach the relative safe haven at the end as the elderly grandfather and grandmother expire on the journey and two others drop out. The main characters though are Henry Fonda's Tom Joad, the family matriarch Ma Joad played by Joan Darwell and the idealistic lapsed preacher Cristy, played by John Carradine. They each come to very different ends but the film does at least conclude on a vaguely optimistic note with stirring speeches of defiance and even hope by Fonda and Darwell, both of which in fact were interpreted by the soon to be all-powerful House Un-American Activities Committee as evidence of a Communist propaganda subtext.<br/><br/>Oscar-nominated Fonda is excellent as the combative, already road-hardened Tom, just released from jail for killing a man, who soon becomes the head of the family and so supersedes his father and his father in the hierarchy. Darwell won the Oscar as the Mother Earth character whose indomitable spirit drives the family on while Carradine memorably portrays a man who has lost his faith and who now channels his energies into human rebellion.<br/><br/>Ford (and screenwriter Nunnally Johnston), even if he does bend to the box-office by editing and tweaking events in the book to afford at least a smidgeon of optimism at the end, treats the text in a starkly realistic almost quasi-documentary style as befits the seriousness of the subject matter, aided in this by the masterful black and white photography of the acclaimed Greg Toland. The sense of abject poverty is manifest in the way Ford and Toland frame their cast's often gaunt portraits against dark skies and blasted landscapes.<br/><br/>This classic movie is a literary adaptation, history lesson and cry for social reform all rolled into one."
"emmagersten","10","1","1","20 January 2020"," A window into the life of migrant workers in the 30s
","The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 Hollywood movie and is based on the book written by John Steinbeck. It was adapted for the film by Nunnally Johnson and directed by John Ford.
The film's main focus is on the Joad family's survival during the great depression of the 1930s. The film is in black and white which lends itself ideally to reflect the gloomy times and life circumstances of the main characters; they are poor tenant farmers, suffering from terrible climate catastrophe that destroyed their land and livelihood. The process of brutal bank repossession of the farm and eviction of inhabitants was presented in its entire cruelty, showing no regard for the dignity and destiny of its long-term occupants and their survival.
The film opens with the two main characters: Tommy Joad (played by Henry Fonda), and Jim Casy, a preacher and Tommy's friend, driving by some fields and talking about share cropping. Tommy discloses that he has been just paroled from prison where he spent 4 years for killing a man at a bar. That later puts him in a legally sensitive position. Returning to the share cropping land in Oklahoma where Tommy Joad and his family had worked for generations, he was immediately told that they are no longer allowed to work on those lands. After much effort to resist, the Joads join the caravan of other from Oklahoma on the journey west to California that advertised jobs and opportunities. That made them feel hopeful for their future.
The film follows their journey to California, where not everything is great: some family members die and some lose their spirit in addition to their descent into poverty, some split from the group, people quarrel and fight, the living conditions are horrible, people sharing sad stories of helplessness, low pay and more hopelessness. Jim Casy is very honest about losing his faith while still reminiscing fondly on his past time as a preacher. Both Jim and Tom reflect passionately on the conditions, the fairness and social justice.
The tragedy of this film is watching their long trek not result in a better life. Still the film includes scenes where people manage to dance and sing and cling to hope and stay loyal to land and farming.
What I really liked about this movie is that it made me consider parallels of poor living conditions of people under capitalism versus the powerlessness of masses of people under communism. In spite of sad circumstances people in the movie were free to move and pursue happiness. Compared to the amalgamation of modern movies I've seen the characters were very authentic and much easier to connect with.
The movie was one of the best overall that I've seen. The absence of CGI was also surprisingly refreshing because it makes you just focus on the people, the acting and the story. I haven't seen any other films from this era which makes me not want to give it any kind of star rating."

","""The Grapes of Wrath"" is considered one of the top pieces of cinema to ever be created, and even when viewed for the first time 80 years later, it's not hard to tell why. In the movie based on the book by John Steinbeck, we see the reality of what many American people faced. Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, is a wayward man, on his way home from prison to reunite with his family. Once home, he discovers that his family has been pushed out of their home by the people who own the land. The family, reunited with Tom decide that they can persevere and will relocate to California, where jobs will be plentiful, and money and housing will not be an issue. They decide to take Jim Casy (played by John Carradine), the old ex-preacher, along for the journey with them.
The Joad Family along with Jim Casy quickly discover that the American dream they were hoping for was not as easily attainable as they previously hoped. It seems that they are struck with hardship after hardship, beginning with the death of multiple family members during their journey just travelling, followed by lack of jobs, lack of food, questionable living conditions, and unfair treatment by employers. In one particularly shocking scene, Connie, father-to-be of Tom's nephew, runs away from the family, unable to deal with the pressures of the working camps, leaving his pregnant wife behind.
It seems as if the Joad family's misfortunes will never end. At one of the camps, ex-preacher Jim Casy finds himself involved in what is most likely the beginning formations of a union. Workers are forming strikes to protest the unfair monopoly the food store has over the workers of the farm. Both Jim and Tom find themselves amidst the strikers on one fateful night at which point Jim is struck dead by an officer. Tom retaliates back by killing the officer and running away, but not before getting struck in the face himself, leaving him with an identifiable scar. As the police begin their search for Tom, the Joad family decides to try again, and they pack up in search of the next camp.
At the final camp, it seems that the Joad family's misfortune may be over. Government run, there is plenty of work, food, showers, and even dances. It seems that everything may just work out for the Joad's until the police eventually come by looking for Tom, who has violated his parole by killing the officer at the previous camp. Tom decides it will be best to leave his family permanently to avoid them getting in trouble for hiding them. In a touching scene, Tom says his final goodbyes to his mother and reflects on his time with Jim Casy, the ex-pastor, deciding that he would like to follow in his footsteps and seek out some form of social justice. The two bid goodbye and the next day, Ma (played by Jane Darwell) heads out to work with Pa and delivers perhaps one of the best executed speeches in the whole film, discussing how despite the trials and tribulations the family has faced, they keep surviving and will continue to survive no matter what.
Ultimately, it is the movie's telling of the story, produced by Nunnally Johnson, that makes the movie resonate as strongly as it does. Though perhaps the acting seems a little over the top years later and the accents were hard to follow and understand, the ultimate portrayal of resilience that makes Americans American is a message that still instills a sense of pride in anyone who views this movie. Overall, I would give this movie a solid 8 or 9 out of 10. It is certainly easy to understand how and why this is still an ultimate classic of American Cinema."

As nightmarish as any science fiction movie about a distopian future, and yet when it was made it was an historical movie of the recent past, set in the brutal reality of 1930s America during the Great Depression.
Henry Fonda returns from prison to find his family nolonger has a home and the share cropper world he knew has become the wasteland of the dustbowl, where fat cats in big cars pass the buck while the ordinairy folk scratch at the dry dirt in frustration and starve.
A flat, featurless landscape, scoured by dust storms, that leave a haze through which headlights and torches cast ominous shadows, exagerating the gaunt twisted faces and inbred misshapen ears of it's haunted inhabitants.
In images reminicent of the Terminator movies, bulldozers ridden by faceless figures in gas masks roam the land, demolishing everything in their path - but the faceless figure behind the wheel turns out to be another fellow farmer trying to feed his family.
Hank and co travel ""Beverly Hillbilly"" style across the country, along the way there are acts of kindness between individuals, but as a group they are resented as outsiders by locals, who fear suffering the same fate.
There are shanty towns and farms run like prison camps, angry mobs, police state border controls, man hunting, incidents of inhumanity and humanity are all woven together expertly by John Ford in this master piece.
Fonda is at his melancholy, lean, long legged best, John Carradine is also a standout as the preacher who has lost his faith and Jane Darwell won an oscar for her portrayal of ""Ma"".

","When John Steinbeck wrote THE GRAPES OF WRATH it became a highly controversial book, which eventually became a highly controversial movie. For my money it's a near perfect film. The direction by two time Oscar winner John Ford is spot on. He tells his story and it moves along at a very brisk pace. One thing I always find that bothers me most about older films is that the pace tends to lag, a result of the film not aging well or it never had a good pace. This film, upon release, was highly successful and earned several academy award nominations including nominations for best picture and best actor for Henry Fonda. Fonda plays Tom Joad, a man on parole who returns home and discovers that his family has been driven off their land and now must leave Oklahoma and head to the promise of work out in California. The film has a dark view of life in the depression, but to view it any other way in regards to this family's story would be doing Steinbeck's material a great disservice. The family has to struggle to stay together. Grandma and Grandpa are quite old when the journey begins; Rosasharn is pregnant and, to leave with them, Tom must violate his parole. The characters in this film are very relatable because of the idea of family. We can all relate to the various things the characters do to help the family and sometimes to get away from it. One of the films biggest assets is Jane Darwell's touching performance as Ma Joad, a wise woman who is the glue that holds together the family unit. This is a film that must be seen, it's a true landmark film and a cinema classic."

Every detail is made important, like the clothes condition along the movie, the despair that increases in every face, the familiar ties that responds to every fact. Every detail tells the story in a way to make the spectator take place on the happenings. Special attentions to the constant use of shadows, which almost play as another group of characters. <br/><br/>Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine are absolutely great but fit in the story in a way to lever the shinning of all the other actors/characters. <br/><br/>Finally, it's a crazy idea, but it seems that the people in charge of ""The Walking Dead"" had in this movie a great playbook to guide them in a way to produce the story of a group of hopeless people trying to survive every new day in a society that has just been reduced to ashes."

I never have been able to really distinguish between on-scene location and on stage. But, in this movie, surprisingly I was able to because of the echoing. But, the lighting in that scene is awesome! It really captures that its later in the day, going on evening, and there is a storm coming. The camera work is pretty basic.

Those migrants who resisted exploitation were sometimes viewed (and treated) as ""reds""; local police (or private security agents) were too often used to intimidate or quell resistance. <br/><br/>Steinbeck's criticism of such exploitation of workers led to banning the book in some places although it became quite popular through most of the US and led to reforms. Henry Fonda's role as Tom Joad earned his stardom; Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as did John Ford for directing.<br/><br/>Steinbeck was very critical of an economic system that allowed such mistreatment of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by wealthy land owners, bankers, etc., (supported by local officials wherever the owners/bankers resided). But while the movie piles worst case on worst case, IMO it's a fair view of how bad things sometimes got in the Great Depression era (1929-40). <br/><br/>I spent 2 summers (1949, 1950) in the Bootheel of Missouri working in communities of former sharecroppers who'd been evicted from their jobs and their shack homes in circumstances parallel to that of the Okie families. These evictions happened when the owners of the cotton plantations, after receiving federal agricultural subsidies for NOT growing cotton, decided to keep all the money for themselves by evicting their farm families (January, 1939), making thousands homeless.<br/><br/>The tenant farmer/sharecropper system was based on the land owners providing substandard housing to farm families plus advancing them credit (in their company stores) for food, clothing, and seed. In return the farm families planted, tilled, and picked the cotton. But their share of return from the cotton harvest was never sufficient to get out of debt to the store. The system made the farm families, in essence, indentured servants. Until they were kicked out.<br/><br/>While the motivations (land owners' greed, farm families' struggles to survive in extreme circumstances) and conflicts were very similar to what the Okies experienced, the resolution of this Bootheel crisis became far more uplifting and inspiring than the struggles without victors presented in the ""Grapes of Wrath."" But almost certainly, the popularity of this book and movie helped lead to such a different outcome in the Bootheel only a few years later.<br/><br/>This video describes the Bootheel situation: http://www1.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=148227<br/><br/>By Googling ""Sharecroppers Strike"" and ""Cotton Patch Moses"" you'll find a number of links that describe this Bootheel crisis, its conflicts, significant people, and outcomes."

Throughout their journey one by one family members are lost; through death and separation.

"RT Firefly","Null","8","22","20 October 2005"," A valiant effort, ruined by socialist exaggerations.
","I hesitate to write a bad review of The Grapes of Wrath because I know that to many people who view it apolitically, it is simply a very well made drama. To such people my criticism may seem merely like muckraking. If, however, you are observing the misinformation that the premise of this film is built upon, then I believe it legitimately fails. I understand the poetic license that artists take to make a good story, and I am willing to grant that license. However, I feel that, when tallied, this film's erroneous statements go far beyond the pale of poetry and cross into the realm of propaganda and silliness. It's the difference between ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" vs. Charlie Daniels ""In America"". The former inspires me, the latter is a joke.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie that bothered me was its disconcerting take on morals. It begins, fittingly, with someone being mocked for obeying a rule. Henry Fonda, a murderer just out on parole, berates a truck driver for obeying a rule that prohibits him from giving rides. What if Fonda had hijacked him, would the truck driver be a prude or an idiot? In the next scene, God gets the ax. Fonda comes across a disillusioned vagabond, the family's ex-parson. He brags that his sermons were emotional hype and confesses that he liked to sleep with the women that got caught up in ""the spirit"" at his meetings. Now, he says, he has lost hope. He does not state this as a fault, so much as it is confusing to him why ""the spirit"" has left him. Strangely, this later state of the preacher is looked upon by Fonda as being clairvoyant. Everything that happens in The Grapes of Wrath happens within the context of morality being a relative thing, certainly one devoid of divine appointment. Everything from lying to murder is excusable if done by the right people or for the right reasons. A few examples: <br/><br/><ul><li>Upon seeing Fonda out of prison, most of his family is hoping he broke out. His parole comes as a disappointment.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The murder he was sentenced to seems irrelevant.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sharecroppers are willing to kill the owners of the land to stop them from evicting them (they don't because it ""won't do no good"" not because it would be morally reprehensible).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>(slight spoiler) Fonda murders another man for murdering his friend, and Fonda's mother not only excuses the murder without knowing what her son's motive was, but offers to cover it up by hiding her son.</li></ul><br/><br/>I, personally, have a hard time rooting for such protagonists. I also found Fonda's character to be too abusive and insolent many times.<br/><br/>Overall, I find the authors socialist overtones clichÃƒÂ© and cockeyed:<br/><br/>Its opinion of authority is comical. All cops are evil thugs, all employed towns people are absentee cowards, all successful businessmen are thoughtless criminals, and essentially everybody in the film that has employment are only out for themselves and their first impulse is always to be rude and uncaring.<br/><br/>The film's opinion of how people treated each other in the '30's is askew. No doubt, some people where cold and heartless, that is a given at any time, but where are the good people? There is not a single group or individual (with any means, that is) helping any of these people, esp. children? Where are the soup kitchens, churches, etc..? The premise of the script is built upon this nonsense. Quick research into the Great Depression will reveal a contrary reality. People where mostly very kind and helpful to each other. It's how we survived as a country. Many other countries turned to anarchy.<br/><br/>Its opinion of progress is very cockeyed. The tractors are pictured as giant evil job gobblers. In reality, modernization made it so poor people could get better paying jobs and live a much higher quality of life.<br/><br/>Its opinion of what role religion plays in American life is cockeyed.<br/><br/>Its opinion of land ownership is cockeyed. If I rent land, and the owner wants to take it back, that is part of my contractural agreement. Oddly, it appears the farm owners were actually doing them a favor by getting rid of them. If they were not successful, their grandparents should have thrown in the towel decades before. But I am expected to sympathize with this.<br/><br/>Its opinion of how the government helps people is not only cockeyed, it's backwards. If anyone is guilty of screwing people and taking away their rights, it's government. Reality is so much different that this issue becomes a farce. In one scene, the only thing missing from the government run workers camp were angles playing harps. You may argue that Roosevelt's WPA helped people, but many scholars argue that it actually prolonged the depression.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the ""Okie migration"" is not factual as presented here, Google the topic to find out. For example; the migration of the Midwest was transpiring since the teens. The bulk of it occurred in the 40's, not the thirties, as employment became abundant in California due to WWII. There are a plethora of other non-truths in this script. So much so that the movie was protested by many people in California. Steinbeck grossly misrepresents the facts.<br/><br/>I could go on much longer, but I am limited to 1000 words. All of this is not to say The Grapes of Wrath does not have good and valid points about how we should help people and think of them before profits. I just think they are lost in an ocean of deception and lies. As a movie making effort: 9.5 out of 10. As a whole: 3 out of 10."

","This powerful film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford chronicles the Joads, a family from Oklahoma, driven from their home by greedy bankers and corporations after their livelihood was ruined by the dust storms of the mid 30s. These storms displaced around 500,000 people, many of whom went to California looking for work. This caused a serious overage of pickers and workers in that state and many of the displaced ended up and starving and suffering in squalor in miserable camps. Steinbeck chronicled this misery (his own version of Les Miserables) in Grapes of Wrath, which was adapted the following year for the screen. Henry Fonda took the role of Tom Joad, which turned his career into gold. All of the adults in the cast performed marvelously, from the crazy grandpa dreaming of squishing around in grapes, to Casey the former preacher who just wasn't sure anymore to Ma, (who won an Oscar along with John Ford for the film). The overwhelming message pounds home the misery of these people, the poor treatment they receive at the hands of the government, police and big business and how unions and worker rights are the solution to these ills. <br/><br/>This movie is like bran muffins. Not just regular bran muffins, but bran muffins where part of the oil/butter has been replaced with apple sauce to make them more healthy than they already are. At first you are a little bothered and afraid that the taste will be diminished by the alteration, but it's not, they taste just as good, and the muffin provides lots of fiber for your health and little fat to make it guilt-free.

Maybe the ""academy"" should take a lesson from the regular folks. At least we are fair with our voting."
"krorie","10","3","6","5 March 2006"," One of the greatest films ever made
","John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" stands tall in the history of cinema. Many critics would say it is the greatest Hollywood film ever made, even better than Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane."" Whatever stance the viewer takes, it is a must-see movie. A few scenes in this masterpiece were actually shot on location around Sallisaw, Oklahoma. Though many from Oklahoma were offended by parts of the book and film, especially calling the Joads ""Okies,"" others realized what Ford and the author of the book, John Steinbeck, were presenting. The Joads are depicted as honest, hardworking salt of the earth Americans knocked down by Old Man Depression and the Dust Bowl, not as ignorant hillbillies as some believe. The so-called respectable agricultural conglomerate heads and big businessmen are the ones shown as malevolent heartless persons, with the law, especially hand-picked deputy sheriffs, being represented as brutes and murderers. Sallisaw today honors the movie and the book by having a Grapes of Wrath Festival each year.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda in a role of a lifetime--and he knew it--turns in his best performance. In one of the great film portrayals of all time, Tom Joad, Fonda is able to capture the essence of this set upon human being who is trying to survive in a world he never made. Pulled apart by society's pliers, Tom speaks for the common people with heart and soul. The viewer knows that this young man with somewhat of a chip on his shoulder who is easy to rile, often responding by violence, is destined to return to the prison from which he was paroled, McAlester, or one just like it. He is admired because he will never surrender, never back down, fighting to end injustice and exploitation of the working man. Amazingly Fonda did not become type cast as a result of playing Tom Joad and went on to play many diversified roles and start a cinema dynasty with controversial Jane Fonda almost equaling her father in acting ability.<br/><br/>Though Tom is the main character in both the book and the film, he is not the hero. That title belongs to the indomitable Ma Joad, who is determined to keep her family together come Hell or high water. She too won't back down but she is also filled with Christian love and charity for all God's creatures, even the despicable and cruel. Jane Darwell deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actress for her brilliant performance as Ma. Her final dialog in the battered old truck heading for Fresno says it all. The rest of the cast, consisting of John Ford's regular troupe of actors such as Ward Bond, is fine tuned to the nth degree. John Carradine's key role as Preacher Casy is exceptional as is John Qualen's graveyard ghost Muley Graves.<br/><br/>Director John Ford, who also copped an Oscar, with his cinematographer Gregg Toland captures on film the face of hunger by visualizing what it is like to be dispossessed of one's heritage. The most telling image is that of the Joads standing up to unbridled greed when the cats are pushing over their homes. The camera pans away from their defiant figures, a dusty wind whistling through their hair, to focus on their shadows. The wind-blown shadows are all that is left of their previous lives. Their homes gone. Their families torn apart and scattered. All their worldly possessions abandoned. Now they must look westward to California for what they pray is a new beginning.<br/><br/>Modern viewers find it difficult to understand how ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered so controversial that John Ford and his crew had to shoot it in a surreptitious manner. John Steinbeck's socialistic message was watered down somewhat for the movie, but it does peek through every now and then. Tom wants to know, ""Who are these Reds?"" In those days being associated in any way with the labor movement could get you branded a Communist, even if you did not know what a Communist was. The ending was also changed to make it more upbeat and optimistic. <br/><br/>The music is sufficient to convey the feelings and emotions of the Oklahoma refugees, especially the main theme ""Red River Valley."" One of the high points in the film is when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) sings the song to his mother when all are finally having fun once more at the big dance in a New Deal migrant workers camp. Yet had John Ford the foresight to utilize the talents of Oklahoma native Woody Guthrie for the songs the musical score would have been a masterpiece. Woody did write his own score inspired by watching the film. His ""Dust Bowl Ballads"" are among the artistic triumphs of the 20th century."

","As I write this, there has been rioting in the streets in Argentina and Brazil, rioting by the African and middle eastern immigrants in France and here in the US, tens of thousands of the poor remain displaced from their homes following Hurricane Katrina. A line from one of the best films of the year, ""Secuestro Express,"" sums up perfectly all these people's common problem.<br/><br/>""Half the world suffers from malnutrition, the other half from obesity."" <br/><br/>Even though it was made 65 years ago, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is still relevant today, for the grinding poverty depicted in this film and the struggle to overcome it --in some cases just to survive it --remains today the all consuming battle for a large portion of the world's population.<br/><br/>We should not forget just how controversial John Steinbeck's novel was when it was first published all those years ago. Called socialist propaganda by politicians and branded a pack of lies by the big California farmers, the book went on to achieve great acclaim. Yet it and stories like it will always be lightning rods for controversy because they dare to suggest that what separates the halves and have not's is not always just how hard people are willing to work. Some of those who work the hardest --and there may be no harder work than stoop labor --wind up with the least.<br/><br/>Plenty of good hard work went into the motion picture version of this story of Dust Bowl immigrants of the 1930s trying to start a new life in California.<br/><br/>The film, of course, was the work of some of the best in Hollywood. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the industry's greatest producers, adapted for the screen by Nunally Johnson (Jesse James), photographed by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane); staring one of the screen's greatest actors, Henry Fonda, backed by a remarkable cast of character actors including Jane Darwell and John Carradine, and helmed by a candidate for the honor of Hollywood's greatest director, John Ford, this film was assembled like a fine Swiss watch, which is probably why it continues to tick today, well over half a century later.<br/><br/>Ford was at the top of his game when he undertook the project and its brimming with his unmatched visuals, thanks to the camera-work of Gregg Toland. From the opening shot of a solitary figure walking down a highway towards a diner, to shots of the Joad family, piled in their jalopy truck, passing through an Indian reservation in New Mexico, to the film's signature shot, as they wind their way through a transient camp outside Bakersfield, California, Ford and Toland use the camera to advance the idea that these are people on an odyssey, a search for a better life in a sometimes beautiful, but often hostile environment. Many directors are capable of making pretty pictures. Ford proves in ""Grapes of Wrath"" that you can tell a compelling story without a word being spoken.<br/><br/>But like all great movies, from Murnau's ""Sunrise"" to Coppola's ""Godfather,"" this film is about a lot more than pretty pictures. The movie's words are powerful and haunting and resonate today. When John Qualen, playing the deranged sharecropper, Muley, describes how the Oakies have been pushed off their land by the banks; or when David Hughes playing a discouraged immigrant coming back from California empty handed, gives his dire warning about the perils the travelers face, you cannot help but be moved. And of course, there is Henry Fonda, who delivers his now legendary speech at the movie's end, as he sets out on his own to see what can be done about the plight of the poor. The screen may have never produced a better piece of dialog.<br/><br/>""The Grapes of Wrath"" continues to stand today as a landmark of American movie making and a film well worth the time of anyone who wants to try to understand what for much of mankind remains the most important struggle --the struggle for survival.."

","""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an inspired, harsh and critical retake on the Great Depression and its human fall out. While other studios were producing ultra high glamor and star driven vehicles, Darryl F. Zanuck chose to turn his spotlight on the crisis of the country and came up with an all time box office winner. It stars Henry Fonda as the forgotten man of conscience who is forced to leave his homestead in search of a hopefully better life that, sadly, is not to be. Jane Darwell is brilliant as Ma Joad, the defiant, resilient and compelling matriarch who keeps the family together through these tough times. Dark was the world of the 1930s in reality, but never was it more magically brought to life than in this inspirational film of hope, courage and the dream of prosperity that must have seemed so far out of reach at the time of the film's general release.<br/><br/>TRANSFER: Previous versions of this film have looked as though they were caught in their own dust bowl. This DVD managed to recapture much of the lost visual style absent in earlier versions. Greg Tolland's evocative camera work is magnificently captured. Black levels are deep. The gray scale, for the most part is well balanced and captures the stark harshness of the original presentation. There are a host of age related artifacts present throughout but these have at least been tempered and do not terribly distract. There is some shimmering of fine details and more than a hint of pixelization in this transfer. Nevertheless, the image quality is an improvement over previous incarnations. Somehow it almost seems to add to the vintage of subject matter of this film. The audio is remixed to 5.1 but really Â– this is a mono film with very little spread or reason for it across your other channels.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an enduring tale of enduring souls caught in the uncertainty of their times.

","This is a social conscience picture form the genres heyday. Although never described as such, the dust bowl was an American refugee crisis. Wrath follows some of the affected characters who are so poor they probably owe rent on their own skin. From the very first frame Gregg Tolands photography is amazing, whether it's simply a static composition or whether the camera is in motion.<br/><br/>John Ford, as Orson Welles has said, was an artist, but he's not particularly known for getting anything more than serviceable performances out of his corral. And usually any of the finer points of a performances are held a beat too long, or are notched up well past what is necessary, as are movies of the period.<br/><br/>But the real crime here is that the film's ""nobility of the common man"" pap is piled upon itself so high that a viewer begins to suffocate. A little of that goes a very, very very long way. I was shouting at my TV - ""Oh please, will you move on. We got your thesis! Everyone GETS IT!"" He also does this in They were Expendable. He does it in ""How Green was my Valley."" He doesn't do it in ""The Quiet Man,"" which is a movie I like. In this world poverty is the signifier of moral righteousness. Grampa Joad gumming his way through addled, irritating, overacted speeches, and Pa Joad going for a bath with his junk flapping around are thrills I'd prefer to miss.<br/><br/>As is the tradition in Amercan films, if a man over 70 gets in a car for a long trip he ain't going to make it. As was his style, Max Steiner selects a musical motif and beats you to a pulp with it. Here it's Red River Valley. The crew ends up at a Utopian work camp as unreal as the epilogue in Raising Arizona. But the conflict is still pretty accurate about how conservative reactionaries generate phony causes to dismantle any peaceful, progressive threat to their viability. And it only hints at what complete thugs conservatives will become."

","Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) has recently been released from prison and returns to his family home to discover that his family have been kicked off their land as it has been bought out by greedy developers. Joad and his family head to California to start a new life, but this journey proves to have more hazards and pitfalls than they could ever have anticipated.<br/><br/>The Grapes Of Wrath is a film adaptation based on the John Steinbeck novel. I'll start by saying that I haven't read the book, but I can safely say that the 'cinematic' version of the book fell well below my expectations....<br/><br/>For starters the film takes an immensely long time to get going (one could actually argue as to whether it ever gets going). The problem is that the first half is awfully slow and dull with very little happening to drive the narrative forward. To me, The Grapes Of The Wrath came across as a character-driven film but when the film is filled with uninteresting and poorly developed characters it became very hard for me to remain interested or give a damn about anything that happens to them on their journey to California.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is slightly better (in the sense that it has a bit more urgency about it). Although the better pacing made the second half more tolerable than the first half I still felt that the whole film had a superficial feel to it - we get to see glimpses of the suffering and pain that has been bestowed upon the family, but it's never really examined in much depth and this resulted in a film that just never seemed to take advantage of all of its potential.<br/><br/>The cast are all OK and whilst Fonda wasn't particularly brilliant here I appreciated that he tried to give the film some emotional weight (which again probably would have worked better if both the narrative and character dynamics had been stronger and more interesting).<br/><br/>So yes I didn't like this film but will say that this was more down to the slow-paced first half, poor characterisation and the missed potential in fleshing the story out and making it more interesting."

","The Grapes of Wrath sounds clearly like a propaganda film for the liberals of the 30s and 40s (Thankfully, John Ford became more of a conservative in his late days). It often tends to be ridiculous, as, for example, with the character of John Carradine and the camps of the government managed by kind people versus the bad guys of the private companies. It is definitely an overrated movie going back to the cinema's first steps. The movie has been filmed pretty much entirely in the Fox studios : the sound of the steps of Henry Fonda in the supposed wilderness sounds like being inside a studio. Avoid it and be proud not be part of the Politically correct bunch in this noble art of the movies!"

The story seemed to drag on forever, with each character contributing little to the entertainment factor of the film. I know that the subject matter of the film is very serious and important to the history of the United States but the film could have used some more editing and a lot more comedic relief."

The last prejudices are just like toys for babies, bones for dogs, something easy and inoffensive to focus the attention while the main, big attack is left untouched and unchallenged! In a way, those old american movies were thus more intelligent, assertive and free back then than today because i can't name a single recent movie about the poor, the exploited and the left-over of the American Dream while crisis and inequalities have never been so strong! <br/><br/>3) This old movie is like Missisipi Burning a precious proof for the case prosecuting America! So this country genocides natives, crushed workers rights, corrupts its politicians, makes war all over the globe, practiced slavery and segragation but ends up considered like the worldwide light of freedoom! Just unbelievable (and excellent propaganda)! Here the case is clear: money is the only value, reference to deal with people life, law is made for the rich and powerful and that's all! Thus destroying farms is lawful, mourning relatives and memories is a waste of time... In the same period, Soviets were into collective farming and they are the only bad guys! Honestly, in America, lands is owned by a few tycoons so i don't see a fundamental difference. In Germany, labor camps were built and those that we watched in sunny free California seems to be like them: workers behind barb wire, in barracks with the minimum of comfort and exploited to their death!<br/><br/>And for sure, Ma Joad is an exceptional angel, a unforgettable ray of light in this world of terrible darkness: a must see if you have human feelings!"

","The Grapes of Wrath is a touching movie of poverty and how the Great Depression had an impact on families. Families had land taken away from them even though it was owned for over 50 years. Companies came in and took the land from families leaving them with no where to live. They struggled to feed their children. They had no choice but to leave their land and find a new home. Some traveled all the way across the country to find a new home. Lives were lost along the way due to illness or sickness. The darkness of the film gives you the realization of how depressing those times were. How some homes were occupied by 20 plus family members all trying to survive. The way that individuals had to suffer to get to a free land of living was gloomy situation. The part when the kids were all playing in the dumpster and then fighting to get soup was real touching and portrayed the struggle of families trying to feed their children. People lived in tents and they got used to the struggle of survival. People just wanted to work and provide for his family and they worked for pennies just to feed their children. This movie helped me to realize the little things that we take for granted today. How land could be lifted up from under people and they were left with nowhere to go. Families that stick together can get through anything."

","Grapes of Wrath is a book to movie adaption. John Ford is famous for his westerns and his beautiful extremely wide angled shots of the western landscape. Ford infuses his love for wide angled shots in Grapes of Wrath and shows off the barren landscape of the dust bowl during the Great Depression. Ford's use of these wide shots gives the viewer a great idea into depth of field and is very easy to make the viewer feel like they are part of the scene. Character development is on point, we as an audience can become attached to these characters because we understand what they are going through. John Ford was the best director to capture the Joad family's journey across desert from Oklahoma to California in search of a better life."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","4","13 November 2012"," We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody ...
","Watching John Ford's 1940 masterpiece ""The Grapes of Wrath"" spares dozens of historical readings about the Great Depression. Through the absorbing realistically-handled journey of the Joad Family, sharecroppers from Oklahoma, the movie is a tacit homage to all the farmers who were kicked out of their own land after half a century, and by an enemy even more redoubtable because he was invisible. Call it corporations, banks, politics, it's impossible to point a finger on a responsible person, let alone a gun, all the 'Okies' are left with is a bitter resignation mixed with the hopes for brighter futures in California, the promised land.<br/><br/>Through its documentary value, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" works as the perfect contradiction to all the supporters of Capitalism as the core of American ideals. It's a film about the little people, those who had faith and lost it. The central character is Tom Joad, an ex-convict, released after four years. Joad was imprisoned for homicide but doesn't carry any regret, the 'victim' had it coming: he pulled a knife. Joad is the kind of more-or-less decent individual victim of unfortunate circumstances but learns to deal with them rather than whining. The second representative character is Casey, an ex-preacher played by John Carradine. The preacher lost the spirit, and it hardly surprises that it's Communism he embraces at the end.<br/><br/>An ex-convict, an ex-preacher, ex-farmers, the gallery consists of a bunch of people who 'used to be', and seem incapable to conjugate the life in the future. In a world where farmers are forced to leave the land they walked on and died on, what positive can ever be presaged? The fear ends up killing Grandpa Joad, and the grandmother doesn't outlive him for long. But one person doesn't fear future; it's Ma Joad, and Jane Darnell embodies the pioneer spirit, temerity despite exhaustion, with her droopy but magnificently scintillating eyes. When they live the farm, she doesn't give a last look for they're going to California, and she has no time to mourn the past. She's not braver than the others: the night before, she meditated on her own sadness, alone, but as the heart of the Joadses, it's her duty to exude the happiness the Family is looking forward. <br/><br/>The power of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is to vehicle its powerful and inspirational message through characters rather than facts. Ma Joad, through her eyes, smiles and spirit, incarnates the ferocious and so womanly attachment to practical stuff like eating, living, being clean, she's the unwounded soul of that crisis-stricken America. On the other hand, men are more inclined to think, to translate the facts into abstract notions, and ultimately to fight. Tom Joad is no more eager to become an agitator than anyone else, but the odyssey of the road 66, opened his eyes on the new face of America. Either facing the disdain or the support of fellow citizens, he understands that the salvation cannot come from the individual but from solidarity. His ""We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody"" almost sounds like a spiritual protest slogan.<br/><br/>It's even ironic that a right-wing conservative directed ""The Grapes of Wrath"", but the whole socialist and communist undertones were less taboo at that time. The film was adapted from the Pullitzer-prize winning novel of John Steinbeck, released in 1939, at the dawn of a worldwide conflict that put the Red Scare into perspective. Naturally, the farmer's contribution to the war efforts leaded them to a more prosperous state, from which their descendants benefited. But as a slice of the American life during the 30's, the film encapsulates all the desperation, the fears and the hopes of a population that stopped to believe in its own ideals. And now that the world is stricken by another crisis, with the financial system, and the most pervert side of Capitalism as responsible, it's time to look at ""The Grapes of Wrath"" with a new eye for the film is still relevant today, maybe more than when it was praised as one of the greatest American films of all-time.<br/><br/>And cinematically speaking, it's also a gripping adaptation that conveys the oppressive feeling of this era through a very powerful black-and-cinematography. There's indeed a magnificent contrast between the shadowy photography of the earlier scenes and the sunnier ones when they arrive in the campground in California. At one part, Casey makes a poignant preach implying that he found a new faith, his face hides in the shadow while his eyes are clearly seen, as to suggest a new lucidity, as if the use of lights allowed him to shine within his own words. The same goes for Henry Fonda during his memorable ""I'll be there"" speech, although the lines seem less spontaneous or more cinematic. And this is not to blame on the script but rather on Fonda who magnificently played a character full of anger and hopes, always distant but never unnoticeable, that's Fonda's charisma, subtle but irreplaceable, Fonda who should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for several other Oscars, it lost the Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" but won a Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darnell and Best Director for John Ford. The two awards are much deserved for Darnell is the heart of the film, and fittingly concludes it with her immortal ""We're the people"", you sure are, Ma Â… and John Ford who works each shot with an admirable craftsmanship. Many of them show all the Joadses in one frame as to continually sustain the idea of their unshakable unity, which is the kind of values that the film stands for: unity and solidarity.<br/><br/>Quite odd from an American film to celebrate these ideals, but this is what makes it such an endearing, timeless, and universal classic."

","Based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name, about the mid-west proletariat struggle during the great depression of the 1930's, John Ford's adaptation to film is a sweeping and emotional drama, displaying the problems entailed when a family are forced to move west in the search for work. Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), is travelling back to his homestead after five years in prison for manslaughter. On arriving back he discovers that his family have been evicted from the family farm due to a corporate take overs, and banks foreclosing on the land. So the only option is to travel to California, as they had been presented with a flier advertising picking work.<br/><br/>We follow the family through series hardship across the breadth of the USA. Deaths occur, and the working part of the family are mistreated and abused by ruthless business's, who have seized the opportunity to take advantage of the mass exodus of farm workers, making the ""pilgrimage"" from east to west. The film is an indictment of the times. Many families would have had to make this journey, mainly due to the greed of financial institutions (sound familiar?).<br/><br/>The film is majestically shot in beautiful black and white. The fact that it was filmed in studios does not seem to make the journey any less real.

The working classes will always be here, and will always be needed. The people are the most important functioning body in the world.

","The Grapes of Wrath (1940)<br/><br/>A John Ford, Gregg Toland masterpiece. Even if you don't like the social politics, which people in 1940 often did not (the government was helping the poor too generously and so forth), you have to love the movie. Henry Fonda is only the beginning of a series of tough, beautiful performances. And the series of heartbreaks is balanced by glimmers of hope.<br/><br/>Most of all, oddly, is that this is a cinematic masterpiece, tightly constructed, and seen (and photographed) with aesthetic intelligence. Maybe the most amazing performance is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who commands the role of an earthy, wise, smart woman fighting the disintegration of her family. She's quite astonishing.<br/><br/>Toland's photography is worth noting not only for the usual framing of the shots or the occasional moving camera (when it moves through the squatter camp, slowly, showing the parade of poor people, it's quite striking), but for his use of minimal light. This isn't some film noir effect, but a way of capturing the candlelight, firelight, and just dim night skies that were very real, and very effective here. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Dorothea Lange, the FSA photographer who set the framework for the visuals in this movie, is of a special order of photographer, visual but highly human and emotional. And empathetic. Ford and Toland manage to make this into a non stop moving experience, over two hours, and it's no small feat. The fact these are all actors, and yet they are so convincing, adds just another level of appreciation. <br/><br/>Yes, great stuff."

After traveling all that way with them, seeing them suffer, humiliated, spat on, you feel so much compassion for them. And the scene where Tom and his mother are dancing, and Tom is singing to her, that is pure joy. I don't know what Ford's politics were, but I remember reading somewhere where he is very conservative, and many of his film's deal with the frontier, rugged individualism and all, it's interesting that this movie deals so much with local corruption, exploitation and sides with the federal government and its programs protecting worker's rights.

"MOscarbradley","10","2","4","13 June 2008"," The Great American Novel
","Often cited as a prime example of 'The Great American Novel', John Stienbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was hailed more for tackling unpalatable political truths at a time when the nation as a whole would rather have buried its head in the sand, than for its literary merits, though they are many. In filming the book in 1940 producer Darryl F Zanuck and director John Ford pulled no punches; even seventy years on this extraordinary film still has the power to shock as American moves ever closer to the possibility of recession: it is just as relevant today as it ever was.<br/><br/>It's about the Great Depression, essentially about the Oakies forced off their land, initially by nature itself, thereafter by the banks which took over their share-holdings, and about their migration to California. It's a bleak, harrowing film with no real happy ending. Speeches by Tom Joad and his mother about 'how he'll be there when ever there is a fight so hungry people can eat' or about how 'they can't lick us 'cause we're the people' may have the whiff of optimism but 'not licking us' isn't quite the same as putting bread on the table. Consequently, the film's success has largely been critical and while Ford and Jane Darwell won Oscars the film itself was overlooked in favour of ""Rebecca"", (an oversight rectified the following year when Ford's far inferior ""How Green Was My Valley"" won Best Picture).<br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director it is unlikely the film would have been quite so grim. It's certainly not flawless; there is a penchant for Fordian sentimentality and the characters of Grandpa and Grandma never rise above caricature, but it's still remarkably faithful to Stienbeck's original and thanks, in the main, to Gregg Toland's superb black and white cinematography a good deal of it has the look of a documentary.<br/><br/>It is also very well acted. John Qualen's Muley is a beautifully etched study in despair and John Carradine has one of his best roles as 'The Preacher' who finds himself in the unlikely role of a union leader. At the centre, of course, are two great performances. Henry Fonda brings his gangly, liberal integrity to the part of Tom Joad which fits him like a glove while Darwell's stoic, Mother Courge of a Ma Joad rises above the sentimentality and the penchant for caricature into the realms of the truly tragic."
"mhflight","10","2","4","14 October 2007"," A depression era classic
","By the time John Ford begun filming his adaption of John Steinbecks' depression-era novel late in 1939, a whole decade had passed since the Wall Street Crash sent the USA spiralling into economic crisis, yet its effects were still very much apparent with many Americans out of work and short of the money they lost on the stock market. Film studios did their best to help ordinary Americans forget their troubles with lavish musicals and comedies of the screwball variety, but with this picture Ford used his remarkable movie making skills to document the true harshness of the situation depicted in Steinbecks' book.<br/><br/>The picture is given its much needed authenticity by the opening scene. On a bleak, dusty, open road in Oklahoma, we see Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) walking alone against a howling wind as he heads towards his family home (""We lived here fifty years same place"") for the first time since he was released on parole from the state penitentiaries (""You can't keep a Joad in jail""- Grandpa Joad). Here he meets Casy (John Carradine), a preacher who no longer preaches because ""I got nothing' to preach about no more"". We learn that decent, hardworking families such as the Joads are being forced off their land by the greed of the bank. Many such people have farmed their land for decades and yet their homes are being destroyed and they are forced to seek their fortunes elsewhere.<br/><br/>The story is a heartbreaking one, especially since the life that the Joads are forced to leave behind is all that they have known. Grandpa Joad (Charlie Grapewin) has to be forced off the territory by his own family- ""This is my land and I belong here...my dirt."" The family face an arduous journey to the promised land of California, a journey which has tragic consequences for them. Upon arriving at a campsite they find starving children and other families who are very much in the same boat. One telling moment comes when the Joads see their faces for the first time. All of these people look glum, hopeless and devastated. Their expressions reveal the hardships of life at the campsite- ""It sure don't look none too prosperous""-Tom Joad. The little work that is on offer is hardly enjoyable- picking peaches for five cents a box for example- ""a man can't make his dinner on that"". Furthermore, just as it seems the family have found a better place to stay for at least the time being there is more heartache around the corner-""I guess it had to come, sooner or later""-Ma Joad.<br/><br/>The film not only presents an unfavourable picture of the bank who force people to live like ""pigs"" but also the police who are brutal, and the first camp which is far more inhabitable than the next camp the Joads move on to. Here they are stunned to find the luxury of toilets, showers, washtubs and entertainment every Saturday night. The tone is overall very bleak but there is always a glimmer of hope-""We'll go on forever pa because we are the people""- Ma Joad.<br/><br/>The performance of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad is exceptional and he excels as the main character of the film whose flaw perhaps is his inability to restrain himself when he sees injustice before him- ""Whenever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there"". Jane Darwell is very effective as Ma Joad in an Oscar-winning portrayal of a highly sympathetic character who tries to hold the family together through the series of crises they face. Also worth looking out for amongst the cast is Ford favourite Ward Bond as a policeman.<br/><br/>The much acclaimed Greg Toland provides the films' impressive cinematography- he would famously work on Orson Welles' 1941 masterwork Citizen Kane. The film was cited by Bruce Springsteen as a big influence on his moving 1995 song 'The Ghost of Tom Joad'. Overall this is an excellent picture and it certainly made me think next time I face up to a problem- does it really seem bad when compared with what the Joads faced up to?"
"tsf-1962","10","2","4","21 November 2006"," one for the ages
","At first glance John Ford, a life-long conservative Republican, might seem an odd choice to direct the film of one of the most famous social protest novels in American history. The assignment was a success because Ford approached the novel more from the viewpoint of its human drama than its ideology. There simply isn't a more beautiful black and white film in the American canon. Gregg Toland's cinematography is exquisite; it's no wonder he went on to shoot ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Except for the fact that it uses well-known stars instead of non-professional actors, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" has in embryonic form all the stylistic hallmarks of Italian neorealism. Henry Fonda gives the performance of his life as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell won a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Ma Joad, the eternally stoic earth mother who keeps the family together in the face of insurmountable odds. My favorite character, though, is the renegade preacher, Jim Casy, played by John Carradine at the height of his acting career before his eventual slide into grade-Z horror and exploitation movies. The film's depiction of the persecution and oppression the Oakies faced in their epic trek to California is especially relevant in connection with the plight of undocumented workers in present-day America."
"jem132","10","2","4","16 May 2006"," Starkly realistic...
","...Well, as starkly realistic as Hollywood could get in the 1940's.<br/><br/>Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's amazing social novel is terrific. The atmosphere of the source material is brilliantly maintained. The thing that impressed me most was that the film wasn't glossed over in the Hollywood studio-style. Yes, there are some omissions in the plot to comply with the Hayes Code, but it's still very dark and realistic. The hungry children rummaging through the waste piles for a sliver of food is shockingly compelling, as are the machines sent out to destroy the farmer's houses, crushing them easily as the onlookers watch in disbelief. It feels authentic.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom Joad, the hero of the tale. Fonda's underplaying and sense of the 'everyman' suit his character perfectly. The supporting cast are terrific, and they are not glossed-over, either. Jane Darwell appears to have just jumped off the pages of Steinbeck's epic as Ma Joad. So many families made the journey from the Mid-West to California, the land of supposed 'milk and honey' (which the Joad's find out is not true), but the Joad's struggle feels very personal to us.<br/><br/>Very depressing in content- I had to watch this film in portions simply because it overwhelmed my emotions so completely. But the Great Depression was an awful event in America's history, and it's portrayed so accurately here. Students should watch this at school to realize how lucky they've got it now, and how dangerous it would be to fall into a recession once again (it would be different now, but still have the same effect on morale). This is draining to watch, but ultimately uplifting. Ford's direction is always convincing; Steinbeck's great work is in fine hands. The black-and-white photography emphasises the bleakness and realism.<br/><br/>10/10."

","The very first commentary on this movie says it all. Although I also was living during this disaster, for some reason I was not aware of its affects on my family, who came to this country with great wealth in 1924. By 1930, it was bankrupt; I kept wondering why we were moving from the big house to a succession of smaller houses on the same property, then entirely off of it. Mine was such a happy childhood, I can only surmise the loss of wealth did not register with me. I don't even remember being aware of it; by the time my family became being near penniless, I was the only child left at home - I was the youngest. My parents' battle to win it is a testimony to their resiliency and bravery. My dad became a master-carpenter, and helped build-renovate many homes his wealth had helped other people to obtain. My mother became the town-sempstress, sewing garments she would not have worn in earlier days.<br/><br/>I suspect I may had read ""The Grapes of Wrath"" shortly after its publication; I was a precocious child. I know of my family's travails only from other family-members, during the Great Depression which could so easily happen again, for different reasons. I doubt seriously if today's citizens of this country - and the millions of immigrants - could survive one. Reading other commentaries on this movie, I wonder how-and-who decided it is of a communistic theme - I must have been too naive to grasp it from the novel. Although they were worlds apart in their cultures, my mother certainly was very much like Ma Joad, both angels on Earth. I proudly associate the two; my mom put-away her aristocratic demeanor to help pay my dad's bills. Ma Joad BECAME aristocratic through her gentility and compassion. I am so happy I inherited many of my mother's characteristics, because lineage means nothing to me. It's the person-as-is I love.<br/><br/>""The Okies"", although they received much less sympathy than those hordes who cross California's southern border with Mexico, brought the same magic power to California, because they did the dirty work. We politically correctly say, ""that's work we won't do"" -hmmmmmm. One doesn't know what one would do, until a situation confronts them. Being retired from night-club entertaining, I view everyone as being equal: I often confronted individuals of foreign birth with unkind things to say about America. I could only smile and ask, ""If that is true, why is everyone in the world trying to get here?"" Many of the commentators on this movie have written cogently about it. There is not much more I can add, except to say it causes me to weep for the goodness of the people during those times, when they had every reason to be evil. I see no comparison in the quality of the film to ""Citizen Kane"", because that film is mostly fiction. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a true-to-life historical telling of real situations. They are rampant all over the world, and in some parts of this nation. Let's pray they can be alleviated for everyone's good.<br/><br/>I think Henry Fonda portrayed Tom Joad brilliantly, but don't see too much difference in his other roles. Perhaps he became a ""big star"" because of his cunning, to choose roles that would fit him. I agree with those who write the awarding of his Oscar for ""On Golden Pond"" was the culmination of a popularity contest. There is a dark rumor (in Hollywood) ""Pond's"" theme wasn't all that fictional; in true life, Jane and Dad didn't get along that well.....<br/><br/>Watch ""Grapes"" as often as you can - there are many great lessons to be learned from it. It deserves every accolade given to it, and none of the tacky criticisms - it is pure art that just happens to depict a dreadful period of our history. I can't give anything but high praise for all who had a part in its production. ""Happy are those who are persecuted because they are good, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs."" Mathew 5:10."

","Evicted from there land in Oklahoma, victimized by the double whammy of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, the Joad family loads up their dilapidated truck and makes the journey to California, joining thousands of others in the westward migration, seeking work as pickers in the California groves. John Ford doesn't let us forget what it's like to be destitute as the film details the belittling attitudes they endure at every stop along the way, eating away at whatever pride they have left. And when the torturous journey claims the life of Noah Joad (Frank Sully), the eldest of the family, his haunting and memorable burial along the side of the road provides one of the film's most riveting scenes.

","As a film of the 1940's, the Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and beloved work of American Literature.  <br/><br/>Even seen as a bit dated, the film harkens back to a time in American History when the government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for agriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees to California. They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.<br/><br/>This has to be the definitive Henry Fonda film.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath received two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with Oscar wins for both 1941's How Green Was My Valley and 1952's The Quiet Man, not to mention what I consider his greatest film ever, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne.<br/><br/>My rating: 2 and a half stars"

","The Grapes of Wrath is a must watch film due to its parallels to The Dust Bowl and The Great Depression of the 1930's. The movie also portrays thoughtful cinematography and excellent choice of music which brings the whole movie together. A major theme in the movie is the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a series of major winds and drought during the 1930's that spread throughout the southern US which led to the death of all crops and livestock. The main characters of the movie, the Joad family loses their farm to the Dust Bowl and travel from Oklahoma to California in an attempt to rebuild their lives. They encounter many struggles along the way and have little money due to their crops being demolished from the unforgiving winds. In 1929 the worst economic downturn in US history hit, the Great Depression. It began when the stock market crashed and immediately impacted the rest of the US. During this time unemployment rose to 25% and many people lost their houses, cars, jobs, etc. This major economic downfall is portrayed so vividly in the movie when you see the characters struggle to find a job to make enough money to provide for one another. The American dream portrayed during the roaring 20's is now gone and reality has set in for the characters knowing they may not make enough money to live. As well as it's significant connections to history The Grapes of Wrath also should be recognized for its flawless cinematography and music score. Director John Ford uses storytelling through the cinematography of this movie with subtle hints shown in every shot. During the scene where the caterpillar passes over Muley's house the cinematographer slightly pans to show the shadows of the farmers going through the tractor tracks. The use of the shadows portrays an underlying theme of defeat coming from the farmers, only putting the shadows in the shot left a feeling of emptiness in the viewer, exactly what the farmers were thinking in the scene. The music in this movie compliments the theme almost perfectly, with songs such as ""She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain"", and ""Going Down The Road Feeling Bad"" Alfred Newman does an incredible job of placing the music within the movie. The entire soundtrack of the movie fits perfectly with the theme of hopelessness and traveling West which enhances the entire experience of the movie. This films tie ins with major historical events and incredible cinematography and soundtrack make it a must see for anyone."

","The Grapes of Wrath gives us a look into what life was like for the displaced farm families and the migrant workers during the Great Depression. It does this by following the struggles of the Joad family, Midwesterners who lost their farm, as they try to make it to California and a better life. Overall, I found this film to be enjoyable in that it held my interest and made me feel like I was learning about an important piece of American history that's often forgotten. One positive aspect of the movie was the acting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a young farmer, and John Carradine as Tom Casy a former preacher. I was also struck by the perseverance and hopefulness of the Joad family. Even though one misfortune after another happens to them, they never give up hope. There seems to be a message here about how people can come out okay no matter how bad their situation is if they keep trying. On a less positive note, some of the travel scenes were a bit boring and could have been shortened."

","""The Grapes of Wrath"" probably could of been advertised as a documentary, had it not been for its narrative-style story-telling. The historical context of the movie's setting, characters, and conflict makes it seem like a genuine account of a farming family surviving after the Great Depression. At first, you're not sure if this will be a good movie, mostly because of the behaviors of Charley Grapewin and Zeffie Tilbury's characters, who come off as some sort of senile comic relief pair. Later on, however, you realize that the movie is shaped around the struggle this family encounters as they go West. Henry Fonda makes for an incredible lead role, mostly because of the fact that he's a criminal and the last thing you'd expect for him to act like a generic ""momma's boy."" It's his rebelliousness that also makes this character likable, seeing how we could of acted the same way if we were in his shoes. The dialogue is memorable, the shadows and sound effects really draw in the atmosphere of West, and the final speech(es) of the film tie everything together spectacularly. After watching this film, there's a cleansing feeling you get from seeing this film, as if all the worries of the world momentarily drained out in the past two hours."

","When you watch the opening credits of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" you'll see a veritable parade of legendary names in multiple areas of production: Fonda, Steinbeck, Toland, Newman, Ford. Living up to a lineup like that is a tall order but this film manages it.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with Steinbeck's novel, the story concerns a family of depression era farmers who are forced off their land in Oklahoma. They resolve to travel to California in order to seek work but are continually beset with hardships as their hopes are dashed time and again. The screenplay, adapted by Nunally Johnson, was rewarded with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The cast features Henry Fonda in one of his most iconic roles, that of recently paroled Tom Joad. He instills his character with a keen sense of justice, matched with the will to fight back when driven to do so. He was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to James Stewart for his performance in ""The Philadelphia Story"". I expect that was mainly due to Stewart losing out the year before for ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Jane Darwell, on the other hand, saw her Oscar nomination turn into a win. As Ma Joad, she was an effective counterpoint to Fonda's character. A couple of other standouts in support were John Carradine as a disillusioned former preacher and John Qualen in a small role.<br/><br/>In terms of technique, the film is practically flawless. John Ford's direction is impeccable and the Gregg Toland cinematography is excellent. Ford took home an Oscar for his work but, strangely, Toland wasn't even nominated. For that matter, Alfred Newman's stirring score wasn't nominated either (perhaps because it's mostly based on the song ""Red River Valley"").<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel but I know that the storyline of the film deviates from the novel somewhat, particularly when it comes to the ending. Ultimately, though, the movie's grueling enough already; I can't imagine it ending as miserably as the novel supposedly does.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", either, so I can't say whether or not this movie deserved the Oscar for best picture, though it certainly would have been a worthy choice. Simply put, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an essential American film."

There were some scenes that it was easy to tell that there was a painted backdrop ( for example when Tom is arriving back home for the first time, he is walking through a field and there's an obvious backdrop.)The fact that the director was able to create a convincing look at the dustbowl so soon after it occurred definitely speaks for his talent."

","Great Movie. ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" was known to be an outstanding novel. John Ford brings us his adaptation of it. This movie was so well done. One technical aspect was how great the photography looked, by cinematographer Gregg Toland, one of the best in the industry at that time period. John Ford gave this movie excellent direction, he conveyed good character development and the movie had movement and progression, both in the storyline, the core meaning and the character relationships. It's a sad movie made in 1940, but taking place in the 30's during the dust bowl, families are forced to migrate west to California in hopes of finding work. With thousands of families migrating, few can be accommodated. For the family of Tom Joad luck was rare. The emotions, mood and feeling that come from the very roundness and progressiveness is what makes this movie so desirable. Also the shot composition and lighting really helped me feel the mood of the story. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a very realistic and sad story of man vs. law and man vs. society. It shows us how the best thing to do is to stick together with your loved ones and you'll get by. This was such and inspiring influential movie."

I understand that the film is meant to show the struggles of families in the midwest during the depression and it certainly did a good job getting that point across.<br/><br/>I perked up at the very end when Tom told his mother that he was going to try and do something about the land and attempt to gather protester's, which would have given the movie a bit more action or just a specific direction.

","When I say this I don't mean in the sense of how accurately the film follows Steinbeck's novel; the film starts to stray from the books story around halfway through the movie. What I mean is the film is great on it's own and ,unlike most film adaptations of books, this movie kept most of the others message intact. The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff. I just think keeping to Steinbeck's original ending would have instilled to much ill feelings in Americans in a time where we needed some optimism. So great film, don't watch it though if you can't handle a little despair though."

","This film surely deserved being nominated in the Academy Awards. Steinbeck's message was butchered and the story of the Okies disgraced. These two viewpoints are both fairly accurate in their own respect. Indeed this is very entertaining and captivates its audience, but it also twists the story Steinbeck conveys in his book. Before considering whether or not to view this movie, you first need to know if it is the right match for yourself.<br/><br/>Entertainment: If you are searching for the perfect movie to sit back on a Friday night, maybe reminisce in the past, eat some popcorn, enjoy a classic movie, then you should continue reading under heading. This film did deserve being nominated for best film in the Academy Awards. Excellent cinematography and great actors like Henry Fonda and John Carradine set this movie apart and make the audience really feel for the Joads. After losing their family farm, the Joads set out as migrant workers on their way to California. They overcome adversity as the try to get settled and find work, despite the attitudes of the land owners. This is a story of overcoming odds and no matter what happens, staying together as a community, as the people.<br/><br/>Compare and Contrast: If you're looking to see how this movie compares to this book and are hoping that it will accurately depict Steinbeck's novel, then turn around. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it does tell the story of the Joads and shows the problem they are facing, but the way in which the Joads combat this diversity is different between the two works. The beauty of the inner chapters isn't expressed to its full potential in the movie. It's not expected that this can be done, but the effects of the inner chapters is part of what made the novel what it was. In the book, the inner chapters tied the Joads to the entire community and helped set up some context. The movie tells some of the stories of those in the inner chapters, but doesn't give the sense of community that the book has. Along with the lack of sense of community the relationship of the family is not the same between the two entities. In the book the two kinds of families, the Joads and John Davis', are compared. The difference between the two are having the family break up, but have community replace it, or have a family that stays together, but their connection to the community is destroyed. The movie seems to take the stance of Joe Davis' family because the focus is put on the family and the aspects of the family falling apart like Noah's Departure and the Joads connection to their community is downsized. The Joads never meet the Wilsons and the boxcar seen is completely taken out. Also the family farm isn't really shown in detail and there isn't a sense of connection to the agriculture because not a single peach or piece of cotton is shown. This brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>Students: If you need to read this book over the summer before going back to school, watch this movie. It seems like a spark note of the book as it summarizes the travels of the family and their hardships. However, if you need to discuss the themes of this book, you might not get a very good grade. The problems of the Joads remain intact, but the solutions of their problems are different. Emphasis is put on the people instead of sacrifice to move forward.<br/><br/>This is truly a good movie, but if you are hoping it will reflect the book, you might not enjoy it as much. Personally having read the book myself, I did enjoy this movie and respected it for what it did achieve for its time; however you can't view this thinking that it will be like watching Steinbeck tell his story."

","The Grapes of Wrath is really an excellent movie â€“ fantastic actors and casting, and cinematography, especially for the time it was made. Seeing it after just finishing Steinbeck's book, though, I was a little disappointed. Even though it's a great movie, it's not so great of an adaptation.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, I never really felt Steinbeck's message really coming across, except in certain points when direct dialogue was used from the book. Steinbeck showed the story of many people in his novel, and how important it was for them to come together as a community, while the movie focuses simply on the Joads. There is hardly any interaction between the Joads and the other Okies at all. In the end, Ma talks about surviving, and how that was all they had to do to make everything better. Steinbeck never wanted the Joads or any other Okie to just survive, he wanted them to come together as a whole and make sure they got their rights. The movie shows that just surviving makes everything better. Ending with the government camp (craftily renamed ""wheat patch"" rather than ""weedpatch"") gives the sense that there are decent people, and the Joads will have no problem finding decent people and a place to live. Ending with the boxcar and the flood and Rose of Sharon's scene (which is understandably not in the movie) shows that the hard times were hard from over, but if they stay as a community, they can try to make things better.<br/><br/>All of this being said, the movie has some really good references back to the book. Most of the actors managed to completely get their characters down. My main problem was with Al, and how much he was downplayed in the film. (And I felt a little hurt when they completely forgot about Noah). Ma and Tom and Casey, however, really did manage to find their characters. The scene between Ma and Tom right before Tom left was the scene that felt the most true to me. I was upset, though, that the only characters allowed to be seen and developed through the movie were the Joads, and every connection they had with other families, like the Williams and the Wainwrights, did not exist. The connections between the families was what brought out the book's message, and made it about more than just the Joads. It made it about everyone.<br/><br/>I understand the context this movie was made in, with the Depression barely over, the memories and events of Steinbeck's novel still fresh in everyone's minds. A complete replica of The Grapes of Wrath would have a been a bit too harsh for everyone then, and honestly impossible with the technology of the time. I think I would just ask in a remake for them to try to get it a little better.<br/><br/>It really is a fantastic film, especially for the time period, and on its own it's great. In terms of displaying Steinbeck's message, though, it does miss the mark."
"stfl42","Null","0","0","27 March 2011"," Comparison between book and film. (For my English Class)
","John Steinbeck's original novel The Grapes of Wrath was intended as a stunning critique of life in contemporary America; the film, meanwhile, is rather tame in comparison. This is of course understandable when considering the film industry in the 1930s and '40s, making movies required money and corporate sponsors were not likely to hand out money to produce a savage critique of they society that they dominated. The film does stay mostly faithful to the book, with much of the dialogue taken verbatim from the original text, but has three major departures. The first of these differences is, understandably, the loss of the inner chapters that served as parables and generalizations in Steinbeck's novel; most of them would have been hard to write into a cohesive movie. The films second departure is the loss of much of the socialistic rants and sermons from Jim Casy, the almost prophetic former preacher that accompanies the Joad family on their exodus. In fact, his character in the film is downplayed until his two moments of self-sacrifice, while in the book he is almost as important as Tom Joad himself. The third, most drastic departure is the alteration of events at the end of the film; which have been re-ordered or cut out to dull the novels original ultimatum. The Joad families stay at the corporate farm is put before their stay at the government camp, lending the film an upbeat sense of hope that the text was certainly lacking. Also, and perhaps most importantly, the filmmakers cut the last scene of the book out of the script. Instead of ending with Rose of Sharon's miscarriage, the flood, and the family taking refuge in the barn, the movie ends with the family on the road to pick cotton, hopeful of finding work and saving enough to settle down. The film ends with hope, whereas the book ends with an ultimatum: pursue self interest and let individuals and families perish (capitalism) or let ""the I become we"" and live in a utopia (socialism)."

","After taking a film class you get used to being shown the same scene over and over again before having to tear it apart and examine the fine points of film technique. After watching the entirety of The Grapes of Wrath for the first time in my English class, I considered what I have learned and what gear I have worked with doing filmmaking, even if it was a beginner class. Understanding that in the 1940's, during the Great Depression no less, filmmakers did not have the equipment or technology we have the fortune of using presently, I believe Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel deserves praise for the exceptional cinematography.<br/><br/>The camera angles, different shot types, color scheme, and lighting all helped effectively portray the desperate times in which the Joad family lived. The varied shot types are used as the components of storytelling; the close-ups show the raw emotion in Ma and Tom's relationship when they are having conversations, while the panning long shots show the constantly changing settings the jalopy moves through. John Ford's choice to use black and white film versus color film significantly changes the overall appearance of the story; it comes out as dirtier and rougher; the darker side of America.<br/><br/>I do hold some narrow-mindedness toward the film seeing as I read the book beforehand. If you are planning to read the book and watch the movie, I recommend you read the book first so as not to confuse yourself when you find the order of events rearranged or missing all together in the movie. Those differences cause the entire message of the movie to shift away from Steinbeck's message in the book, but they had to be done in order for Fox to even allow the movie to be produced. I admit there were so many changes in detail that I was disappointed with the storyline of the film, but overlooking that I still deem this film as a true artistic presentation. John Ford generated an incredible film using the bits and pieces he was allowed from the novel ; he made do with what he had and kept on living, just as the message of the film goes."
"sunschein75","6","0","0","27 March 2011"," Disappointing in comparison to the book, but artful in its own way.
","The 1940 film, The Grapes of Wrath, is an artful depiction of the contemporary book. Utilizing much advanced technology and film-technique for its time, the movie was revolutionary in its cinematic grandeur. However, Nunnally Johnson, author of the screenplay, strayed from the path Steinbeck had purposely traveled down with his storyline. While the film still includes some of the fundamental values and scenes that make the book one of the best historical pieces of fiction, the omission and reversing of certain scenes may leave avid viewers enamored with the original story feeling a sense of dissatisfaction. The movie ends with the superficial ""riding off into the sunset"" ending which implies that all is well or will be down the road (no pun intended!); however, this is counter to Steinbeck's artfully crafted ending. <br/><br/>Perhaps the largest mistake made by director Tom Ford and writer Nunnally Johnson was the reversal of stops the Joad family made along their journey after their final arrival in the supposedly-plentiful land of California. The decision to make the government camp the last seen stop for the family sends out a blatant pro-government message, which at the time served as propaganda to rally support for the government in its Dust Bowl-related reforms. With the reversal of the sequence of the Joads' stops, the movie is not a precise display of the story that captures the essence of the novel: the hardships and obstacles of exodus, and the importance of family, community, and perseverance to find a home in a foreign land. However, keeping in mind the standards of controversy in this time, the original ending in the book would have been too racy for a movie. With that in mind, the ending is not as disappointing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Grapes of Wrath remains a thought-provoking film that serves as a great culturally enlightening experience for those looking to gain insight on the Oakie migrations and pushing out towards the great American Frontier. After getting over the initial disappointment of the movie-produced happy ending, viewers can appreciate the believable historical setting and the development of the characters created by John Steinbeck in his original work. Overall, Grapes of Wrath is a movie that should be seen with an open mind and probably, without comparison to the book."

This film was a perfect example of great American film making because of its genuinity. It smoothly combined everything you need for a movie to be successful - breathtaking cinematography, spectacular writing and most importantly - brilliant directing. The characters performances were powerful and inspiring. The Grapes of Wrath is an unquestionably beautiful and spiring - yet educational - film at the same time.

","Growing up in a comfortable suburban community, I had the option of reading John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" in an English class. I wish I had. But I'm not sure I would have fully grasped its significance. Now that America is in a modern equivalent of the Great Depression, some 80 years later, I can fully appreciate Steinbeck's work. <br/><br/>I have nothing against capitalism, but what is portrayed here is not capitalism, it is naked, ruthless greed destroying the lives of countless people. While the details have changed, the greed we see today is the same, and even more faceless and insatiable. <br/><br/>This movie is not just a story, it is a lesson about the need for compassion for our fellow Americans and human beings, a lesson that desperately needs retelling today. <br/><br/>In 1960, John Steinbeck traveled around America in a pickup camper to research the book that became ""Travels with Charlie."" The Steinbeck who saw the horrors of migrant labor camps portrayed in ""Grapes of Wrath"" did not like what he saw Americans had become in 1960, especially the racist ""cheerleaders"" of New Orleans. He was so demoralized he eventually cut his trip short and headed for home. <br/><br/>I wonder what Steinbeck would have thought about Americans today, especially the politics? I think John Steinbeck would weep.<br/><br/>This is a movie that every American should watch, especially if you are living in a comfortable suburb insulated from the pain many of your fellow Americans are experiencing today. This is not a comfortable story, but it is one you need to see, and probably will be glad you did see, unless you are one of the 21st century robber barons."

This was what opened up John Ford's black and white, seven award nominated film The Grapes of Wrath.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath (1940), John Ford's greatest film also in black and white was about the Joad's family from Oklahoma, Colorado who were evicted from their dirt bowl ancestry land. They migrated to California in search of jobs and to find a better way of life. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) played a major role as mother of the Joad's family in the film. Ma Joad is a strong willed mother who always encourages the others to be positive and strong=g. She was the backbone of the family. She kept the family together throughout the migration and through the roughest times.<br/><br/>It was a pleasure watching Ma Joad take care of her family and providing them with the love and support needed to motivate and comfort each family member even when they were dying. During their migration Ma Joad lost two of her family members. Ma Joad fulfills every expectation playing her part in the film.<br/><br/>Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) played his role exceptionally well as the black sheep in the family. Tom who just got out of jail for committing homicide was released early on parole. He was very excited to see his family only to be told that his family and his neighbors were evicted from their ancestral home. He soon found them and joined them on the trip to California. Although he was very short tempered, and on parole he tried not to get into trouble because his mother has begged him not to get into anymore trouble. Tom played his part amazingly well in this film.<br/><br/>The film settings in black and white along with natural and low key lighting made this film exceptional. Everything looked so real, I felt as if I was character in the film. It felt like everything was happening while I was watching it. It all seemed so natural with the sunlight during the day and the low source of light in the night. This was the best black and white film I have ever seen. All the shots that made up the scene of the camp grounds were excellent. The high angle camera shot that was taken of Tom hiding when they were looking at license plates at the camp grounds was a great shot. This showed me how vulnerable and hopeless Tom was after killing a cop after they killed Casey.<br/><br/>While migrating to California I noticed there were a lot of informational signs. Most of these signs would say welcome to Arizona or welcome to California. These signs gave only a part of the information, they would then say the speed limit is, but the speed limits were never shown in the film. This family knew there were no limits to what they could do.<br/><br/>The Danger sign posted on a tree at the end of the film reveals that they were coming out of harm's way and that everything was going to be alright. This film far exceeded my expectations. All the characters played their part very well."
"eabakkum","8","0","0","5 January 2011"," A drama about the expulsion of peasants from their tenant farm
","The Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film, both in substance and as an artistic accomplishment. Since I did not read the book, my review is written without any prejudice. In the film we follow an extended family of small peasants, the Joads, who are expelled from their tenant farm. At first the story may seem a typical part of American history, which is of course true. For instance the illustrious folk singer Woody Guthrie had his roots in the Oklahoma dust bowl, and the eventual migration to California. I was truly fascinated by his biographic DVD ""This machine kills fascists"". But in fact the expulsion of small peasants is a universal theme. Already in the fifteenth century it started with the English enclosure movement. In the nineteenth century it was a recurring phenomenon in all parts of Europe. For instance, in 1903 the Flemish author Cyriel Buysse wrote a play about it (""Het gezin van Paemel""), and created one of the predecessors of Steinbeck's novel. Later a Flemish film version has been produced, which is highly recommendable. And then in the Bolshewist countries there was the forced transformation into collective farming. Although the Czechoslovak and Polish regimes shrunk from this move, which gives food for reflection. The making public of the American version through a book and subsequently a film was a courageous endeavor, since social critique is rarely welcomed (it could probably only be done because of the friendly New Deal atmosphere). Paricularly striking is the scene, where a farmer tries to prevent the demolition of his farm by threatening with a rifle. He asks the usher: ""Against who should I defend myself?"" The land owner? No, it is only an enterprise. The director of the enterprise? No, he just does what he is told to do. The bank? No, it simply reacts to the demand of the market. Of course the usher puts up a sham, because each and every one of these institutions is to blame (evidently in the first place the director, who has made a willful decision to break up the long-lasting business relation). The homeless farmers migrate en bloc to California (!), hoping to make a living as pickers. They live in tent camps, and are murdered by villagers, the thugs of land owners, and even the local police (especially the deputies are accomplices of the wealthy land owners). The main character is the peasants son Tom Joad (impressively portrayed by Henry Fonda). He has just served six years in prison for man slaughter, and is freed on parole. Here we see a glimpse of the family pride. When Tom returns home to Oklahoma, his family assumes: ""Did you escape?"" Especially grandfather is delighted: ""I told you so! They can't lock up a Joad!"" He and many others hold that they have a right to the Oklahoma land, because many of them died there: ""It is our dust"". All peasant communities share this same common isolation, caused by an apparent independence and self-provision (my grandparents were also farmers). This tends to make them inflexible. Grandpa and Grandma die during the ride to California. This does not come as a surprise, and therefore the Stalin-like director of the land owning company does not go free here. Characteristic of the small and collective peasant world is the mother of the family, who complains that she sees her family falling apart. Again Tom kills a man, this time not in self-defense. Frankly, I don't understand this aspect of the narrative. On the one side, Tom is no more a criminal than the policeman, who for no reason fires with his gun in a crowded camp of migrants and seriously wounds an innocent woman. On the other hand, it impedes the feelings of empathy and identification of the viewer/reader, and images the Joads as culpable wrong-doers. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that the Joad family (just like the Paemels) have neglected the change of time,and the agricultural revolution. This is a central point. Too often the changing policy of the society elite is far-reaching to such an extent, that the common people get no fair chance to adapt. And this can truly be called a crime. In conclusion: The Grapes of Wrath is recommended (which it doesn't need). If you like social films, see Het gezin van Paemel. Or consider reading my other reviews."

The Grapes of Wrath is a story of a joint family living in America (State of Oklahoma) at the times of the 'Great Depression'. Homeless and out of work, they had to move to the extreme west (State of California) to have a chance of earning livelihood and survival. They move from Okhlahoma to California in a vehicle that is old enough to be kept in the museum. Their journey to California itself is a highlight of the movie. They venture through different towns and states, get the sometimes good and sometimes bad reception of local people of every state, Hell,loose two members of their family in the journey (The Journey in Little Miss Sunshine is inspired from this movie). Living peacefully all these years in their Oklahoma Farm, suddenly they are faced with the materialistic facet of human nature. Some days they go without eating, somedays without sleep, Looking here and there for a job, they are ready to do absolutely anything. In all this trauma and pain, the only thing that remains constant is the human emotion of love and belonging. As a family, they are emotionally richer than the most richest man around. The clear message given in this movie above all is the importance of a family and the attachment to it is the only constant thing in life.<br/><br/>Performances are absolutely top notch. Henry Fonda gives a great all-round performance which can be considered one of his best ever. From the family, the one that impresses the most is the family Matriarch played by Jane Darwell who is responsible actually for binding the family. Actresses in the black and white era normally over-dramatized or in short over-acted especially in movies as these. But her's is a very natural performance. Overall, this movie may not appeal to people who don't have the basic human emotions of love, belonging, grief etc. I am not of that kind and thus I thoroughly liked the movie.<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"

There are too many beautiful visual moments in the film to explain in detail, but there seemed to be a pattern of filming that stuck out in my mind, and that is when only the reflection of conversational scenes are filmed, either in the reflection of a windshield or in a review mirror. This camera technique presented the very translucent and uncertain emotions that this wandering family must have been feeling.

","During the Great Depression and today's recession, it's important for families to never give up hope on themselves and keep looking foreword and ahead to the future as they want to advance towards a better life in an economic, political, and social standpoint. Sometimes,money doesn't usually bring happiness and success for people, only family, respect for others, and love are what keeps a family together. No matter how many times a person hasn't succeeded in a goal, they continue to persevere until they make themselves happy and successful in their goals as well as making their family proud.<br/><br/>It was Steinbeck's novel and the screen writing is what made this movie stand out as the best movie of 1940.The narrative writing of the film was full of realism by showing us what it would have been like to live in a poor family that's been evicted by their home by greedy land owners, banks, gangs, and sheriffs that are supposed to protect the people from harm's way in the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The narrative allows viewers to feel the experience and be in the movie as the actors were reliving real life experiences of moving away from home,exploring life, traumatized by death, despair, anger, and hope of finding a new life. The overall acting in this movie was excellent and well shown through their actions, the directing, and the script. The use of real natural wind, light, and the outdoor setting also made the story even more realistic and believable within the time period of the depression giving the film a more realistic feel. The photography and the use of the camera lens was excellent!! The juxtaposition of the two pictures of images in Muley's flashback and the movement through the states as shown by the signs in the moving time period, flowed well with ease through the story and adding the dimension of how the family drove and persevered to reach their goals and their attempts to save their homes from destruction. The use of shallow depth of field, lights and darks on the actor's faces, and the dark and light contrast in the sky was used very well in the film. The dark contrast and shadows brought out the mood of fear,anger, worry, and sadness that each of the characters expressed throughout the film during the tough economic crisis that was very emotional for the entire United States. Lighting created a sense of emotion, depth,mood, and how we see these characters in the film. Lighter outdoor scenes in the film were very opportunistic and bright as the families were looking into a happier life in the future.<br/><br/>This's the best movie that Zannuck has ever made in his life!!

A time when unemployment was around 25%, dust was choking off normally reliable farmland, and simply finding enough food to eat could be nearly impossible.This film was actually made when these kinds of conditions were still ravaging the United States. It would not be until the end of WWII that happiness on a large scale would be found once again within our borders.<br/><br/>The film itself is skillfully made and acted. Some of the edgier elements of Steinbeck's novel could not be included in a film in 1940, but the audience will still have no trouble understanding the dire circumstances these characters face. This film basically made Henry Fonda a star, and he may have never been better. Fonda stars as Tom Joad. Joad is portrayed in the film's earlier moments as kind of a shiftless and violent type who has just been let out of jail where he had been sent for killing a man. He seems to want to brag about this to a truck driver who gives him a ride out to his family's farm. Once he gets there, he encounters a washed-up preacher named Casey who is played by John Carradine. It seems that since Tom has been away, things have gotten so bad in rural Oklahoma that even preachers are losing faith. Tom Joad then learns that his family, among several others, have been ordered off their farms by either banks or faceless corporations that own them. Tom Joad has to grow up pretty quick after meeting up with his family members, and soon enough they load themselves and their belongings into an old truck and are headed out to California to find work.<br/><br/>The Joads encounter all sorts of hardships and prejudice on their journey, and things are even worse once they arrive in California. It seems that work is harder to find than they were led to believe, and the work there is doesn't pay worth a damn. Anyone who speaks out is likely to get beat over the head with an ax handle and killed. People are starving everywhere, and nobody in authority seems like they care. For a moment, the Joads seem to find a sanctuary in a government-run campground, but by this time, Tom Joad's fate is already pretty much determined. For reasons you will have to see for yourself, Tom Joad knows that he will have to spend the rest of his life on the run. And hopefully, he or his spirit will be able to help the ""little guy"" whenever he can. His goodbye scene with his mother is poignant, and it will touch even the most stone-hearted members of any audience.<br/><br/>The picture looks great. B/W has never looked this good. Even though some of the sets were obviously sound stages, you won't really mind. Except maybe the scene where Fonda and Carradine are walking up the land to the Joad farm. You can actually hear their voices echo off the walls and ceiling! The film is preachy, but these were desperate times back then. To a guy who is starving and cannot feed his family, socialist dogma must have sounded pretty good. All of the performances ring true, including Jane Darwell as Tom's mother. She won an Oscar, as did director Ford. The film is bleak, but in its final frames there is a definite twinge of optimism. This is key because when the film was made, nobody yet knew of the prosperity yet to come. Pearl Harbor had not even happened. The film definitely scores points for ending with an upbeat theme and showing its faith in the people. Because after all, we the people keep on keepin' on! 10 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","The following comment surmises the Classic book: The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, but also pertains to scenes and events from the award winning 1940 picture.<br/><br/>John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath is a stunningly realistic account of the daunting lifestyles of mid-western and southern farmers, who after having endured the vicissitudes of several consecutive years of drought and the lack of crop growth are compelled to relinquish ownership of their properties and move west for the prospect of a frivolous life, where fruits and vegetables are abundant and where labor is easy and prevalent. The historical significance of this movement is portrayed through the eyes of Steinbeck's memorable fictional characters: Casey, Tom Joad and his family. Having been recently released on parole from prison for the execution of a man, Tom Joad is keen on returning to his family once more. The identity of the man Tom has killed remains undisclosed throughout the book due to the fact that the significance of Tom's atrocity is not of the man he killed, but the reason he killed him. John Steinbeck built his book on characters with dormant animosity. The poor yield of the crops, the famine and pessimism of the future has all amounted to irrational wrath and unconventional violence. On his journey homebound Tom confronts a listless figure with his back against a tree bark and is surprised to discover that the person is none other than Casey, the preacher. Casey enlightens Joad that he is no longer a preacher and has given up a life of piety for the life of a ""normal man"". Here again, the ingenuity of Steinbeck's plot is witnessed, because the preacher's neglect of God shows that he unequivocally faces the predilections and dilemmas of the common people. He being a pastor does not make him exempt of the impending crisis soon to befall. By the time Tom Joad and Casey have reached Tom's former abode, they perceive that it has been abandoned and has been left to decay and disintegrate in putridity. When Tom asks a fellow farmer as to what has become of his family, he is aware that they have relocated elsewhere and are planning to embark on a tedious exodus west in a few days time. The grapes of wrath are beginning to plant their roots.<br/><br/>Tom and Casey reach Tom's family by nightfall and Tom asks his mother when they were to leave. She replies that they were to leave tomorrow morning. He then inquires whether or not they would have left, had he still been in prison. Tom's mother (alluded to as Ma) assures him that they would have dispatched an epistle. Now Steinbeck addresses the dire earnestness of the situation, by showing that Tom's family would have went west, whether he was in prison or not. When Tom's capricious grandpa adamantly rejects to moving west with the rest of the family he is knocked unconscious and sprawled upon the tarpaulin, which furthermore shows the vital importance of the move west. Soon after their departure, Grandpa falls ill and later succumbs to his sickness. He is given a banal burial, and the family along with Casey moves on, showing that even death would not intervene with the necessity of a better life out west. Later in the story when Tom's grandmother falls ill, the truck stops in front a checkpoint and an officer peruses about the items and occupants on board. Tom's mother ardently refuses for the mandatory checking, claiming that there are no liquids on board and that they have an ailing woman who is in need of critical medical attention. The officer permits them through out of maudlinness and when the rest of the family realizes that the grandmother is deceased they ask why she never informed them. She replies that she was scared the guards wouldn't let them through if they had known it was so, and once again we are blatantly witnessed to the importance of the migration west.<br/><br/>From thence forth the family is labeled as ""Okies"", not pertaining to the place of their birth, but a bias slur, generalizing them as simpletons who have neither food nor work, and ramp about the country pleading for undeserved privileges and necessities.<br/><br/>Goaded on by the lack of food and substantial work, the Joads reach California. Pa says something along the lines of ""It will all be better once we get to California."" and Tom replies that ""We are already in California"", signifying that life for them in the Midwest would be no different from life in California. Acres upon acres of plentiful fruits and vegetables which were not of their possession, but of the possession of the affluent, avaricious landowners were a mere ploy in the eyes of the Okies. They were there, redolent, serene and glistening, mocking the ""Okies"" for having come all that way merely to perceive something they would never have the ability to obtain. The grapes sagged on the branches of the Californian bushes. Troubles sagged on the hearts of the Okies and the wrath intensified into pure rage. The grapes of wrath had sewn their stalks in the hearts of the Okies.<br/><br/>Envy and spite instills within the former preacher Casey, to audaciously strike a cop who arrives to intentionally conjure trouble out of his own initial contempt. Casey is sent to prison and the family resumes in search of work and solace. Solace is found when the family reaches a stable government camp, where not only are hot baths and commodious tents bourgeois accessories but the affable people accentuate the atmosphere. The realization that life in the government camp is ephemeral goads the Joads onwards once more and Steinbeck idyllically portrays his use of deception by making his readers believe that a glorious life is prevalent when in all actuality it is not (he uses this style in Of Mice and Men as well)."

","This was the worst film I have ever seen that was taken from a book. It completely screwed up the story and didn't even finish with the book. John Steinbeck is an excellent writer and should have sued for making such an awful movie after his book. What were the movie makers of the time thinking when they thought they could turn this into a film. Considering that the story was a little too racy for films at that time especially the ending. Having to read this for an english class I bet people just watched the movie and were too lazy to read the book. Hollywood can never portray a story from a book.

"hansboxer","Null","3","8","21 February 2002"," The More Things Change...
","The amazing thing about this film, besides the acting, script, directing, lighting, etc., is how clear it is about class exploitation.  The sharecroppers are being kicked off their land, but no one seems to at fault. When the company man is questioned he says, ""It's not my fault, I'm only doing what the bank tells me to do.""  Farmer:  ""Well, I'll go to the bank."" Company Man: ""Well, it ain't his fault.  He's just doing his job."" Sharecropper:  ""Well, whose fault is it?""  ""Brother, I wish I knew.""  So, the first principle of exploitation, still present today, is to make the source of economic misery unlocateable.  How is this achieved?  Well, for one, politicians are in the service of the wealthy, but they also appear to be working for somthing called the ""American People.""  A President like George W. Bush is obviously working for only the richest 1% of the people who live in the U.S. but he constantly looks for ways to appears to be working for the entire population.  He said: ""My economic security policy can be summed up in one word: Jobs.""  And then he proposed a budget that cut job training across the nation.  The second principle of class exploitation clearly outlined in The Grapes of Wrath is that owners will always try and undercut wages by laying people off and throwing people out of work.  The Joads are told they'll be paid 5 cents a box of picked peaches, and then the next day this is cut down to 2 1/2 cents a box, and because there are starving people all around, they can get away with this.  This is still in effect today.  The wealthy class needs economic misery to keep wages down of ordinary people--this is why no state in the US pays a living wage of at least 11.00 an hour.  People actually have jobs for 6.50 an hour with out health care in this country!  There is no way that the great economy of Clinton could be sustained with a Bush in Whitehouse--which is exactly why it plummeted so fast after Bush stole the election.  I find The Grapes of Wrath to be the boldest Hollywood film ever made.  And in the end, when Henry Fonda starts putting 2+2 together, realizes that there is systematic exploitation of poor working people, there is a light in his eyes, a presence beyond the boundaries of his physical body: ""I'll be there..."" and by the end of film, we have made the journey from the scared individual all alone and helpless (Muley--who recounts the destruction of his farm) to Tom Joad's realization that the 97% of us without much of anything have to stick together to beat the remaining 3% of the wealthy who have politicians in their pockets and control the media.  It is Henry Fonda's portrayal of this growth of Tom Joad that makes him the best actor around who could have pulled off such a change.  Bravo!!!"
"zetes","10","3","8","5 November 2001"," Note Perfect
","There's probably nothing new I could say about this film - just the regular and much deserved praise: John Ford's direction is perfect, perhaps only surpassing it in The Searchers, as well as Greg Tolland's cinematography; the next year, he would photograph Citizen Kane, and his work there is just the slightest hair better than his work here (which, of course, means that this is one of the most impeccably photographed films ever made). And then there's the acting. Henry Fonda was, no doubt, one of the greatest actors of all times, and this might just be his best film (other great roles of his include The Lady Eve, made the following year, and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man). John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies. Even in Stagecoach, his role was kind of, well, cheesy (I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film). That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent; Carradine is brilliant (and so is Greg Tolland; man, look at the lighting job!). I do, however, wish he had kept his mustache. It's hard to picture him without it! But even with those two masterful actors, a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell, who plays the Joad matriarch. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history. There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which, as the Joad family is just about to flee their home, Mrs. Joad finds some old earrings. She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror. How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings? The past is past, and it will never come back."

","What a masterpiece--beautiful film, beautiful acting, incredible characters, strong setting, interesting story...<br/><br/>And ridiculous. A pure piece of political bully-pulpit pounding shame.<br/><br/>When you whittle away the bare bones from the withered flesh of a story, you find a simple message: BIG GOVERNMENT GOOD, STATES & LOCALS BAD. The way they portrayed it was crazy obvious. What I don't understand is why people sympathize with a double murderer, though motivated to such actions. It is a slanted logic that dictated men's lives as worthless where local justice is involved....in America. Never seen a message so ridiculous in film, the opposite being the truth--abuse and lack of justice within centralized government (just read the news).<br/><br/>The question in the beginning of ""who is to blame"" for taking the farms points to the evil bankers, the evil overlords all up the ladder of capitalism, as if the owners had no rights to their own land, and their own financial mismanagement wasn't the fault of the grassroots- decision-maker. But, never mind that: details get in the way of a good leftist message. By the end it portrays a world that will never change and the people who try will just wither and blow away for the sake of cigar smoking, besuited fellows in brand new cars with extensive peach orchards and businesses.<br/><br/>When I moved to California in the early 90s I met a lot of the old transplants who moved to CA in that time of need. They did pretty well for themselves. Ultimately, a displacement creates need and need is sated by people creating work and making things, people finding their place in the world. Maturity to understand how the world changes and corrects itself is what the story lacks completely. But, it wasn't a film made to reinforce the nature of the world, just to stir up some wrath."

","Watching ""The Grapes of Wrath"" 60 years after its release, one still asks: How did Hollywood allow this film to be made? But as viewers, we are cheered that Darryl Zanuck permitted John Ford and his cast to tell an important story. Although inferior, I think, to John Steinbeck's source material, arguably the greatest American novel, the film is brutally frank about terrible conditions imposed upon Americans. Gregg Toland's unsparingly bleak cinematography dominates the film; the scene in which the Joads ride into the labor camp is so unsettling that I am relieved when the camera stops panning the other residents and returns to the Joads. The unspoken resentment of the new arrivals is palpable; they are not looked upon as fellow Americans but as enemies: more people looking for work, more hungry mouths to feed. The Joads don't have much but when Ma Joad cooks something for dinner, it's as if Pa Joad can hear the rumblings of every hungry belly in the camp when he tells Ma, ""I can still see them in the tent.""<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly superb with Henry Fonda giving the necessary edge to Tom's character and Jane Darwell word perfect as the matriarch of the Joad family. The scene in which Ma models a pair of aged earrings in a faded mirror before leaving for California ranks with the greatest in American cinema. The first and last scenes of Ma and Tom together are guaranteed to touch one's soul. The story is too grim to support a happy ending, but what we have is about the best that can be hoped for, with Ma Joad reassuring her loved ones that ""they can't lick us because we're the family."""
"Quinoa1984","10","2","5","5 April 2008"," one of the most unsentimental films of the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood, possibly Ford's best
","For a motion-picture made in 1940, this one gets the depression probably more on-target than I have seen in any American work (Bound for Glory might be a short bit behind). This is due to two factors, one a little more obvious than the other. Steinbeck's book (still, sadly, unread by me, though other works like the Pearl are amazing on their own) is called the definitive account of the poverty-stricken mid-American experience in the depression, and it probably is. It allows for a very literary sensibility to form about such an American family like the Joads, who are the kind of folk that you'd think, if there wasn't immediate cynicism to be had with the like, politicians would be addressing first and foremost in speeches as the 'working man' and 'American family'. Sadly ironic then that the film had controversy for depicting some of California as corrupt, and that years later there would be charges on John Ford and Steinbeck of being un-American/communist for their respective work. Steibeck knew what he was doing, that's the short of it.<br/><br/>The second part is that Ford and David O. Selznick had such faith and dedication to the material in making it so straightforward that none of the possible melodramatic fat would be noticeable. This is so pure a work of American familial drama that any sense of sentimentality seems to be stripped away (as opposed to sentiment, there is a difference, as also noted by Scorsese re: Paths of Glory). Considering the cast, such as stars Henry Fonda and John Carradine- plus the quietly scene-stealing performance of Jane Darwell- it almost has the feel here and there of (pre) neo-realism, at least as far as Hollywood could take it. There's such a matter-of-factness to the turns that are taken with the Joads on their journey across the southwest to California- the bulldozers, Tom coming home after killing a man, the deaths of grandpa and grandma (the latter just in time to see California), and the subsequent trials and tribulations of working on near slave wages, that it builds the drama unexpectedly. You want the Joads to keep on going because they've earned the emotional investment honestly.<br/><br/>Only towards the very end, perhaps, does a tinge of the alleged communist &/or socialist stuff leak in, but it's not without some reason. By the time Tom Joad (Fonda) has gone through what's happened, his eyes have grown more empathetic than ever for those around him. His final speech, however full of the low-key gusto that calls out for attention, is effective because of what it means for the character, not even so much for the society at large. What's preceded this spirit for the working man has been very simple, the kind of style that many fans of the movies love Ford's work. It's a road movie essentially, and the story keeps on moving along to point after point that hits home what the Joads, and for that matter other families who've ventured out to California, have to deal with. And while there are some scenes where Ford and his DP Greg Toland move the story along in some stylistic flourishes (i.e. the montage of signs and roads, and the bulldozers in the flashback), the script doesn't allot for any time to take any more breathing room than necessary.<br/><br/>And as far as an adaptation- even without reading the book- it's quite wonderful, particularly where one can see that a scene or a moment that probably had profundity in the wording is given an equal amount of emotional weight by what isn't said (the example I'd give is before the Joads leave Oklahoma, the night before, as Ma is in the house by herself, the somber accordion music in the background, as she looks at old pieces of memories and throwing them bit by bit into the fire- all around it's a masterful scene). And on top of there being a sense of truth in the source to screen (with, of course, the necessary cuts and omissions for 1940 production code standards), the performances are golden. Fonda was rarely better, exemplifying all that was good naturally to him as a persona into his character (this and 12 Angry Men his quintessential socially conscious 'Average-joe' performances); Darwell, as mentioned, takes up the screen in her role of a career; Carradine skates between being truly dramatic and campy, and comes off as, simply, intense.<br/><br/>It's a gripping saga, and it may even surprise those who are expecting it to be an 'old-fashioned' tale of dust-bowl suffering during the depression. It is actually old-fashioned, in the most honorable way a picture from the period can be. A++"

Although it did not compare to the book it was still a well made film. I find it difficult to match actors with the characters in the book however, Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the hot head. Fonda did a great job of portraying his character as the common man and his performance allowed me to understand the way many individuals were feeling during that period of history. While the movie did leave out many important scenes that were included in the book the scenes included showed the struggles of the Americans that experienced the Dust Bowl. The scene where the Joad family is kicked off their land was quite emotional and a good depiction of the past. The setting of the film was very accurate to the book and the way the scenes were The shot of the family traveling to California were very well done.

","A historically important and extremely accurate portrayal of the times and experiences of those disadvantaged by the Depression. It shows how some Californians were inviting and the cruelty of others, and the film manages to expose exactly what the book aimed to expose in terms of the dehumanising effect of the Depression. The degree of accuracy of the film makes it at times painstakingly uneasy, but nonetheless the subject matter is given appropriate treatment. In terms of lighting, acting and direction it nears perfection too. The title refers to how some Californian farmers would spray kerosene on their leftover, rotting produce to stop new migrants from eating it, and that idea in itself haunts the whole film."

","John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath."" is generally considered one of the Great Ones. Ford's direction is assured, the Gregg Toland cinematography is stunning, and Henry Fonda is mesmerizing in what is probably his best performance. But the film just isn't all it's cracked up to be.<br/><br/>For one thing, characters disappear with no explanation or exhibit completely unmotivated changes of heart -- as if the director's cut had been hacked to pieces by the studio after the first preview in Pasadena. Worse, in spite of the unmitigated suffering, everything has a squeaky-clean gloss, and the Joads are suffused with an unrelenting nobility that makes you want to strangle them all. Certainly Steinbeck's ""little people"" were heavily romanticized, but you could still taste the Demon Dust that engulfed them. Here it too often feels like a little wayward talcum powder.<br/><br/>Fonda's Tom Joad is especially troubling, because he seems to exist as the mediating force between ""our"" prejudices about these people and their essential ""goodness"". He's clearly capable of violence -- and of realizing our worst fears about the poor and aimless -- but his faults are the result of an involuntary fall from grace. He's at the core an angel who's been cast from heaven by evil forces outside himself. This is rather simplistic.<br/><br/>Still, if the film ended on Fonda's famed visionary, fevered soliloquy, it would be easy to forgive much of the gloss. Instead the last big (and seemingly tacked-on) monologue is given to Ma Joad, and its perversely buoyant optimism is utterly true to the soporific populism of Old Hollywood."

","The Grapes of Wrath is one of the two films I can thank for my love of classic movies. When I was a kid I had enjoyed a few older films. Mostly stuff like The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life that I had been weaned on from an early age. But, like most kids, I was far more into the movies of my time. I viewed most older movies, especially black & white ones, with a degree of contempt. However, that changed when I was fourteen. That summer I checked out two older movies on VHS from my local library. I had heard a lot about one of these movies being called ""the greatest movie of all time"" and the other I knew was based on a book that fourteen year-old me just wasn't about to voluntarily read (although I did read it years later). So I took them both home and watched them back to back, glued to the screen the whole time. The two films were Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath and I was in love with classic movies from that point on. Interestingly enough, both films had legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland working on them.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath is a beautiful, haunting masterpiece from director John Ford, who deservedly won an Oscar. Nunnally Johnson's script brings John Steinbeck's novel to life but gives it a more optimistic finish. The cast is extraordinary, with Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell giving exemplary performances.

Because of the terrible director the landscapes were matt with the colour. If it was Hitchcock motion picture the Black and White and the directing wouldn't of been an issue. In my opinion the soundtrack was rushing to the drains because of the instruments that were playing worthless chords.

","If you have never seen John Ford's classic film The Grapes of Wrath it's highly recommended that you do so at least once in your lifetime. The Grapes of Wrath is more than just a good old fashioned movie; it's a lesson in American history. Many of us have probably heard a grandparent or older family member talk of ""The Dust Bowl"" days, ""The Depression Era"" and of banks foreclosing on farms during the 1930's. Director John Ford brilliantly captures all this in The Grapes of Wrath as it follows one Oklahoma family through all these hardships as they migrate from their foreclosed farm to California in hopes of finding work in a depressed economy. Superb acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine bring raw emotion to a well written script based on the novel by John Steinbeck. Both the novel and the movie were extremely controversial during their initial period of release. The novel was actually banned in several states because of its true depiction of the life of strife that many families encountered while living in migrant worker camps in California. This is a great must see movie for the whole family."

","The Grapes of Wrath is a drama directed by John Ford. It was based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. It features Henry Fonda,Jane Darwell,John Carradine,Shirley Mills,John Qualen and Eddie Quillan.The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson.The film tells the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family, who, after losing their farm during the Great Depression in the 1930's, become migrant workers and end up in California. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities for the family members.<br/><br/>Tom Joad returns to his Oklahoma home after serving jail time for manslaughter. En route, Tom meets family friend Casey, a former preacher who warns Tom that dust storms, crop failures, and new agricultural methods have financially decimated the once prosperous Oklahoma farmland. Upon returning to his family farm, Tom is greeted by his mother, who tells him that the family is packing up for the ""promised land"" of California. Warned that they shouldn't expect a warm welcome in California--they've already seen the caravan of dispirited farmers, heading back home after striking out at finding work--the Joads push on all the same. Their first stop is a wretched migrant camp, full of starving children and surrounded by armed guards. Further down the road, the Joads drive into an idyllic government camp, with clean lodging, indoor plumbing, and a self-governing clientele. When Tom ultimately bids goodbye to his mother, who asks him where he'll go, he delivers the film's most famous speech: ""I'll be all around...Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat...Whenever there's a cop beating a guy, I'll be there and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be there too.""<br/><br/>Movies will probably go on improving and broadening themselves; but in any event, The Grapes of Wrath is the most mature picture story that has ever been made, in feeling, in purpose, and in the use of the medium.A potent drama that is as socially important today as when it was made, it is affecting, moving, and deservedly considered an American classic and a great adaptation of the novel.A documentary-styled production for which Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland demanded painstaking authenticity, it is much more than a classy, old-fashioned history lesson. With dialogue and scenes that rank among the most moving and memorable ever filmed, it's a classic among classics or simply put, one of the finest films ever made.It was often named the greatest American film, until it was dethroned by Citizen Kane."

","Maybe not the most thrilling movie ever made, but it's hard not to get caught up in it. You just can't help but to feel for the plight of the main characters, and follow them intently as they continuously journey onward searching for hope and prosperity. In a rather grim fashion, the characters are forced to confront disappointment, and ultimately persecution and hardship at every turn.<br/><br/>This classic John Steinbeck story is perhaps as relevant now as it was back in the 30s; it serves to criticize the ideals of the American dream, and it proves quite effective as it documents the migration of displaced farmers and workers across the nation. The story is a journey that pushes the characters to extremes, and provides a fairly hellish view of the dustbowl in general. It's driven by a constant pattern, in which the characters come close to finding what they're looking for, and then having it snatched away from them. It's pretty bleak, but the characters remain endearing, especially with their endless conviction and motivation.<br/><br/>On film, the story is immortalized with excellent photography and editing. The acting is swell: Henry Fonda, John Carradine, and heck, just about everybody inhabit their characters quite well. The writing is superb. This production is loaded with good, real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. The music used is fitting.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"
"jboothmillard","7","1","2","19 March 2012"," The Grapes of Wrath
","From Oscar winning director John Ford (My Darling Clementine, The Quiet Man, Mister Roberts, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance), based on the book by John Steinbeck, this was a film from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die that I was really going to try and focus on. Basically Tom Joad (Oscar nominated Henry Fonda) has returned home after serving four years in prison for killing a man, and he is joined on his journey by faithless former preacher Casy (John Carradine), and together they find the farm deserted. Tom finds his family who tell him that they were evicted, and the extended family of eight have to pack their things and set on the road to California, and there they hope to find work. The Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies from a stroke along the way on Route 66, and they have no choice but to bury his body on a roadside, and after being warned about the lack of jobs at their destination, Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) dies also before they reach the border. They soon find a travelling camp populated by children, and a man and the sheriff do come offering the family members work, but with no indication of what the salary is, this man with the sheriff is trouble apparently. The sheriff killed the man, and Tom knocked out the sheriff before getting away, and the rest of the family keep travelling until the find a farm that needs workers, but it is suspicious for being surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. They earn very little money when they accept a job picking pears, and Tom walking around comes across Casy again who is planning a strike with fellow labourers, but then thugs kill Casy and gash Tom. The family move on again and find a US government camp which has much better living conditions, such as toilets and showers, but they are wary of thugs coming and need the sheriff to take control. Tom must go away because the sheriff is looking for him, and he leaves his mother, Ma Joad (Oscar winning Jane Darwell), thinking that she won't see him again, but she is hopeful about the future heading for work in the north. Also starring Dorris Bowdon as Rose-of-Sharon 'Rosasharn' Rivers, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, O.Z. Whitehead as Al and John Qualen as Muley. Fonda is alright as the one who almost leads the family, and Darwell is indeed intriguing as the mother of the family who is tries to keep spirits up. I will be honest, I didn't really pay enough attention to or understand the plot, and I didn't really understand the leading character's heroism, I'd probably only see it the once, but there are some good moments, costumes and landscapes to just about keep you watching, a reasonably worthwhile classic period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Tom Joad was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!"
"Kubris","8","1","2","12 March 2012"," Wrath indeed
","IMDb Top 250: 156<br/><br/>I can't think of too many films that show the hardships of the Depression off the top of my head, but surely The Grapes of Wrath (what an intriguing title) weighs equally to the entirety of all others. Based on a novel I haven't read, 'Grapes' follows the Joad family leaving to find work in California with their recently returned son and finding misery. This is a heavy film, a depression in a Depression.<br/><br/>I was excited by the prospect of seeing a John Ford film, because I associate him with two major things: beautiful cinematography and 'full' films, filled with themes and symbolism. I got the first one: dark, black and white photography, with breathtaking long shots and silhouettes, and faces appearing in darkness. The second was still there, but not as plentifully as his later films. However this is an adaptation, and thus Ford's leeway was quite constricted, plot and theme wise.<br/><br/>A film this bleak, with such a feeling of desperation (the wind sounds are chilling) needs desperate performances, and 'Grapes' delivers. Fantastic acting. Henry Fonda is just- wow. I recently saw The Philadelphia Story, and I can say Fonda's performance is far more deserving than Stewart's Oscar winning role. Tom Joad is hot-tempered yet caring: walking the fine line between cool and volatile. Fonda perfects the role and elevates the entire film with his honest performance. He is backed up by solid support, like Ma Joad and Casy. The Joad family is large, and we don't get to really meet most of them. I'm sure the book fleshes the characters out more, but I can only remember the names of Tom, Ma, Pa, and Roseasharon (?) Joad. <br/><br/>Like All Quiet on the Western Front, 'Grapes' teaches a solid history lesson. We see the 'Okies' plight in the Dustbowl, their trip across the country with everything in one truck, and their subsequent hardships faced in California by people who don't want them stealing jobs they need too. This story is told with good flow and a strong pace- no scene feels rushed, and no scene feels overdone.<br/><br/>Mood is another of The Grapes of Wrath's strength. There's a very post- apocalyptic feeling about it- the scramble to ensure their families survival against everyone else. We see a form of society breakdown, where people can only fend for themselves. The major conflict is hard to describe, as everything goes wrong for the Joads. Nature, other people (but no singular antagonist) and it would even seem God wants the Joads to fail. So when the dance scene comes, it's one of the biggest sighs of relief I've experienced watching films.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath is a really bleak film with a really strong lead. It's a remarkably important film, in league with Gone With the Wind, and should be seen for that reason alone- something numbers cannot tell you. It's a story about the injustices done by the rich fat cats at the expense of the poor, and more personally a story of human resilience: that we can overcome lots, but not everything. It's certainly humbling- things can get better but they can also get worse. 8.3/10"

","I got my orders, it ain't up to me, I didn't set the price, take it or leave it. We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that ""nobody"" doesn't even exist.<br/><br/>This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at ""the promised land"" they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter. Despite this fight and the competition for the jobs the workers shows solidarity with each other but cannot use this to get proper organized even though a few tries (the story could be seen as a predecessor to ""In Dubious battle"" where the struggle to get the workers organized continuous).<br/><br/>The Joad family are very poor given the circumstances but nonetheless they are looked down upon and stigmatized; being poor equals being subhuman; An Okie. If they ask questions or making a statement in front of a policeman or guard they are threatened to loose their job or getting the label ""agitator"".<br/><br/>Only in one place do they find themselves at home; in the government camp. It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.<br/><br/>In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.<br/><br/>The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.<br/><br/>The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.<br/><br/>Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.<br/><br/>The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are â€“ and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the ""occupy wall street"" movement.<br/><br/>Regards Simon"

","It's amazing how hopeless and bleak a film from the golden age of Hollywood can be. Films from this era always seem to be overzealous and excessively joyous. They have that electrifying Hollywood feel to them. Not The Grapes of Wrath however. This is a film that gives the world a reality check and tells a story dealing with the darker and more troubling side of life. It tells the story of an impoverished family moving from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl to California in hopes of finding work. However, the difficult trip takes its toll on them and when they arrive to find significantly less work than they hoped for things become even more difficult. It is the harrowing story of struggle and survival, as well as overcoming adversity with love and family, two themes that drive this film. It's an epic production to watch unfold, and it will leave you feeling so lost, so empty, and yet so amazed.<br/><br/>It might not seem like it, but this really was what pushing the enveloped in 1940's Hollywood. To tell a story this challenging and this difficult to absorb was something rarely seen in this glimmering time period of cinema. Yet, it really gave way to revealing the impact that dark cinema can have on an audience. The bleakness of the film is what makes it absolutely gripping and endlessly compelling. It is such a harrowing story and one that constantly makes us want to know what is coming next. It strikes all the right emotional chords and plays out to be a magnificent experience. Add in incredible performances, a compelling script, and John Ford's direction and darkly moving cinematography and you've got yourself a true work of genius.<br/><br/>By today's standards The Grapes of Wrath doesn't seem all that depressing or difficult to watch, but if you look at in context you realize the impact of the film. This is why I give this film so much praise for being a true pioneer film in the ever changing world of cinema. The Grapes of Wrath isn't fantastic enough to compel me to call in one of my personal favorites, but I have undying respect for it's quality and the important mark it left on Hollywood."
"JRamos3","Null","1","2","9 October 2011"," A perfect adaption of literary genius
","Where to even begin? I watched this film for a history of cinema class, and I have to say that all of the films I have viewed of late, this one is by far the best to date. All the performances are stellar, obviously to include Henry Fonda's Oscar nominated performance as the films main character, Tom Joad. While I have never read Steinbeck's novel of the same title, after viewing this film i will certainly put it on my to do list. This film seems, almost effortlessly, to perfectly capture and showcase the harsh conditions of the 1930's during the dust-bowl. Many aspects of this film were extremely well done and worth mentioning. The outstanding performances of the actors aside, the scenery, story telling, and overall misc-en-sene of the film is great. At no point did this film fail to keep my interest, as the characters in the story, although clearly in no way similar to my personal life's story, are truly relate able to the audience. As a viewer, you feel for the plight of the Joad family on their endless journey just to find work and some small semblance of creature comfort. Additionally, the harsh and severe treatment that the travelers as a whole experience at the hands of both law enforcement and local farm security made me nothing short of incensed. To be sure, during the scene in which Tom's friend is killed on the river, I found myself almost in shock, for I did not in any way see that action on the horizon. However, I think it , the killing and general treatment of the migrants that is, stands as a testament to what life must have truly been like at that dark time in American history. Furthermore, the fact that such blatantly gross abuse of power was allowed to persist speaks volumes to the wanton disregard that so many must have had for those that were unemployed. This is truly sad when you think about it; Most of the families that were traveling hundreds upon hundreds of miles at the cost of even further famine and illness only wanted work and some food to eat, and were met with admonishment and disregard. That is truly appalling. But I digress. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent film that in its time served as a call to action for all those who wished to take a stand against the abuse and mistreatment of others. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to others wishing to glean some knowledge about a oft-forgot time in American History."

The film is masterfully directed by John Ford and beautifully shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland. The outdoor shots are grand and bleak at the same time, bringing about a feeling of the insignificance of man compared to nature and the grand scheme of things.

","An enormously powerful and moving narrative of the hardships and perseverance of one poor farming family during the great depression, this film beautifully blends expert cinematography and moving dialogue. The Joad's struggle is hauntingly foreshadowed at the beginning in the Joad's abandoned house, where a mood of tragedy is established. Throughout the film, use of deep contrast and shadow is appropriately used to emphasize moments of despair and sullenness, the preacher often comes in and out of shadow and plays a key role in Tom Joad's development. I found the mother to be exceptionally engaging, owning most of the emotional power and meaning in the dialogue. While the film is mainly a constant bludgeoning of sadness, and it feels as though the Joad's will never be at peace, there are moments of relief. The grandpa serves a dose of comic relief, and the government run housing camp is the only place happiness seems to exist. Over the course of the film you begin to feel connected to the Joads, and start thinking like them. As the Joad's enter the displaced farmers' camp, you feel a sense of apprehension along with Tom, and you find yourself waiting for the next injustice to present itself. You then grow attached to this haven, and feel accomplished when the police scheme against it is thwarted. The beautiful photography, top tier dialogue, and moving story all blend to produce an engaging style typical of great movies; a category in which this film rightly fits."

","Any John Steinbeck title-turned-film tends to scare away contemporary viewers with thoughts of two-plus hours of depressing country drama, but we often forget how radical Steinbeck was for his time, particularly with his Depression-era Dust Bowl novel ""The Grapes of Wrath."" With an adaptation by one of Hollywood's first great directors (and greatest frontier/Western director) in John Ford, this film is anything but a classic adapted for the screen just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" centers on Joad, recently paroled after killing a man in self-defense, and his large family (including parents, grandparents, uncle, sister, brother, etc.) traveling out to California after being forced out of their Oklahoma home in search of work. This one flame of a new life out west, however, slowly begins to flicker away as they find out more and more that they're one of thousands competing for the same few hundred low-wage contractor jobs.<br/><br/>The realization creeps up on the characters and even ourselves. A whopping 70 years later, if you come to the film without putting your history cap on, you'll almost be convinced the Joads have a shot. Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson hinges much of the film's movement on moments of realization, creating a growing shadow. Ford gives each scene a chance to sink in with his lingering closing shots that slowly fade to black. These are ancient foreshadow techniques, but Ford reminds us why they're timeless.<br/><br/>The building tension keeps ""Wrath"" from festering too long in thoughts about good and evil and what actions make a man one or the other, which was sort of radical thinking for the Depression era. The former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who lives like a hobo and claims he no longer has the spirit because he cannot determine automatically what is right or wrong anymore was more progressive than we realize. Occasionally the script will go back on itself or insert somewhat needless moments of pause for Ma Joad (Oscar winner Jane Darwell) to sermonize about Steinbeck's themes, but audiences probably needed to be hit over the head with this stuff in 1940; it is a different philosophy, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Tom Joad's famous speech to Ma as he leaves his family to go off and fight the cause (""wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there ... "") is one of the earliest American ""one person can make a difference fighting for what he/she believes in"" speeches on camera. Since 1940 we've had so many more examples of real life people who have stood up for a cause and fought injustice. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" might seem unoriginal in that thought, but in American history, it's hardly the case. And most certainly, that message will never become irrelevant in spite of hope that it one day might be.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

During the depression film had no other choice, but to reflect the realities of the world. People didn't want to see happiness on the screen when their lives were a constant battle. Joad and Muley take off on foot to hopefully meet up with their family. Eventually they do, and the world family seems to have meaning again. it doesn't matter what challenges they were facing, they knew the strength that they could get from each other.

"PWNYCNY","10","1","2","16 February 2010"," What happens when people trifle with nature.
","A revisiting of this movie merely confirms what is already established as fact: that this movie is great. It's grim story about people struggling to survive. That these conditions existed in the United States is a disgrace. To be thrown off the land is bad enough, but then to be humiliated compounds the injustice. The story is told in the form of semi-documentary which gives it further authenticity. The movie is about land. People own it, farm it, exploit it, divide it, fight for it, defend it, plow it, drive over it, drive through it. The people are transiting; the land stays. Tom Joad enters and Tom Joad exits; he is a metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. The only thing stable is the land. Ma Joad is trying to keep the family together but it's a losing battle. Only the will to survive gets them through. This movie is an incredibly powerful story, strongly acted, and told with candor.<br/><br/>The Grapes of Wrath is director John Ford's homage to nature and a warning to all - that nature, in the form of rough terrain, inclement weather and immense distances, can be lethal to humans. In this movie the land is more than just mere scenery, more than just a back drop for a story, more than just a passing reference, it is an integral player, indeed it is the story itself. Briefly, the movie is about a family, the Joads of Oklahoma, who, after being evicted from their farm during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, become homeless and, in quest of work and a more secure place to live, embark on a long journey through prairie and desert to California. For them, California is the proverbial land of milk and honey and holds for them a promise of a new and better life, much like the ancient Hebrews may have felt when they left Egypt in quest for their promised land. As the Joads travel west in the their broken-down jalopy they are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the landscape. The movie features several panoramic vistas of the rugged western landscape, prairie and desert, geographical barriers that the Joads must surmount to reach their goal and places where they can die. For the land is not friendly and benign; instead it is a source of contention and a cause for grief, such as that visited upon the Joads as they lose their homes and possessions and are forced to migrate in order to survive. The Joads' vulnerability is further reinforced by the distances they must travel and the stress caused by the move itself. Two members of the family die while on the road and another disappears; nothing is close by. Driving many miles means having to deal with the possibility of their truck breaking down en route and becoming stuck in the middle of nowhere. And like the land itself, the people encountered by the Joads on their journey are surly and begrudging at best. The message is unmistakable. Nature can crush us at any time and must be respected for what it is, an all-encompassing, awesome, stark entity that is both life giving and deadly, especially when ignored, as the Joads learned as the ""wind"" destroyed their lives, perhaps as a pay back for the way the land was abused. And when the Joads finally arrive in California, reality quickly sets in and with it comes more trouble and disappointment, all of this having to do with the land, which again poses a threat to the Joads' survival. The story ends with Tom Joad, who is in trouble with the law, shown trekking across the land and the rest of family again on the move as they continue to seek work. The foreboding mood that permeates this movie is further enhanced by the black-and-white photography that further brings out the stark emptiness and vastness of the land. This movie is a dramatic statement that warns the audience that human kind must be cognizant of the whims of nature for nature is something that cannot be ignored or trifled with. In the 1930s people did not treat the land with respect and the land responded in kind. That the Joads got caught up with that is the stuff for a dramatic story but nature itself is beyond our ability to control as so aptly shown in this movie. We build dams and they inevitably fail. We build dikes to keep out the ocean yet we still have floods. We build huge ships that sink. We build airplanes and rockets that crash. We build mighty bridges and buildings and they collapse. And in Grapes of Wrath, we farm the land and the soil turns into dust. And THAT is the story."

The scene where grandpa buys the two children peppermint candy is particularly sad, the waitress charges him less as she realizes the family is dirt poor. Another telling scene is when Tom (Fonda) stops at a gas station and two arrogant gas station attendants survey his situation, saying. ..."" those Okies just aren't human, living like they do""... the rejection of middle class America of these peoples plight is rancid and prevalent.It still exists today.<br/><br/>Eventually the Joads get to a labor camp where they are treated like criminals and live in sub-human conditions. The DP captures the stark images of starving sad children begging mother (Darwell) for food, any food. They are all starving.<br/><br/>Eventually the Joads drive on to find another camp, run by the department of agriculture, which at least provides clean water, bathrooms and food. Grandma dies when they finally reach California soil, the promised land.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda is frankly flawless in this performance, depicting a young man attempting to make a life, but having no resources, no societal support.<br/><br/>A truly perfect film, worth several viewings as you realize there are still impoverished people in America living this way, whether in the foothills of Appalachia, or the sugar cane fields of South Florida. 10/10."

","OK so this was kind of a long movie. It was sad. Some of the things I noticed in this movie were, how they kind of flashed backwards which is something I haven't seen in one of our movies. I liked the shot with the 3 shadows of the men standing there after they were told to get off there land. I thought that was a nice and different camera move. Some other things I saw during this movie is when they lit the candle in the house to see if anyone was there there was still a back light. where was that coming from? another thing was the sound. When the wind storm was rolling in it was extremely loud and if you looked around not everything was moving from these terrible winds. another thing was I liked the fact that they used a montage effect of all the signs when they were traveling from Oklahoma to California. The last thing i notice is when the family reached the Colorado river and they all got out to look at the beautiful sight, there voiced sounded as if there were on a set and not in an open area. over all I did like the movie but it was sad Megan"

","What a sad movie, but with very powerful imagery. I was dreading this movie because I knew how depressing the book was, although I read it long ago. I was going to watch it in two stages, but once I started watching it, I could not stop until it was over it was so compelling. Some of the characters were a bit flat, with the exception of Tom Joad and the preacher. I cannot believe John Carradine as the preacher was the same actor who played the gambler in Stagecoach. Both very amazing performances. I liked this movie better than Citizen Kane, much better. The scenery, lighting, and cinematography really pulled you in to the story. The views of the skyline and vastness during their journey added to the entire feeling of the film."
"baddman316","Null","1","2","13 October 2009"," Grapes of Wrath review
","The grapes of wrath is so realistic and breath taking, it will leave you in a world of emotions. it is the story of the Joad family, who are kicked off their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. Since there wasn't a lot of variation on the black and white cinematography in 1940's, the lack of color increases the emotions of wholeness,poverty and emptiness due to the family's foreclosure and forcing them to move. The Grapes of Wrath is merely not a cutting edge sit at the end of your seat film, but it is a realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performance by the actors and the work of the production company couldn't be more on its mark. the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational."
"johnmschofield","10","1","2","9 August 2009"," A moving story of the effects of Poverty and another warning from history
","This film although made almost seventy years ago is as relevant today as it was then. It depicts a family struggling to survive the effects of a depression and trying to do the right thing in spite of enormous suffering and degradation. You could make a similar film today and probably film it anywhere in the world. There were millions starving in the world both in 1940 and now almost 2010 and without sounding too pessimistic I cannot see an end to this situation. I am not interested in politics mainly because politicians worldwide generally are not interested in changing anything for the better. Thats not to say that I don't hope for a better future but I think it unlikely that my dream of no poverty will ever come true. The situation is the same as it always was and has been the same for centuries and millions have died as a result. That is not just my particular opinion that is a fact. If you are down you will rarely get any help and indeed you are more likely to be taken advantage of because there is always someone that has the power and the lack of empathy to do that. This film graphically sets out what can happen should you and your family find yourself in a similar position. I would recommend anyone watch this film as another timeless classic. To me 'The grapes of wrath' is another warning from history, it seems we collectively are not listening."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","30 September 2008"," A really well made heavy handed drama.
","You know, some movies are just made as pure drama's. They are purely made to bring emotions to the screen and their heavy handed. You just know that from start till finish there will be nothing to enjoy about the movie and it is going to be as serious as it can get. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is such a drama, so if you don't like heavy, serious drama's, this just ain't the movie for you to watch.<br/><br/>Because the movie is so incredibly heavy handed and self righteous, this perhaps isn't the masterpiece everybody telling you it is but there is no denying that the movie is really well made and also features some great acting performances. But because it's such an extreme drama it often feels forced as well and causes the movie to be a long watch, even though it really isn't a that long movie. It's just a movie with a real slow pace and yes I would definitely call it boring in parts, even though lots of (dramatic) things are happening within this movie. It really isn't the most exciting movie to watch and therefore also not really a very effective one. Even though I could appreciate the movie for what it was, it just didn't ever grabbed me with its emotions, story or characters, no matter how very well it all got done.<br/><br/>But no, I obviously didn't hated this movie, on the contrary really. Seriously, how can you hate such a well crafted movie like this? Even though this movie got released in the early '40's it still has a real typical '30's look and feeling over it. The '30's really used to be the era of some of the best and most effective drama movies.<br/><br/>It's a movie that obviously got well directed, by John Ford, who loved to make real 'American' movies. His movies always have something proud and patriotic about it but without the flag waving and such. To the main crowd he is perhaps best known for the work he did within the western genre, with movies such as ""Stagecoach"" and ""Rio Grande"" under his belt.<br/><br/>It's also a beautiful looking movie with its cinematography and sets and costumes, which really suits the time period the movie got set in.<br/><br/>It has a really great story and amazingly enough things like this really happened back then in America. I didn't knew anything about this piece of history, so I definitely learned something new from it. It's a pretty amazing story and you would have a hard time believing it if you didn't know that things like this really happened in the past. The first halve of the movie is basically a road trip with lots of drama to it obviously, while the rest of the movie also tends to be very dramatic, when the family constantly tries to settle down where ever there is work (and more trouble).<br/><br/>Henry Fonda really plays a great role and he himself also considered it to be the role out of his career. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role. The movie also has an amazing supporting cast, with for instance fine acting performances from Jane Darwell and John Carradine. Darwell even won an Oscar for her part in this movie. It was one of the 2 Oscar's this movie received. The other was for director John Ford. Both deserved their win I would say. The movie got nominated in 5 more categories, including Henry Fonda's nomination.<br/><br/>Perhaps not the masterpiece I was expecting, it was too overdone and heavy handed for that but nevertheless one great movie, that I surely appreciated watching.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","20th Century Fox and John Ford brought John Steinbeck's classic novel to the screen and created a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda gives one of the truly great performances of any actor in the history of the movies and becomes Tom Joad. Fonda's performances conveyed Integrity and never more appropriate than in this film. I must also praise to high heaven the work of one of Hollywood's fabled character actresses Jane Darwell. Ms. Darwell conveys more emotion in some scenes than some actresses in a lifetime. Desperation, Loneliness, Futility, Darwell encompasses all the great values that make a Mother. Jane Darwell is Mother Courageous. Fonda and Darwell's parting scene is one of the most achingly memorable scenes in film History, if one cannot share their feelings one has to be made of stone. My only critique of the film is its ending.I would have preferred one more to the book than one that the great legendary John Ford delivered."
"ambimom","10","1","2","9 July 2007"," Quintessential American movie with memorable performances
","It is rare when the movie is as good as the novel from which it is adapted, but sometimes the stars align in just the right way and a masterpiece is created. That's this movie. John Ford is remembered for his westerns, but this is his finest work, by far, and he's not alone here. Watching Henry Fonda telling Jane Darwell ""I'll be there,"" gives me goosebumps every time. One of the best actors this country ever produced, this performance is his absolute best in a career filled with memorable performances. Which brings me to John Carradine, the superb character actor. The subtlety of his characterization is so deft, you forget that you're watching a movie. You owe it to yourself to see the finest representation of a soon forgotten art of telling a story in black and white, literally. See this movie. You won't be disappointed!"
"Steffi_P","9","1","2","15 October 2006"," ""That's what makes it ours Â– living on it and dying on it""
","For the adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, the obvious choice for director was probably not John Ford, who was at that time best known for historical dramas. However, if the setting was not typical John Ford then its themes of family relationships, community spirit and social outcasts persevering in the face of all adversity certainly were. It was also a task which members of Ford's stock company of actors Â– Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and John Qualen Â– were more than suited to.<br/><br/>Considering it is a contemporary drama shot in black-and-white, the images in Grapes of Wrath are startling, from the opening shot of a distant Henry Fonda approaching a crossroads to Jane Darwell's close-up monologue with which the films closes. The director of photography was Greg Toland, one of the best in the business at the time. Combined with Ford's effortless talent for shot composition the results are among the finest images in black-and-white cinema.<br/><br/>Ford knows exactly when to edit and when to move the camera, usually for maximum emotional impact. In a scene where Ma Joad is burning some personal possessions in preparation to leave the farm, he cuts to a dirty mirror reflection of her. It's hard to explain how but it works perfectly. He also makes far more use of close-ups than is his norm, building up a greater level of intimacy and bringing the emotions to the fore. This occasionally makes the lengthy patches of dialogue seem a little corny, but this is often a problem with motion pictures adapted from novels which few directors have managed to get round successfully.<br/><br/>John Carradine performs in what was probably the best role of his life as the preacher Casey. He's cast completely against type (he usually played sinister villains), but he makes the role his own, creating a character who appears simple on the surface, but is full of down-to-earth wisdom and humanity underneath. There's also a small yet memorable appearance from another Ford regular, John Qualen, who gives a spirited performance as the farmer Muley. In what are some of the best scenes in the film he vents his anger and frustration at being turfed off his land, eventually breaking down until he's nothing but a ghost of his former self.<br/><br/>Despite Ford winning Best Director at the Academy Awards for Grapes of Wrath (one of only two Oscars it received), it's probably more a classic borne out of group effort than the vision of one man. For a start, the plot is sourced from a great novel, itself brilliantly adapted by Nunally Johnson. That is combined with a great cast of actors and of course Greg Toland's cinematography. Ford definitely felt more at home when making a western. Having said that, he was never someone to do a sloppy job, and I'm by no means suggesting his Oscar wasn't deserved, but that's not what makes this a memorable picture."
"nnnn45089191","10","1","2","13 July 2006"," Great classic
","I was surprised at the depiction of brutality and misery in this great classic.Even more surprised that the director was John Ford.This must be his greatest film.Henry Fonda has gotten much credit for his portrayal of Tom Joad through the years and although he is marvelous, I think he has been better in some of his later films. One of the cinema's greatest supporting performances belongs to Jane Darwell as Ma Joad.She's simply magnificent and deserved the Oscar she got for her portrayal.There are some really harrowing scenes that show the misery of poverty and exploitation by the wealthy class.The stark photography by Gregg Toland underline the bleakness of existence in the great depression.One of the best movies I have seen,both thought-provoking and emotional."
"blaker22","9","1","2","3 April 2006"," As good as it is, Just makes me want to read the book again
","This is one of the most watchable old films I've ever seen, right up with ""Citizen Kane"" and ""12 Angry Men."" Direction, Photography, and acting all shine. The story is a little weak, as there's simply no way to provide all the rich characterization and settings that Steinbeck does in his novel. Because of that, the movie felt a little jumpy to me, but all in all it is one of the best adaptations I have seen. Of course, the ending is inadvisedly changed, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect a Hollywood film from the 40s to end with a stillborn baby and a woman breastfeeding a grown man, no matter how symbolic the imagery is meant to be.<br/><br/>I have two complaints relating to discrepancies between the book and the movie. The first, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the total lack of explanation involving the disappearance of brother Noah. This left me very confused: in one scene, he is bathing with them in the river, and 2 scenes later they are down to ""4 men."" This strikes me as either an editing or scriptwriting problem, and one of the only flaws I noticed in the film. The other problem I had, which is strictly personal of course, is that Fonda's ""Tom Joad"" came across as more confrontational than he seemed in the book. This is evident in the first scene with the trucker, and later on the porch at the $.50 campsite. My vision of Tom Joad after reading the book was a more softspoken man, not as likely to confront someone directly but certainly not willing to back down once disrespected. Let me be clear in saying that I still think his performance was fantastic.<br/><br/>All in all, I would have liked to have seen maybe 20-30 minutes more of character development or plot points (from the novel) added, but that is just coming from someone who was blown away by the book, so take it for what it's worth.<br/><br/>I would also like to address those who object to the movie on political grounds, saying it's pro-communism, or that it's an exaggerated account of the Dust Bowl. It's well-known that Steinbeck was a Socialist bordering on Communist for at least this period of his life, so it makes sense that he would write a book lambasting unfettered capitalism and progress. Whether you are socialist or capitalist is really beside the point on an IMDb forum. I wouldn't even be surprised if he exaggerated events to further his point. But I maintain that none of these facts, if true, detracts from his theme of disadvantaged people maintaining hope and preserving their dignity in the face of injustice."
"vishal_wall","9","1","2","28 December 2005"," A good documentation of American depression
","I had heard that 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a good movie. I watched it and I found it indeed is. It's a very well cast, written and directed film by John Ford. The movie is about a family from Oklahoma migrated to California to find work during the great depression. I don't know why we call it 'Great' depression rather than calling it 'worst' depression or 'Devil' depression. I think humans are romantic about misery and so all the brutes or incident which brought misery are called 'Great' like Alexander the devil, Napoleon the devil and Devil Depression of America (1929). I'm sure by the next century Hitler will also be termed as 'Great' as by then probably western anti-communist agenda would have subsided and people will find greatness in Hitler's policies. Anyways. Henry Fonda- a Criminal by circumstances comes back from jail on parole to his home during American economic depression only to find his land is grabbed by capitalism and his family has moved to his uncle's farm. He meets them there and as his uncle's farm is also doomed they have no choice but to move towards the west to find work. In rest of the film the whole family keeps moving from one place to the other looking for work. The film has some very moving scenes especially the one where family stops at a restaurant to buy bread. The closeness of the family members, their relationship with each other is shown beautifully. At one point I was really compelled to think they are better off as at least they are together but from the next scene onwards the family starts breaking into pieces. Staying away from the family members is a curse of capitalism and this movie has depicted it in a very formal way. People are just lost on the way. Husband leaves his wife for a job. Uncle takes a dive into the water and asks others to move on as he wants to live close to a river. How things become direction less in a money oriented society is very well done here. Jane Darwell as Ma Joad steals the show. Henry Fonda has never said a word differently in any of his film so no point in discussing what he does here.<br/><br/>This is not a movie where you look for a story. Each and every scene is an anecdote for the people who have seen or have gone through the similar misery. It is a lesson for the future generation that the international conflict of 1914-1919 and 1939-1945 are no separate incidents. American, British and French postwar policies created global depression which resulted in unemployment and bringing communists in to power in Italy and Germany. The Great depression was a result of the First World War and a reason for the Second World War.<br/><br/>I must admit that when characters in the film picked up the mud and called it 'my land' I did not confuse it with 'the land we confiscated from Red Indians'. I'm sure Americans found the whole 'my land' thing very moving but I have read history carefully and could not forget that the same thing happened just a hundred years back and persecuted was a persecutor then. This movie came out in 1940-the Second World War had already started by then. America was still in shambles as Great FDR of Great America had still not looted Great Churchill of Great Britain in the name of help and became a Great American President. It seems movie won two well deserved Oscars for the director and best supporting actress. This movie was a big hit and Henry Fonda became a superstar overnight. The legend goes he reluctantly signed a seven years contract with universal just because of this movie. A must watch."

My life and outlook changed because of books and movies like this. The exploitation of the poor and working classes, man's inhumanity to man. History repeats itself, this time not in California but in China. We buy the cheap goods but forget the slave labor conditions that the peasants of these third world countries work under. Sorry I digress. The production of this movie was marvelous the acting earthy and with depth of emotion.

"Jazzmosis","8","1","2","13 November 2005"," Masterpiece of film-making
","If you're not familiar with the Production Code Administration during the time of this film, The Grapes of Wrath may lose a lot of its hidden meanings. John Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland wanted this film to have a documentary feel (hence the type of shots used), and for the most part, it accurately displays the realities of the depression. However certain additions to the movie that separate it from the book, including a totally different ending that neither Ford or Toland wanted to add give the movie a contradictory feeling to it (thanks to the PCA).<br/><br/>The harsh struggles of the Joads throws the viewer into a world of desperation, mistreatment, and death. Anyone that saw this during it's original must have been moved, as for today's generation, it's hard to imagine the kind of destitution and difficulties the families of the depression endured. And as the viewer begins to sympathize with the Joad's situation, Ford throws a curve with how Tom Joad acts during a meeting with an lost friend.<br/><br/>While it's clear this movie had a political message in mind, the restrictions of the PCA almost ruin the ending, giving almost an opposite message that Ford had.<br/><br/>Technically, Toland is at his usual greatness, putting together shots that make the film appear so real that the viewer wants to step out of their seat and into the scene. While watching The Grapes of Wrath, it's easy for the viewer to forget the advantages of the life we live now and to step into the depression and feel the pain of the main characters."

","As a film of the 1940's, The Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and monumental classic work of American Literature as this is.<br/><br/>Even seen as a bit dated by today's standards, this film harkens back to a time in American History when the Government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for argriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees westward to California.  They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.<br/><br/>This has to be the defintive Henry Fonda performance.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath recieved two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's suspense masterpiece Rebecca.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with 1941's Best Picture winner How Green Was My Valley (another Best Director statuette) and his 1952 homage to his homeland of Ireland, The Quiet Man (yet another Best Director statuette).  But his film career would be crowned later still with what many consider his greatest achievement, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne, Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.<br/><br/>My rating: 2 and a half stars"

Negative cost: $850,000.<br/><br/>COMMENT: So much has been written about The Grapes of Wrath and it has such a reputation as one of the greatest movies of all time, that it is in danger of being regarded by today's cinemagoers as a museum piece. This would be a tragedy. Although the political and economic events which shaped the book and the film have receded into history, the power of its story, the vividness with which its human tragedy is unfolded, and the collectively forceful eloquence of its players are undimmed.<br/><br/>Ford and Darwell deserved their Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards. Fonda was cheated out of his. (I mean James Stewart's role in The Philadelphia Story is a supporting one, not a lead. Furthermore, Stewart plays the part with all his usual mannerisms - nothing special nor distinctive at all).
I could go on for pages about the dramatic impact of The Grapes of Wrath - how it socked me right out of my seat the first time I saw it. And every time since. It's a masterpiece. Brilliantly directed, breathtakingly photographed, atmospherically set and scored, persuasively written and arrestingly played. Fonda regarded it as the high point of his career. So do I."
"Horror-yo","7","1","3","27 December 2016"," Good film, terribly dense/heavy - boring
","As subjective as it may seem, I cannot avoid making the comment this film was a bit boring. Painful to watch. There's a strain that the narrative builds over the watcher, the pressures of an incredibly tough and depressing series of life events, where a viewer may be left thinking: ""well I don't have an issue with dramas or tough films, but why focus on such difficult and common life events ?"" It's one of these things about historical movies - a particular event having occurred doesn't necessarily make for a great film plot or story to tell. <br/><br/>The incredibly rough Great Depression years were awful and all, sure, but to make 2 hours plus of film based on the Steinbeck novel... this is like an American Emile Zola, an American Germinal. That monotonous old naturalism/realism narrative of exploring the misery of the working class... why, out of everything else there is to write about or make a film about... You'd ask yourself why an author would focus all his energy on something so bleak and real, there's such a lack of fantasy, the story telling is just totally flat and linear. What, we're barely given 30 seconds of poetry at the end from Fonda and then a speech from the mother in that last scene, but 2hrs10 for that ?...<br/><br/>Good film. Tough to watch. 6.5/10."

","John Steinbeck's 500+ page novel 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a masterpiece. This film of the book is good but does not reach the books level of greatness.<br/><br/>The film just scrapes the surface of the book. It doesn't show the pain, suffering and hardship that the Joads and families like them have to go through. It's not gritty enough and lacks bite. It doesn't show them toiling and sweating in the fields. You never get intimate with the family and the feelings that you develop for them in the book simply do not appear in the film.<br/><br/>Also, what happens to Noah in the film? He simply vanishes. In the book we know what happens to him. Certain scenes also sound as if they were shot in a tin studio - I hoped they sacked that sound op!!! Worth watching but could be a much better."

","The Grapes of Wrath gives us the hardships and prejudices that ""Okies"" had to face during their journey to California.  Forced off their land, and striking out west, the Joad family encounters just about every kind of hardship, yet the family lives on.  Mostly in part of Ma Joad, who keeps her family going through the worst of times.  Henry Fonda is wonderful as Tom. You can see his anger and frustration behind his eyes.  There's so much injustice going on around him, and he's powerless against it.  When he's about ready to do something foolish, it's his mother that pulls him back and makes him think about what his actions will do.  Unfortunately for Tom, fate has a way of dealing a bad hand and he must leave his family, not for his safety, but for theirs.  John Ford, a man usually associated with the western genre, brings Steinbeck's epic to the screen with skill and care. He invests so much time with the Joads that you feel like they're your own family.  And it pains you to see them go through such pain.  There is an uplifting end to it.  Ma Joad tells her husband that they will live on, they are the good people and nothing will ever wipe them out."

After watching it though I honestly thought this film was horrible and don't see what everybody sees in it. I hated the story, I don't want watch people just struggle through out the whole without any really closure.I need to be entertained and watching a family struggling from Oklahoma to California is not my idea of a great film.

""The Grapes of Wrath"" is based on John Steinbeck's novel, takes place in the Great Depression, and effectively portrays the grief and hopelessness of what many people went through during this time. <br/><br/>Henry Fonda plays the lead character as the eldest Joad family son returning home from serving time in jail for manslaughter.

","Grapes Of Wrath is utterly faithful to John Steinbeck's sad document of Dust Bowl Okies seeking a way to survive. The cast is perfect, the direction the great achievement of John Ford's career, and the photography a work of art.

","John Ford, one of Hollywood's greatest directors, practically hero-worshipped by no less than Orson Welles, made many great movies in his illustrious career, but this is probably his best.  His sure-handed direction, combined with Greg Toland's excellent cinematography, Nunally Johnson's first rate script (faithfully following Steinbeck's great novel), and top-notch acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, and the rest, many of then John Ford regulars, make for an unforgettable portrait of an an America, which, although only existing 60 or so years ago, is completely unrecognizable today.

And I don't know if the version I watched was remastered or not but the shadows and picture kept shaking. I recognized the main character's ""I'll be there"" speech from some place, and a lot of it reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine except much darker and stuff. The ending was OK but unsatisfying. I was hoping for more to make watching it worth it but I was disappointed. I wasn't that interested in the whole context of them movie anyway so I didn't like it to begin with.

","Pretty good film, but awfully slow-moving at times.

He just can't avoid mischief earning him the right to be arrested and thrown in the clink just to get him out of everybody's hair -- and I wished that would have happened. As it was, he continued to screw up despite the constant pleas of his Mom to stay out of trouble.<br/><br/>John Carradine (my all-time favorite actor) delivers a fine performance as an ex-preacher. The film is basically well directed by John Ford, but once the Joads arrive at the 'sanitary unit' camp, the movie is, for all intents and purposes, by that time, over. There just aren't any surprises left. Fonda's final ""I'll be there"" speech is over-rated.<br/><br/>Worth tuning in for Ford's direction and Carradine's acting."

Tom finds an itinerant ex-preacher named Jim Casy (John Carradine) sitting under a tree by the side of the road.

Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property only to find it deserted. There, they meet Muley Graves (John Qualen) who is hiding out. In a flashback, he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land. A local boy (Irving Bacon), hired for the purpose, is shown knocking down Muley's house with a Caterpillar tractor.

It's hard to blame the producers, writer and director for cutting away parts of the book, just as it is hard to not miss the parts that are not adapted.<br/><br/>There are some tweaks to the story that changes the tone a little, especially regarding the ending. I find myself forgiving it, due to the time it was made in. Had a modern day adaptation taken similar shortcuts (in order to achieve a happy ending), I would most likely not have accepted it.

"JosephPezzuto","8","0","1","8 January 2015"," Reel Look: 'The Grapes of Wrath'
","""We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people."" The Grapes of Wrath (1940), based off of John Steinbeck's epic novel, is, for me, director John Ford's most famous black and white epic drama that truly indicates the struggles to survive and the ultimate will to go on amidst a bleak and weary world. Do the Joads give up all hope or continue to pursue their dreams during the one of the most flavorless times in American history? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>The film itself has many great points that I would like to point out, and also not some very good ones at that. A great moment in the film is in the beginning when Tom (Henry Fonda) comes back home only to dins it darkened and dim, and how the lighting appears on his face, which shows almost all of the left side of his face black and white only a little sliver of light displays his right. To me this implied that even though the darkness had come, a little glimmer of hope still remained with him. The acting was great, but it was really Tom and Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) that captivated me by their amazing acting with their facial expressions and Southern accents. <br/><br/>Some weaknesses in the film were the bigotry towards the Joad family and anyone considered to be like them as well. People did not see other people as they should have during that certain point in time. Casey's death, I thought, was a weakness as well. I felt as they should have he should have fought back some more and for what he believed to be true. Tom's monologue near the end of the film was another strength because he believed in a better tomorrow and in the hope of his fellow people. Ma's closing statement as they drove onwards at the climax of the film (though I preferred the book's ending far better) was yet another great strength in telling the audience that her people will never be wiped out, as Ma states with confidence and pride in her last lines to Pa.<br/><br/>This film, being my second viewing, has opened my eyes to what true cinematic history was during that period of fighting to stay alive amidst a barren oasis. A mesmerizing yet tasteful view on what the Great Depression era was like really captured the essence of how it really was. This picture was a true portrayal of living, struggle and having a glimpse upon utmost freedom amidst an hour of flavorless desperation but also carrying with it the utmost refute to give in to despair with the will to just live."

","John Steinbeck published ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in 1939. A well-regarded work of early 20th century social realism, the novel watches as migrant farmers struggle to survive the Great Depression. Droughts, landowners, banks, business cartels, technological changes and strikebreakers weight down upon our heroes, but they stand tall. The novel ends with Tom Joad, one farmer's saintly son, vowing to defend the oppressed and the downtrodden. As Tom embarks upon his quest, ominous flood waters threaten to drown his family and, by extension, his social class.<br/><br/>Steinbeck's novel contains a famous sequence in which a farmer's home is demolished by a tractor hired by a bank. The angry farmer attempts to shoot the tractor's driver, but the driver insists that he is ""only following orders"". When the farmer counters that he will shoot the person who gave the orders, the driver replies that this too would be useless, as this individual is simply another bank employee. ""Well, where's the president of the bank?"" the farmer growls. The driver states that there is no president, only a board of directors who themselves receive their orders from the ""East"". ""Where does it stop?"" the farmer cries. ""Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I can kill the man that's starving me!"" The reply: ""Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't men at all. Maybe it's a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change!""<br/><br/>Steinbeck's point was clear. There is no individual who is ultimately responsible for the economic forces which are harming people. Rather, all individuals are complicit in, and beholden to, a system they are themselves a product of. Such a stance would get Steinbeck labelled ""anti-American"", ""a liar"", ""communist"" and ""a Jew acting for Zionist-Marxist interests"". His book was burned in the streets, attacked in Congress and banned from schools and libraries. The fact that his first wife was a communist, and that he publicly picked fights with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, notoriously anti-union and anti-worker, only made things worse. Over the next few decades Steinbeck would be hounded by the state, and everything he wrote would wind up in a FBI document. It would later be revealed that he was put under government surveillance as early as 1935. Fearing attempts on his life, Steinbeck would buy himself a gun for self-defence.<br/><br/>John Ford directed ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in 1940. The film is regarded as a classic, was showered with awards, but Ford ultimately disliked the picture. The film's leftist slant rubbed against Ford's political conservatism, and the meddling hands of producer Darryl Zanuck oft irked the director. Zanuck is himself responsible for the film's hokey ending, which was installed without Ford's consent.<br/><br/>Ford's grievances aside, ""Wrath"" remains one the director's finest pictures. Like Steinbeck's novel, it watches as a family of Oklahoman farmers are torn from their land. Seeking employment, and respite from drought and sandstorms, they venture toward the state of California, the new Promised Land. Unfortunately their journey points only to broken promises and shattered dreams, an entire nation's notions of ""manifest destiny"" mocked along the way.<br/><br/>Ford has a number of exceptionally photographed pictures (""My Darling Clementine"" and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" especially). Aesthetically, ""Grapes of Wrath"" is every bit their equal. Poised between myth and social realism, the film boasts fine cinematography by Greg Toland, which is abstract in places, expressive, poetic, even ghostly. Unfortunately, like most realist and neo-realist works, which sanctify the poor, the film's photographic depiction of poverty is highly sentimentalised: a continuation of very specific type of Victorian-era aestheticization.<br/><br/>Like most John Ford films, ""Wrath"" features endless waggon trails, armies of travellers ""heading west"", bands of folksy old-timers, expansive vistas and puts a wonderful emphasis on ""community"". Unlike most Ford films, however, ""Wrath"" re-contextualises Ford's usual tropes and embeds them within a plot which counters the conservatism (and stands against the class-bias and implicit racism) of some of his more popular films. Ford would continue this trend with his next picture, ""Tobacco Road"".<br/><br/>""In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy,"" Steinbeck would write. The line, ominous, hinted not only at violent revolt, but the ushering in of a better society. This call for socialist solidarity is erased in Ford's film, which engages in subtle forms of depoliticization and which for the most part avoids Steinbeck's critiques of state, private property etc in favour for populist boss-bashing. Leading the charge is actor Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad. Like his role in Ford's ""Lincoln"" some years earlier, Tom's part folk hero, part Jesus Christ, a homespun redresser of social wrongs.<br/><br/>Ford and Zanuck dilute Steinbeck's novels in other ways. ""The old methods of intimidation and starvation perfected against the foreign peons are now being used against the white workers,"" Steinbeck would write, the author aware of America's long history of exploitation. Indeed, the refugees from the dust bowl accounted for only six percent of the southwestern migrants to California. Most were Mexican and Filipino workers, but this doesn't fit Ford's view of quintessentially white, rugged, American pioneers. The film is also wary of pointing fingers at the state (the land retirement policies of the US government â€“ like the notorious Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was designed to artificially inflate the cost of crops â€“ were instrumental in displacing farmers and landowners) and ignores the confluence of forces (The Depression, the collapse of the tenant system, the rise of mega-agribusinesses, mechanised farming etc) which were pushing people into poverty. Expecting such nuance from one of the most mainstream directors and producers of the era is silly, but it nevertheless partially explains why Ford and Zanuck received comparatively little resistance when assembling their film.<br/><br/>8.9/10 â€“ Masterpiece. See ""Wendy and Lucy"", ""The Wild River"", ""Bound for Glory"", ""Bread and Roses"" and ""Land of Plenty""."

","This tragic tale of the Joad family and their struggles living in the dust bowl during the depression is one of the great literary novels of all time. The movie version has propelled the story to legendary status and is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, sometimes even appearing in the top 10 lists of various film critics and classic movie fans. John Stenbeck's novel also became a great play in the 1990's, one of the few times in the American theater where something already so familiar to audiences could strike a cord and remain as fresh as it had been when it was first written and filmed.<br/><br/>The tragic figure of Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is a quiet man who has been beaten by life, and there is no getting back up for him. Already having been put in prison for murder, he knows there's no way out for the second time, an accidental killing during a riot involving unsympathetic work camp guards and striking workers. All through his journey is his devoted and loving mother, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who provides the voice of reason, still not quite beaten even though she definitely has the weight of the world on her shoulders through the tragedies her family has seen.<br/><br/>If there was ever a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is the tragedy of Tom Joad's life. It seems that the fickle finger of fate is constantly pointing at him, making him doomed to suffer at the hands of chance. There's a big heart tucked away inside a soul that longs for release, and he quietly deals with every unfortunate incident of his life with grace and dignity. It is as if his life is one big shrug of the shoulder. There is no bitterness, only acceptance of the fact that this is the way his life is destined. Yet, he doesn't want to see anybody else taken down with him, particularly an embittered former preacher (John Carradine) and a sad little pipsqueak of a man (John Qualen) whom he encounters along the way.<br/><br/>Then, there's his family, sticking together through thick and thin and never any personal judgments, especially against ex-con Fonda. Grandpa Charley Grapewin (""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Tobacco Road"") jumps up and down with excitement like a little kid, but the same fickle finger of fate that points at Fonda has turned into a visit by death for poor Grandpa. There are no tears in the Joad family, no maudlin cries of ""Why?"", just the realization that they represent the people, always stepped on by those in authority, but some day, those meek people will inherit the earth. Two soliloquies, one by Fonda, another by Darwell, are the glue which holds this together, expressing the depths of their souls and their totally unselfish natures which only long to survive somehow, as long as they are together.<br/><br/>The film has no real conclusion, which represents life which doesn't always have a connecting beginning, middle or end. That's the power of Stenbeck's tale, superbly directed by the amazing John Ford. Every character is there for a purpose, giving some minor players great opportunities to shine. Zeffie Tilbury, the elderly character actress who played bits in some big films and supporting roles in some ""B's"" (and is best known for the feisty old lady whom Spanky, Alfalfa and the rest of ""Our Gang"" encounters in ""Second Childhood"") is moving as Grandma, sitting there quietly and accepting her fate, only briefly mourning her husband.<br/><br/>Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar, is actually a leading lady in this film, but in 1940 Hollywood, if you were portly and middle aged, you were deemed as a character actress, and character actresses (unless you were Marie Dressler) were supporting. Fonda lost his much deserved Oscar to old friend James Stewart who won pretty much because he had lost the previous year for a film he had deserved to win for. Such are the Grapes of Wrath, whether they are the bitter grapes of man's inhumanity to man or the honoring of the most honest performance of an actor's career that has nothing to do with ego but everything to do with brilliance."

","The first time I watched this film I was in middle school and were watching it to learn about the dust bowl and the migration of farmers. I thought it was boring and dry however upon watching it later in life I came to appreciate the portrayal of a poor family struggling to survive after having lost everything. The story more than anything, is about family and perseverance. The film was visually pleasing, the natural light was good, the camera angles were good, the editing was good, and the score was well made. The acting was phenomenal and very touching.

","I really enjoyed this film, from the beginning monologue to the end, it was a great film. It had elements of despair and used flashbacks as a way to get the story told. This film is an adaptation of a previously written novel, and that usually means that the film will not be a decent view. However, that is not the case. Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom, and does a great job at making the viewer believe the plight that one would have when having to move off of their land due to the dust bowls. My favorite part about this film is the theme of hope that ultimately comes from the end of the film, in that man can overcome anything."

Besides the plot, the camera work was incredible. <br/><br/>There was one scene in particular where the camera stayed in a fixed location, it was great because there was these houses that lined right up next to each other.

Along with the fact that a lot of the scenes in this film was taken in the dark. The tonal range in these scenes almost ghostly. It felt as if nothing was left, and there wasn't. These people lost there home but as well as their humanity.

There is probably one of the most mature films I have seen come from movies of the 1940's. The story is during the time of the dust bowl where no jobs are available. The actors are truly inspiring at how they display emotions on their face. The actors take this into their own hands and make it extremely believable.

It also gives a sense of how different things are now than they were then and how good we have it now. Henry Fonda's character Tom was very easy to connect with because he was just someone you were easily drawn to right from the beginning.

"weezeralfalfa","10","0","1","6 October 2014"," classic narrative of the Depression dispossessed, including Exodus, with somewhat optimistic ending
","Judging from the large number of reviews of this film, compared to most other well regarded films from this era, this must still be regarded as a classic portrayal of the plight of the rural poor during The Great Depression, dispossessed of their rented or sometimes owned land and home, forced to flee to distant overcrowded greener pastures or cities. Actually, this flight had begun around 1920, after the collapse of agriculture produce prices with the ending of WWI. Although only white Americans are depicted, African Americans were leaving southern states, especially, in large numbers during this period and subsequently. Although the Joads understandably didn't see it that way at that time, population dislocations, due to technological progress or resource exhaustion and resource discoveries is an unfortunate integral part of relatively recent history. This film dramatizes the generally greater adverse effect of such dislocations on the elderly, who have often invested near a lifetime in their dispossessed property and lifestyle, thus are more reluctant to abandon the familiar for a distant unknown, and are more likely to die trying to get there under rather primitive traveling conditions, as dramatized in this film. This particular point is more thoroughly emphasized in the subsequent film ""Wild River"", in which an elderly woman landowner refuses to leave her lifelong home and plantation, until forced to, even knowing it would soon be drowned by the rising waters behind a new TVA dam. In that case, the woman didn't die of traveling stress. Apparently, she simply willed herself to die, out of depression. She had no desire to start a new life in the TVA-financed alternative property awarded her, in spite of all the immediate and long-term benefits claimed by the TVA rep for the building of that dam.<br/><br/>Instead of looking for work in some city, as many did, the Joads hoped to land some temporary labor jobs in the oversaturated farming lands of CA. They are put off by the primitive living conditions, thuggish guards, lack of work, very low pay, and high cost of basic supplies at the several farms owned privately. Later, they discover the more humane living conditions and friendlier attitude at a federal government-sponsored farm. This is, in effect, a plug for the New Deal projects designed, at least partly, to help alleviate much of the poverty and unemployment. The implication is that well off individuals and companies were only interested in exploiting the downtrodden, not in helping them reestablish decent living conditions. As Tom Joad, Henry Fonda, in articulating his parting ambition to act as a superman, helping the downtrodden, is really articulating some of the general goals of the New Deal and the liberal political agenda. He himself, as an accused murderer on the run and parolee, isn't likely to achieve much of what he claims he wants to do. But well-healed responsive governments could help the downtrodden in their fights against exploiting capitalists. That is the main message. Of course, in reality, this is an oversimplification. By developing new technologies and discovering new resources, private individuals and companies potentially gradually improve the living standards of their workers and consumers, with a degree of competition generally a positive influence.<br/><br/>A few years before, Fonda had starred in ""You Only Live Once"", in which his character is paroled from a prison term for some youthful robberies, with the help of his acquired girlfriend. But, potential employers are put off by his status as a parolee, hence he can't keep a decent job, then is soon judged guilty of a large bank robbery he had nothing to do with.. Later, he accidentally kills a man during a prison break just before his scheduled execution, engineered by his girlfriend. They are later gunned down in an ambush near the Canadian border. Rather reminiscent of the historical Bonnie and Clyde, of the times. In all, a pessimistic comment on the refusal of society to ignore the past transgressions of people, especially poor people, in giving them a real opportunity to make amends. This film was made during the depths of the depression, whereas the present film, with its more optimistic ending, was made as the US was beginning to pull out of the depression, with the beginnings of producing materials relating to WWII.<br/><br/>Jane Darwell, who plays Ma Joad, played an important role in the prior ""Ramona"", which also included Russel Simpson(Pa Joad), and John Carridine(Casy, in the present film). The plot of this film has some strong resemblances to that of the present film. but, the victims of forced evacuation of their homes and fields are Christianized California Indians, soon after CA had been wrested by the US from Mexico. Like the Joads, they packed up their minimal belongings and traveled to some unknown destination. Unlike the other, hostile, Americans, Jane's character was friendly and accommodating to these Christianized Indians. Near the end, she gives a lengthy encouraging speech, with a gist similar to her optimistic speech at the end of the present film. Thus, Jane's character is presented as sort of equivalent to the federally-sponsored farm in the present film. In contrast to the present film, ""Ramona"" was filmed in 3-strip Technicolor. B&W was probably a better choice for the present film. <br/><br/>Another relevant film: ""Sullivan's Travels""('41) explores the largely urban dispossessed during The Depression, and their prejudicial treatment by the legal and penal systems.....Of course, Ford soon followed the present film with the plight-of the-mining community tear jerker ""How Green Was My Valley"". Ford liked to champion the underdog, and the discriminated minorities, of which he, as an Irish Catholic, was one."

","So much for a story about fruit, The Grapes of Wrath is way much more than that! This film may start off quiet and dull, but it leads to a much more action-packed plot! Although different from the original book, the film still does include the major points and the overall themes of the story. The Grapes of Wrath is a story about a poverty stricken family, the Joads, who migrate from their home in Oklahoma to California in search of work and a better life. The main antagonist is poverty which is enhanced in the black and white color settings of the movie. Because it is in only black or white, it is clearly felt and shown the desperation and lack of hope the Joads have. On the entire journey towards California, the family endures every possible trial they could have faced. They lose family members to death and abandonment, suffer from ""persecution"", poverty and hunger, and have a constant breakdown from their run-down truck. However, their determination, along with Ma Joad's eventual leadership, demonstrates one of the major lessons that strength can be found in numbers and with each other. Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad, the protagonist-a man recently released from prison, portrays Tom the way that Tom is supposed to be received. He acts as a caring, yet strong-willed and sometimes reckless youth- which is then shown in Fonda's vibrant facial expressions and motions. All of the actors portray their roles with an enthusiasm that is then proved in the accurate representation of the characters. Although many times, there is a small form of hope throughout the book, viewers never expect that The Grapes of Wrath will have a happy ending. The film did not include the intercalary chapters from the book but enough foreshadowing is presented allowing us to know that it is a moral story with no satisfying end. Overall, this film is mind captivating forcing readers to think about life in many aspects, and reconsider decisions made. It teaches important values and how to have faith in times of hardships."

","Based on the landmark novel by John Steinbeck, John Ford's film adaptation of The Grapes Of Wrath has become almost as large a cultural force as its inspiration. It was selected as one of the first twenty- five films to be archived in the Library Of Congress as a significant cultural artifact and, in my opinion, this was done with very good reasons.<br/><br/>The story of the Joad family making the trek from Oklahoma through to California in search of work during the American depression will be familiar to many people, and as such I will not talk at length about the film's plot. What I will discuss, however, is the deftness with which this material is handled by Ford.<br/><br/>Gritty and realistic the photography and direction of the movie is one of the high points of cinema history. Nothing appears by accident, but nothing is drawn too obviously to the audiences attention. Tom Joad (wonderfully played by Henry Fonda) lighting hand-rolled cigarette in a moment of quiet contemplation, ex-preacher Casy's (John Carradine) nervous twitching as he tries to find his role in the world, and the Joad kids' (Darryl Hickman and Shirley Mills) resigned playing as their stomachs softly growl: all of this is shown with such a lack of overt stylisation that they become some of the most touching and heart- wrenching images to be displayed outside of a documentary.<br/><br/>The attention to detail too is great to witness. The actors wear no make-up as they play their parts in an effort for realism and the car that takes them on their trying journey is the same Hudson ""Super Six"" Sedan described by Steinbeck. Nothing feels staged or overly Hollywood, but rather it all comes across so naturally that one can almost smell the miasma of dirt and sweat that surrounds this unhappy lot.<br/><br/>I think, however, that some of the biting realism of this film have been lost over the years, or at least relegated to being somewhat of a quaint charm. I mean, Steinbeck's novel is taught in many schools and people have become very familiar with the story over the many years since it was written, and this is be no means a bad thing (in fact it makes me happy to think that Steinbeck is still so well respected and widely read), but it does mean that someone sitting down to watch The Grapes Of Wrath for the first time is unlikely to have anything similar to the reaction that audiences had at the time.<br/><br/>The socialist undertones and dissection of the pain caused by a capitalist system left to its own devices now come as part of the package when one hears the title The Grapes Of Wrath, no longer will one be surprised, shocked, and reduced to tears of righteous indignation when these images are presented to them. The discussion of 'pinks' and 'reds' are not so immediate to a modern audience as to make them bristle with deep-rooted political allegiances, but rather they pass the modern viewer by completely or serve only as some historical curiosity of a bygone time.<br/><br/>I suppose that it is better that the conditions of Steinbeck's book and Ford's film do not persist to the current day, but it is still somewhat of a shame that these reactions have been lost, and that a full visceral understanding of the film is almost unattainable today. But still the film must be viewed as a triumph and a masterpiece which does and will remain relevant now and for a long time to come."

He comes home to an empty house and the news his family has lost his land and thus their source of income and survival and from here the family makes their journey across the county suffering many hardships along the way.<br/><br/>Being released just a year after the Great Depression officially ended in 1939 many movie goers related to this film like nothing they had ever seen. It stands today as a reminder of the struggles that we as a nation have overcome and the strength of the average American family.<br/><br/>Besides its historical significance the film was also a major success for the style of the early 1940's. It combined studio setting with location setting which was typical of the time. It was also directed by Ford which resulted in much of his style which included many long and medium range shots. The use of light was typical for the time, which met it was used to determine between good and bad characters and to set the mood of the over all scenes in the film. One example of this includes a scene where the corrupt cops beat and kill a friend of the family. in this scene it is the lack of light that makes it typical for the time period. Overall it is a very well made film and a good movie with historical significance and a good plot that was only enhanced by John Fords unique directing style."

As a result the family packed up their run down truck, and headed west to California to find work. During the voyage some of the elders from the family passed away. The film showed the difficulties that people experienced during the Great Depression, as you saw other families in camps waiting for a place to go next. The look of the movie was out standing, it gave you a good idea what the middle and west of America looked like. The people struggled to find shelter to live and money to eat, but they didn't give up. The whole time that I watched the movie, I was wondering if they're truck was going to make it the whole way to California."
"launsbachc","7","0","1","26 March 2014"," Overall Good
","I have to note that the characterization in this film is very good. It is as if you can really hear and see the pain each character is experiencing. For example when Tom first meets Casy the viewer can easily identify that he has drawn drastically far from his former beliefs and life as a preacher. Henry Fonda (Tom) does a phenomenal job of portraying the sort of rough around the edges but good hearted type. Most of his significant plot developing actions consist of him perhaps doing the ""wrong thing"" but for the right reason for instance when he hits the sheriff. Because the film is centered around depression era Midwest farmers it may be difficult to connect with on a personal level. That said, one thing any whole hearted person can relate to in this film is the love and dedication we have for our families, how important it is, and how it truly reveals itself in times of hardship. To me that was the overwhelming social significance of the film. In the end when Tom is forced to skip town because of the sheriff he tells his mother he plans to fight for injustice. Although it is definitely sad I feel as if Tom gains fulfillment from using his edge and aggression to combat unfairness. Weather it was Casy's attacker or the Sheriff it was clear Tom did what he did for the right reasons and felt good about it despite the consequences. Symbolically as we see Tom off to seek his fulfillment it appears his family may be fortunate enough to seek theirs too as they hear of work north of the camp. <br/><br/>Overall touching film and I enjoyed it. On a side note I think their truck may have been the inspiration for The Hollywood Hillbillies."

","Having read and loved the book, I was a little apprehensive about watching this. I didn't want it to not meet my expectations. However, it went above and beyond them. The movie really painted a clear picture of everything the book was trying to say. The adaptation from book to film was a work of art in itself. It has such a powerful social message that is really hit home through the way it is directed and the way the actors worked together. Also, I felt that the cinematographer of the film did a wonderful job at capturing the fields and open skies of Oklahoma. The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most realistic and captivating films that I have seen and definitely left me in awe, and thinking about the issues it presented."
"rivardoman","7","0","1","24 March 2014"," Family Values at Their Best
","John Ford examines the plight of families at the (cusp) of the great depression. The story is centered around the family of protagonist Tom Jobe. Tom is reunited with his family after serving a four year prison sentence for killing a guy in a dance hall. Ford has such a fluid style of film making. The viewer becomes a part of the family as they pack into their old truck and head west to California. I find that Ford uses a lot of visual metaphors to convey his ideas. For instance, when a families house is demolished, ford pans down to the shadows of the family cast over the tracks of the tractor. Symbolizing the destruction of their whole life. With each day the situation seems to get worse as the sun goes down, but each day brings a new hope as the sun comes over the horizon. The film makers fully understood the effects of lighting, that's part of what makes Fords films so great."

","This movie is a good one, but it's not as good as some of the other films that I have watched recently. When I saw the Route 66 sign, I knew that the family was going to another place. However, I didn't know that the Joad family's travels down the highway was hard. I was sad when Grandpa Joad passed away during the trip down the highway. Other than that, it's still good. The acting by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell happens to be really good as the story moves on. Also, the writing of this movie is so good that it makes me want to see it at least once more. When it comes to how it did overall, I would say that it's not as good as some of the others, but hey, it's still a good movie. People shouldn't regret missing out on this movie."

","Although I normally hate black and white films. This had its educational purposes and highlighted many of the problems we face today. I would love to see this film remade with a present day twist and maybe some color. The actors sold the script and the filming added the drama to the film While everybody learned about the Great Depression and even California Migration resulting in the dust bowl in the Midwest. This movie teaches you what every day life was like for migrant workers. The abuses that ordinary citizens faced everyday just trying to provide food and shelter for their families. Big businesses were profiting millions of dollars while paying workers measly wages and providing no benefits or safety. The film does carry a political tone against big business and anti-regulators."

Then to have to travel across country and lose members of their family along that way is tough. <br/><br/>Then for Tom to faced with more challenges when he just trying to help his family survive, this relates to everyday life as we see it."

","Good movies are the ones that goes beyond a specific historic moment and impacts our present ""moment/life"". You can feel and understand The Grapes of Wrath's message now in 2014. I had to look back into dates to realize that ""La Terra Trema"" and ""Rocco e i suoi fratelli"" both from Luchino Visconti or ""Les quatre cents coups"" from FranÃ§ois Truffaut or even ""Los Olvidados"" from Luis BuÃ±uel were made after John Ford's movie, I felt that in those days only European cinema had these deep drama human elements, but this movie was a good surprise for me. Human spirit struggling; people moving from one place to other leaving everything they have for a new better life, dealing with moral dilemmas, taking care of older parents, hunger, misery, all these elements are always present in one way or another in those days but what I loved about this movie is the ""hope"", the way this American movie believes in the human spirit and doesn't lead everything to a dramatic tragedy. Classic movie to watch!"
"iamyuno2","10","0","1","28 December 2013"," A Must-See Film For So Many Reasons - And One of The Very Best
","If this isn't the finest and most moving depiction of the human tragedies that occurred during the Dust Bowl era, I don't know what is. Yet it is much more than that - it is simply one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will never see - and while it's arguably (a very young) Henry Fonda's very best film, Jane Darwell puts in a performance you will never forget (and you won't soon forget her final line - one of the most historic, moving and memorable final lines in all of movie history). You can't get a better story than one written by John Steinbeck, of course, and the stark cinematography blazes new territory and remains fresh to this day. Even the ""lesser"" character actors shine brightly here. Who will forget John Qualen's performance as Muley or John Carradine's performance as Casey? ...And that's just scratching the surface. Who doesn't fall in love with and care about the main characters, as they desperately try to survive the rigors of the Depression (and whom among us could withstand the horrors they went through)? This is a real story - one that every American needs to know; there is no exaggeration here. The inhumanity heaped upon the most defenseless during the Depression - as brought out in this film - is something few movies have brought out. This is the quintessential Dust Bowl and Depression film. The realism is incredible. The music helps move you to tears, too. The heroism so many of the characters display is not just moving - it speaks of a time when more people were truly noble. What a cast! What a story! What a film!"
"lenavaughan","10","0","1","27 December 2013"," Steinbeck at his best
","Born into wealth, it is hard to imagine how Steinbeck could portray poverty in such a personal way. If it is true that great writers write from what they know, it is astounding. Somewhere he possessed an old soul and a feel for real people and real times. East of Eden is another wonderful example of his understanding of pain and , most of all, of love. Henry Fonda was born to play this role. Why he did not win an Oscar for it is amazing. Attempts in later years to remake this epic movie, a waste. Leave perfection alone. Ma Joad, also, cannot, among today's actresses be redone. Perhaps Meryl Streep in another hundred pounds and 30 years. When choosing entertainment for young readers, this movie is one they should be required to see. Sadly, many English classes no longer have required reading. Watching this adaption of Steinbeck is the next best thing."

","John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is today very much a literary classic, but when this film came out in 1940 it was still a modern best- seller, having been published only the previous year. It tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they head to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.<br/><br/>The novel was a controversial one when it first appeared, largely because of the author's left-wing political opinions, which are clearly reflected in the text. It was perhaps an unusual choice for a movie to come out of Hollywood, an institution which was far less liberal in the thirties and forties than it is today, especially as it was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by John Ford, both generally regarded as conservatives, or at least as far more conservative than Steinbeck. Zanuck did, however, have a reputation for occasionally making films with a social message- ""Gentleman's Agreement"" is another such- and the film does tone down the left-wing emphasis somewhat, removing Steinbeck's editorialising passages in which he comments directly on social conditions, and providing a happier, more optimistic ending. Nevertheless, there is still something socialist about the film, especially in the scenes set in the Government-run camp which imply that it is Big Government, not Big Business, which offers more hope to the little man. <br/><br/>Ford and Zanuck might not have been pleased to learn that their film was twice used by America's enemies to make anti-American propaganda. During the war Dr Goebbels used extracts from it, passing them off as genuine newsreels purporting to show that America under Roosevelt was a backward, poverty-stricken land. In 1948 it had a brief release in the Soviet Union, but was hastily withdrawn when the authorities realised that Russian audiences were drawing the ""wrong"" conclusions from it, namely that in America even the poorest people could afford a car, something which in the USSR was a privilege reserved for high-ranking Party officials. <br/><br/>Apart from drawing attention to social conditions during the Depression era, Steinbeck's book had two main themes, the relationship of man to the land and the importance of the family unit. The first of these is largely omitted from the film; it has been pointed out that, although the Joads are agricultural workers by trade, we never see them engaged in any agricultural work. The importance of the family, however, is something stressed in the film. The scenes in which the Joads' son Noah and their son-in-law Connie walk out on the family unit, while not omitted, are very much played down. <br/><br/>The main characters in the film are Tom, the family's eldest son, and its matriarch, Ma Joad. Both can be seen as symbolic of the American people and their struggle against hardship, although the ways in which they react to their plight are rather different. When we first see Tom he is a rather wild and angry young man, just released from prison after serving four years for killing a man in a brawl. In the course of the family's journey he learns to channel his anger and resentment into a quest for social justice and becomes a committed socialist, but ironically is forced to go on the run after killing another man while trying to protect a friend. While Tom reacts with socialism, his indomitable old mother reacts with a defiant stoicism and determination not to be beaten. To her are given the last words in the film:-<br/><br/>""We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, cos we're the people"".<br/><br/>Jane Darwell, at 61, was probably rather older than the character imagined by Steinbeck. (The Joads' youngest children are still of primary school age). She gives, nevertheless, a compelling performance as the tough, determined Ma, one which won her an Oscar for ""Best Supporting Actress"". Henry Fonda as Tom is equally good, but he lost out on ""Best Actor"" to James Stewart in ""The Philadelphia Story"".<br/><br/>Darwell's was one of two Academy Awards won by the film, the other going to Ford as ""Best Director"". Ford's victory was controversial as he beat Alfred Hitchcock, whose ""Rebecca"" had taken the overall ""Best Picture"" award. Whatever the merits of that particular decision, however, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a fine film, and Ford's direction is one of the things that make it so. He was always a director with an eye for a striking image, something much in evidence here. His stark black-and- white photography is well suited to the film's social realism and unsparing look at the darker side of the American dream. Authors have not always been happy with film adaptations of their work, but apparently Steinbeck was delighted with this one, even though it is not always faithful to his storyline. That fact perhaps says more about the film than any critic ever could. 8/10"

The movie created a portrait for us to see as it goes through the trails this family has to battle. The costumes in this movie not only helped gave us a visual on what the 30's were like; it allowed us to forget about the reality we currently are in. Again, this is the genius of film making.

","I haven't read the novel so can't compare to it; but I am sure from what I have heard that it is like one of the greatest novels of 19th century, the movie probably falls short of the novel. Expressing emotion in a restrained fashion, without using overtly emotional words or body language is something I have now come to associate with the B/W Hollywood cinema. But even accounting for that, the emotive quotient of the movie could have been a tad higher. The Joad family cuts across the width of America from Oklahoma to California in a dumpster truck, lock stock and barrel. Poor grandpa doesn't want to leave the earth he grew up in and the earth grants him the wish, albeit in a tragic way as he dies en-route. Grandma follows suit, though much closer to California. Her burial scene is unceremoniously skipped and I found her body getting carried along with live people for so long a little macabre honestly. The kids seem to have no context of the whole situation which is again a bit weird given that the girl is pretty grown up. They are just happy-go-lucky all the time not missing a single thing and not regretting any piece of the journey. Uncle John also doesn't show any character, nor does the pregnant women. In fact, I believe the chief character of the movie is the mother, but she symbolizes the all-too-familiar middle class matriarch much more than a woman from the time and space she is required to represent in the movie. The situations themselves are assumed to be already known to the audience with the screenplay not bothering too much with explaining the details of what is going on. So my verdict - one time watch. Also I am going to read the novel now and I am sure after that I am going to understand the movie more and like it even less."

In such trying times, it appeared to be very hard for the family to appreciate each other.

","The film Grapes of Wrath, based off the book by John Steinbeck, depicts a family who lives in Oklahoma around the time the Dust Bowl starts. As times get worse, the family is forced to move off their farm and head west to California to find work that is rumored to be there. This film was obviously very important because it brought to life the struggles of the Midwestern people during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, which may only ever have been depicted in books or literature in times to date. The film is masterfully made. This film is in black and white but this does not take away from the experience, it actually adds to the theme by using dark shadings to symbolize the struggles and poverty and desperation. The actors do their part well, and make the audience connect with and feel the struggles they went through at the time. Many people know about the history and hardships of the people who lived in the big cities and were directly affected by the stock market crash, but what is less known, is the plight of the farmers who were wiped off their land by the severe drought that also took place during the Depression era. This movie does justice in bringing to life the struggles thousands of people faced. Through all the endeavors, one major quote from the movie sums up the feelings of many Americans at the time.<br/><br/>""We'll go on forever because we're the people."" The strong and hard-willed matriarch of the family speaks this quote. She is the backbone of the family and she takes care of them the best that she can. She is also very wise and is interested only in the welfare of her family and keeping her family together. In this movie, one of the major life lessons that are spoken to the audience is to always keep moving forward and to never give up. I really love this quote. This was a quote that I already try to live by in my life, and seeing the quote played out in real life is fascinating. Even though this is a movie that was ""Hollywoodnized,"" the struggles that these people went through were real. In real life when the people persevered and never gave up things eventually started to look up. This is a quote every American, especially younger audiences, should try to live by, and this is a movie that is exceptionally well done."

"jon-fougner-966-434081","Null","0","1","12 March 2013"," The Geometry of Underclass Frontiersmanship in The Grapes of Wrath
","John Ford's ""Grapes of Wrath"" captures the salt-of-the-earth Dust Bowl destitution of the Steinbeck novel from which it is adapted. The Joads' trek west is every bit as entrepreneurial as that of the emerging agricultural barons for whom they toil, albeit motivated by survival rather than riches. Position is everything, whether that means fighting to stay or conniving to leave. Ford's cinematography, dialog, and plot bring land to life as another character in the film, animated by the Joads' do-or-die movements across it.<br/><br/>From the opening shot, the terrain is something to be contended with. A high-angle exterior shot of our protagonist Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) walking down the road photographs ground more than half-way up the celluloid. (Perhaps the geometry of this shot influenced that of the crop-duster scene in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest""). Intersecting roads and telephone wires create a rectilinear lattice confining the shot's subject, telegraphing how confined Joad's choice-set will prove. (The store he walks into is called ""Cross Roads."") More high horizonsâ€” most memorably, a high-contrast night shot of the sheriffs' ominous headlights bearing down on the Joads' old houseâ€”further the impression that the distance the Joads must traverse is a wall they must drive through. <br/><br/>If the wealthy typically speak of nouns they own and the healthy, of verbs they do, those tethered to the plane beneath their feet for bare subsistenceâ€”the Joadsâ€”speak in prepositions. Their life is cartographic. When the Joads can occupy their land, they're ""on it,"" and when they're evicted, they're ordered to ""get off"" and they're ""throwed off."" Now, their aim is not stillness, but control of position; seeing Tom, Grandpa exults, ""They couldn't keep him in!"" ""You can't keep a Joad in jail!"" The scene evolves into a comedic sketch in which just about everyone asks Tom if he ""busted out."" The family's watchword is ""across"": they have got to keep marching *across*, even if the grueling pace costs Grandma her life. Similarly, compass directionsâ€”those siblings of prepositionsâ€”are ever on the tip of the tongue, furnishing, for instance, a pretense for the family's escape from the farm (they had gotten a job ""up north""). <br/><br/>Plot developments will confirm our sense that the earth has heftâ€”heft enough to kill (if their jalopy craps out in the desert, as the gas station attendant warns them), or enough to nourish (if its fruits will command five cents a bucket rather than two-and-a-half). Even minor plot details reinforce the primacy of terra firma: when burning family mementos before embarking, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) spares a souvenir of the Louisiana Purchase. Now *that* was a deal on a plot of land. <br/><br/>As for Tom, he made it from prison to Oklahoma to California and now he's got too much momentum to cast anchor. Where to next? ""I'll be everywhere,"" he tells us in his final monologue. ""Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there."" And for all his work in the dry dirt, he's finally transcended the terrestrial: ""I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. . . . And when people are eating the stuff they raise, living in the houses they build, I'll be there, too."""

","This is a great movie with an epic story that is ultra realistic to issues people faced during the time period depicted. The cinematography is astonishing especially for a 1940 film and really helps set the mood of each scene. Tom Joad's journey is a captivating adventure, the struggles him and his family face throughout the film and the hardships overcome made me appreciative all the things I'm blessed with. When originally released I can imagine this film had a strong impact on American society because during the great depression many families had gone through similar situation and could relate. Strong acting done by Henry Fonda really helps to create a strong emotional bond to the characters. John Ford definitely did not disappoint in his adaptation of Steinbeck's most powerful story, truly a thought provoking perception on American life around the time of the great depression. A must see for anyone who enjoys classic masterpieces"

","The Grapes of Wrath was a good film. I had started reading the novel by John Steinbeck back in high school and never finished it. But what I remember from it, it seemed as though i would find the movie interesting which i did. <br/><br/>I was really captivated by the opening scene of the paved road in Oklahoma. Just with the telephone poles and everything it was a great opening scene to draw in viewers. <br/><br/>the story itself of a man, Tom Joad, is one to grab anyones attention. The concept of Tom Joad(an ex convict) breaking his parole to move out west to California with his family was outstanding to me because it was sort of a bad-to-the-bone thing to do and thats definitely enough to get one like myself to watch any film.<br/><br/>i definitely recommend this to everyone.

Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build - I'll be there, too.<br/><br/>These timeless words seemed to be reverberating through the confines of my mental processes, through the ages. Like love at the first sight, i immediately took to them. I had heard them for the first time in The Dream Team. Search as hard as i might, i couldn't find their source at that time. But things have a way of coming back to us when we least expect them regardless of our actually needing them. But as i watched The Grapes of Wrath i found how much i needed them as they spun their familiar magic over me. I had found them at last!<br/><br/>For me The Grapes of Wrath is all about the performances by the Academy award winner Jane Darwell, John Carradine, and one of my favorites Henry Fonda. Its also all about the endearing relationship between Tom and Ma Joad. Its not often that a literary masterpiece has got its due on the silver screen. The Grapes of Wrath is indeed one of them.

"bcaulford","Null","0","1","25 February 2013"," Historically touching
","I found this film to be touching, not only because of the Joad family's unfortunate situation but because this really happened during the Great Depression and in some cases on a far worse level. It's a shame that the whole family started off with twelve members and at the end of the movie only ended up with seven or eight. I commemorate the overall spirit of the family for not giving up and working together to make ends meet and establish a life for themselves. During this time it was very bad for farmers because they were forced off their land with no other direction to go in. Many people died and starved and fought tooth and nail for even the smallest, short lasting job out there. What really makes this film touching and unique is the fact that this actually took place in history and it gave people some insight on how others were suffering and how to be kind and compassionate towards others. When the family stumbled upon the camp that was run by the Department of Agriculture it demonstrated the kindness and compassion that was needed in order for people to survive and make it through the next day. Having that ultimately unified the people into preventing a so called ""riot"" to take place at a local dance just as a excuse for the sheriffs to show up and ransack the place. Tom and mama's little speeches towards the end touched the heart of the audience and affirmed the idea that no matter how hard things get in life you should always keep going and do your best and never give up to live a happy and healthy life. Another thing to add regarding the form is that the camera angles were very pleasing for being an older movie because during exciting scenes, like when there was a fight or a chase taking place, the camera man did very well in following every movement and the different angles made it more exciting to watch and made the audience feel as if they were really there watching it. Overall this was a great film in my opinion because a.) I'm a sucker for historical films and b.) the plot is one that could never get old and ultimately would touch the heart of anyone watching it."

Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.<br/><br/>Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review.<br/><br/>Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.<br/><br/>Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.<br/><br/>John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself."

Huge numbers of migrants had the misfortune of living through both the stock market crash and its aftermath and the lack of rain which left thousands of empty farms.<br/><br/>Narrated by Tom Joad, a man who has just been released from prison and returns to the family farm only to find it abandoned. He meets up with a former preacher, Jim Casey, and they venture out on the road. What they find is not pretty as the banks have foreclosed on countless properties and the rumor spreads that California is a perfect destination for good, high paying jobs. Unfortunately, the employers have sent out many more fliers than people needed for the work and use the oversupply to keep wages low. In order to force a living wage, attempts are made to form unions , which results in violence between starving transients living in camps and the owners who call them reds or communists.<br/><br/>The book is one of the finest works of American literature and director John Ford retains the spirit of the novel using Henry Fonda as every man in the defining character, Tom Joad. John Carradine is also well cast as the doubting former preacher, Jim Casey. The mood is ominous but at the same time hopeful of a better time yet to come.

","""The Grapes of Wrath"" as a film was very similar to the novel in one unfortunate way, it was very slow to develop. It is the story of the Joad family in the dust bowl of the western United States, during the Great Depression of the 1930's. The Joad's are destitute and heading west in hopes of finding a better life. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad was the lone bright spot in this film. The plot was very slow and deliberate, by design. The film is meant to portray a struggle, and the fight against hopelessness, which it does well, unfortunately it does it at the expense of keeping the interest of the viewer. The sad, drawn out tale is, plainly put, not very interesting or fun to watch. As a documentary it would have worked by telling such a fine story, but as a film that is meant to entertain an audience it fell flat on its face. Watching this film felt like work more than entertainment, and although it may be understandable because of the subject matter, the end result is a film that is not enjoyable."
"j-catanzaro","Null","0","1","12 October 2011"," Classic Steinbeck brought to life
","This film is great for many reasons, primarily because it was adapted from John Steinbeck's timeless novel. Although Steinbeck's original thoughts and emotions are written down in the text, John Ford and this cast do a superb job of conveying these emotions and thoughts on screen. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, and does so flawlessly. Each character has their own influence on making this movie great in different ways. At first, we see Tom fresh out of jail, naive to the current times and angry with people and the world in general for the state most people are in during the depression. Toward the end, Tom realizes he can't control every situation presented him, and matures over the course of the film by accepting things that he can't change. Although he carries with him good intentions, the Joad's and many like them are victims of the times.<br/><br/>Steinbeck's novel is a classic, and I think that John Ford does an excellent job of paying his due diligence through this movie. If you are familiar with Steinbeck you'll already know that he writes of many things simultaneously, that is, many of the things he says can be taken at face value or delved into deeply and contemplated end over end. John Ford understands this, and it shows in scenes where his characters give monologues, usually with close up shots to show the raw emotion in their faces. At the end of the movie we see Tom saying farewell to his mother before leaving the ranch. Mrs. Joad inquires, ""What'll you do Tom, go off? How'll you survive- what if you get killed? I'd never see you again"", to which Tom replies, ""Ma I'll be everywhere helpin' out the everyman. (If I were to die) I'll be there when a cop is beatin' a poor fella for no reason, where children laugh because they're hungry, an' they know supper's ready... I'll be everywhere."" It is here that we see Tom's change in his character, which is reflective of the entire country at the time. Beaten and broken, most are forced to fend for themselves in hopes of finding better days. Tom is the opposite, looking out for those he loves and complete strangers simultaneously.<br/><br/>This movie reflects the nation as a whole of the time, and gives us a peek into the simple will and desire of those folks to merely get by without worrying about starving or having a place to sleep at night. As Ma Joad says, ""We'll keep on forever 'cause we're the people. Born on this dirt, live, die, and pass on to the youngster's here, we'll keep on going forever"". See it, read it, love it."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","4","26 April 2011"," A Masterful Film That Lives Up to Its Reputation
","Grapes of Wrath, The (1940) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>I'm sure many could take a political angle when discussing John Steinbeck's novel, which was the bases for this film, which today is considered one of the greatest pictures ever made but I think trying to label it left-wing or right-wing would really kill the deeper meanings in the film. The story is quite simple as a poor family from Oklahoma are kicked off their land and they decide to travel West where they think plenty of work will await them. The family heads off for a better life but soon they're hit with one heartbreak after another. Having watched this for the first time in over twenty-years, what really struck me was the simple message of the story and the rather simple tones that director Ford used to get those messages across. This certainly isn't a film that preaches to you but at the same time it's impossible not to deeply feel what it's saying as the film perfectly shows everything that's great about America and what's bad about it. There are so many classic. landmark moments in this film that many others simply get overlooked or are never really discussed at all. One such scene happens early on when the family, slowly breaking apart, enter a diner wanting ten-cents worth of bread but the rather snotty waitress tells them all that's available is fifteen-cents. What follows is certainly very touching and shows what good can come out of people. Of course, there's also the ugly side mainly dealing with, as Tom Joad puts it, millions of acres of land and thousands of farmers going hungry. Ford clearly wanted to make people feel as close to these characters as possible and I think one major reason he succeeds is because of the documentary feel he creates. The natural lighting was the perfect choice because it really makes you feel the dirt that is on all these characters, it makes you feel the baking sun and it makes you feel as if you're along for this sad journey. This journey from Oklahoma to California is filmed in such a way that you can't help but feel for the people going through it but it also gives you this strange feeling that you can follow your dreams no matter how unlikely they are to come true. Many stated that this film is about dreams that go unfulfilled while others see the ending as an incredibly positive thing to give one hope for going forward. I think my feelings are somewhere in between but there's no question the final speech by Tom Joad deserves its place in history.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and that ""simple man"" quality of the actor was certainly very much needed here and there's no question that it was born here. While Fonda turned in many good to very good performances before this film, it's clear that this here is where he really took off and this simple man part is something he would go onto play countless times in his career. Just that laid back approach to the way he walked and talked really took this character off the book pages and made him a film icon. Fonda certainly gets much of the spotlight but the supporting players are all just as impressive. Jane Darwell is perfect as the strong mother, Charley Grapewin as Grandpa, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad and John Qualen as Muley. Eddie Quillan, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, Darryl Hickman, Ward Bond and Joe Sawyer also appear. Then there's John Carradine who turns in one of the finest performances that any actor gave in any film from this era. It's always rather shocking to see how many terrific performances he gave early in his career before turning to ""C"" and ""Z"" pictures towards the end of his life. It's also rather sad that he wasn't given better film parts because his role as Casy.<br/><br/>THE GRAPES OF WRATH was considered for many decades to be the greatest American movie but then the praise for CITIZEN KANE came around and while the Ford film has fallen over the past few decades it's certainly a film that still touches many. I don't think there's anyway to deny the true power as it's almost what one would call the perfect film. Everything on a technical level is top-notch and you're certainly not going to find many more movies with such terrific performances by an entire cast. Some might try to tear it apart for some political reasons but that would really be a shame and it would only show the flaws of said viewer and not the film itself."

","Grapes of Wrath is a very real representation of what life was like during the Great Depression. There is an overall dark and depressing aspect to the film; families lost their land, homes, food, and great amounts of their wealth. Media tried to cover the reality of the situation by reporting deaths due to heart failure or stroke, instead of starvation, which was the reality. It was a trying time for many people, and Grapes of Wrath, shows what it was like for one family to lose their home to the Depression. All they want to do is go to California, but when they get to the land of ""Milk and Honey"" there isn't as much hope there as they had thought. The camera work for this film was overall good. There were beautiful shots of the environment and land surrounding them. Although the film is a realistic interpretation of a very historical period in American history, it seems to be quite dull. John Ford (Director of the film) may have tried to make too much happen in the film. The family can never catch a break and there's no profound change, making the story seem somewhat repetitive and hard to sit through, and really enjoy/get into."

","Grapes of Wrath is a really difficult movie to watch. For nearly two hours, you watch a family lose their home, get bullied by the police, starve, and lose half their family members to death. And the despair and helplessness is all captured and presented beautifully. GOW is an extraordinarily directed movie, with a fantastic use of camera and lighting. The cloudy country shots are beautiful. As are the dark, enclosed shots(in a different way), with their contrasting sense of lost confinement. It's a simple thing to mention, but the way Muley lit up when Tom was searching through is home was really awesome. The movie is bitchin."

","Upon review of this classic, I found myself immersed into the feel of this film. The lighting in this movie casts a certain element of darkness,doom,and gloom which indirectly reflects the time period this is being portrayed in the film. The plot was interesting, I followed the story and it was an interesting look into what our grandparents and great grandparents had to endure during those times of hardship. I found it also liberating to a certain extent, it made current situations and problems in my current life seem not so hard up after all, at least i haven't been forced out of the home and shipped off to a farm to work for a measly 2 cents... Not yet of course ( considering the shape of our current economy / government ) I enjoyed the casting of shadows, and that most of the film was shot at night, this really gave me the sense of darkness, loneliness, and uncertainness. Not quite sure if the director had that intention in mind while in production, but anyway you look at it, it holds a unique element of darkness to it. I would strongly recommend this movie, its fun, serious, and educating, and tells a story during an important time in Americas history."

Such as the characters losing their homes, the conditions of the camps, and the harsh attitudes people had toward the farmers wherever they went. The film was really slick and well made, it flowed well and didn't get boring. The movie was well acted and well directed.

What was amazing was the photography and lighting in this movie. Though it was in black and white, some how the cinematography of the movie appeared to be so clear. Also, you could notice the use of lighting in this movie. For example, people could tell when it was night time by the darkness in the scene and the light from a candle or a flashlight. The movie did get repetitive since all the family did was move from place to place, but I would expect a story like this from John Steinbeck.

","This was definitely my least favorite movie we've watched so far this semester.

However it may have been what the director had in mind for the movie. also it was very repetitive with all of the hardships the family faced it became almost too predictable, so on the whole I thought the movie was poorly written.

","The 1940 drama, The Grapes of Wrath, was made during the great depression. It was a very touching story about a poor family that loses their farm land and is forced to move to California for work. The movie shows the journey and plenty of hardships they must endure. Unlike other movies they can never seem to catch a break. Grandparents die, their trucks runs out of gas many times, a pregnant women traveling with them is very sick, and they do not have money to feed the children. This movie also shows the bad environments that they are made to live in at government camp and the terrible treatment of workers. Throughout the movie the family never seemed to be in a good place and it dragged on. It was very boring and I didn't need a two hour movie to get the point. I think that if the movie was 40 minuets shorter it would have been a better experience for me. My favorite character was the mother because she had to deal with so much stress and anxiety but always remained cool and collected."
"classicsoncall","10","0","1","19 September 2010"," ""I'll be everywhere, wherever you can look"".
","It's been way too long since I've read the book, and I've seen the movie now a couple of times in the past year. In a political discussion, I'd come across as the conservative, but I don't find issue here with the struggle of the Joad's to find a better life for themselves. History can't easily be defined in black and white terms, and the idea that government programs can be legitimately used to provide for citizens in dire need is to be commended. Those same programs, when used to create class warfare is where I take issue. Because director John Ford was such good friends with conservative stalwarts like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, one would think that he was a Republican as well. In fact, he was an activist liberal Democrat, who admired FDR and JFK. So perhaps it's true he was stirring the pot with this picture, pitting the haves against the have-nots in a way that can be viewed as left leaning. The term 'Reds' was used a couple of times by Henry Fonda in the picture in a questioning way.<br/><br/>All that aside, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is one of the truly great movie classics of all time. It works as story telling and as pure cinema. Ford's direction is impeccable and Gregg Toland's work with the camera is among the best in the business. The characters are perfectly cast, and even though Ford was working with a stock group of his players (Fonda, John Carradine, Ward Bond), their work in the picture transcends their personalities. For Fonda and Carradine, this has to rank right up there as among their best work. The other outstanding performance undoubtedly belongs to Jane Darwell, Best Actress for her role as Ma Joad, keeping the family together through every bad turn the road takes them.<br/><br/>There are so many riveting scenes in the picture that it's hard to pick a favorite. But perhaps the most touching one for me was when Pa Joad takes Winfield and Ruthie into Bert's Diner while on the road. Bert orders the waitress to honor Pa's request to buy a dime's worth of bread, as Pa also contemplates a two for a penny candy purchase for the youngsters. While the truck drivers watching this exchange seem to be derisive in their observation, it's they who make good for the nickel candy. In that brief moment, Ford captures everything anyone needs to know about the good will of Man and the inherent goodness of what it means to be an American. You don't replace that with government programs, or legislate it with fancy sounding bureaucracy."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","9 June 2010"," Overrated with flawed performances, but an overall effective adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel
","John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", was originally published in 1939 and turned out to be both highly acclaimed and highly controversial. This film adaptation was released the year after the book and was also a success. Today, both the book and the movie are still hailed as classics. I recently finished reading the lengthy novel with the intention of watching this 1940 adaptation soon afterwards. Aware of its general reception, I was expecting a great film, better than both of the adaptations of Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" I had seen (the 1939 and 1992 versions). My expectations were definitely not exactly met. As much as I'm sure many would disagree, I don't think it lives up to the source material. I was still impressed, however.<br/><br/>In Depression-era Oklahoma, Tom Joad has just been released from prison. He was sentenced to seven years for killing a man in a drunken brawl, but has been let out on parole after four years. On his way back to his family's farm, he meets Casy, a former preacher he used to know, who has since lost his faith. Together, they go to the Joad farm to find that it has been abandoned. Muley, a former neighbour, comes along and tells the two of them about the dust storms and how they have led to the eviction of farming families from their land! The Joads are now at Uncle John's place, and will soon be leaving for California, just like so many other farming families in the Dust Bowl are doing, including Muley's, but he refuses to leave Oklahoma. The next day, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's farm, so Tom is reunited with his family (his parents, grandparents, siblings, and uncle). The Joads then begin their journey to California to search for employment, and take the former preacher with them on their truck. However, their destination may not be what they are expecting.<br/><br/>Since I was expecting this to be a great film, I was expecting great acting, but unfortunately, I didn't see much of that. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is a memorable but flawed one, and this is clear from the scene where he first talks. Most of the other cast performances can probably be described the same way. Most of them aren't exactly bad, but Dorris Bowdon's performance as Rose of Sharon can be fairly poor, and the way Shirley Mills (Ruthie) says her lines can also be bad. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for the role of Ma Joad in this film, and her performance is probably better than most of the others here. There were times when I wasn't quite as moved as I felt I should have been, especially around the beginning, such as the part where Muley talks about losing his land. It just didn't seem convincing enough to me. However, I did find some parts more moving, especially later on, and found that maybe it got more intriguing after the Joads' arrival in California. For the most part, the film did hold my interest, with the story and the cinematography, though I also found that it ended too soon, leaving out too much of the novel, even though the movie is just over two hours long.<br/><br/>After reading John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, it seemed to me that an excellent movie certainly could have been made out of it, and was convinced that this widely watched adaptation was it, but while many definitely think it is, I think it's overrated. However, overall, it is a good drama. Obviously, there are some differences between the novel and this adaptation. For much of the film, it closely follows the book (though obviously not everything is included), but takes more liberties later on. Also, some parts of the book obviously couldn't have been done in Hollywood in 1940, including the ending. This was long before the fall of Hays Code. Still, despite the differences, I would say this adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is worth watching if you like the book (or maybe if you haven't read the book but like movies from this era), though you obviously COULD find yourself somewhat disappointed, maybe even severely disappointed, even if most people who have seen it haven't been disappointed at all."

","The film Grape of Wrath was shot in 1940. It is a film based off the novel by writer John Steinbeck. Right away just from knowing what the film was based off of. I'm a fan of John Stinebeck other works. So naturally I was excited to see this film. The film takes place during the great depression which was a time of hardship with little employment. This is a story of a family and friend's journey from Oklahoma to California in search of work and a new way of life. Watching the film I felt sad, seeing the condition due to the depression. The film gave views great insight to life during the depression, and the hardship faced by the people who had to live and make through it. How the conditions were so bad at this time that this group of people had to leave their homes, for one evening violating parole, to find a place when they could work and survive. I also was sad because of the misfortunes of the group traveling. The grape of wrath is a film that has great actors who play their parts well. They are believable. This is a film of realism. It's done so well that it's not only believable the viewers could see this film as an actual even that occur during that time in history. As far as the quality of the film's production go.

","I once had the opportunity to read John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""The Grapes of Wrath"" but regrettably turned it down in favor of another novel that I was not so enthralled by. But now looking back a few hours ago on experiencing the famous film adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"", I'm finding myself very eager to look upon the original text that inspired such an enthralling, potent, and strong movie.<br/><br/>""The Grapes of Wrath"" was directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda and this one of the two or three best films either of them ever made in their careers. Fonda stars as Tom Joad, an Oklahoma farmer recently released from prison during the dawn of the Great Depression. Fonda returns to his family, only to discover that they've been forced off their homes and now their only glimmer of hope for survival seems to be to head to California. But when they arrive, they arrive only to discover that things in California are just as back as they were in Oklahoma, if not worse.<br/><br/>It has been eight decades since the crash of the stock market in 1929 and being locked in a global recession at this point in time, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a surprisingly potent little movie to look upon. Not to say that it wasn't always moving and powerful, but it's just that now, the strength of the movie is excelled and pulsed into the nerves of the American people.<br/><br/>Henry Fonda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this movie (and ironically enough lost to his best friend, Jimmy Stewart for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), an event that made Jimmy feel a little guilty afterward) and it would be forty-one years before Fonda was ever nominated for Best Actor again, when he finally won for ""On Golden Pond"" in 1981. And while any performance by an actor as multifaceted and terrific as Henry Fonda is a classic in its own right, his portrayal of Tom Joad is hands-down the cemented image of the struggling American, a performance that is rivaled in this allegorical category really only by Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane."" And these two performances really are the balance of what every human being wants. Welles's Charles Foster Kane has all the money and fame a man could want, but he would sacrifice it all to have a family as strong and close as Tom Joad's. And Joad watches his family crumble around him, envying men who can prosper and live happily.<br/><br/>Now, that's just the allegory, but that's not all that makes ""The Grapes of Wrath"" a great movie. Nunnally Johnson's screenplay is arguably one of the best ever written, as it encompasses these characters and realistically recreates the Great Depression era so well to make it seem as though it were real captures images of that terrible chapter in the world's history. The movie also features a strong supporting cast including Jane Darwell, who won the Oscar for Best Actress. The cinematography is dusty, yet gorgeous at the same time and this too adheres to the psychological effect on the audience. And of course, as with any film, the director is due enormous credit. I'm not sure which film I would consider John Ford's definitive best, but this or ""The Searchers"" would be the two primary contenders.<br/><br/>And yet, even though the movie does portray a Depression as terrible and family-wrecking, it does end on an optimistic, if not entirely victorious note for the Joad family and this is best, not finishing the story. Just giving the audience the right tone to assume and then using their imaginations and curiosity to wonder how to fill up the rest. This is a powerful, significant element of this powerful, significant film."
