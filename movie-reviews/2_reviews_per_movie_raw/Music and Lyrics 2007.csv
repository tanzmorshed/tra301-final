","There are already 222 reviews of this movie, so the chances of anyone ever reading this are slim. However, I'm a sucker for a longshot. (so if you read this review, please give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down...I'm curious to know if anyone will ever read this, buried under more than 200 other reviews)<br/><br/>When a friend suggested we rent this movie, my initial reaction was, ""NO!! It's a chick flick. And besides, it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it."" However, and remember my fondness for longshots, the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.<br/><br/>To my complete surprise, both actors were excellent, and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest, if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs, I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny, and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.<br/><br/>Here's the quickie plot summary: Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s, and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls, amusement parks, and High School reunions. When a Britney Spears-type singer wants him to write her new single, his life changes completely, but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.<br/><br/>I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny, but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie, he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>I now have new-found respect for Hugh Grant, and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness."
"Chris_Docker","8","226","253","12 February 2007"," Cheesy and proud of it
","Let's face it, often we go to the cinema for a bit of inconsequential fun. In case you were in any doubt, Music and Lyrics kicks off with an 80s-style Wham-like video of a band called as 'PoP'. Firmly tongue in retro-chic, Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher, the washed-up has-been now playing the nostalgia circuit for middle-aged housewives. He meets bubbly Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) who waters the plants in his apartment but has a knack for writing lyrics. This saves his day when current pop-diva princess Cora asks him to write and record a duet with her.<br/><br/>Chances are you are now reaching for the vomit bag or saying that maybe sounds like quite a giggle. If you can stomach the idea of Hugh Grant singing his own songs and staging a come back then rest assured, this is a very polished and unsubstantial rom-com. He and Drew Barrymore propel the movie with energy, wit and a warm, lovable enthusiasm. While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves, it is a delightful performance, and one backed up with catchy songs, a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett (Cora) and a heartfelt, realistic script.<br/><br/>Cora is a sort of teenage megastar, somewhere between Shakira, Britney Spears and a youthful Madonna. Her elaborate stage-shows have a 'Buddhism & thong'(mysticism and sex) philosophy. Here, as with Alex and Sophie, the echelons of the music world seem realistically portrayed. While the matches seem unbelievable at first, by the end of the film we want Hugh and Drew to continue their romance offstage, just as with classic romance films of the 30s, so by any mainstream yardstick, Music and Lyrics is a success. The film is as unpretentious as its two lead actors, makes no great claims, and satisfies Valentine's Day release requirements with a sincerity that takes it a notch above the average cheese. Casting is spot-on, even down to Sophie's older (and much larger) sister, who has similar characteristics and mannerisms. It's easy viewing, and even contains nothing unsuitable for older children. If you want more sophisticated and substantial fare, you probably don't need film reviews to find your way to the nearest art-house cinema or Oscar blockbuster. But for straight enjoyment, Music and Lyrics slides down like a very reasonable glass of rich chardonnay. Silly, formulaic, but rather well done."
"cegeon","8","188","223","8 February 2007"," Interesting and funny movie
","I must warn you -- Being a guy, I had pretty low expectations to begin with. However, there were a couple of things I enjoyed:<br/><br/>1) The movie was funny. <br/><br/>-- Hugh Grant's one-sentence witty remarks came out natural and funny. <br/><br/>-- Their ability to poke fun of two distinct musical decades could be better, but still turned out pretty funny. <br/><br/>2) The plot was novel (at least to me). <br/><br/>-- ""Meshing"" the two music periods (the 80's and today) in the same movie provided a good way to contrast the two styles. <br/><br/>-- Since I'm not so familiar with the music industry, I enjoyed the ""behind the scenes"" with the trial and error of coming up with lyrics (at least in the way the movie portrays it.) <br/><br/>Other than that, it was the typical ""chic-flick."" Guy has problem with girl, he says some bad things, stir up some emotional scene and the usual -- will they get back together? <br/><br/>Other than that, if you're just looking for a good laugh, I'd give it a go!"
"toncasgirl","8","138","163","10 February 2007"," Lightweight but uplifting comedy
","I'll admit it, I love this film! OK, the plot line is thinner than paint stripper, the lines more mildly amusing than witty, and the acting isn't going to win any Oscars, BUT...<br/><br/>it's one of those movies that just makes you feel good. <br/><br/>Right from the hilarious opening, showing Hugh's make-believe band ""Pop"" in their ""MTV/VH1"" hit video ""Pop Goes My Heart"", you can't help but smile. Obviously it is especially amusing for those of us who lived through the pop excesses of the 80s, but I have to say the teens in the audience seemed to enjoy it too.<br/><br/>All the songs are pure cheese (and incredibly infectious), which coupled with some amusing lines, a very lovable Hugh Grant, a very cute Drew Barrymore, and fabulous supporting roles from Kristen Johnston and Aasif Mandvi make this movie a great romantic comedy for those of us who actually enjoy a ""bit of fluff""."
"buster1976","7","152","185","6 February 2007"," Surprisingly good fun - better than you'd think.
","I've just read the first review on here and I'm a little surprised at the things it said but as always, these things are only an opinion. Anyway, I went to the World Premiere last night and here's what I thought.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple - Hugh Grant plays a washed out 80s pop star with a flair for melodies but no clue about lyrics. Cue the dizzy plant-girl (do people really have a plant-girl??) Drew Barrymore who can throw lyrics together without a problem. The relationship between Drew and Hugh is built well - especially when you remember that Drew is 31 and Hugh is 47. There's nothing wrong with such a gap, I'm simply saying the chemistry is there (or they would have looked a little creepy).<br/><br/>Haley Bennett plays Cora, a Britney/Christina/Shakira mish-mash who is looking to do a duet with Hugh's character. She is brilliant at the shallow, superficial teen-nymphette and it's a surprise to see that it's her first feature. And check out her costumes! The soundtrack is good fun - pretend 80s songs mix with Cora's modern pop and the Hugh/Drew demo track is nice too. One of the songs sounds a bit like The Whitlams. The spoken section at the very start of the film sounded awful but the rest was fine - maybe the cinema's problem but I was in the Odeon Leicester Square....<br/><br/>The editing seemed a tiny bit, er, clunky at times - scenes cut into each other messily and dialogue at one point seemed to be cut short. It hadn't been but it just sounded that way at the time.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like the film that much - I only went as I fancy Drew to bits (and having seen her close up I'm right to!) but both my girlfriend and I came out laughing and humming the main song. It's genuinely as good as any other Hugh Grant film and is another great performance from Drew (though it doesn't get near Wedding Singer or Doppelganger (joking about Doppelganger)). It's well worth going to see at the cinema and is a proper feel good rom-com. There's no shame in it for us fellas as Drew is nice to look at, as is Haley. My girlfriend loved it."
"midwifejean","9","94","118","11 February 2007"," An unexpected pleasure
","It seems odd for me to give such a high rating for romantic comedy as I always find them frothy and lightweight. Yet I found this wonderfully pleasurable. Hugh grant may have been in his usual role of self depreciating charming English Gent who is living on his past pop star glory but the dialogue and one liners gave his role substance. He more than gave justice to them by his superb timing. Drew Barrimore also fell into the part as a woman who comes to feed the plants and ends up feeding ideas to him for a song in which he cant complete. The acting was spot on, the one liners witty but I think it was the music added joy to the film. As he said in the film don't quote me on this but something like "" there is nothing like a good song for lifting your spirits in a second."" I left this film feeling happy not only for the characters but in myself.!"
"LDGcoolest","8","123","157","7 February 2007"," I liked it.
","From the moment the movie started it was apparent that it was going to be cute. The opening sequence is a hoot and must have been incredibly fun for Hugh Grant. I, as well as the most of the audience started laughing as soon as the movie came on. First time watching a movie that I didn't even notice the opening credits. I really liked the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore. They played well against each other. I could do without the woman from Third Rock From the Sun. I find that she acts a tad too cartoonish in her show/films and this one is no exception. Nice to see Brad Garrett in a straight role. I love the fact that actors and actresses are doing their own singing. I like movies that don't stop at the end of the movie, but have fun things to watch during the closing credits. I suggest you stay for them."
"Sniper_Wolf_86","9","89","116","11 February 2007"," A charming romantic comedy that entertains from start to finish
","Music & Lyrics is a great romantic comedy. Hugh Grant plays the charming English guy role effortlessly as ever and Drew Barrymore demonstrates great comedic timing and brings a sweetness to the part and together, the two have a believable chemistry. The age gap isn't an issue when you watch the movie because it just seems right that these two characters should get together.<br/><br/>What sets Music & Lyrics apart from other rom-coms is the music. The music is woven seamlessly into the fabric of the movie. There are three main characters in Music & Lyrics, Grant's Alex, Barrymore's Sophie and the soundtrack which is enjoyable and deceptively catchy. I came out of the cinema and i had the lyrics to the main song ""A way back into love"" in my head for hours after the movie had ended.<br/><br/>Mix all this together and throw in great supporting performances from Kristen Johnston & Brad Garrett and you get a sweet movie that will definitely make you smile."
"davemelw","7","90","120","15 February 2007"," Delightful!
","I was pleased when I finished this movie... normally by the end of most romantic movies my legs ache from non-use and I have just enjoyed a nice little nap.<br/><br/>I found Music and Lyrics to be charming and clever.... Hugh Grant gives a great crisp delivery on his very witty lines... good interaction between he and Barrymore, some well-timed jokes and a heartfelt ending make this a nice date movie that did not follow the norm in it's character. <br/><br/>Here is where a few things were different<br/><br/>1. The main male character was a not a womanizer charmed out of that life 2. The two characters had no secret shame to be revealed halfway through the movie 3. He did not cheat on her... then they got together in the end<br/><br/>He just did... as Sophie Fisher's sister in the movie, says ""Something Extraordinary"" to win her love.<br/><br/>See it.. you will smile!"
"FrenchEddieFelson","7","14","16","28 May 2019"," What a pleasant rom com!
","This is a nice rom com as lighthearted as mesmerizing. First, we feel an alchemy between the two main protagonists, Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher, even if these two people seem diametrically opposed, at first glance. This is not a love at first sight, but we see them taming to each other, as the fox and the little prince written by <a href=""/name/nm0756686/"">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a> in 1943. Then, I like this constant self-mockery about the cheesy band called Pop, the introduction and last scenes, and the manifold hilarious references of the Battle of the 80's Has-Beens. Finally, the dialogues are excellent with a permanent British humour. Oops... I've almost forgotten: the cast is globally excellent, especially <a href=""/name/nm0000424/"">Hugh Grant</a> and <a href=""/name/nm0000106/"">Drew Barrymore</a>."
"steph4","6","80","131","8 February 2007"," Grant and Barrymore
","I'm a fan of Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. Their personalities alone are enough to carry a movie. And such is definitely the case with Music and Lyrics. Hugh Grant's self-deprecating, dry sense of humor charms. And Drew Barrymore's slightly daffy girl-next-door shtick lights up the screen. These two could read me an economics book and I'd be entertained.<br/><br/>Music and Lyrics has its moments (campy '80s videos, shots at reality shows and pop divas), but overall, the story isn't as good as its stars. And while I love Grant and Barrymore separately, I'm not sure I love them together. Each of their personalities seems somewhat compromised in Music and Lyrics -- as if Grant's sarcasm and Barrymore's sweetness are both toned down. They meet somewhere in the middle, and it's very pleasant...but it's not as good as it could have been. Music and Lyrics is very much along the lines of Two Weeks Notice (both are written and directed by Marc Lawrence).<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's light fluff with some engaging stars, fun pop culture mockery and a song that will stick with you (like it or not!)"
"final_flower","7","35","69","9 February 2007"," Music and Lyrics filled with lots of laughter!
","I got to see a sneak preview of Music and Lyrics on Thursday night! It is so funny! The entire theater was filled and I don't ever remember anyone enjoying a movie this much before. Lately it seems like I'm the only one laughing and enjoying myself during a movie. But in Music and Lyrics I had lots of accompanying laughs! I suggest you see this. It is perfect for your valentine's date...which is conveniently the date of it's arrival in theaters near you! It had us laughing from the very opening scene. And let me tell you Hugh Grant does some amazing dance moves! ;-D I can not wait to go buy the Music and Lyrics soundtrack! I was humming songs from it the rest of the night!"
"tobyfilms","10","5","8","26 February 2007"," Brilliant! Really good surprise
","I thought this would be your average run of the mill rom-com. I am a film school graduate & have watched tons of rom-coms with my Mum - so can kinda predict where they're going - BUT not this time.<br/><br/>What an interesting premise for a film. It was nice to see people with creative blocks or should I say writers portrayed on screen. Being a budding script-writer myself - I can vouch for/say that we (like Drew Barrymore's character) - do have our kooky habits, nervous ticks & things in our past that haunt us & drive us.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is great & Grant & Barrymore ooze chemistry. I hope the film was as fun to make as it is to watch.<br/><br/>One more thing - THE FILM IS NOT PREDICTABLE - though obviously it has a happy ending :-) - Have fun like I did figuring out how it ends! Shall be buying this on DVD when it comes out!"
"DarkVulcan29","10","5","8","20 February 2007"," Totally Awesome
","It makes you think about old groups from the 80's, some are still going strong, and some have moved on to better things. Hugh Grant seems to be at his best when he does comedy, he can say the stupidest things and make them sound charming. He plays Alex Fletcher, a singer who used to be part of a WHAM like group called POP. But when they broke in the early 90's, his career has not been much of anything, these days he performs at conventions, until he is giving the opportunity to write a song for a singing sensation named Cora(Haley Bennett). But soon suffers from writers block, until he comes across Sophie Fisher(Drew Barrymore), a women who has a way with words. They both soon start writing the song together, but will they get it done in time? A great date movie. Hugh Grants comeback After last years American Dreamz. He and Drew have such perfect chemistry, I hope they will team up together again. This movie is funny and has great music, please go see it with a date."

","Whats not to love about this film???? <br/><br/>Hugh Grant, 80's music & Drew Barrymore <br/><br/>Hugh plays himself brilliantly & Drew delivers that oh so delightful koookie (is that how you spell kookie???) girl next door character.<br/><br/>To all intents & purposes it's a standard romantic comedy set against a music biz background but with the added bonus of having Hugh, Drew & Pop Goes my Heart.<br/><br/>Hayley Bennet was rather annoying as Cara but as I've not seen her in anything else I don't know if that's because she was in character or if she just is a bit annoying – who knows???!!! <br/><br/>I love this little film and it gets better with every viewing!"
"shannonmykayla","9","7","15","24 September 2012"," A Pop of Genius!!!
","First of all, I actually give this a 9.5, and I have ALWAYS been a HUGE Hugh Grant fan. He may not be Jack Nicholson, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Morgan Freeman or the ever amazing Liam Neeson, or the never disappointing Tom Hanks. But Hugh Grant is the type of actor that makes you feel good, is extremely entertaining not to mention SO easy on the eyes. He's believable in any role he plays and he makes everything feel so effortless and can anyone deny his natural sexy charisma and boy charm with spews out humour in the most seamless way. And dear God if he ever get's rid of that accent to take on an American one, I'll die. His British accent just sets him right off! OK, so that being said about Hugh....he was the perfect pick for this movie. Drew Barrymore whom I also love, I grew up with her, she's in a class all by herself and really cannot be compared to anyone. She has her own charm and genuine spirit that shines in her eyes and her adorable smile and she brings a light and warmth to anything she is in. She's gorgeous, beautiful, confident, adorable, funny and has a sweet voice. No she's not Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarrondon or Meryl Streep, and neither does she have to be. All that being said, those two, Hugh and Drew were perfectly matched for this type of movie. You couldn't put anyone else together and come out with a better marriage of two characters. If you put anyone else together the movie would have been a huge disappointment and painful to watch. Those two together make it absolutely worth it, and a very sweet, charming and playful choice that has been on my list of favourites for many years now. PS: If nothing else, even if you don't particularly care for another music business story-line (Be Cool, Glitter, Crossroads, Burleseque,and any other ones I'm forgetting), this movie showcases a hidden talent that Hugh and Drew both possess and that alone is worth it. Those two could sing their A,B,C's and it would still be lovely just like they could both read out the phone book and we'd watch it over and over just because it's Hugh and Drew. Choosing them for Music and Lyrics was definitely genius for such a feel good movie that will have you humming your way back into love and popping your heart at the same time. :)"
"g-bodyl","9","8","18","28 October 2014"," Sweet and Charming!
","Music and Lyrics is actually one of the better rom-coms made in the past decade. It's a little cheesy, but who can't resist the sappiness and charm of the film which works thanks to the two irresistible stars and an excellent soundtrack. As a fan of 80's music, I know a thing or two about washed-up musicians, so I enjoyed the film even more. I'm one of those people who believe in this sort of love, so I was even more interested. Finally, I also love the inside joke this movie makes about modern pop music. Those who like 70's/80's music know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Marc Lawrence's film is about a man named Alex Fletcher who is a has-been star of the 80's hit band, POP!. When a young famous musician in the style of Lady Gaga asks him to write a song, he needs to find a lyricist fast. When he learns how talented his plant lady is with words, they become an unexpected pair with an unexpected romance.<br/><br/>This film really works because of Hugh Grant's charm and Drew Barrymore's sweetness. I never knew that Grant could sing, but does he ever have a good voice! And as usual, he is good at being funny. Drew Barrymore has always been a respectable actress and that continues her as the flawed plant girl who is afraid to stand up for herself. Haley Bennett does a good job portraying the typical modern pop star in the vein of Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.<br/><br/>Overall, Music and Lyrics is a sweet though unusual rom-com. This film is almost like a musical, and it works big time. The soundtrack is very catchy and honestly the songs sung in the film will be a good addition to my expansive collection of songs on my Ipod. It's well-written, which it should be since a good portion of the plot is based around writing. Now this is the kind of smart rom-com I want to see on Valentine's Day. I rate this film 9/10."

","I actually first saw this movie in theaters with my girlfriend... there wasn't anything else really good out and we had no idea what it was about so we took a chance... and truth be told I wasn't all that impressed.... I thought it was alright but the only thing that made the movie somewhat memorable and worthy of consideration for a second viewing was the pop! music video at the start...<br/><br/>However, I watched it again the other day with a friend of mine and I was pleasantly surprised... I found Drew Barrymore's quirky, off beat and spontaneous character adorable and Hugh Grant was great as Alex. The characters were both lovable, the humor (especially Alex's quick wit and one liners) were clever and funny and in the end the movie was a slightly different but none the less enjoyable love story. This movie was really underrated in the box office and continued on that track unfortunately. So never mind renting... go do yourself a favor and pick this movie up at your local video store.. chances are, like Alex's solo album in the movie, you'll be able to find this hidden gem on sale for $9.99 somewhere..."
"fuscusamongus","10","8","18","6 February 2007"," Gap between has beens draws closer
","A long line of people viewed a special screening of this feel good movie. If you want to revive that uplifting 80's checkerboard, big earring era, watch this guilt-free for a sit. We laughed through a good part of it, knowing that this was a playful nudge at musicians in the way of ""Spinal Tap"". The commercial machinations of success such as Britney, Christine, et al, is shown via parties and videos, with the added twist of sex and spirituality--nod to a common pop theme today. This movie may have been the perfect format for Hugh Grant; as his ever deepening crow's feet appear, his appeal bridges into a new era--whether of not he draws large sums of money, or if that matters to his fans, remains to be seen. Drew Barrymore seemed to shy away from...something. Maybe it was written into her character, or not... Although a pleasure to watch two musical eras meld, it's not a classic, but good for a smile out of the cinema."
"Superunknovvn","7","9","21","15 March 2007"," Good one
","When I walked into this movie I asked myself what I had gotten myself into. Why would I see a Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore flick voluntarily? I sat down expecting the worst... and was pleasantly surprised! Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play their parts very well and were not as overly cute as they sometimes are. Kristen Johnston was, however, the one who stole every single scene she was in, a bit like Jack Black did in ""High Fidelity"" (only she was not quite as good).<br/><br/>What's best about ""Music and Lyrics"" are the songs, though. From the opening number ""PoP! Goes My Heart"" a perfect homage to the 80's, both visually and acoustically, to the hit song Grant and Barrymore are writing during the movie, the Soundtrack was catchy and lovable. You won't be able to get those songs out of your head even days after you've left the cinema.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Music and Lyrics"" does have its cringe-worthy moments but they're rare. Mostly the story of an 80's has-been who gets another shot at both, love and fame, was realized with a lot of witty dialog, and funny scenes. The mild satire on the current pop business as well as 80's nostalgia was dead on and very welcome.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" is a light-hearted romantic comedy that will put a smile on your face, the rare case of a chick flick that guys can enjoy, too... if you're prepared to sing ""PoP! Goes My Heart"" for the next couple of days, that is."
"jamesbourke59","10","6","14","15 February 2009"," The Citizen Kane Of Romantic Comedies
","For as long as I can remember, my movie viewing of choice has always been the horror movie, or to be more precise, the B horror movie.<br/><br/>However since I got married a few years back, my viewing habits have gradually changed, I still find time to watch the odd horror flick that warrants my attention.<br/><br/>As with marriage, you have to share and care for one another, and I would never dream of making my good lady sit down and watch such demented delights as 'Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers', the mere mention of title practically makes her raise an eyebrow, so such delights I often leave for myself to recall with fondness.<br/><br/>That being said, having worked in video Shops, and cinemas down through the years, I have often decided to swerve anything that remotely contained the romantic comedy angle, but the love of my wife is such, and rather than ruin such romantic interludes as Valentine's Day or a romantic date for two out to the cinema, I more or less have opened my mind to other cinematic possibilities.<br/><br/>So as the years have passed, such suspect delights like 'Love Actually' 'Pretty Woman' have left an indelible impression upon my festering heart.<br/><br/>Such a similar case can also be said for this slice of rom-com candy floss. Initially the notion of watching Hugh Grant in any sort of movie would fill me with deepest fear.<br/><br/>However my guard was down one night, in popped the DVD and there I found myself hooked.<br/><br/>As has often been the notion, whenever you have the very beautiful Drew Barrymore in a movie, more often than not, you would be guaranteed some modicum of entertainment.<br/><br/>Just ask Adam Sandler, whenever he needed a romantic comedy to fly at the box office, a simple call to Drew would more or less bring multiplex cinemas to their collective knees.<br/><br/>Beyond anything else that Mr Sandler has made before or since, both 'The Wedding Singer' & '50 First Dates' will always rank highly for me as pure romantic comedy entertainment.<br/><br/>Perhaps, such a notion also entered into the mind of writer/director Marc Lawrence, when it came time to cast this very fine movie.<br/><br/>Granted not all of the movies mentioned will have made mega bucks, but their legions of fans will have guaranteed that the DVD sales would have wanted similar parings.<br/><br/>If we were to be honest, Hugh Grant's acting talent is pretty much focused on that one character trait, that of the foppish cad, and as long as the project suits the actor, then the movie will always be given the green light.<br/><br/>Now I haven't watched 'Two Weeks Notice' Or 'Miss Congeniality' but during my video shop days, both these titles always flew off the shelves.<br/><br/>As has been mentioned many times previous writer/director Marc Lawrence certainly has a way with the written word, and this is certainly on display here.<br/><br/>Both Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore work very well together, Drew as ever showing that slight glimmer of vulnerability which is always endearing in movie of this type.<br/><br/>Couple their performances, with the witty script as well as the very excellent soundtrack, which I have since purchased, and cannot stop playing, especially the main track 'Way Back Into Love' this movie in my humble opinion, is truly a wonderful experience, that really makes you feel spot on inside.<br/><br/>The additional performers in the movie also add a touch of class to the proceedings, especially Brad Garrett and the very sexy Kristen Johnston.<br/><br/>More often than not, certain films can withstand the test of time and become true classics of their respective genre, okay so this movie might not reach the fevered heights of acclaim of 'Gone With The Wind' or 'The Wizard Of Oz'.<br/><br/>However for me this movie could possibly be the 'Citizen Kane' of romantic comedies, but the again, I'm the guy who loves his horror movies, but as my wife often says, 'Give it time my love'.<br/><br/>My rating for this movie is 10/10"

The movie made me want to go home with my husband and listen to A-ha, Wham! and Duran Duran.<br/><br/>I know the hair was awful and the clothes bizarre. I know they used ""clapping"" machines too much (is that what they were called?) and the music was often over-produced, but heck, this movie just brought back the pure joy of ""wake me up before you go-go"", and with life in the States just sucky these days, it was fun to feel good for awhile.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT."

"tedg","Null","8","21","15 February 2007"," The Show
","Films define romance to such a dominant extent that the so-called date movie can't stray far from ""the story,"" the story of what romantic love is all about. Naturally the larger arc of that story must be that the couple falls in love (often in unlikely or ironic circumstances). They break up usually because of some misunderstanding (and in this case it is often a miscommunication) or because the man is reluctant. Then at the end they get together again, and exactly how the man makes the plea is the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>That last act, the re-romance, the certification of what we saw before as genuine... that is almost always a public act. There has to be an audience in the scene. The reason is a narrative necessity that I call folding. We feel things more sharply when we think we are part of them. So if we see ourselves literally in the film, if we see an audience watching as we watch... If we see their faces react, then we react too.<br/><br/>So for many, many date movies, the writing challenge is how to engineer that final fold. Here it is done by starting at the end. We need Grant to sing a love song to an abandoned Drew, in front of a packed audience at Madison Square Garden. The writer (in this case Lawrence) may have started with the problem, so he created a writer with the same problem, how to find the story, the words. Its brilliant, the solution. Drew IS the words and also provides the words.<br/><br/>Its made plain even for the stupidest of us: melody (which Grant provides) is just the appearance. The words are the soul, where the romance is rooted. That's Drew. Of course you knew that going in, but she actually says this on screen.<br/><br/>Along the way, we are given a B. Spears like singer who shows us the superficial, literally buttwagging public seduction of the most superficial kind. On Drew's side is her sister a huge, heavy woman who runs a diet supply store but eats like a horse. She brackets Drew with the sexy singer to let us know that although Drew isn't pretty and thin and sexy in those ways, what she has is the words. In fact the ditsy singer initiates the search for the words that Drew provides. We even have the food and words metaphors combined when our lovers talk about real romance as real song and both as ""dinner.""<br/><br/>Its a remarkable solution. As the need for expensive, solid date movies increases, look for all sorts of clever writing along these lines.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the actual film-making here stinks. Its just a poorly done movie that handles the sparkles from these two ineptly. Its odd, because the shows within the show are marvelously perfect, including an ersatz music video at the very beginning. That video, by the way distills the entire story.<br/><br/>Oh. Drew's character is unhappy at the beginning because she has been ""badly written"" by her former lover, a novelist.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

Drew Barrymore is so lucky.<br/><br/>It feels good to reconnect with the 80's, plus the musics are surprisingly very good (I can't stop singing ""I said I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then pop! Goes my heaaaarrttt...)I spent a very good moment watching this movie which gives us an idea of how hard can the music industry be.<br/><br/>Morality of the story: you never know where and how love can strike!"

","Love the film. But, it has one scene (breakfast) which must have been filmed when the continuity person was terminated and before the new person was hired.<br/><br/>Watch the scene. It was shot at least three times (possibly four) and cut together. Watch the plates, glasses, hands, sitting forward or sitting back, etc. All of this is screen center and by the primaries, not atmosphere. Seriously funny to watch. The largest number of continuity errors I have ever seen in a single scene.<br/><br/>Other than that, the overall film is a fun watch.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't stop watching... the story continues through the credit roll."
"moonspinner55","4","1","1","20 January 2016"," High concept rom-com drowns in adorableness...
","Hugh Grant acquits himself admirably in this half-hearted music biz satire-cum-romantic comedy, which has too many targets, too few jokes and totally unreal characters. A 1980s pop music has-been, a singer/keyboardist once part of a bubblegum outfit called PoP, has recently been commissioned to write a song for the reigning teen-queen on the charts; he likes the randomly delivered lyrics thought up by his substitute 'plant waterer' and they form a songwriting partnership. Drew Barrymore's gregarious personality would appear to be the perfect counterpoint to Grant's dry witticisms, but the dim brand of 'cute' writing here leaves Barrymore stranded. She attempts to fall back on her patented charm and pluck, yet this is the kind of silly screenplay wherein her Sophie Fisher can quickly rattle off rhyming sentences yet suffers a complete block when faced with her nemesis (a best-selling author who...oh, never mind). The strongest aspect of the movie turns out to be the songs, which have an authentically retro feel and almost manage to convince us that Grant could have been another Andrew Ridgeley. *1/2 from ****"
"lastliberal","6","1","1","10 June 2007"," Are these pants a bit too tight?
","The basic formula for a Hugh Grant romantic movie never changes. Finds girl, loses girl, and rejoins girl to live happily ever after. That is why I love watching his movies. They are predictable and he is predictable and funny.<br/><br/>He seems to match with some of the best women in the business. Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, Andie MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice, and now Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>Barrymore and Grant are perfect together. She has that infectious smile that makes her irresistible. They both have those charmingly quirky looks, and they just seem to fit well.<br/><br/>It all makes for one of the best films he has done and one that I will watch over and over."

","So, finally got to see Music and Lyrics. It was WONDERFUL! A perfect date movie for all ages of couples. It was sweet, but realistic. Hugh and Drew played a man and woman coming together awkward and clumsy. They think things about one another, but learn more as the movie moves along. Speaking of moves, who knew Hugh Grant had them, along with a good, no scratch that..a great singing voice. Drew can sing as well, so who knows maybe maybe they will each will put out a c.d. I can't wait till it comes out on DVD, so I can watch it over and over. Also, Drew and Hugh are so cute as a couple and since they are both single, I would love to see them pull a Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck and get together for real, get married and have a cute baby. Yea, I know, it's just a movie, but who knows. Maybe love will find a way into their hearts for one another. ;D"
"AshGurl2897","10","7","19","21 February 2007"," More fabulous than I expected!
","This isn't the BEST romantic comedy ever, but that isn't what it is intended to be. It is a subtle film (if you can believe it) and it treats love in a really decent manner. The two main characters are not immediately obsessed which one another, but actually they develop a real relationship this is believable (as believable as it happening initially in the span of 4 days, can be believed).<br/><br/>The piano scene where Hugh sings, ""Don't Write Me Off"" is destined to go down as one of those classic romantic comedy scenes in years to come.<br/><br/>Drew and Hugh work - much to my surprise. The music is poppy and fun, like the film and the message is clear, entertainment doesn't need to be Shakespeare to be worth your time. Pop music - and thusly the romantic comedy - are time honored traditions which may not be the most high society, but they make an impact on people nonetheless and there is a LOT to be said for that.<br/><br/>Great film! Give it a shot, you'll like it. :)"
"g310709","6","3","6","17 February 2007"," Lots of Recycling
","This movie is definitely better than the regular horrendous romantic comedies (i.e. Failure to Launch, How To Lose a Guy...); however pales in comparison to Hugh's other movies such as Notting Hill or Love Actually. In addition, there is a fair bit of recycling that goes on from these two movies: The dancing (from the PM character) and cheesy singing/music videos (from Bill Nighy's character) is straight out of Love Actually. And several scenes are very similar to Notting Hill: when Hugh interrupts a guy at a restaurant who has wronged his girl, the dinner party scene where you meet friends and family, and a lot of small jokes Hugh makes are extremely similar...<br/><br/>As a Hugh Fan, I would rate this movie above Two Weeks Notice (atrocious), but below everything else, even Bridget Jones 2. Drew was cute, but sometimes not believable - the character of Cora was done really well."
"lisahenshall","4","12","39","2 February 2007"," For die-hard chick flick fans
","This is a sweet, gentle, occasionally amusing, but ultimately dull romantic comedy. I mean it has it's moments - there are some funny lines here & there - but the whimsical story plods along without much excitement. Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore are both good comedy actors but somehow combined on screen they don't really have much chemistry. Music & Lyrics is PG rated so it's never going to sizzle but it feels like more of a teenagers chick flick than one aimed at an audience my age (mid-30s) that actually remembers the kind of 80s has-been pop star revival that's celebrated here. It's pleasant enough and if you're out with a bunch of your girlfriends then it would pass the time - but I wouldn't queue up for a ticket!"
"bettierools","1","11","36","14 February 2007"," WORST romantic comedy I've ever seen
","For goodness sakes. I guess there's this memo out that says when an actor really 'makes it', he or she can cease making an effort to make a nominally-decent script work. Hugh and Drew, who I normally love, just didn't have clearly developed or devised characters, and heck, they didn't seem to care about it. Sophie (played by Drew) was supposed to be a New York neurotic-cum-brilliant writer, but I soo didn't buy it. Hugh, as Alex Fletcher, was meant to be the usual doddering, stuttering English guy (think Notting Hill, Love, Actually) but in those films he had additional characteristics which made him lovable. In this one, you can't be sure who and what he's meant to be (is he nice? is he mean? WHAT'S Going' ON HERE??). He was just so freaking average, as was she, that it was just plain implausible that one could actually be enamored of the other. Also, their jokes, which were already weak, were poorly timed! Not all blame is on the actors, however. The director, editor, and script-writers certainly played a part. Editing was in general poorly done, ruining the fluidity of each scene, ruining further those already-horrible gag lines. And the director could've made a couple suggestions to his actors, like, for instance, telling them to ACT! Also, these possible villains were introduced (Sloane for Sophie's character, Colin for Hugh's) but were put to little or no use. Last, the movie was ABOUT music and lyrics, but the music and lyrics devised for the movie were impossibly un-catchy, impossibly BAD! The movie's only saving grace, if I am to be kind, is that '3rd-rock from the sun' actress. And perhaps that Pop-Up video homage at the end. But remember-- that means you have to sit through the whole thing to see a two minute golden nugget. In a nutshell, people-- don't see this film, unless you want to waste your money and be supremely disappointed! Doesn't work as a V-day flick or couple-thing or formulaic cutesy film or anything at all! Me and my boyfriend wasted our date and 25 pounds (think fifty dollars) on this crud."

I think it was a brilliant play on romantic comedies I loved how they made you think about the age difference and should they even be together and then you were wanting them together through mid movie. It was clever how they made you mad at Alex character and then you fell in love with him all over again! <br/><br/>I was shocked to find out that it was truly Hugh singing on the soundtrack and amazed how good he sounds being a younger gal makes you look at a mid aged 47 year old in a whole new light!

"pjl-7","8","5","13","20 February 2007"," Grant and Barrymore - an unlikely combination that works!
","Who'd have thought that Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore could pull off something like this? Grant does his standard ""I'm a complete airhead, but I'm terribly lovable"" role, with his usual skill. Drew Barrymore has also made a career out of portraying airheads - bimbos who are a few french-fries short of a happy meal. At first blush, you'd expect a pair of ditzes like these to turn in a Lucy & Desi style slapstick shtick, but surprisingly, the combination works. The humor is generally understated, and Grant's funny lines spin forth with the impeccable sense of timing and delivery that he always brings to his work, while Barrymore does a very creditable job at holding up her end of the farce.<br/><br/>Of course, the plot is pedestrian, hackneyed and unoriginal, hence the down-grading from 10 stars to only 8. Boy meets girl; one of them doesn't like the other much, and anyway they're mis-matched; along the way a relationship develops, breaks, gets mended, breaks again. No surprises here. But the underlying thesis of an autumn-spring romance, while it, too, is far from original, does give both stars a chance to show what they are made of. The awkwardness of the situation, the slow dawning attraction, the petty generational conflicts are portrayed with a sensitivity that we would expect more from a serious drama than a fluffy feel-good comedy like this.<br/><br/>Top marks to the special effects crew for the retro video of the band ""Pop!"". The age regression techniques are utterly believable, such that it's hard to credit that they didn't actually dig out some awful archive footage of Hughie from some forgotten vault.<br/><br/>As a recommendation, I can't do better than report my wife' s reaction. She is a person who NEVER wants to re-watch a movie she's already seen. If she is watching a film on TV and begins to recognize it as something she's seen before, she immediately turns it off. So I was stunned, at the end of this film, to hear her suggest that we stay put in the theatre and watch the next showing as well. Is it worth paying good money to view on the big screen? Probably not, unless you're a die-hard Hugh Grant fan who wants to see him, larger than life, swivel his hips like Colin Firth in ""What a Girl wants,"" or you're a latent pedophile who wants to ogle at giant, nearly naked Haley Bennet faking an orgasm on stage. Otherwise, just wait for the video."
"owlglass","9","5","13","19 February 2007"," Charming
","M&L is driven by several major sources of energy, if you will, mixed together with skill and a fine sense of timing: absurd comedy, parody, utter predictability and an overwhelming charm that only a romantic-comedy hater could resist. As for me, I was...well 'charmed'. Hugh Grant, as my wife noted, basically always plays the same character: a mix of hapless but amusing bumbler with a self-effacing sense of insight into his own bumbler-ness and maybe human nature in general. In anybody else this endearingness would be annoyingand do not doubt that there are a lot of Hugh-Grant-haters out there; and good for you, because I know where you're coming from. It's just that I'm not with you on this.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore has always had a slight inherent cluelessness and innocence, mixed it with a twinkle of the actress's own life-ups-and-downs, that made her perfect for this little flick. This is in contrast to another not-so-recent movie Ever After, which was very likable and charming, but I wished the Cinderella character had been someone else, because the US accent just gratedjust as did, for example, the accents in The Three Musketeers and especially Chris O'Donnell's D'Artagnan. I can't abide that kind of sloppiness. But here, Barrymore was perfect.<br/><br/>They spent a lot of time on music numbers in this one, playing songs almost all the way through. This normally would have annoyed me for I would have thought of it as the time-filler it might have been. If it was, well in this instance I don't care, because it worked as well. And the ditty Way Back Into Love is a real earworm. It made the whole thing almost believablebelievable enough at the time to allow, for me at least, effortless suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, this is the kind of movie I could never make or script. I don't have the disposition for it. Because of that I really have no notion of how to make it betterand that's a good thing, because I wasn't sitting there, asking myself ""but why didn't they..."", which is what I sometimes do in flicks that I might have written, but in which I detect serious flaws. If this thing here had flaws, well, I don't care. It was fun and games and lots of laughs. And yes, call me whatever you want to, but I was humming that damn tune when I came out.<br/><br/>Till Noever, owlglass.com"
"shigatsuhana7","8","6","17","11 February 2007"," Just a fun film
","It was so refreshing not to see Hugh Grant doing his typical bumbling character. I enjoyed the story very much and thought it was believable. There are a lot of American small jokes in the film that some British viewers may not catch, but I still think it was very funny and anyone will enjoy the film. There were plenty of funny moments and if you happen to be a 38 year old woman like myself, you'll understand that we still love our teen idols from the 80's! I don't know how believable the character Cora was. Seems like she had older women in the audience rather than the 12 year olds that would seem more likely. And it's very unlikely that the writer of a song would get as much credit during a concert. Just small observations were annoying, but it is Hollywood after all. The 80's references were quite funny and I would say that this movie is definitely geared to people in their mid- to late 30's. It's a non-thinking movie, just be prepared to be entertained."
"kidnotorious2001","1","9","29","24 February 2007"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
","Just got back from watching this piece of dreck. Although Hugh Grant did have a few good one liners, as did Drew Barrymore, overall this movie was as complete a disappointment as I can ever remember. All of the music was pretty bad including the ""Comeback"" tune written by Grant and Barrymore. The music was as simplistic as can be imagined, sounding more like what a beginner musician composes. I cannot imagine the audience at the ending concert actually standing and applauding for this collection of simple chord changes and uninspired lyrics unless, of course, a gun was held to their head. The one bright spot was Grant and his trademark dry humor and ability to deliver an insult in such a fashion as to make it sound like a compliment. But alas, even he was not enough to save this movie. Overall, it was a complete waste of $16.50."
"crockerz","2","7","21","10 February 2007"," Unfunny, cringeworthy
","I got slightly tricked into seeing this film, due to a couple of OK reviews. Within about 5 minutes (after the only OK bit, the opening video clip from Hugh Grant's character's '80s band) the mistake was clear - a painfully unfunny script, a cheesy set-up which stretched credibility well beyond breaking point, awkward performances...<br/><br/>Hugh and Drew are forced into a scenario where they are writing a pop song for a mock- Britney character. The second quarter of the film covers the process of writing this 'masterpiece', scenes which seem to be trying to be both hysterically funny and an artistic revelation as this apparently wonderful song emerges. <br/><br/>Amazingly, the only way from here was down, and throughout you feel yourself heading towards a truly painful finale, which it is no spoiler to reveal arrived even more corny and more painful than imagined. <br/><br/>There is a character throughout the film - a young lyricist which Hugh's character is initially paired with, meant to symbolise the ""serious"" writer - a figure of fun. Towards the end, upon hearing the song that Hugh and Drew wrote together, he mimes blowing his brains out at Madison Square Gardens. Watching this movie, I thought ""I'm with that guy""."
"tieman64","Null","4","10","20 October 2011"," Nobody grows up in Florida, unless they're an orange
","""Music and Lyrics"" finds the usually intolerable Hugh Grant playing a washed up pop singer who meets a young songwriter, played with customary cuteness by actress Drew Barrymore. As per formula, he's cynical about music and the music industry, but her optimism, love and energy rekindles his zest for art and life. They fall in love, break apart, and then get married, the film climaxing with Grant writing a song for Drew and then revealing it to her on stage in front of a crowd of thousands.<br/><br/>It's your standard boy meets girl, boy loses girls, boy gets girl back formula. What's different here is that the film has been deliberately reverse engineered, the film-makers starting with a very specific set of problems: how to get a guy and girl romantically writing songs and singing for one another, and how to climax the film with the guy expressing his love to the girl via song in front of a large public audience. As cinema and music, or rather pop-cinema and pop-music, largely define man's understanding of love and romance, the intention here is to tap into a kind of ultra romance, director Marc Lawrence trying to create a more mainstream version of what John Carney did a year earlier with his indie film ""Once"" (also another Barrymore project, ""The Wedding Singer"").<br/><br/>The film is at its best when its satirising 1980s glamour and pop music. It also pokes fun at the contemporary music scene (many young, oversexed, dumb pop stars gyrating for their rumbustious fans), but such jabs are less funny. As with most of these films, the climax must be a public event, we the audience watching as an audience watches our heroes. This both enfolds us in the drama and taps into a kind of primal need for public validation.<br/><br/>Usually with these films the female role is given to a foreigner, someone verbally impaired. It's the male character who masters language and is in a position of linguistic dominance. Here Barrymore is the master of words and Grant's the stammering goof-ball.<br/><br/>Note that both actors are all surfaces. They're constantly blasting us with ultra cute, ultra romantic, ultra bashful, ultra suggestive, don't-you-want-to-just-kiss-me-now poses. Every gesture, pose and inflection is relentlessly calculated. Barrymore's an old hand at this now. Grant too. Love is itself a game of broadcasted and exchanged signs.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Romantic comedies, keeping the human species breeding since 1909. Worth one viewing."
"claudio_carvalho","7","4","10","17 June 2007"," Leaving the Past and Finding Success and Love
","In New York, the washed-up singer Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) has a decadent career singing his old hits in amusement parks, school reunions or dinner parties to survive. In the 80's, he was a successful singer of the band POP with Collin Thompson, but when his partner split, his solo-career was a complete failure. His manager and friend Chris Riley (Brad Garrett) schedules a meeting with the successful teen singer Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) and Alex has a chance to be promoted in a show if he delivers a new song for Cora's concert in the end of the week. Alex has difficulties to put lyrics in his melody, but he accidentally discovers Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who is temporarily watering his plants and proves to be a sensitive poet and efficient lyricist. Their song is approved by Cora, but they disagree about her interpretation, while they fall in love for each other.<br/><br/>I agree that ""Music and Lyrics"" is predictable and even a little corny (but I loved the romantic end). However, it is also a delightful romantic comedy, with wonderful chemistry between the sweet Drew Barrymore and the charming Hugh Grant, and has an adorable and enlightened character performed by the gorgeous Haley Bennett , who makes a magnificent debut on the screen, and lovely songs. This feel-good cute movie is like a contemporary fairytale supported by music, lyrics and love, and I really liked it. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Letra e Música"" (""Lyric and Music"")"

","To be honest, when Drew Barrymore first made the scene not that many years ago, I wondered if she was up to the job of carrying the family banner. Just goes to prove that genetics will come through if you give it half a chance. Her performance in this film is magnificent! Music and Lyrics is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, a good script, well cast, and capably acted by both Barrymore and always dependable Hugh Grant. (Every mother's favorite husband material.) There's enough comedy to keep it light, yet enough everyday relational drama to keep it interesting, and above it all it's a feel-good story. My wife and I both loved it, and agreed as we left the theater that it was an IMDb 10. Hope you feel the same way."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","10","15 February 2007"," Not exactly Gilbert and Sullivan, but pitch perfect for Valentine
","The title ""Music and lyrics"" may just invite certain expectations. Don't expect the wit and sophistication of Gilbert and Sullivan or, for that matter, Lerner and Loewe. But then, as Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) enthusiastically proclaims, simple words from ""Smokey"" Robinson bring you as much joy, e.g. ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day; when it's cold outside, I've got the month of May"".<br/><br/>Fletcher, a ""has-been"" pop star from the 80s, is now surviving on theme park tours from coast to coast, with Knott's Berry Farm and Busch Gardens at the top of his aspirations. Out of the blues comes a break, when teenage pop goddess Cora Corman (Haley Bennett), who ""survived her parent's divorce when she was seven through the help of his songs"", wants him to write a song and perform it with her on the next big concert, on short order. Circumstances lead to his teaming up with domestic helper (""plant girl"" for watering plants) Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who seems to have a talent for writing but had never written any lyrics before. She takes some convincing, such as his calling her things like ""Cole Porter in panties"". When they finally get to work together, don't expect any G&S type of fiery exchange as you see in ""Topsy-turvy"". She does make an amusing point though, declaring that music is like the initial passion which is all physical, but it is the lyric which comes afterward that really is the foundation of a love relationship, as you find out about each other.<br/><br/>While the music and lyric is pleasant and well placed, this movie is a romance pitch-perfect for Valentine, sweet and simple. Grant is still the best in this sort of role and Barrymore is sweeter than honey and maple syrup put together. Worth noting is Bennett, apparently a real pop singer, playing the superstar that is hot as fire on stage, and cold as ice once off the limelight."

However, the film delivered on some very good humor that any man or woman who grew-up in the 80's would love. Hugh Grant did a very good job, and of course Barrymore did fantastic. I would compare this film to ""The Wedding Singer"" in the way it uses the music and genera of the 1980's. If you enjoyed ""The Wedding Singer"", you will enjoy this one. If you are too young to know the 1980's, or too old to care about that time, then I would not recommend it as much. You will probably still enjoy this film, but not as much."
"Danusha_Goska","3","6","18","18 February 2007"," Two Funny Bits; Otherwise, The Ruination of a Perfect Premise
","There are two funny bits in ""Music and Lyrics."" The first is the opening credits. Hugh Grant plays a pop star in a take-off on a music video from 1984. It's very sweet and funny, and captures the music videos of that era.<br/><br/>The second funny bit is Halley Bennett as Cora Corman, a teen-s1ut music sensation, similar to Britney Spears.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is the ruination of a perfect romantic comedy premise: Sophie, a deep, soulful poet who publishes in literary magazines (Drew Barrymore) writes lyrics for Alex, an aging 80s pop star trying to make a comeback (Hugh Grant).<br/><br/>The script is a sloppy, nearly incoherent mess.<br/><br/>Sophie, as all female romantic comedy stars these days, is both mentally retarded and mentally ill. In spite of repeated communications of this simple idea, she can't figure out that when you enter a musician's house, you don't put your heavy handbag on his grand piano. She gets a cactus spine in her finger and pleads for major surgery. She *crawls across a restaurant floor* because she can't face a restaurant patron.<br/><br/>There's more. Sophie waters plants for a living, but she can't even water a plant correctly. She waters the sofa instead; she waters a plastic plant. She pours coffee onto the kitchen counter when trying to pour coffee into a cup.<br/><br/>If she were in your kindergarten class, you'd give her the *really big blocks* to play with.<br/><br/>For *this* Alex, Hugh Grant, falls in love with her? The same Hugh Grant who fell in love with the regal Andie McDowell, who was NOT an idiot, in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""? And why do all women in romantic comedies these days have to be complete idiots, anyway? And for their idiocy alone men fall in love with them? What does this say about how Hollywood views women? Drew Barrymore, who plays Sophie, is Drew Barrymore. She doesn't act; she doesn't perform. She is just ... the very same Drew Barrymore you've seen on dozens of talk shows. Perky, cute, dimpled; cute, perky, dimpled; perky, cute -- you get the idea.<br/><br/>Hey, with a name like ""Barrymore,"" maybe it's asking to much to expect her to actually ACT. I guess John, Ethel, and Lionel were genetic flukes. Or maybe they could act because they never entered rehab.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant can act. He's brilliant, as always. Two problems, though: The script is a mess, and he looks old enough to be Barrymore's father. This is not attractive. The script doesn't work to make it attractive. It just gets creepier and creepier.<br/><br/>There's a really weird, discordant scene. Campbell Scott plays an allegedly abusive novelist and college professor. Campbell Scott plays this role with such intensity and conviction, an intensity and conviction completely missing from the rest of the movie, that you feel as if you've been shuttled into a completely different movie, a Scorcese neo-noir about this professor's shady shenanigans and the dark truth hiding behind the allegations of his having harmed Sophie. Since Sophie can't stand up to him, you wonder if his allegations against her are true, and there's a much better, darker movie hiding behind this foolish, inferior one.<br/><br/>This movie, like many badly made romantic comedies recently, just breaks my heart. Why is the romantic comedy genre in such bad shape? What do atrocious movies like this say about the current conception of women? A final note -- I really want to applaud Kevin Smith's bravely trashing of this mess on Ebert and Roeper. Thank you, Kevin."
"SnoopyStyle","7","3","7","6 October 2013"," Grant-Barrymore rom-com A-Team
","Director/writer Marc Lawrence is kind of a rom-com hack. And that's basically what we have here. The story is weak, but it's the two stars that make this shine.<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a has-been singer songwriter. He's living off his former fame, but that's drying up. So he's forced to ghost write for pop princess Cora Corman. Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) is the substitute plant waterer. (really?? that's a job?) She ends up being his lyricist.<br/><br/>It's all very silly and manufactured. But the storyline does allow a few jabs at popular music. Grant and Barrymore are super cute and amiable together. They are amazing rom-com material. Their chemistry is off the charts. They both have great comic timing. They make this premise work."
"madonnawb","5","3","7","18 September 2007"," Looked Cute but didn't quite live up to the Expectations
","At least not mine. There were quite a few funny parts and Hugh and Barrymore really make a cute couple, but the plot unravels happened kinda too fast and was a bit too silly. It was simply missing something more real to settle it down and give it more personality. Seeing Hugh Grant do his pelvic thrusting for most of the movie wasn't exactly the highlight of my day, and there were some editing faults that were an eye sore as well- example when they are in the restaurant for brunch the camera angle switches from her back and front and it is not sycronized, one moment she holds her ice tea with left hand other moment it is in her right hand, then she is putting the pastry in her mouth and next shot there is no food in her hand. This goes on for about 2-3 minutes and makes me wonder how come they couldn't spot it. It gives me the impression that it was done quick, low budget and not very well thought out- just like the plot and the dialogue. Not to say that Hugh and Drew don't have chemistry or add life to the movie but could have been much much better."

Neither of Grant nor Barrymore are among my top favorite actors, but they really make the cutest couple. They played the parts so well, and I think they had really good chemistry. It takes a lot to make a great movie, and this was one of them. You should definitely go and see it!!!!!"

Hugh Grant was great and adorable as an ex-pop star, and Drew Barrymore was so cute as the plant-girl. They worked well together, really complimented each other. I would never have guessed it, never in a million years have put them together, and we were pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>There are some tender moments, and quite a few laughs, especially subtle ones coming from a modest Grant.<br/><br/>It was hard seeing Barrymore and Johnston as sisters, as they're so different physically, but it worked, and Johnston was hilarious.

","i rented the DVD just a few days ago. the moment i PoPed in the DVD and hit 'play'.. i started laughing with the 'Pop! Goes My Heart' music video.. what went thru my head was on the spot was.. the music video's a great concoction of AHa, Wham! mixed with Duran Duran.. and Hugh definitely makes a great Simon LeBond clone!! I was a Hugh, sorry HUGE fan of Duran Duran during the 80's and i adored Simon LeBond, so u can imagine the joy of 'seeing' him come back as Hugh Grant!! LOL also, the part in the music video where Hugh was dreaming of him and his girlfriend under the rainbow was hilariously, mainly because of the their facial and physical exaggerations!! :)) Speaking of Wham! Collin Thompson, played by Scott Porter, really reminds me of a George Michael look-alike and Hugh Grant... perhaps the more forgotten Andrew Ridgeley...<br/><br/>anyway, there isn't a song in this movie that i didn't like, so hats off to Marc Lawrence and his team of writers and songwriters..<br/><br/>now here's the clincher >> 1. this movie has the potential of Grease1 and Grease2, so hint to the producers of this movie.. have a Music and Lyrics 2.. with the same humor and great songs.. i remember Grease2 was also a great hit like Grease1, except they replaced Olivia Newton-John with Michelle Pfeiffer. Don't do that with Music and Lyrics, keep Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore as they are, but spice it more, with them writing more songs together as a couple with some ups and downs (as required in movie plots etc..), whatever, the team of wonderful writers can think of something.. do it!! It'll be a great hit again, i'm certain.<br/><br/>2. Next, make this movie into a Broadway theater production.. i can see the stage productions of Cora on stage with the gigantic Buddha!! And have 2 characters play Alex Fletcher. A younger one to do the 'Pop! Goes My Heart' music video and the older Alex Fletcher to do the acting. This Music & Lyrics musical will be a hit, again i'm certain, 'cos the music is memorable, and had us humming and singing the tunes and bits of singing the lyrics (as much as we can hold in our heads without reviewing the subtitles on DVD!!) Well done!! Music and Lyrics has held my attention throughout the whole movie. It was hilarious from the beginning to the romantic end backstage!! Bravo!! BRAVO!! and please start planning some kind of ENCORE!! Cheers!! P.S. i wasn't sure i was gonna like Music & Lyrics at first (that's why i didn't catch it at the movie theaters, and recently picked up the DVD at the video rental store), 'cos i wasn't a big fan of Two Weeks Notice (also by Marc Lawrence). But Marc Lawrence has out done himself this time. So all is forgotten about Two Weeks Nottice. :) of course, now i'll be heading to the stores to buy a copy of the DVD, for my own library!! Loved the extras in the DVD too, so well-done to the DVD production team."
"Buddy-51","7","2","4","23 June 2007"," comic romance hits all the right notes
","With its tune-filled tale of songwriting lovebirds, ""Music and Lyrics"" pokes good-natured fun at the accoutrements and defining elements of '80's pop music and culture.<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher is one half of a chart-topping duo known as POP! (obviously modeled on the real life WHAM!), that reached icon status in the mid 1980's. Since that time, while his opposite half (the George Michael of the team) has managed to blaze an amazing career as a solo performer, Alex has had to content himself with life as a certified has-been, appearing as a theme-park attraction and on 80's retrospective shows just to keep his name before the public. Suddenly, however, Alex is given the chance for a comeback when a Brittany Spears-like singer offers him an opportunity to write a new hit song for her. At just that critical moment, Alex meets Sophie Fisher, an insecure young woman with a talent for writing poetry, whom Alex asks to supply the lyrics for his melody. Soon, the two of them are writing up a musical storm and falling in love in the process.<br/><br/>Boasting a litany of snappy one-liners and spectacularly engaging performances by Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, the movie manages to hit its satirical points without reducing its targets to stereotypes and caricatures. The story, it's true, can't entirely escape the strictures of its romantic comedy formula (Alex has the requisite nervous-Nelly manager who lives in fear that his client will make all the wrong career choices, and Sophie has an overprotective, celebrity-obsessed older sister, who feels compelled to advise her younger sibling on all matters relating to the heart), but writer/director Marc Lawrence at least manages to insert a few narrative surprises along the way. Above all, the movie wins us over with its wit and charm, its knockabout humor and ebullient spirit, and its dead-on parodies of '80's fashions and music. The original score by Adam Schlesinger is pleasant and catchy in a slick, commercial-jingle sort of way, and the movie starts and ends with an uproarious takeoff on glam music videos from the mid 1980's. Finally, Kristen Johnston, Brad Garrett and Haley Bennett manage to bring warmth and depth to characters who could easily have been relegated to the status of cardboard cutouts in less capable hands.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" may not be the most credible movie ever made on the theme of romance, but this upbeat tale of love in the music biz hits all the right notes."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","2","4","22 June 2007"," A pleasant romantic comedy
","I didn't know what to expect out of Music and Lyrics, from the trailer, it just looked like a rental where you might enjoy it, but it looked a little too cheesy. But I rented it recently and watched it, it was actually a pretty cute movie that over all I have to say that I was impressed with. Hugh and Drew were just absolutely adorable together and the story was so sweet, they really made it work. Because it could have been over the top cheesy, but due to a great director and these two terrific actors, you'll find yourself enjoying it.<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher, he was huge in the 80's with his mega boy band phenomenon, PoP! But now in 2007, there's no room for him, he's a has been. But there is a new hot artist who loves him, Cora Corman, she wants him to write a song and sing it with her. This is the chance for him to get back onto the scene instead of constantly singing at small fairs and high school reunions. A girl, Sophie, who is taking care of his plants starts to sing a little with Alex, and he realizes she's his ticket to a hit song. Together they come up with a great duet and find themselves loving each other. But Alex may have to sacrifice certain things if he wants to be back on top.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it is predictable in some ways, the story is a romantic one that I'm sure anyone could enjoy. It has good clean humor, which was a pleasant surprise for once, I absolutely loved Kirsten Johnston's character, Sophie's sister, she was so funny. She delivered that line ""Gary! I'm going out!"" so perfectly, it got a great laugh from me and my mom. I would recommend this for an afternoon movie, I think you'll like it.<br/><br/>7/10"

As a love comedy it is more well adjusted to women, but for me as a man and after i have hated a lot of this type of films, this was really good. Hugh Grant is an expert in this type of films (i can't count how many beautiful and famous actress he has kissed already: Renne Zellweger, Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock, Jeann Triplehorn among others); so his acting is quite well fitted and with style, his pop dancing and his show is really funny!; Drew Barrymore is beautiful ad his acting is deeply lovely, i am simply in love with Drew, she has the most beautiful face in Hollywood!, and her acting in this movie show her beauty, natural as she is. The Cora Corman character is great!, as a Shakira/Christina comic symbiosis is great!. A movie definitely to enjoy, laugh and stay with a pleasant smile after a while.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE MOVIE: Hugh Grant is Alex fletcher, a previous pop star who was part of an 80's famous band called Pop!, this band broke up and his career declined, while the other star of the group was successful as single. Hugh live only by giving small shows with the help of Chris Riley, his friend and manager (Brad Garret), Alex suddenly find an opportunity for compose a song to the popular pop singer Cora Corman (Haley Bennet), but he has only one week for the job. He met in the way Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), a retired Literary student who took care of Alex's plants, Alex see in Sophie special abilities in composing songs, so he convince her to help him in his challenge, they two start to show feelings for each other, while making this song, some great and funny episodes evolve trough the movie, where Sophie's sister Rhonda (Kristen Johnston) an ex Pop! fan, and Sophie's previous university teacher Sloan Cates (Campbell Scot) appear.<br/><br/>7/10! a good love comedy!"

","I saw this twice in as many days, once on cable TV and then on a flight. A fellow traveler and I laughed at the appropriate places; he was seeing it for the first time. I enjoyed it both times, and for a male that's saying something.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant as the ""has-been"" pop idol is a neat play on his real life ups and downs and ups. Drew Barrymore has come a long way since she showed David Letterman her chest as a birthday gift (and, I was watching the show that day.) So, 'redemption' hangs heavily in the air for both leads. Redemption is what the love-song of the title is about, equally for the songstress 'Cora' (Haley Bennett) for whom it's written; for the two leads' careers; for their relationship; for the goofy agent (Brad Garrett) who is trying to keep his client and the money-stream; for the gushy sister (Kristen Johnston) and her fading youth and so-so marriage; for the vacuousness and shallowness of the recording industry and its 'star' cycle; and so on.<br/><br/>The small-part players are well done. For instance, the DJ, Derek (Billy Griffith), comes across as not only a hanger-on. <br/><br/>The music is also a player. The three main songs (""Pop! Goes My Heart"" the song under the titles, ""Way Back Into Love"" that is written in the movie, and ""Don't Write Me Off"" sung to win back the girl) are all good. I could sing them all after the movie had ended. Well done to their authors.<br/><br/>All this is dealt with in a quaintly unromantic way, while the romance takes another thread through the movie. The reality-meets-fantasy threads cancel out what could be sickly-sweet and make it a great watch, with a few things to think about on the way.<br/><br/>Marc Lawrence has written and then made a good vehicle for the talents in the movie, including his own."

","Really, it is a cute movie. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore work well together. Both of them give fine performances. The real stand-out, of course, is Kristen Johnston best known from Third Rock From the Sun. She was quite funny! The main downfall of the movie for me was the Cora Corman character. It was obvious that the director told her to act so stiff and non-responsive, but it was a bad decision. I think the character could have worked better if she had just played it as a whining pop star, so that was a disappointment. The final song, however, ended up being really beautiful. A great song, coming from a movie that really did all I wanted it to do- It made me laugh, kept me entertained, and provided an easy night out. 6/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

In addition, this movie is proof that Hugh Grant is a really wonderful actor. Not only does he have a flare for comedy, he can sing even though he's not known be a singer. And Drew Barrymore gives a wonderful performance as a lyricist. This movie may not win any awards or accolades and probably will soon disappear from the movie theaters, but if that happens that will be too bad because this movie deserves positive recognition."

","Okay, total Hugh Grant movie, but one of his better ones. It's not all about the romance, but mostly about the music. It's hilarious, Grant is unbelievably funny and he (as Drew) has a perfect timing. The numerous funny lines keep you laughing throughout the movie. The music is cool, totally believable and I was surprised to hear those songs and actually love them all. *soo buying the soundtrack* Hugh's voice is a bit high in some songs, but especially when he sings in a lower voice, it's a pleasure to listen to him. His playing-the-piano-scenes are great. Okay, I'll admit it: I love Hugh Grant in this movie. Hilarious, believable and cute. <br/><br/>Drew Barrymore was really good as well, I hadn't seen much of her, but she's cool. Funny, weird character and very lovable. She has good chemistry with Hugh. <br/><br/>Newcomer Halley Bennett had some really funny lines, especially in the beginning which make you see the superficiality of the music industry today. The movie makes fun of it and still portrays it in a way that makes everybody recognise it and therefore believe it. Halley is doing a great job and I can see how she'd be a superstar (even though her character's weird. But all stars are weird these days, so that's just fine). <br/><br/>Last remarkable actor was Sophie's older sister. Her first entrance made me love her immediately. The character is a bit stereotypical (:-S), but funny. Drew's storyline with her as with her children is nice to see.<br/><br/>This movie is worth your money, mainly because of the actors. The story is okay, not really outstanding or whatever, but good. The actors and the music make this movie great and make you leave with a happy feeling and some new songs in your head."

While Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore don't have a lot of chemistry, they make up for it in their acting and comedic timing. This is particularly true of Grant. I found myself laughing aloud several times during this movie. While this isn't the kind of movie that leaves you sighing about the romance, it was a lot of fun and very cute. I loved the 80s pop references, and Hugh Grant is very believable as a washed up 80s icon. I will most likely be buying this one when it comes out on DVD, if only to see Hugh shaking his hips again!

I then saw the trailer one day when at the movies, which made it look a little better. In more context, the jokes were actually somewhat humorous and the love story we all knew was coming seemed to have potential. The cast of Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant, however, acted as my main convincer, and as I walked into the theater for my 8:00 showing, I was still uncertain what I was getting into. Boy, was I wrong. Music and Lyrics, while certainly not award-winning, succeeds in charming audiences with its lighthearted humor. Yes, it's a typical romantic comedy, with certain twists and turns as predictable as clockwork. It was the same old boy meets girl, interaction, feelings develop, dramatics occur, etc., etc. However, fans of the genre walk into the theater expecting this and knowing that it takes more than format to make a movie successful. Music and Lyrics contains that more. The jokes are clever and funny, the acting is touching, the music is catchy (as it's been in my head for days) the plot still even manages to pull viewers into the story. Yes, the movie isn't perfect, with a few corny lines and a few undeveloped plot points. Yet even so, I left the theater humming the tunes and grinning from ear to ear. ""Praise indeed."" =D"

"Rogue-32","10","2","4","15 February 2007"," This movie is dinner AND dessert
","Music and Lyrics has been on the top of my list of must-sees from the first time I caught the trailer; any film that features Hugh Grant as a washed-up 80s pop star and Drew Barrymore as his song writing partner had to be more than serviceable or there's no glimmer of hope for the movie biz - that was my thinking. Today, I got to see the film, and I'm thrilled to report that I liked it even better than I had expected, from the trailer, which is a monumental rarity for me.<br/><br/>This film works on every level, from the premise on up. Hugh Grant was born to play the role of Alex Fletcher. In fact, I cannot think of any other actor who could pull the performance off as brilliantly as he does. The thing about Grant that really sets him apart from others who do romantic comedy is his perfect timing combined with his abundance of natural glibness - he has a way of making witty dialogue even wittier by having it sound as if he's actually just thought it up and is speaking it spontaneously. There are not very many actors you can genuinely say that about. And Drew Barrymore - her mere presence is enough to make any movie at least watchable, and here she is given a great character, a superb co-star, and a clever set of circumstances to work with. <br/><br/>The film is both charming and funny, which is not an easily-achievable combination. It never gets contrived, heavy-handed or mean-spirited, and just as importantly, it has heart. It's got a lot to say, as well, in a subtle way, about the serious topics of writing, inspiration, honesty, relationships, the music biz in general, and more specifically, the tightrope act that it takes to deal with the commerciality factor of superstardom while still maintaining one's integrity in the process. It also has an extra ace up its sleeve in the form of the absolutely gorgeous Haley Bennett, in a star-making performance as pop star Cora Corman, the person who enlists Fletcher's services at the get-go, which starts the delightful plot wheels turning. <br/><br/>I especially appreciated how Cora's character is not made out to be a bimbo, some brainless puppet whose career is being controlled by some behind-the-scenes mastermind. This is evident particularly in the Madison Square Garden concert scene toward the end, where -=- SPOILER ALERT -=- she decides to do the song that was written for her by Grant's and Barrymore's characters the proper way; this is shown to be ultimately her decision and her decision alone, not a 'corporate' one. -=- END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>There aren't too many films, let's face it, that can make you laugh out loud (and I laughed out loud a LOT during Music and Lyrics - sometimes at the hilarious one-liners delivered so impeccably by Grant, sometimes at the situations, and sometimes it was a physical bit, like when the two of them wake up under his piano) and also deliver a heartfelt - and subtle - message about what it takes to be true to oneself in life and to realize what truly matters, whatever your occupation. <br/><br/>There's a line in the film where Fletcher says his music from the 80s was OK, but it wasn't dinner, it was merely dessert. I'm here to tell you that Music and Lyrics is most definitely dinner. With a delicious serving of Chocolate Creme Brulee brought to your table afterwards."

They're very different from each other, multidimensional, with very clear personalities for each, and so, so authentic. It's so easy to empathize with them that I always find myself feeling what the characters are feeling, and worrying about them. In fact, I'd dare to say Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher are two of the most likable characters I've ever seen in a movie.

I loved the Buddhist Britney Spears like pop star in the film, she gave a lot of good material for comedy, she wasn't all that funny herself, but like I said, she gave funny material to other characters, how people reacted to what she did was the real comedy. All in all, this rom com is humorous, especially if you were alive and can remember the 1980s. I of course was not, but I still found it funny.

","Music and Lyrics (2007): Dir: Marc Lawrence / Cast: Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Haley Bennett, Kristen Johnston, Campbell Scott: Endearing romantic comedy about collaboration. Hugh Grant plays a washed up 1980's pop musician who is given opportunity to write a song for new pop sensation Cora but must rely on the woman who waters his plants since his lyrics skills are weak. Although formula in structure director Marc Lawrence makes hilarious jabs at the 1980's pop scene. This is a vast improvement over his previous film Two Weeks Notice, which also starred Grant but here he is backed with 80's satire elements that work much better. Grant plays off weakness and desire with perfect comic pitch. In the film's opening he is shown in full 80's drag before his plummet from success. Drew Barrymore is superb writing lyrics yet haunted by a past relationship. It is obvious that they will romantically unite but what works is his talent verses her ability to write lyrics. Supporting players are unfortunately flat although Haley Bennett as Cora is fetching. Cora is obviously a reference to Britney Spears and selling sexuality and Bennett spares no punches. Campbell Scott plays Barrymore's ex-boyfriend professor whom she encounters by chance but Grant ends up in a scuffle with in her defence. Retrospect pop culture and the innocence spawn from what has come to pass. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

","Generally I'm not really that into romantic comedies, but it's hard to deny putting Hugh Grant in a 80s pop group is pretty goddamn hilarious. Therefor the opening sequence of the movie is probably the funniest, which isn't as negative as I make it sound. The rest of the movie is typical Grant fare: boy meets girl, charms her with his ineptitude, falls in love, has brief fight, falls in love again. The question is: is there anything wrong with that? Predictability is pretty much a given in these movies, so I'm not going to complain about it. Apparently Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore didn't really get along on set, but I don't think that really shows on film. They genuinely seem to like each other here, good enough for me. Even the ending, which everyone sees coming from miles away, was rather touching. Or is it corny? Bit of both. Definitely one of the better Hugh Grant films, if that means anything."

","This familiar romcom with music does not depart from formula in any major way. However, the two leads and supporting players turn it into something quite a bit above and beyond the usual. Hugh Grant is at his well-timed comedic best as the once-famous pop star, delivering his barbs with understated Brit skill. Drew Barrymore, playing the fledgling lyricist, comes across endearingly klutzy and manic, but in the manner of a real person who demands attention. The chemistry between these two is obvious and strong. It is this that supports the premise that they really do care for each other and are right for each other. You root for them right away.<br/><br/>Backing them up is Brad Garrett as Grant's manager, playing it as both a good friend and nice guy. Haley Bennett as the sexy pubescent pop star, a la Shakirah, is the perfectly oblique foil for the leads and also serves up some eye candy in her flawless portrayal of a pop diva.<br/><br/>No, its not Citizen Kane, or even close.

","Here in the UK at the moment, the pop charts seem to have been invaded by a vast collection of nubile, blonde young women grinding their hips and wearing not much. It's difficult for someone like me to keep track of them all but even harder to take them seriously as musical artistes. Trouble is, the other current trend is for various groups to reform and produce new stuff and unless rose-tinted spectacles are firmly in place, the Eighties weren't much better either. Beneath the facade of being a rom-com, this film offers a happy (if implausible) mix of the two featuring two stars who aren't exactly pushing their boundaries too far.<br/><br/>Washed-up former pop star Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) has a comfortable existence living off the royalties from his Eighties heydays in Manhattan and occasionally performing small-scale gigs with his manager Chris Riley (Brad Garrett). But when he's recruited by current pop sensation Cora (Haley Bennett) to write a potential new single for her, Alex senses a possible comeback on the cards. But he has a problem - he cannot write decent lyrics but against Chris's decision, he brings in his gardener Sophie (Drew Barrymore) who has a gift for writing lyrics. But Sophie isn't without her own baggage...<br/><br/>It's about as contrite as any rom-com you can think of and it's certainly not going to win any awards for unpredictability but ""Music And Lyrics"" is a little different from the norm. The first thing that lifts the film is the music which perfectly captures the vacuous nature of Eighties pop music - the opening video, for example, is spot-on. Grant and Barrymore, whilst not exactly testing the limits of their acting, provide a decent enough couple on screen despite the plot not being believable at any point during the film. Sadly, the comedy is not frequent enough for the film to be anything more than a gentle titter, especially seeing as most of the film's humour is so obvious that Stevie Wonder could spot it a mile off. But both are supported by Garrett and Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda, though they struggle to escape their sit-com pasts.<br/><br/>Yet despite its flaws and my preconceptions, I kinda enjoyed ""Music And Lyrics"". There are some laughs to be had and it has enough of the slushy stuff to keep your other half interested as well and it's this combination that makes it a half-decent rom-com. Sure, it's lightweight and utterly forgettable and I doubt anyone will remember it in ten or fifteen years time. But when I was watching it, I was recalling other rom-com films Grant & Barrymore have made over the years. ""Never Been Kissed"", ""Two Weeks Notice"", ""Lucky You"", ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason"" - I'd happily throw myself into the Atlantic with concrete shoes than watch any of those movies whereas ""Music And Lyrics"" isn't anything like as bad. Rom-coms aren't really my thing and rarely score more than a six so this is a pretty good score, all things considered. Maybe music in the Eighties wasn't that bad after all."

One of the funniest scenes in the movie occurs when Grant's character, Alex, is performing at a school reunion and he's doing his signature move, and because of his age hurts himself. He's also winded and ends the song sitting down, waving to the audience, who do not seem to notice, or care, that he's finishing the number in such physical distress.

For me, this movie belongs to Drew Barrymore. She's almost always good, but the tone and pace of this film suits her perfectly, as the quirky and sometimes quite mad Sophie, who stumbles by accident into co-writing the next big song with Hugh Grant's Alex. The city of New York also features as a backdrop to the story, and many scenes take place either on its streets or with a view of its skyline through a window, so the viewer never forgets where this story is taking place.<br/><br/>Don't expect too much of this movie, but do be prepared to enjoy it.

","If you want your movies to explore the meaning of life then ""Music and Lyrics"" is not for you. It won't ever make anyone's top ten (or top hundred for that matter) but it does entertain and there are worse ways of spending a cold winter's evening than by watching this movie. Hugh Grant is good and believable as washed up 80's pop star Alex Fletcher and he sings his own numbers rather well! Grant can stroll effortlessly through a movie like this without breaking sweat and the part could have been written for him (perhaps it was?). Drew Barrymore is quirky and a bit weird as the tyro lyricist but she is engaging and funny. Revelation (for me) was the teenage Haley Bennett as the Madonna/Kylie/Britney ""diva"". She gives a convincing and very raunchy performance and hits rather well the vacuous self-aware style of these queens of pop. If you want more substantial fare then the works of Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini are available on DVD. If you want an unchallenging and amusing couple of hours then this is for you."

","when I saw music and lyrics I thought it was well done though they could have picked better actors to play Drew Barrymore's sis and brother in law. Haley Bennett did a good job, she is a much better actress than Britney Spears who did cross roads. cross roads was okay but music and lyrics was a better film. I hope they come out with a second one. I thought that having Drew write way back into love was good, the humor between Hugh and Drew was funny. the guy from Ray Romano was funny tho he did a better job in this movie was better than the pacifier which he played a jerk. Drew Barrymore is a good actress, this is one of her better films by far. I haven't seen many of Hugh's movies except for 9 months and Love Actually. He was funny in Love Actually. <br/><br/>Drew and Hugh work well together as a fan of both of theirs I hope they continue to do more movies together. tho the beginning of the movie was cheesy the song Pop Goes My heart was weird and the way they started in the 80s then went on to the present was confusing but the rest of the movie was astonishing."

","I didn't go and see this movie in the cinema because for some reason it didn't appeal to me at the time.. The advertisements didn't make it look too interesting as far as I remember! Although when it was recently released onto DVD I decided to rent a copy and as soon as the opening credits started, I knew I was really going to enjoy this film. I bought the soundtrack shortly after seeing it. The music is some of the best I've heard in a long time, especially ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" and ""Way Back Into Love"" both of which are so catchy I cant get them out of my head. Hugh Grant has really excelled himself in this movie. I was really surprised at how great he was in his role. His singing voice really suits his songs, he is very likable in this and I personally believe this is his best work so far. He does an excellent job performing his songs and newcomer Haley Bennett is very good as Cora. Drew Barrymore is adorable as Sophie Fisher, and they did very well playing opposite each other although I did feel during some scenes they were lacking chemistry. The storyline is very sweet and enjoyable and has some very funny moments throughout. Obviously, this film has a very tongue-in-cheek approach to the modern day music industry and is not meant to be taken too seriously as a whole, but if you like a light, enjoyable romantic comedy then definitely give it a go. I wasn't expecting much from this film when I first watched it and it greatly surpassed my expectations. Highly recommended movie."

This is a movie that actually wound up being better.. far better..then it looked which is a surprise because it is usually the other way around.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant have a great deal of chemistry and make their budding relationship feel realistic and sweet. Their one major love scene is pretty short and not at all graphic but manages to be more sizzling then a lot of love scenes that do have the other above mentioned elements.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore seems to star in a lot of movies that recall the 80's and that is just fine with me since that was a time period loved. There are several aspects of this movie that remind me of ""The Wedding Singer"" which is one of my all time favorite romantic comedies so that definitely works in this movie's favor. It also gives a look into the music business and I found a lot of this movie surprisingly poignant.<br/><br/>Basically this is a movie I was sure I would hate that I found to kind of adore. It is sweet, flows very well and feels natural, and has an enormous amount of depth and a surprising amount of humor(there are many things played for laughs that are indeed actually funny). In addition the music featured is great, very 80's and it's a lot of fun to see Hugh Grant seeing. The music is very reminiscent of ""ABC"", ""Wham"" and many other bands from that time period and the relationship between Grant and Barrymore's characters is one that the audience gets invested in. The supporting cast is excellent as well.<br/><br/>I would give this an 8.5 out of 10. I wish the previews had been a little stronger. I'd have probably seen it in the theaters. This is definitely a must see for romantic comedy lovers and fans of the eighties."

What isn't? For a chick flick this is pretty good because they stay on message and don't screw it up with too much making out, crying and whining. Both Sophie and Fletcher have baggage, but it's dealt with in good fashion because the dialogue is quick, short and honest and get this: funny too. Why that's almost like a breath of fresh air when you really need it.<br/><br/>I keep asking when Hugh Grant is going to make movies with more substance, but I realize that there is a market for this type of movie and he is very good at it. When he gets a little longer in the tooth maybe we'll see something else. As for Ms. Barrymore she is a very good actress and she can do movies like Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd but doesn't and I am not counting the Charlie's Angels movie.<br/><br/>All is good in here, the acting, pace, and music too. The chemistry between Grant and Barrymore is good and believable, but it is really the witty, funny and honest dialogue that puts this over the top.

","I really liked it. I knew when my wife and I rented it that it was going to be a sappy love story but I had seen the trailers and was intrigued. My wife is a professional musician and I love music so that aspect really came home. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were naturals and really showed me something in their chemistry. They brought their characters to life and made them seem real. This whole movie was done in a very believable way that something like this could happen in real life. Being a child of the 80s, I appreciated the reference to Alex's band and Sophie's sister going ga-ga over meeting a ""hero"" of her childhood. I personally have met band members I grew up listening to so I can appreciate that part. Likewise, Brad Garrett was good in a straight role. Good to see him out and about other than his TV personality. The song that Alex and Sophie wrote was really nice and sounded great. I liked the way it ended too. Overall, a good movie with personality, comedy, romance and a touch of seriousness all rolled up."

","In ""Music and Lyrics"" we meet a former pop-star Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) whose star is fading. He gets a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hit the gates of fame again by making a song for a hot new star Cora. Making lyrics isn't the strongest ability of Alex but he finds help in form of his plant-nurser Sophie (Drew Barrymore). You might guess what will happen next...<br/><br/>The plot in ""Music and Lyrics"" is from the pen of film's director Marc Lawrence whose earlier efforts include also a Hugh Grant Rom-com ""Two Weeks Notice"". The plot walks on the path of comedy and romance with spices that has been used several times. There is a few good laughs like the starting sequence which is hilarious but unfortunately Lawrence has gone where the fence is lowest.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" manages to do its job and entertain. Hugh Grant is again solid and subtle and quirky charismatic. The pair Grant-Barrymore is a little odd because the chemistry between them seems to be so called forced just in the name of acting. There isn't much to act in such a flat script. But I have to admit that ""Music and Lyrics"" is a little better than lazy ""Two Weeks Notice"".<br/><br/>I recommend it for lazy Sunday afternoon!"

I saw four Drew movies this week: Music and Lyrics in the theater, and the rest on TV: Ever After, Riding in Cars with Boys, Never Been Kissed, and number 5 (a little of) Boys on the Side. I notice in this movie Drew is getting older, and so is Hugh Grant. So are the rest of us. But I digress . . .<br/><br/>Drew has twice played a writer in these movies: in Music and Lyrics, and in Riding in Cars with Boys. I think she pulls it off well.<br/><br/>Hugh's bumping and grinding reminds me of Mick Jagger, and may in fact be a parody.<br/><br/>I pretty much liked the whole movie, except where the young kids saw Cora in very abbreviated clothing. That was a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>The story of the weight loss business of Drew's sister seemed to be a sub-story not fully developed, yet it had to stay in the background due to the main story being how Drew and Hugh collaborated on the music and lyrics they wrote == hence the name of this movie, obviously.<br/><br/>I think Drew looks like her great uncle and great aunt, Lionel Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore, who in their youth looked a lot like the Drew of today. I have seen some very young Ethel Barrymore photos, and the resemblance is sometimes uncanny.<br/><br/>Well, enough said. I always like Drew movies and Hugh movies. Where do these two go from here?

","I really had no intention in seeing this film. I was not really interested in seeing it, either. I still saw it, though, and I must tell you, this was a really sweet and heartwarming film. It was pretty predictable, though. You can easily predict most of the movie, but that does not matter, I enjoyed it. I do not really see any Oscars for this movie, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. Alex Fletcher is a singer from the eighties that tries to become a hit again by writing a song for huge pop superstar, Cora, who is basically Britney Spears. The only problem is that he can not write a good song. Then he meets Sophie Fisher, who came to his house to water plants. Her ex-boyfriend wrote a book about their relationship and ruined her life. He discovers that she is a great song writer. He persuades her to write a song for Cora with his help. She reluctantly agrees. They create the song, fall in love, and give the song to Cora. She loves it, but she makes some changes and makes it a weird Indian-techno-song. Sophie does not like the changes but Alex doesn't let her tell Cora because he thinks she'll get angry. Sophie gets angry at Alex for not letting her tell her. Then, on the day of the Cora's concert where she'll sing the Indian song, she sings the original. It turns out that Alex persuaded Cora to change the song at the last second. The movie has a happy ending, and it is revealed that Sophie and Alex live together now.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good and sweet film. It is actually very funny at times and is well acted by Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. Also, you should watch the credits to see some hilarious trivia facts, like Cora was married, and the party lasted nine hours, but the marriage lasted three hours. Anyway, I was highly impressed by this film, and like I said over and over, this is very sweet and nice and you should watch it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Once."

","To have inspiration to compose a song is not something easy, but you can do it if you have the will and dedication to it. Since little, i always wonder how difficult can be to compose a song. I always imagine it, but always i think that was a hard job because mixed music with lyrics its not so easy ... but you can do it, and ""Music and Lyrics"" proves it.<br/><br/>This new romantic comedy work with the old new formula of big comedies of today, simply that it uses well, and it is not exceeded with it, like in much cases. ""Music and Lyrics"" told the story of an 80s rocker in our days called Alex. He wants enjoy of success, he doesn't want that nobody forgets him. He must do something fast. He has a good offer by a new pop singer named Cora. She gives him the opportunity of compose a new song for her. But he should have the song in less than one week. He doesn't know how can do it. Suddenlly appears Sophie, a girl assigned to take care of his plants. She is very creative, and Alex need that creativity. So, Sophie decided, without any guarantee, to help him. ""Music and Lyrics"" is an entertaining comedy, not the best in its kind, but surely entertain and makes us remember that sticky music. The movie counts with a great Hugh Grant as Alex and Drew Barrymore as our beloved Sophie. With other good performances we have too Kristen Johnston, Brad Garret and Haley Bennet.<br/><br/>Are movies about rock bands and songs, but - at least me - i have not ever seen a movie about compose a song and its effects with the show business (Remember that ""Theres no business, like show business"") and i think that is marvelous. Although that don't play much 80s music like i think, the soundtrack here is very sticky and fun, as much of the situations that sometimes are so touching. If ""Music and Lyrics"" is another romantic comedy, is a good one, and an excellent choice to have some fun and tender situations.<br/><br/>*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any."

But the biggest surprise (for me) was how much I enjoyed his singing. I liked the movie mostly for the music. The plot was cute, amusing, not complicated. The music, and the singing by Grant made the movie for me.<br/><br/>As always, Drew Barrymore added a nice touch. She worked well with Grant. A good combination. Just being herself, that is, her movie self, added a nice romantic softness to the story.<br/><br/>I liked the way the sex scenes were handled. There was no phony acrobatic lovemaking. No titillating glimpses of private feminine parts. And only one (though brief) passionate, wide open-mouthed kiss. I hate those scenes one sees in some movies; close-ups of wide open mouth, tongue lashing kisses along with clothed sex acts."
"NoLittleLamb","7","0","0","6 June 2007"," Sing Along with this Romantic Comedy (maybe laugh a little less).
","Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore take us on the romantically comedic ride of their coincidental meeting and accident-ridden relationship.<br/><br/>I can only describe this movie, and the millions of other films like it, as cute and delightful, but not in an overly enthusiastic way. A cute story with fun characters and an up beat atmosphere, but certainly not cinematic gold. However, I am perfectly aware that this was never the intended goal of the filmmakers, so when reviewing movies such as this I'm always hesitant. Do I look at it completely critically and grade it on par with all other movies ever, in which it would never come close or do I take it for what it was intended to be by the filmmakers, just a fun two hour date movie, and give it a thumbs up for completing it's goal? I don't know. All I know is that I feel much better about myself after watching stupid comedy's than I do after watching some deep meaningful drama, just physically, I don't need an aspirin afterwords. I wont make a definite decision now; I'll just go with the flow I suppose. But I can't ever completely deny the small place the romantic comedy holds in my heart.<br/><br/>I found the plot base to definitely be unique, I never knew how people went about writing songs, and after watching this I can at least pretend like I do, even if that's not actually how it happens. Otherwise though, I felt it had the usual romantic comedy plot twists and I didn't find myself ever totally caught off guard, which I must say is something I happen to enjoy in a film once in a while, so no points there for Music & Lyrics.<br/><br/>I found most of the characters to be charmingly entertaining. Kristen Johnson's character as the Popz obsessed fan was great, and I really wish she would do even more acting, I think she's great. Brad Garret also played a perfectly depressing talent agent. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were there usual romantic comedy-selves. Drew's character was a very small stretch for her and there was absolutely ZERO stretch for Hugh Grant (Playing the stuck-upish character who is brought back down to earth by the love interestnothing new for Hughie). They were entertaining nonetheless.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED the soundtrack for this movie. The songs they made up for the ""80's pop group"" were perfect and the music video was spot on with the ""creepy makes no sense"" style of the 80's music videos. The end song I also found to be really cute, and definitely appropriate, it made me feel warm and fuzzy which I suppose is the ultimate goal of any movie like this. I tried to download to some of the songs because they were just that catchy; I'm still working on it. Let me know if you can find them.<br/><br/>Overall a very cute movie, as far as Romantic comedies go it was one of the better ones. Not a complete waste of my time, and if you want an un-depressing, relaxing evening why not check it out, you might get a great song stuck in your head too."

","What does this movie have in common with The Wedding Singer? Well, they both star actors with the same birthday (Adam Sandler and Hugh Grant) as former pop stars anywhere from at least early 80s (in The Wedding Singer it only directly mentioned he was in '79), now preforming menial musical tasks, along with Drew Barrymore lending them a hand after they meet her at work...and they wind up falling for her despite challenging circumstances...Well, anyway, it seems like Music and Lyrics had the right things in common with The Wedding Singer, since it's about as enjoyable. 1/2 of the 80s duo Pop, Alex Fletcher lives in obscurity while his former partner is still successful and popular, partly because he claimed their final joint 3 hits as his own), only able to keep the meager supporters he has if he quickly composes a hit. When house-sitter Sophie Fisher happens to be at one of his numerous rocky additions to find a lyricist, she appears to be doing better than anyone he can meet, so he hires her. They're pretty different at first, drawn together only by her talent, but as time goes on and Alex begins to see hope for their work and that he'll actually gain some fame again with her advice and support, they become a little more than friends. Until a snag hits - it's not her engagement to a creep, but her reluctance to perform the song with a controversial teen-aimed Indian music video and his reluctance to voice his actually similar opinion to Cora Corman (Haley Bennet). This is a good movie with plenty of laughs but not so many bizarre oddities in the humor as The Wedding Singer - which is fine with me, even if it shoves most other characters into the role of minor ones so makes them and the plot a bit forgettable. I enjoyed how both characters learned from each other and it wasn't just a 1-way street experience. I didn't find the soundtrack quite as endearing, partly because it wasn't all 80s music, but did enjoy some songs, especially the old music video in the opening sequence. I thought the acting was great and the fact that Hugh Grant could sing was a pleasant surprise. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Wedding Singer - and to a few who didn't."

Well, everyone involved in the movie was in top form. Hugh Grant put aside his recent run of cad-like roles and got his dry, incredible comic timing back in form. And with a musical flair that I never realized he had. Drew Barrymore has played the sweet, charming, slightly off-center, lovable everygirl about 5 times in a row. Apparently I can't get enough of it, cause she gets me every time. She is the most naturally likable actress working in movies today. The supporting cast is also terrific.<br/><br/>The story has been written up a hundred times, so it isn't re-inventing the romantic comedy wheel. Boy meets girl ,falls for girl, loses girl...........! Just because we know its coming, doesn't mean it can't be entertaining and this is great entertainment. Tip of the hat to writer/director Marc Lawrance. The one-liners are funny, the music is silly, entertaining and actually, pretty listenable. There is a mild harpooning of the music industry, which adds to the fun, without being mean spirited. <br/><br/>This was a fun surprise that I highly recommend to all fans of the stars and rom-coms in general.

The two of have charm and comedic timing to spare, but they also supremely click together as an on-screen couple.<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher seems tailor-made for Grant. There's a certain charming arrogance that Grant exudes as Alex, a man who knows his place in pop culture, if you will.<br/><br/>Barrymore's an absolute darling as Sophie. Though, frankly, she could play these roles in her sleep. She breathes life into Sophie - and the film. She mines wonderful comedy from relatively ordinary moments. The fact that she also has one of cinema's most radiant smiles doesn't hurt, either.<br/><br/>I know why Barrymore takes on these roles. But I would now love to see her in a truly dramatic role.<br/><br/>The film's loose bit of casting is Kristen Johnston as Sophie's sister, Rhonda. Hr character is a cliché of the genre - the sidekick - but wasn't Joan Cusack available? Seriously. Johnston's way too over-the-top. Subtlety has never been her forte and she plays everything so broadly that her shtick gets a bit annoying after a while.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" is a typical romantic comedy.

As they try to agree on the lyrics and the music, a young and somewhat neurotic house plant caretaker begins humming the song and coming up with her own lyrics. Fletcher catches her words and incorporates them. And thus Sophie (Drew Barrymore, CHARLIE'S ANGELS) becomes his new lyricist.<br/><br/>Grant really steals the show here, his line delivery flawless and his portrayal of an aging rocker pulled off exceptionally well (when he nearly dislocates a hip on stage, it's laugh-out-loud funny). Nothing can be taken away from Barrymore, however. She plays fine beside Grant but just isn't up to his level. But this is probably the best role many viewers have ever seen her in. She's not throwing punches or high-kicking some bad guy in the face. She's a character here and not simply a vehicle for action.<br/><br/>The supporting cast also pulls this common storyline up a notch. The previously mentioned Brad Garrett is terrifically funny as Hugh Grant's manager, and so is Kirsten Johnson (THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN TV series) as Barrymore's older sister and someone who was obsessed with Grant's old ""Pop!"" band. Newcomer Haley Bennett plays the airheaded pop star to a tee, rightfully making you cringe every time she opens her mouth (""We need to go to the roof. That's upstairs"") or puts on some sleazy piece of clothing.<br/><br/>Keep your expectations on an even keel, though. The ending is straight out of Hollywood's happy ending catalogue but the dialogue will keep you engaged enough for an enjoyable ride."

","Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a has-been '80s pop star is given the chance to write a song for a reigning pop diva, but having not written a hit song in years, he needs help with the lyrics. Along comes Sophie Fischer (Drew Barrymore), a quirky florist whose knack for words makes her the perfect collaborator for writing a song that can help revive Alex's career.<br/><br/>Generally, romantic comedies aren't my favorite genre because most of the time the two leading stars lack a certain chemistry to make predictable material seem interesting. Fortunately, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are great together and watching them on screen was pretty entertaining. The material was of course rather stale yet there were still plenty of interesting scenes and moments so the film never managed to get dull.<br/><br/>The premise was actually pretty good and the music video that opens the film was great. I loved the way it spoofed all those cheesy styles from the 80's. Beyond the premise and the opening scene, things were pretty standard which is okay because the cast was strong. Director and screenwriter Marc Lawrence was just doing his usual tricks. If you have seen ""Two Weeks Notice"" or ""Miss Congeniality"" then you should expect the same type of humor. I kind of wish he would add a little more edge to the material but still quite a decent screenplay.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant was giving his routine performance although it still worked fine. Drew Barrymore was also pretty good and she had many funny lines. Most people I know can't stand her at all but I usually find her pretty charming. Kristen Johnston was great and I hope to see more of her in the future because after her show was ended, she seemed to have disappeared. The rest of the cast gave acceptable performances except for Haley Bennett who was quite annoying and her character got old very fast. Overall, Music and Lyrics is nothing mind-blowing but it is a fun little flick that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10"

I was just wondering who is the guy that is in the movie, the doctor? at the very beginning of the movie in the ""Pop Goes My Heart"" video, he's the doctor taking the vitals while Hugh Grant is unconscious. It only shows him briefly so I guess that is why they did not credit him? He has the feathered grayish white hair and is tanned ... Does anyone know the doctors name? Any information at all will be appreciated! I thank anyone who would know! It;s not too big of a deal, I just want to know! Oh, and for all you who haven't seen it yet!

","Okay, so this is not high-brow art-house cinema. It's stars Hugh Grant as an aging '80s pop star from the cheesy and over-the-top band, POP!. Drew Barrymore stars as his substitute plant lady turned lyricist.<br/><br/>If you can get past the cheesy hilarity, there are a few humorous critiques of modern pop culture: the obsession with ""B"" stars, the ""spirituality"" of pop singer Cora (who references Britney and Christina) is particularly biting.<br/><br/>The main bit of the movie is the muddled, innocent art of good songwriting. There's sweet, but overdone bits about being yourself and finding your true calling and all that jazz.<br/><br/>Grant shines as an aging pop star in tight pants. His signature self-effacing humor plays large here, but as always it's endearing. Barrymore doesn't seem to put her whole heart into the character, whose odd foibles (like her germaphobia and the fact that she cares for other people's plants on a temporary basis) are never fully explained.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Music & Lyrics"" is entirely predictable, but a fun and funny romantic comedy that's worth a rent."

","Some things in life are just meant to go together. Jack and Jill. Peanut butter and jelly. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. Music and Lyrics, however, just wasn't meant to be.<br/><br/>Grant and Barrymore star in the recently released film ""Music and Lyrics,"" written and directed by Marc Lawrence. Alex Fletcher (Grant), a washed-up 80's ""has been"" is given the task of writing a hit song for a young, racy, Shakira-esquire teen singing sensation named Cora Corman (Haley Bennett). With absolutely no song-writing success, he hires a seemingly depressed lyricist (Greg Antonsky, played by Jason Antoon) who insists on writing dark words for a song that will be titled ""Way Back into Love."" When Sophie Fisher (Barrymore) shows up to water Alex's plants, she starts spouting off rhymed couplets with which Alex is greatly impressed  and Greg is greatly disgusted. Alex tries to convince her to become his lyricist, but in the true manner of love story films, he is initially unsuccessful.<br/><br/>Sophie Fisher continues to accidentally tantalize Alex with her words, and eventually agrees to help him write his song for Cora. The two sit down in his apartment to try and come up with impressive lyrics, but Sophie irritatingly clicks her pen more than she writes. Another show of her immaturity as writer is the fact that she bails once the inevitable writer's block sets in. ""But I've never written a song,"" she tells Alex. While we later learn the cause for Sophie's reluctance to put her writing out there, it still seems as if she could benefit from some self-esteem counseling. Her disinclination to finish the task at hand makes her seem whiny and unprofessional at best. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very formulaic. The only unpredictable bit came when the film opened with Alex's 1980's band, PoP!, leading one to question whether the entire movie would be set in that decade. Aside from that, neither the ending nor the entire plot of the movie were a surprise. As a whole, the movie was reminiscent of 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" in which Barrymore stars opposite Adam Sandler. In both movies, a musician falls in love with her and writes a touching, if sappy, song in her honor. ""50 First Dates,"" in which Barrymore and Sandler appeared in 2004, is another Barrymore precursor to ""Music and Lyrics."" The bohemian blonde is a role that Barrymore certainly has down by now, which is perhaps why she was able to fit the role of Sophie so well  from the styles she wore to the way she spoke to the chemistry with Alex.<br/><br/>Forced acting by Kristen Johnston (who plays Sophie's sister Rhonda) and Haley Bennett (Cora) did nothing to better the movie. Both actresses either lacked emotion in most of their lines, or were overly exuberant  such as when Rhonda meets Alex in person and acts like a 12-year-old on a sugar high, or when ditzy Cora insists that she must show Alex the roof  ""it's upstairs!"" she gleefully exclaims.<br/><br/>The film was carried by its witty one-liners  Alex: ""I've given up, my face is in the butter!""  and clever dialogue between Alex and Sophie:<br/><br/>Alex: ""Theoretically I could pick you up because I will be taking a cab."" Sophie: ""I could be standing outside at 9:40 in bright orange clothes, so you wouldn't miss me"" Alex: ""Oh good, you'll get some road work done while you wait, then.""<br/><br/>Were it not for the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore, the film would have fallen flat. The concept of music and lyrics being together is explained in the movie in such a way that embodies that chemistry  that the melody is like a first impression, and the lyrics are like when you get to know a person. If that were true, the melody for this film would be trite and with few chords, and the lyrics would go something like: ""this is not a film that I would pay money to see again, although it would be decent for a night full of rain"" Even so, the movie would be sufficient for a girl's night out. Don't think about asking any males to see the film  Grant's hip shaking will have them crying all the way home."

","I approached this movie with some trepidation. The reviews had been rather mixed and romantic comedies often go wrong. And I don't really trust the opinion of the friend who recommended it.<br/><br/>But it's actually excellent. It's funny and charming. The songs are some of the best written-for-some-romantic-comedy songs I've ever heard. The opening mock video is great and Grant and Barrymore are both utterly charming. There's also a very nice performance by Haley Bennett as a spacey pop star (I actually came across a review by someone who said Bennett stole the movie from Barrymore, which is fairly insane since it's a very small part. My guess is the reviewer either just doesn't like Barrymore or fell in love with Haley because she's utterly gorgeous).<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie. Like a lot of romantic comedies, it begins to lose some steam when it tries to actually have a story and teach lessons and all that. I was worried it would turn out like Hitch, which is really funny for the first plot less half and then becomes really lame. But Music & Lyrics wisely keeps the plot to a minimum, staying as much as possible to a simple story about two people with a connection being charming and saying funny things."
"Mr_PCM","8","0","0","10 April 2007"," The film equivalent of a comfort blanket
","There is something strangely comforting about Hugh Grant films. You always know exactly what you are going to get, and what you get is enjoyable, non-offensive gentle romantic comedy. OK, Hugh Grant will usually be playing Hugh Grant, (this is the case in pretty much all of his films) so his films are never likely to trouble Oscar, but for matinée idol entertainment there are few better. So because you always know what you are going to get, Hugh Grant rom-coms never have a problem living up to expectations  and that is no bad thing.<br/><br/>In this latest offering, Grant is a washed-up 80s pop star looking to try and revive his career in some sort of comeback, whatever it takes (which seems a reasonable idea given the high number of reforming bands and comebacks around the current chart). He is asked by a Britney/Christina-alike pop diva to record a song for her. Struggling for inspiration, the lady who waters his plants contributes random lyrics, and a song is born as the two work together on the music and lyrics (clever title then huh?). It also helps that the plant-watering lady is played by the beautiful Drew Barrymore, so I won't bother recapping what happens next. Well there's no need is there? The film opens with a classic 80s-style pop video, showing Hugh Grant and his former bandmates in all their glory, a perfect example of 80s cheesy pop, complete with accompanying dance moves  and irritatingly catchy, so you will find yourself going away humming the damn thing all day. The rest of the soundtrack is surprisingly pleasant without being mindblowing, and is thus the perfect accompaniment to the film.<br/><br/>As stated before, Grant is just his usual self  no real challenge for him anymore, so he seems completely at ease with his performance without really having to make much effort, and Barrymore is also her usual likable self. The supporting cast are all fine but with no real show-stealers like you sometimes get in these films. So while there is nothing outstanding about this film, it is still an enjoyable film, fun for all the family and inoffensive. Just don't be surprised or disappointed by it, because you know what you're going to get before the opening credits roll. Overall a slightly above-average comedy thanks to the likability of its two leads, relevance to today's charts, and a decent number of one-line gags  and the irritatingly catchy soundtrack! So why such a high rating if it is merely above average? Well quite simply, I enjoyed the film, maybe it is a guilty pleasure film, but in the end it all comes down to personal preference. I enjoyed it, so there."

","In the mid-90's, Hugh Grant was typecast as the nice guy with a knack for one-liners whose greatest fault was passivity. Not coincidentally, this was both the commercial and artistic peak of his career with films such as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain"" and ""Notting Hill"". Then came the Divine Brown scandal, which tarnished his nice-guy image. Since then, he has been either had to do garbage like ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" and ""American Dreamz"" or settle for roles as misogynistic womanizing brats in such fare as the ""Bridget Jones"" movies and ""Two Weeks Notice"".<br/><br/>In ""Music and Lyrics"", Hugh Grant plays a nice guy with a knack for one-liners whose greatest fault is passivity. Not coincidentally, this is his best performance since ""Notting Hill"". Otherwise, however, this is just another romantic comedy starring Drew Barrymore set in New York.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a dead-on parody of 1980's videos that features PoP, a New Romantic band purposely designed to only appeal to teenage girls (think Duran Duran meets Wham! meets a-ha meets ABC). Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, who plays synth and shares lead vocals with Colin Thompson (Scott Porter). We cut to the present with Alex in a boardroom shocked to find out that ""Battle of the '80's Has-Beens"" wants him to box Debbie Gibson for the opportunity to sing on TV again.<br/><br/>He goes back home with his manager (Brad Garrett) and meets his new plant lady Sophie (Drew Barrymore in the same role she's always played since the end of the ""Charlie's Angel"" franchise). He is under no illusions about the significance of his teen-pop, but he can't make a living without it. Then, just when all hope seems lost, he gets an offer to write a song for shallow teen sensation Cora (Haley Bennett playing a cross between pre-motherhood Britney Spears and post-motherhood Madonna). But the problem is that before, all the lyrics were written by Colin, with whom he has not had contact in over 10 years. He tries hiring a professional lyricist (Greg Antoon), but the lyricist only wants to do gloom-and-doom stuff. While they are hashing it out, Sophie--watering plants in the background--improvises a rhyme that is much better than anything the lyricist can come up with.<br/><br/>And that sets up the rest of the movie, with the typical romantic comedy staples: long pans of the NYC skyline, the interfering older sister (Kristen Johnson), the jerk ex-boyfriend (Campbell Scott), the first sexual experience that they mistakenly think is a mistake, the near-breakup and the reconciliation to great public applause (I'm embarrassed to have to put a spoiler warning for that last one).<br/><br/>A mention must be made at this point about the music: It is uniformly awful, but then so is 1980's New Romantic music (with the notable exception of U2) and 21st Century teen-girl pop (with the notable exception of Beyonce Knowles). Although Grant and Barrymore are listed as the performers of their songs, the closing credits list Martin Fry (former ABC lead singer) under ""special vocals"". There is no female ""special vocalist"" credited, from what I have heard of Barrymore's attempts at singing on ""SNL"", I imagine she had one too. Say what you will about Stephen and the Colberts (""The Colbert Report""), that really is Stephen Colbert singing, and that tuneless croak was a staple of many a New Romantic singer trying to ape David Bowie.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""The Daily Show"", I think it is a shame that Aasif Mandvi is stuck playing a middle-eastern stereotype when he devotes his all-too-limited time on ""The Daily Show"" to exploding middle-eastern stereotypes.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Hugh Grant, you will thank director/screenwriter Marc Lawrence for giving him a much better role than their previous collaboration in ""Two Weeks Notice"". This movie is very much Grant's and he makes the most of it. And that is what saves ""Music and Lyrics"" from the romantic comedy blahs. 7 out of 10."

","I like positive surprises! More than the shallow romantic movie I expected, but sufficiently original, lively and funny. Good entertainment for me for me from first to last minute. Lightened up my spirits on a lonely Friday night, was no doubt worth the money. I sympathized with the characters for their slightly freaky way, and liked that the movie - at least at most times :-) - did not cross the line to soppiness but always stayed funny and a little ironic, and also the way some inconvenient truths were outspoken between the characters which is always a healthy preventive to soppiness. I appreciated a lot the musical&show performances the actors delivered. I think that anyone who has ever been on a stage themselves will truly have to give them some credit for their accomplishments in entertainment, especially newly-cast Haley Bennett. On-the-spot entertainment for me, which will say something for someone like me who neither has a liking for the 80's nor for the usual git Hugh Grant. No, I liked both Grant and Drew Barrymore a lot in this one as well as the music. Light entertainment is an art in itself, and was accomplished pretty much to my satisfaction. Strongly support the tagline of another user's comment ""Surprisingly good fun - better than you'd think"". OK perfectly happy as I was, why did I not give it a ten?

","There was a 70's Neil Simon show called ""They're Playing Our Song"" that I just loved loosely based upon the short-lived romance between Marvin Hamlisch and Carol Bayer Sager. Although not literally based upon that play, the spirit of that delicious confection lives on in this comedy.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays an 80's Has-Been (loved the running gag about the Battle-of-the-80's-Has-Beens) former POP icon who has burnt out and taken the easy road in life. Lo and behold, a new POP icon, supposedly a riff on Brittany Spears although not really a very close one, wants him to write a song they can do as a duet. But he only writes music; he needs a lyricist. Enter the quirky and delightful Drew Barrymore, sister of Kristen Johnson who steals just about every scene she's in -- the latter owning a few weight-loss salons that Drew works at, and also a huge fan of Grant's old group. I don't know how true the music industry stories are but I found them hilarious, especially as recounted by Grant. Brad Garrett deadpans it just right as Grant's agent. And, Campbell Scott is perfectly smug as Barrymore's insipid literary ex-boyfriend. I did not know the actress playing Cora or the main guy in the entourage but they were also deliciously in-synch with the movie's overall feel and attitude.<br/><br/>I never liked Hugh Grant much in the 90's but thought he was wonderful in About A Boy and the two Bridget Jones movies. (If you enjoyed Grant here and never saw About A Boy, rent it -- I liked it even better). He built upon his new abilities to laugh at himself and the world at the same time recognizing that he's neither as noble nor as worthless as he once thought himself to be. There were two scenes where Drew seemed to think she was in The Wedding Singer again instead of a romantic comedy with a tad more sophistication and she didn't seem to reciprocate the chemistry with Grant that he was able to convey for her, but why nitpick when the film was so enjoyable? Good fun. See it with someone you love and laugh together."

","Forget about all the romance--Music and Lyrics is really about the evolution of a good pop song. The hilarious opening '80s music video, starring Alex's fictional band Pop!, truly sets the moodleaving you humming their catchy but totally irritating song ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" throughout the entire movie. Director/writer Marc Lawrence (Two Weeks Notice) knows what he is doing when he's got his two lovebirds collaborating on the love song for Cora. But the film falls apart when Lawrence tries to justify everything else, such as why Sophie's a neurotic wacko (coming off a bad breakup) or why Alex fell off the wagon (bitterness over a split with his writing partner)and most importantly, how these two kids make it work (the ending is too pat). I suppose it wouldn't be much of a movie if it were just about how bad the music was in the '80s, but it certainly boosts Music and Lyrics' corny spirits."

","Alex Fletcher is an 80s has-been (Hugh Grant) from the duo Pop!, and he needs to compose a hit for a Britney equivalent, Cora Corman (Haley Bennett, who has eerily dead eyes like those of Bjork's), in an attempt to boost his flagging career. Since he's more of a musician than a writer, he finds help from his plant lady Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore).<br/><br/>Pop!'s video at the start of the film establishes where Alex comes from and it admittedly had an authentic feel of an 80s music video. Grant has left his usual womanizing cad characters with this film, and like his character, is unashamedly true to his range. Alex has no qualms being called a 'has-been', has no angst nor pride. Barrymore is luminous in this role and like Grant, plays this sort of character well. Grant and Barrymore effectively work as a tandem because they embrace their genre and unabashedly play it to the hilt so they never really have to try so hard.<br/><br/>Alex is given depth and not just the easygoing man he appears to be. When Alex convinces Sophie to confront her ex, ""People wait their whole lives to see an ex when things are going really good. It NEVER happens. You could make relationship history!"" people can relate to that. And when he justifies how pop songs are superior to literature (""Let's see how reading a novel can make you feel better in five minutes just like a pop song can""), and when he gives Sophie a much-needed reality check by calling her on her pity party. In the end, we realize that Alex is a brilliant popstar after all and Sophie is not just a cerebral Lit major, because they are able to relate to the average person on an emotional level in the amount of time it takes to do so: a five-minute pop song.<br/><br/>Music & Lyrics is a cutesy, feel good romantic comedy, a bit draggy in some parts but it does have its sparks of wit."

","For moments Music and Lyrics is amusing, for moments it is touching, but it is also a bit dull. The problem is not that its story is unoriginal - after all it is a romantic comedy, we know by looking at the poster that Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore will fall in love (the best Hollywood romantic comedy of the last 20 years, Green Card, is even less original than this film, but its life is in the detail)- the problem seems to be that it is unfocused. The couple meet and fall in love, they are amusing, and that's about it. There are obstacles, but it is the lack of focus that hurts, the obstacles shift, are never constant enough to become concrete: in their first meeting, Barrymore (who seems to be a professional plant waterer) pricks herself on a cactus and flees Grant's apartment in need of first aid - what is this supposed to show? that she is zany? I don't know and the film doesn't follow it up - it's just a way of making them meet cute; Barrymore is haunted by a former relationship with a writer who has used and exploited her as the inspiration for the central character in his best seller - this creates anxiety and threatens the chance of the relationship with Grant (of course we know there will be such a relationship even before they do), but she has the chance to confront the writer during a chance meeting at a restaurant, she is left tongue tied - this is one of the best scenes of the film, but hereafter all this business is dropped (almost as though it was not part of her character but just an excuse for an amusing scene). After the couple have come together romantically and as a song writing team with their song being accepted by the greatest pop sensation, it all threatens to fall apart when the pop star proposes making their song into one of her dance routines (a dreadfully bad one, of course): Grant accepts this wanting the financial security, Barrymore is outraged at the assault on their song - the couple part. How do they come back together? Off screen he writes a song to her saying what she means to him and performs it at the big concert at the end of the film where their song will be premiered (and, of course, the pop star sings their song the way they wanted it) - it is all quite touching, but it is very easy, a bit lazy. When the couple fall into each other's arms at the end it's nice, but little more."

The film is not complicated, and it uses wit in remembering the cliché boy bands and music videos of the 1980s. This also brings us into today's world of modern pop music and follows the creative process of song-writing between an older 1980s has-been and a young, insecure female writer. The music in the film is done very well and is also very strong. Simply, this is a good feel-good film to watch when you need to wind down."

","This was a really nicely crafted love story, rolled up in a neat package of ironic pop culture. Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, and Brad Garrett were excellent. The fictional music video of Hugh Grant's 80's band, ""POP"" was laugh out loud funny. The hair styles, the clothes, the vocal inflections, EVERYTHING, were spot-on. The director and producers hit a home run with their send-up of Ah Ha, A Flock of Seagulls, Wham, and Haircut One Hundred. Hugh Grant is the actor that I keep going to see and wanting to hate, but I just can't. The guy is just too good. He plays the aging, self-deprecating pop star with such aplomb that you find yourself believing it. I don't know what I loved more, the fact that his character is playing high school reunions and Knott's Berry Farm, or that he fells honored to do so. Good stuff. Two thumbs, way up!!"
"Yarra G","8","0","0","18 February 2007"," Just when you thought you've seen Hugh Grant do it all as the romantic comedy lead
","Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, the forgotten half of a popular 80's pop duo who's now struggling to maintain a respectable career. He tours with the carnivals and on reunion shows while his partner earns millions after having gone solo. Drew Barrymore plays Sophie Fisher, a quirky but charming and talented writer with a serious writer's block brought on by broken heart. Thanks to her mentor, the acclaimed novelist, Sloan Cates (Scott Campbell).<br/><br/>When the chance came for Alex to revive his career through writing a new love song for the reigning Pop Princess Cora, he was stuck without a decent lyricist. Sophie was just pitching in for Alex's plant lady, but when she dished out a few lines that made perfect sense while watering the plants, Alex knew she could be the key to his success.<br/><br/>What child of the 80s will not LOVE this movie? This movie is funny, funny, funny! Memories of the British Pop invasion will flood you at once. Owe it to the surprising MTV intro that blows you away before you can say - wake me up before you go-go! It all so eerily resembled a WHAM music video with the band members looking like Duran Duran. Ah, the hairstyles! And the dance moves! The allusions to all the 80s icons cannot be missed. And you can't miss how the movie shows their probable sorry states today. Being a pop fan myself, I would also be screaming with the rest of them should my favorites perform today, no matter if they've aged two decades.<br/><br/>Did anyone miss that a Brit himself played the forgotten other half of a has-been 80's duo? Just when you thought you've seen Hugh Grant do it all as the romantic comedy lead, he delivers a surprise performance in a character so familiar, yet so unlike his other roles. I think what got the audience cheering the movie on is seeing the usually self-conscious Grant sing, dance and gyrate those hips many times over like a real Pop King. Now THAT is serious acting.<br/><br/>I recall a particular TV interview when Grant promised profusely that he would not ever dance on screen again after doing ""Love Actually"". Who would forget the scene where Prime Minister loses himself, strutting his stuff around to the tune of JUMP? No wonder his moves in Music and Lyrics seemed so familiar! The surprises, wittiness of the characters and the laughter built without letup for the first half of the film. But I would say that's where it reached its crescendo, losing steam in the middle and leaving me wondering if I can reach the end of the film without falling asleep.<br/><br/>Anyway! Just enjoy the banter and the quirkiness of the characters. No one could have picked out a more perfect casting. Drew Barrymore is her usual appealing self, her delivery of Sophie showed a character as lovely and as mature as the person she seem to be becoming today. The supporting roles of Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda, Brad Garrett as Alex's manager Chris, provided not just more comic relief, but it rounded out Alex and Sophie's individual worlds and gave the film more heart. Lastly for Haley Bennett as the most venerated Cora, I could only say she's one smart girl: starting her singing career by playing a pop princess in a movie. Most people start the other way around.<br/><br/>However, what I find sadly missing, is the romantic chemistry between Grant and Barrymore. I wonder if it's their age difference, or their culture difference or pure real discomfort between the two actors that came across on-screen. The two played their characters brilliantly, but when they kissed eeeoow! I didn't feel the thrill nor the tenderness. For a movie focused on creating an enchanting melody, this aspect was sorely out of tune.<br/><br/>Anyway again. Once you get past the dizzy phase of connecting this symbol with that icon, and the development of relationship between the characters, you get to the heart of the film. That is, usually, the one thing getting in the way, the one person causing the writer's block of our lives, whatever they may be, is ourselves. - our inability to remove blame from everybody else and just do whatever it is we ought to do."

","Very entertaining, not just one for the girls either. A humorous and realistic look at song creation and different musical eras. Grant is convincing as a washed up pop star in this romantic comedy. Barrymore is her usual sweet self. The 'pop video' at the start of the show was very funny and very well done. The songs also in this movie were convincing creations. If you go into this looking for anything profound, you'll be disappointed, but overall, a light and entertaining evening at the movies where one did not come out of the theater thinking, ""well that was another couple of hours gone out of my life that I'll never get back"". Six out of ten for me."

","Sometimes you just need a movie that makes you smile, laugh, and feel good about life for a couple hours. This works. Grant is hilarious and believable in his role as a ""has-been"" 80's pop star and Barrymore is fun to watch. There are no surprises but the video sequence at the beginning of the film alone is worth the price of admission. For anyone who remembers the absurdity of 80's pop (and especially for those who reveled in it!), it is a lot of fun. It's a movie that doesn't take itself or its characters too seriously (if at all). It's well done, however, and I found the concert scene at Madison Square Garden amazingly realistic, for what it is."

","Just as the title claims, this movie wanted to focus on love that rises from the combination of music and lyrics. Unfortunately, I think the producers slipped in the script reading sessions of the film, and left out the film completely. A great blooper reel to say the least. The actors looked like a gun had been placed close to their brains, and they were forced to deliver cheese-filled lines and sing one very annoying song. It's ironic how the last two hours of the most romantic day of the year is filled with hate. A sinfully boring recreation of Jerry Maguire, where even the title did no justice to the plot. In one word: painful."

I think that he is getting a little old for this movie, playing and 80's rock and roller. Drew Barrymore was adequate in her roll. Movies for the most part are being made for the teens and twenty something patrons and anyone who is older is left to seeing this silly little movie. My advise is that if you fall into the above age groups go see it or better yet wait for the DVD (which should be out very shortly.

About 1/3 of the way through I was wanting to stick pins deep into my cortex through my eyes. 15 minutes later, I came to my senses and realised that I actually wanted to inflict this cruel and unusual punishment on Hugh Grant - he really does deserve it...<br/><br/>Please take your loved ones to see this film, and then run away and lock them in the room with no way of escaping or turning the film off.

","This makes two stinkers in a row. Granted, it's not as nausea inducing as FEVER PITCH- which I actively hated. But Drew is making movies like this and the not all that great DUPLEX either because she has no judgment about what scripts will play well or because she knows there are enough people who will see a bad movie just because she's in it.<br/><br/>MUSIC AND LYRICS has one of the worst screenplays in the hundred year history of movies. There's no relationship to human speech or human behavior. Characters spew vast chunks of exposition giving us background about characters and events we're really not all that interested in.<br/><br/>The situation is, at best, odd. Drew plays a plant girl- she goes to people's apartments to water their plants, a job which I'm sure can support an adult in comfort in Manhattan- who gets involved with a washed up singer who was a big star...when she was ten years old. Her romance with a man sixteen years older than she is continues Hollywood's endless exploitation of younger woman/older man relationships.<br/><br/>Characters appear and disappear with no logic. The script seems to have been rewritten about twenty times because there's no flow to it. There's a really good performance here that actually gets what few laughs are elicited from the audience. Kristen Johnson plays Drew's older sister with a manic energy and in the few scenes she's in almost brings the movie to life. Although this is billed as a comedy, the fairly large audience we saw it with sat in stony silence most of the time.<br/><br/>The movie this is closest to in spirit is SAW. Instead of guilty people trapped in a torture chamber MUSIC AND LYRICS gives us hugely talented performers speaking dialog that sounds nothing like human speech in situations that strain credibility.<br/><br/>Grow up, Drew. You can't get by on the audience's good will toward you much longer. You have a heart, a mind, and a soul, but you're being reduced to nothing but a mass of unkempt hair and irritating mannerisms."

Music and Lyrics does not contain ONE single good line and the characters are dreadful (especially Hugh Grant's - and I normally don't mind the guy.) No-one in our cinema laughed, even once, at anything Hugh or anyone else said, and it wasn't for lack of trying. I have never seen comedy bomb so badly.<br/><br/>Within 5 minutes of the opening video clip ending you will just KNOW you are in for a shocker, as the initial set up isn't funny, isn't plausible and gives you two leads that you do not care about.<br/><br/>I cannot stress how bad this film is and am AMAZED it gets 6.5."

"celestialsphere0","4","2","5","12 April 2007"," 'Music and Lyrics' Doesn't Pop
","Marc Lawrence's ""Music and Lyrics"" begins as an enduring melody, but fails to maintain its rhythm. The film's potential echoes in its pairing of Hollywood A-listers Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore who have a wonderful on-screen harmony. Yet, the film's potential falls flat as the storyline begins to drag making the film's once catchy beat seem increasingly forced.<br/><br/>Grant steals the show with his comical portrayal of Alex Fletcher, a has-been 80's singer from the hit band ""PoP!"" who earns a living performing at high school reunions and fairs for screaming middle-aged women. Suddenly, Alex is visited by fan and pseudo-Zen pop sensation Cora Corman (played by Haley Bennett in her feature film debut) who asks Alex to write the lyrics for a song to be titled ""Way Back Into Love."" Alex must complete the song within three days, which proves to be a daunting task for a musician who isn't a strong lyricist. As Alex states: ""I once rhymed you and me with autopsy.""<br/><br/>Alex finds a glimmer of hope in getting the lyrics in Sophie Fisher (Barrymore), the uptight, jumpy and guarded woman who waters his plants. Sophie's talent for song writing  and knack for drowning plants  becomes evident as she mutters lyrics out loud as Alex struggles with his. This sets the stage for a working relationship that quickly turns romantic. But like most movies of the comedy-romance genre, an altercation erupts which temporarily disrupts the lives of the once love-smitten characters, until a solution brings about a resolution that finds a ""Way Back Into Love."" <br/><br/>The songs featured in ""Music and Lyrics"" by composer Adam Schlesinger (""That Thing You Do!"") are catchy. While watching the film I found myself tapping my foot to Alex's rendition of ""PoP! Goes My Heart"" and hours later I was still humming ""Way Back Into Love."" The music also serves another purpose: it is symbolic of the personal growth Grant's character experiences in the film. The time Alex spends with Sophie increases his self-awareness improving his self-expression as a lyricist. Alex's progress becomes apparent when he performs his meaningful and heartfelt ballad ""Don't Write Me Off,"" which greatly contrasts the lively, but empty lyrics of his 80's pop song ""PoP! Goes My Heart."" <br/><br/>The unique chemistry between Grant and Barrymore saves this film from suffering a dreadful fate. ""Music and Lyrics"" is another example of Grant's mastery of the subtle, sly and sarcastic humor that works so well in the romantic-comedy genre. Barrymore shines with her casual congenial cuteness as she sings a beautiful duet with Grant's subtleness.<br/><br/>Yet, Grant and Barrymore's chemistry can't bring this film to a level above mediocrity. The film is 96 minutes long, but feels much longer. Writer, director, and producer Lawrence (who also wrote and directed ""Two Weeks Notice""), spends too much time focusing on the song writing process, which is funny at first, but becomes increasingly tiring. Also, the succeeding scenes involving Alex and Sophie's business dealings with Cora are too long and are further aggravated by Cora's complete lack of personality (the character is as hollow as a Barbie doll).<br/><br/>The lack of character development doesn't end with Cora. Alex's manager (Brad Garrett) and Sophie's sister and Alex's biggest fan (Kristen Johnston) have the potential of becoming intriguing additions to the film, but instead are mere scene fillers. Many good comedy- romance films have supporting characters that struggle with some type of personal problem, such as ""The Wedding Singer"" (another Barrymore film), where Holly (Christine Taylor) and Sammy (Allen Covert) both struggle with loneliness, which makes the characters interesting. Yet, the supporting characters in ""Music and Lyrics"" do not face any personal struggles; they are simply on-lookers to the budding romance between Alex and Sophie. This left me emotionally detached from their characters.<br/><br/>A spark in the form of a song did awaken me during Cora's concert at the end of the film, but it wasn't enough to heat up its contents and warm my heart up to the characters again. ""Music and Lyrics"" is packed with potential, but lacks the pop necessary to put it over the top.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics,"" released by Warner Brothers, is rated PG-13 due to suggestive sexual situations."

","The word ""innocuous"" was invented to describe movies like this.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays an 80s pop star has-been who has the chance to write a song for a hip young music star and perform it with her at an upcoming concert at Madison Square Garden. The thing is, you see, he can only write catchy music, but he sucks at writing lyrics. If only someone could drop into his life out of nowhere with a knack for song-writing, all would be hunky-dory. Lo and behold, Drew Barrymore drops in, in the guise of a neurotic disaster who shows up to take care of his plants, and an unlikely song-writing duo is born.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" is so formulaic that even the actors seem bored with it. Of course Barrymore must be persuaded that she can write lyrics even though she swears that she can't. Of course the two must get in a fight and go their separate ways, only to get back together in time for a big finale. Of course, Grant must declare his love for Barrymore by writing a song -- lyrics and all -- for her, proving to her how much she means to him. Meanwhile, nothing about the movie is especially funny, yet neither is anything egregiously bad. It's just THERE, and I guess that's one of my biggest complaints about it.<br/><br/>And is anyone but me weirded out by the age difference between Grant and Barrymore? Couldn't a funny, interesting movie have been made from the same premise without making them romantically involved? But that would have taken a bit more imagination on the part of the screenwriters, and really, who can be bothered when there's money to be made off of something we've seen ad nauseum before? The best parts of the movie are the opening and closing credits, that feature a mock music video from Grant's 80s band. It's hilarious, and proves that the 80s can't really be parodied because they were a parody to begin with.<br/><br/>Don't spend $10 on this. Rent it instead.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

Lingering death. I'll try to explain this: death of intelligence, bad words paired together trying to collate as to make out jokes (the only exception being Grant's words on how candy sprayed onto a bunch of old people made him recall Altamont), no romance, no good songs (apart from Moroder's ""The Neverending Story"" and a ""nice try"" to Bloodshot & Avant who somehow agreed to do a song for this clownboat) and the general feel that all atmosphere left this film a long time ago.

First off, the pacing of this movie is so slow you could probably take your dog for a long walk and come back without missing anything. In other words, boring. The pace of the movie picks up a little toward the end, but by then you are already bored to tears.<br/><br/>Second, the casting of Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant as a romantic couple is almost disturbing. That's right, disturbing. I never quite understood what woman saw in Hugh Grant but whatever charm or looks he may have had in other films is clearly lacking in this film. The fact that Drew ends up sleeping with him made me almost shudder with horror. No Drew, don't go there! The development of Drew's character Sophie Fisher is so shallow that I found myself more intrigued with the brief appearance of Cora Corman. Hugh Grant's character Alex Fisher has more development, but the character has absolutely no redeeming qualities to speak of and he is completely unlikeable. If Sophie Fisher is truly a hypochondriac, how could she possibly sleep with such a slime bucket? As for Brad Garret's role as Chris Riley, two words come to mind: abysmal and pointless.<br/><br/>The movie tries desperately to redeem itself at the very end, but by then it is way too late and we simply don't care anymore. If it weren't for a few good steamy videos and dance numbers by Cora Corman, I probably would've given this movie 1 star. This movie is everything a romantic comedy should not be. I highly recommend that you pass on this one."

","This almost the worst film I have ever seen. The first scene was so forced and terribly setup that I just hoped it would get better, but it doesn't. The premise could have been written by a twelve year-old. Does every character in American cinema have to be famous to have any credibility? The direction is so terrible. There is a whole section of dialogue shot from the character's backs while walking for no apparent thematic reason, besides a lack of creativity. The dialogue isn't even in sync. The director never gives you time to get a feeling of place. I'd say the only redeeming part of the film is Hugh Grant's corny antics on stage, but that is it. The saddest part about the film is that the humor is so childish and slapstick that the English as a second language audience I was watching it with were actually enjoying it. Makes it seem as if films are now made with out inspiration and just to be paid for, filling genre slots in cineplexes, so that romantic couples have a reason to not talk to each other. Finally, an hour in to the film I snapped out of the numbness walked out."

","Slightly better than usual Hugh Grant rom-com vehicle which sees him play an ageing, 80's has-been Andrew Ridgley-type popster who gets an unlikely break from the constant round of playing the oldies circuit when he's asked to write a song for the new, hot young Britney / Christina kid-on-the-block. However, rather like, say, Elton John, he doesn't do lyrics and needs to find one fast to complete the new song on deadline and give his erstwhile career a much needed boost. By chance, it turns out his young, female plant- lady (i.e. she waters his plants) has a way with words and because she's also Drew Barrymore they form an offbeat partnership, get involved and along the way solve Barrymore's own issues which revolve around an old teacher of hers who's used her experiences as the thinly disguised subject of a hit, soon-to-be-filmed best seller of his.<br/><br/>The film starts off very funnily with a spot-on mickey-take of the relentlessly upbeat 80's videos from those boys from Wham, before the main story takes over and I suppose falters from there. Grant is a bit less gauche and narcissistic than usual (strangely so, given his character's C.V. here) and Barrymore is more clever than cute when her character might have played better if those traits were reversed.<br/><br/>There's not a great deal of romantic spark between them although cosmetically they spark a little better off each other. Sadly, the supporting characters are thin while story goes through the predictable series of will they, won't they get together ups and downs before the expected happy-ending sees the succeed together on a personal and commercial level.<br/><br/>The best lines are still those which spoof the 80's music scene, in my opinion, the decade that fashion and talent forgot, the rest of it is, unsurprisingly, soft and warm and fuzzy, rather like a typical George Michael single of the time. The big conclusion, at a massive concert thrown by new hipster Cora, sees Grant, heretofore an inept lyricist, but who throughout must of the film, keeps up a mostly witty and confident dialogue and writes a fluent open-letter lyric to Barrymore just as she's quitting the big showcase concert of Cora's where he appears to be taking sole credit for their new song for Cora.<br/><br/>Like 80's music in general, this reasonably pleasant and amusing film doesn't exactly challenge the senses but passes the time amiably enough."

It's under-rated because it doesn't try to be something it's not, so refreshing, but succeeds brilliantly at what it is--a seemingly effortless, finding themselves romantic comedy.<br/><br/>If there were ever a documentary film devoted to best comic moments by supporting players this film has several that qualify for the hall of fame, including scenes with the apartment desk clerk played by Aasif Mandvi or with Drew's sister in the film played by Kristen Johnston.<br/><br/>It's six years later and I still feel peeved when the talking heads who originally reviewed this film have the last word.

I was also impressed by how Haley Bennett managed to switch from a hyper-sexualized character to one that is almost a-sexual and unreadable. I imagine that's also partly the result of the director's efforts on this film. <br/><br/>If there's anything I know well, it's the 80s. It's never easy to get the feel of a past decade's music and style quite right. However, this film manages to nail it right on the head. Watching the behind the scenes material on the DVD, I can see that they referenced the right material in order to get the look and feel correct. Going overboard worked in their favour, since the New Wave era was pretty extreme -- to say the least. <br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that I found myself laughing my head off.

The title 'way back into love' and 'dance with me tonight' have become my favorites. Like the movie these songs the bring a feeling of pleasantness and calmness. Also must mention that Drew and Hugh have pretty good voice, in fact I liked Drew and Hugh's version of title song more than that by Haley Bennett, maybe their being actors helped them lending more emotions to their voice ,which makes up for their lack of singing talent. Other songs like 'meaningless kiss', 'love autopsy' and 'don't write me off' are quite good. <br/><br/>A small sneak peek in movie.Hugh plays Alex Fletcher who can save his dwindling carrier by composing a song for a major current teen singing sensation (someone like lady gaga), but needs a lyricist.In comes Sophie, Alex's temporary plant girl who has an amazing talent with pen but is dealing with some personal issues and together they create a chemistry and warmth as good as the title song. The movie neither overdoes the comedy or cuteness nor it becomes too slow, a common syndrome by which romantic comedies are plagued. The balance of the movie is fine. Every now and then it manages to make us smile through subtle comic punch but never overcooks it. <br/><br/>Now coming to performances Drew and Hugh were amazing. Their chemistry looked perfect. Drew completely soaks in the role of this extremely vulnerable girl next door very well who is afraid to face her fears and Hugh gelled well in the role of a singer almost finished with singing career trying desperately to make a final dash. Their on screen chemistry is as good as it gets. Other actors like Haley Bennett , Brad Garrett , Kirsten Johnston do justice to their role. Overall it was a nice movie which can be watched with entire family to have a good time. I hope Drew does more movies like this."

","This movie was well much beyond what I expected (I don't know actually why!)...I really loved the movie and the music. The characters were smart, humorous, and memorable and the setting was pretty much cool. personally, I love Hugh Grant, especially after viewing About A Boy. I can honestly say that this is one of his best movies also. The movie talks about an aspiring artist of the 80s trying to adapt himself to the Music business of nowadays. I also liked the contrast of the songs (80s vs. contemporary) and even the main soundtrack of the movie has become one of my favorite songs. A highly recommended movie with a noble message about good music! loved it!"
"rooprect","8","1","2","15 March 2010"," Required viewing for 80s music fans
","Every 10 years or so, a musical comedy comes along that perfectly pegs a musical era. The late 70s would be ""Spinal Tap"". The 90s would be ""Singles"". And here, ladies & gentlemen of the 80s generation, we have ""Music and Lyrics"".<br/><br/>I don't know if post-80s people would understand the humour, but gawd I was in stitches right from the start. The film begins with an embarrassingly accurate rendition of an 80s pop video: moussed hair, tight pants, big-arm dancing, slutty nurses with bursting cleavage, the works! From there, the film focuses on one of the guys in the video, the self-proclaimed ""happy has been"" Alex (Hugh Grant), an ex-80s glamour boy who is now reduced to playing high school reunions and Six Flags themeparks to make a living. In many ways it's so accurate, it can't even be called a satire.<br/><br/>Even funnier is the spoof of today's booty music and Alex's attempt to integrate himself. He has 3 days to write a hit single for a pop diva, but despite his instrumental talents he has the lyric writing skills of a wet shoe (trying to rhyme ""you and me"" with ""autopsy"" haha). Then along comes Sophie (Drew Barrymore) who has a magical way of putting words together, though she herself comes with a handful of emotional baggage.<br/><br/>The plot is really not the point. The point of this film is--in the spirit of Spinal Tap--to mock the silliness of cultural crazes, particularly the 80s music that we all know so well (but are too embarrassed to admit). My fellow rejects from the 80s, this is your catharsis, a way of exorcising all the demons from your closets. You can laugh at the screen, but you're actually laughing at yourself & loving every minute.<br/><br/>Both Hugh & Drew deliver great, believable performances, and the script is fast paced & witty like an old Katharine Hepburn / Cary Grant picture. But what really made this a great film are the riotous performances by the supporting characters. Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Kristen Johnston (""3rd Rock from the Sun""), and the rookie Haley Bennett (in her first of, I hope, many films) are monstrously funny, adding their own particular quirky comedy to this production.<br/><br/>Don't miss your chance to see this movie. Twice even. And the bonus features on the DVD are a real treat: the Gag Reel (bloopers), Deleted Scenes, and The Making Of featurette. If you were born between 1965 and 1975 you must see this film. To everyone else, yes, I think you'll enjoy it too. Keep in mind that all this stuff was REAL."

","Music and Lyrics is nothing complex, it is just a simple, well-made light romantic comedy. Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant are very charming, and very likable. The scenes where they are making the song together are the most effective, because it hits right into the heart. The supporting players are also very well cast and rounded, and help make the film likable. It is nothing incredibly special, but the music is quite good, and by the end, you cannot help but feel touched by this film. Finally, a very good romantic comedy that mainstream audiences can enjoy with their lovers. For fans of this film, you might also take a look at Once, the 'independent' version of this film."

","Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore? Surely they must've combined every Hollywood actor/actress together & these 2 together are just an amateur attempt to bring in a different demographic. But I actually liked these 2 together, they're both really funny & they're both really likable, together some people were scared they were going to be nor funny nor likable but I think it turned out quite the opposite. But Kristen Johnson really is the shining star as very comedic sister of Barrymore's.?<br/><br/>The story was just your average guy-meets-gal story but with a twist thrown in..... music! Washed-up has been (Grant) is given a chance for a comeback by writing a song for international teen pop-star but needs to find a good lyricist to do so, as such he finds Sophie (Barrymore) who waters his plants & has a natural talent for songwriting. The two stay up late nights writing this song bonding & learning more about each other, then in a twist-of-fate they end up as bedfellows which all leads to the inevitable rom-com couple fight which just brings them back together stronger in a predictable but enjoyable happy ending.?<br/><br/>If you are frustrated with films like this, maybe you should avoid it. But Music and Lyrics is a very fun, very funny & very romantic nice light-hearted comedy that will definitely entertain most. It is not trying to be an epic Oscar-winner & for what it is, it is a very great film. And I must admit it has some very catchy tunes in it!"
"jpschapira","7","1","2","19 December 2007"," ""Ok...Pop Face!""
","I had been waiting to watch this movie. It's like the perfect romantic couple on screen; the king and the queen: Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. He is Alex, a 'has been' pop idol who now plays in high school reunions. She is Sophie, a woman who washes his plants and because of those things life has ends up writing a song with him<br/><br/>That's the plot line summarized. What can or will happen and if you can predict it or not depends on the posture you take when watching the film. I, a big fan of romantic comedies, just like to sit back and enjoy the ride, as I always say. If you are on the same group, you might just have a really good time on the whole; ""Music & Lyrics"" has all the formulaic elements and doesn't break any rule. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you generally don't like these rides, luckily Marc Lawrence, the film's writer and director, has other things you may find interesting. For example, the culture references of the 80's and the contrast with the contemporary times, or the clear mockery towards the 'pop' groups of previous decades. <br/><br/>If you like music, you'll appreciate the musical knowledge, completely displayed in a scene where Hugh Grant records all the instruments of a song by himself; or the mentions to the musical poets: Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder. And if you like acting, it's impossible to reject these two giants of the genre creating magic together.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe Hugh Grant will never achieve again what he did with Julia Roberts and maybe there won't be another ""Wedding Singer"", but you can't deny the chemistry between the stars here. Grant is great as always, doing his role by heart with his usual charm and some newly incorporated facial expressions.<br/><br/>But the one who surprises this time is Barrymore. She is beautiful as always, that stays the same, but there's something different in her performance. Her Sophie is a character that stands in a different line from her work in ""50 First Dates"" and ""Fever Pitch"". She adds complexity to her silences and to her emotions, and it makes me long to see ""Lucky You"".<br/><br/>Of course that if you love music, good or bad, you'll feel and extra sentiment that goes beyond romance and comedy. But if you love comedy, I can assure you'll laugh a lot; and you'll fall in love if you are fond of romance. <br/><br/>All this said, I'll leave you with two things: it's not an impossible movie to miss if you don't have special reasons for watching it; and there's a teenage pop star, superbly played by Haley Bennett, who does things in a live stage that the music business wouldn't accept today. I mean, I haven't seen Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff reach those levelsAt least not yet."
"duraflex","9","1","2","14 October 2007"," A magic pair in a delightful romantic comedy
","There aren't many people who can light up a movie (or TV) screen anymore but Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore accomplish the magic. These two define ""movie stars"" of the 21st century.<br/><br/>This pair is simply delightful and I found myself pulling them from the first time they met.<br/><br/>We already knew they could act but who knew they could sing? Grant also learned to dance and play the piano for the role. For a guy who is now 47, he has more appeal than many guys half his age. The fact that an attractive woman 15 years younger would be attracted to him is totally believable. Grant is good-looking, charming and he has a heart. This is probably his best performance since TWO WEEKS NOTICE.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fun and uplifting date movie, this will do the trick. A very pleasant film."
"bigglesworth06","7","1","2","15 July 2007"," Good Fun
","Hugh and Drew were mismatched and hilarious in this movie. It was cheesy, offbeat and touching all at the same time. Hugh Grant had a few really funny lines, with his usual good delivery and Drew Barrymore was so bubbly and insanely weird.<br/><br/>It was a predictable film, but nonetheless worth a watch. The one-liners, the interaction between Grant and Barrymore, and the utterly ridiculous 'Cora' character (Haley Bennett) totally make it worthwhile. You'll recognize several characters from sitcoms like 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and 'Third Rock from the Sun'--How can you not laugh when you see 'Robert' and 'Sally'? I totally buy Grant as a has-been songwriter and Barrymore as a wordy scatterbrain. <br/><br/>This one was actually better than I thought--no disappointment here. This one's just good fun."

The guy's got some notes within him; surprising.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, especially the music, being an eternal eighties fan. It was hard to get used to all that but-shaking from Grant who looked way out of his waters, and I couldn't believe it was really his voice until I double checked to be sure; but all in all, he did a great job. Drew's performance was as always perfect. Without her, this movie with any other actress, would have been boring really.<br/><br/>I thought the story was well developed, I liked most of the lines, didn't like some of them. One thing I wish they would have added in the script, was a part where Sophie finally manages to tell what she really thinks and feels about Sloan to his face. I mean, Alex did manage to tell Cora what he thought about the song.

I've seen him in at least three other movies, but here he hit the ball out of the park.

Knowing Marc, he probably already has a good sequel written and is just waiting for the main actors to be available for the filming. <br/><br/>All the best, LizK"
"DonFishies","7","1","2","18 May 2007"," It works for the most part, but is clearly not one of the best
","I am a big fan of Hugh Grant. I may not be the biggest fan of romantic comedies, but anything with him in it is usually something I would tend to watch. And after the absolutely grotesque spectacle that was American Dreamz, I was ready for just about anything to cleanse that god-awful taste out of my mouth. And even though Music and Lyrics is another film about the record industry, I think I am ready to forgive him.<br/><br/>Grant stars as Alex Fletcher, an out of work 1980's pop singer who just happens to be one of singing sensation Cora Corman's (Haley Bennett) favourite artists. Needing a new single to complete her latest album, Corman gives Fletcher just over a few days to compose a brand new song, despite him not having written one in years. After a brief go with someone else, Fletcher finds his muse in his new plant lady, Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who just so happens to know how to write eloquently.<br/><br/>Yes, it sounds rather lame, and just about anyone knows how the film will end, but that does not totally take away from the fun at play here.<br/><br/>Grant is charming as always, even as a much older guy. He has really gotten to the point of perfection in understanding his romantic on-screen partners, and can really mesh in well against them. And even when you can tell he is not trying too hard, Grant still has a suspicious way of making it look like he is. And while he did genuinely attempt something different with Dreamz, you can see that this is where his heart lies, and probably where he is going to be stuck until he really breaks out as something more than the oft-spoken British guy in all of the romantic comedies everyone loves. But if that does not work out, I think he has quite a potential career in singing.<br/><br/>Barrymore, another actor almost eternally cursed to this kind of role, also does well within it. She has some moments where she looks like she is lapsing into someone who is totally different from her character, but thankfully these only last for a few moments. She lights up the screen anytime she is front and centre alongside Grant, and even with unoriginal material, Barrymore makes something of her character and the film itself. She pales in comparison to Grant of course, but for someone who is not the quintessential romantic lead, she did pretty well for herself.<br/><br/>Bennett in her tiny role is a bit bizarre, but was clearly written and acted on being someone who is just alien in her behaviour. To that, I think she does an adequate job, but she could have done better. If she really wanted to make herself out to be that much of a princess, she really should tried a lot less. She has a hell of a singing voice though.<br/><br/>The only real bad apples here are Brad Garrett as Fletcher's manager Chris Riley, and Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda. I just have never liked Garrett, so maybe I am a bit bias when I call him a bad apple. But other than a few minor giggles, he really does nothing for the film. Hell, other than telling Fletcher about Corman wanting him to write a song, he basically does next to nothing. He would have just done better as a backdrop. Much goes the same for Johnson, who appears to have gotten another role written strictly for someone who resembles this bizarre person. I understand her rabid fanaticism, but there is a very thin line between comedy and annoyance. Johnson teeters on this line for the entirety of the film, and no matter what, she does not have the power to overcome any ridiculous stupidity this character acts out.<br/><br/>As a film though, it tends to go on a bit too long. It could have done with a nice trim around the fattened middle, and this could have lead to a much faster and greater ending. As it stands, it falls into a few too many subplots that seem to want to put more influence on the characters than what is needed. I could have done with just minor background on Barrymore's character; I did not need to know as much as we end up being told. It just ends up feeling superfluous in the end, and drops the film down a few notches. If they really needed to keep it, I think they could have done it in a far more interesting way.<br/><br/>But of course, I digress from my favourite part of the film  the opening scene. Mixing in Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran and Wham!, the film opens with a music video from Fletcher's band PoP! that ends up being the perfect synergy of 1980's-style fads and 2007-style parodies. It works on so many levels that it almost overshadows the rest of the film. Everything is just pitch perfect, and if you did not realize that Hugh Grant was jumping around dressed as an 80's pop rocker, you probably could have mistaken it for the real thing. It is just that accurate, and clearly something everyone should watch whether they view the entirety of the film or not.<br/><br/>On the whole, Music and Lyrics is a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, it has the immaculate Hugh Grant doing exactly what he does best, and being paired off with romantic comedy regular Drew Barrymore to boot. But on the other, it is flawed to the point of being superfluous in at least one section. For the most part, it works, and that should be enough for the majority of people watching it. But for any others, it can be used as a light snack, but not as a main course.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"nathalierubic","5","1","2","16 May 2007"," Forgivable
","There may be cheesy parts here and there but they're all forgivable because this movie totally works... for the most part.<br/><br/>Mark Gamaya did a good (not Sleepless in Seattle / Say Anything good) job with the overall plot. Alex Fletcher being a washed up 80's pop star would sound so familiar to the music industry - with has-beens always out looking for comeback hits to keep up with the endless strings of new, shiny and fresh so-called talents Hollywood keep popping out with. Plus, the constant references t the music market ploys and happenings are priceless.<br/><br/>The characters are believable. There's always an Alex Fletcher in every pop group or boy band such as there always will be a Colin in each one (Justin Timberlake, Robbie Williams, etc.). Cora, of course, has Britney Spears spot on.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are, of course, veterans of romantic comedies so there really is no surprise in their acting. It seemed like the characters were tailormade for both celebrities. Drew Barrymore is certainly no stranger to dating musicians having been dating (my fave garage rockers) The Strokes' drummer, Fabrizio Moretti for four and a half years. Another veteran comedic actor , Brad Garrett (of Everybody Loves Raymond fame) added that extra something to the flick.<br/><br/>Being a film about music, one would think that it would sell most with its soundtrack. But the only big hit was the main song, Way Back Into Love... although Pop! Goes My Heart also made a subtle impression of itself. And Briteny's lyricists would certainyl be proud of Cora's: ""Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can. But again my body just wants to slam..."" Editing were a bit off but, like I said, forgivable. Tsktsk, Mark Lawrence.<br/><br/>What I love most about the movie is the message that came with the title: The melody is like the physical aspect of a relationship... sex. The lyrics is the story underneath... getting to know each other. It's the combination of both that makes it magic."

In fact I would go so far as to say that it is a great and entertaining movie and totally hit the spot for me this weekend when I needed to laugh.<br/><br/>Yes, it is 20 minutes too long and yes, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore hardly stretch themselves and can do this kind of stuff in their sleep and yes, it is predictable in the extreme, but it is very funny, Hugh is charming and Drew is gorgeous (I have had long discussions with a certain guy who thinks that Drew is not gorgeous and is actually deformed, but he is obviously is an idiot, because Drew is gorgeous and I will come after anybody who disagrees with me with a gun). There is also a spot on spoof of an 80's pop video for a song ""Pop Goes My Heart"", at the beginning and end of the movie, and that song will stick in your head for hours afterwards. They should release it. It would be a hit."

I laughed so hard when Drew's older sister realized she could meet ""Alex Fletcher"". The older sister is the character I totally identified with, as will all other women about 40 years old. The music video was so corny, but so completely dead-on as an 80s video. Within moments I knew this was a movie about WHAM!, my favorite 80s band.

"jawlaw","9","1","2","7 April 2007"," The Best Romantic Comedy in Years
","I saw ""That Thing You Do"" back in 1996 and was convinced that the film would never be outdone in its genre. In that film a song from another age is created as a backdrop for a fictional garage ""one hit wonder"" band. Adam Schlessinger wrote the title song for that movie. He is up to it again.<br/><br/>He writes several songs used in this movie including the retro 80's ""Wham"" sound-alike song ""Pop Goes My Heart."" This film starts with a retro video of that song and anyone who remembers the digital drums and synthesizer sounds of the ""over-produced"" 80's songs will be in stitches. This film is based loosely on the plight of Andrew Ridgely--the other guy from Wham who was not George Michaels and who did not have a great after-Wham career. The part is played quite well by Hugh Grant, who is very likable and humorous throughout the film.<br/><br/>As the story goes, Grant, playing Alex Fletcher, the 80's has-been, has a chance to escape the stagnating economic necessity of playing Oldies concerts for one more chance to write a hit song for a current artist. Unfortunately, like Elton John, he is a tune-smith, and not a lyricist. Enter Drew Barrymore, who he convinces has what it takes to be a lyricist. The story unfolds and is a bit predictable in places--yet totally satisfying.<br/><br/>I got hooked into seeing this film with my wife. ""Another Chic-flick"" I thought. I have now seen it three times--taking one of my daughters each time. It was a good excuse to keep going back and to keep laughing at this well crafted romantic comedy.

And Hugh Grant was a natural as an aging rock star with his English penchant for dry understatement. It just fit this plot like a glove."

","Going in I said to my self please, give me more than just a romantic comedy with music used to fill a plot line. Well i got what i asked for. I am an involved fan of both Drew Barrymore and the entire romantic comedy genre,and i am use to typical Romadies, but recently marking movie releases like ""Fever Pitch and ""Because I said so"". A change that is redefining the Romady gave me hope.<br/><br/>Drew's character seemed typical, starting of as just a woman coming in to water plants her hidden persona begins to unravel with in seconds free thought and clever rhyming spill from her lips causing Grants character, a washed up pop artist who hears her sing to ask her to use her writing skills to aid his career. the constant jokes and stereotypical parodied scenes of what a pop star is, makes for an incredibly funny movie. the even more interesting back story of why an talented writer turns her back on her gift was brilliant, the alter ego that was present in Barrymoores character flaw was extremely laughable. over all this movie is more funny than romantic and at times the singing us slightly annoying. But what is romance but a Song wrapped in a laugh and sailed down a sea of annoyance. you will love this one on a Friday with your honey.loll enjoy."
"eduvinamendez","10","1","2","22 March 2007"," A great, fun movie
","He sings! He moves with enthusiasm and grace! He is funny! And sensitive! A great performance by Hugh Grant. And Drew Barrymore is simply adorable as always. Newcomer Hayley Bennett is funny and delightful. I read somewhere that this movie was geared to people in their thirties who listened to this music while growing up in the 80's. Wrong! This movie is for everybody. I was too busy working and taking care of my family to be aware of the music trends of that decade. So for me this very catchy music is totally new. I have seen the movie six times. And I bought the CD and I will buy the movie. Just one last comment: some critics have said that Hugh Grant is always the same. Actually, no. In this movie he is funny and cute as always but he is also able to communicate the character's pain."
"Nessi-3","9","1","2","9 March 2007"," Hilarious comedy for thirty-somethings
","We hardly couldn't stop laughing. Even during the more serious scenes we started giggling just remembering previous scenes. The movie probably is not half as funny for younger viewers who don't know the era when hair-gel was new on the market and people wore strange combinations of clothes in the wildest colours and patterns. Just like the spirit of that decade provides a lot of funny scenes, also a lot of the jokes refer to real-life 80's Has-beens who are completely unknown to people born after the 70's. I.e. Frankie Goes to Hollywood or Debbie Gibson and Tiffany who were the Britney & X-tina of that time and alternated in being on the covers of youth magazines for quite a while. The chemistry between Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore works well, because the (real-life) age gap exists also in the portrayed characters. Even if the character of the big sister seems to be a little over the top, we could identify with her very much. All our teenage-year idols are virtually Has-beens now, but if we would face them today, we would probably faint, just by reviving the feelings we had then."
"carsinger86","Null","1","2","8 March 2007"," ""Grant, Barrymore, Work Their Way Back Into Audiences Hearts in ""Music and Lyrics""
","Hugh Grant sings.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant dances.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" provides Grant with an outlet to put both talents to a good (and highly entertaining) use. The movie, released on Valentine's Day (you can either groan or sigh), is the perfect film to make you believe in love again (even if it is only for the hour and thirty six minutes the film runs).<br/><br/>The movie begins with Alex Fletcher (Grant) and his ""PoP!"" band mates hamming it up Wham! style in an outlandish ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" music video. The video includes a near fatal Alex in an operating room-but when he finds love, his heart ""pops!"" after falling in love with a nurse.<br/><br/>Fifteen years after the band breaks up in 1992, Alex is offered an appearance on ""Battle of the 80's Has-Beens."" The competition turns out to be a boxing match for former stars. He declines.<br/><br/>Life seems down for Alex (who has been resigned to playing state fairs, high school reunions and amusement park gigs) but in walks Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) to water his plants. While Sophie shows no promise as a plant caretaker (she waters a fake one), she has a natural talent for lyric writing. This comes in handy since Alex is writing a song for Indian influenced-""Entering Bootytown"" singing Cora Corman (newcomer Haley Bennett) in less than a week and is more of a music writer than a lyric writer. His past attempts at song writing include the lyrics: ""Figuring out you and me/is like doing a love autopsy."" Not exactly happy thoughts.<br/><br/>Alex and Sophie work together to write ""Way Back Into Love"" for a possible Alex and Cora concert performance. The two find themselves falling for each other during their writing bootcamp. The also find each has their own set of baggage. Alex is coming to grips with the fact his heydays are over. Sophie is suffering after being unflatteringly portrayed in her former writing teacher Sloan Cates' (Campbell Scott) book, which claims she used him to get ahead with her own writing career.<br/><br/>But their new found happiness is broken like a guitar string when Alex and Sophie clash over Cora's rendition of their song.<br/><br/>While ""Music and Lyrics"" is highly predictable, director and writer Marc Lawrence (who worked with Grant in 2002's ""Two Weeks Notice"") presents the movie in a way audiences can forget the cuteness of it all and settle in for an enjoyable time at the show. The witty songs combined with equally entertaining conversation made me forget I had the movie pegged after one viewing of the movie trailer.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise is how well Grant, Barrymore and Bennett all sing. Grant previously showcased his abilities in a school talent show in 2002's ""About a Boy"" singing ""Killing Me Softly."" He continues with a strong effort in ""Music and Lyrics."" Grant also looks at home playing the piano and working his magic with his home recording studio.<br/><br/>Barrymore is a perfect vocal accompaniment after getting over her initial nervousness. Bennett is as talented as the majority of today's pop acts and interestingly enough is currently working on her debut album according to the ""Music and Lyrics"" website.<br/><br/>The songs in ""Music and Lyrics"" are extremely catchy, though many are cheesy (but in a cute way). After purchasing the soundtrack a few days after seeing the movie, the CD became a staple on the drive to school. I found myself duetting (unfortunately not in real life) with Grant to ""Way Back Into Love,"" making flashy ""pop"" hand movements to ""Pop! Goes My Heart"" and trying to sing ""Love Autopsy"" (in all of its forty-second glory) with a straight face. While I can imagine what other drivers thought, the in-car performances went on without incident.<br/><br/>With the state of music today, I think some of the songs (especially ""Way Back Into Love"") could have a shot at being hit songs. However, since they are associated with the movie, many might not take them seriously. Music director Adam Schlesinger (of the band Fountains of Wayne best known for their hit ""Stacy's Mom"") has a hand in four of the soundtrack's 12 songs.<br/><br/>Choreographer Daniel Karaty does an excellent job making seemingly uncoordinated actors into believable dancers. Bennett's dance scenes seem appear to be straight out of a Shakira video. Grant's shimmying about (similar to his ""Jump! (For My Love) inspired routine in 2003's ""Love Actually"") is over the top, but appears to be natural.<br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" had me sitting in my seat not wanting the fun to end, waiting for the DVD to be released and wishing for a love like Alex and Sophie's. But I'm also a hopeless romantic. <br/><br/>""Music and Lyrics"" is rated PG-13 for some sexual content-however it is relatively tame and is nothing that isn't shown during prime time television."
"unakluz","7","1","2","5 March 2007"," Could have been better, but not much
","I really enjoyed this film about the aging pop has-been Alex Fletcher(Hugh Grant) and his temporary plant watering lady Sophie(Drew Barrymore) who end up writing a song together for pop princess Cora (played with great aplomb by newcomer Haley Bennet). The scenes where Alex sang his old hits to crowds of middle aged women were just so true they were hilarious. It was a nice gentle romantic comedy in the vein of Notting Hill and Never Been Kissed but with singing, something at which Hugh Grant was surprisingly good. My only complaints about the film would be I think once more Hugh Grant was relied upon to play the usual eccentric foppish Englishman that everyone finds so charmingly amusing, and rightly so, but I think there is a lot more to Mr Grant than that, in fact I think both the leads were rather underused in a comedic sense, so although it was definitely worth watching it could have been a classic if better use had been made of the leads and the strong funny supporting cast."
"Carycomic","7","1","2","5 March 2007"," Passable old-fashioned romantic comedy.
","I'll confess that the only reason I saw this movie, at all, was due to an early matinée showing of ""Zodiac"" being already sold out. But, once I got into the story, it was surprisingly pretty good!<br/><br/>Not knee-slapping hysterical, mind you. In fact, a lot of the intended jokes made cringe rather than laugh. But, I loved the faux-Eighties music video that opened and closed the story. In many ways, I still think the genuine articles were more entertaining than some of the current stuff aired on MTV, nowadays!<br/><br/>And, it's almost impossible to dislike Drew Barrymore's performance as a hypochondriac plant-sitter whose talent for poetry is matched only by her unrequited crush for her snobbish ex-college professor/boyfriend.<br/><br/>Brad Garrett is also pretty funny as Hugh Grant's DJ/manager. Haley Bennett satirizes Generation-X divas with twice as much accuracy as Pink. And, Grant himself all-but steals the show as a heterosexual version of George Michael trying to make a come-back.<br/><br/>All told, I liked it a lot better than I initially thought I would."
"demoneyeslaharl","7","1","2","26 February 2007"," While at core, formulaic love comedy, it does have its shining moments...
","When looking at the posters and previews of Music and Lyrics, I knew it was going to be a standard Love Comedy, but with an angle concerning music. I was right... kind of.<br/><br/>I watched this along with my sister, her classmates and school mates, and this movie gave me the impression it wasn't trying to impress people with frilly dress, huge names, or even corny jokes. It was showing itself off, as it is, and it worked well.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, while I haven't seen him in movies for a while, was quite impressive along with Drew Berrymore. There was chemistry, yes, but not over-the top or overly realistic chemistry, but just enough to convince that it could work. He delivered some of his lines quite funnily without being cheesy or unconvincing.<br/><br/>Drew Berrymore works well as a rather ditzy and funny regular girl who is gifted in writing poems and lyrics. I liked her performance here better then the last movie of her I watched (Charlie's Angels Full Throttle) and like Grant, could deliver funny acts/lines naturally.<br/><br/>Haley Bennet (who plays Cora), while wasn't really a main part of the film, made me laugh. The way she portrayed as one of the top pop stars of the world, while acting like a very eccentric and showing her body movements (in a good way) got me to laugh, especially when her music reminds me of Britney Spears' and other pop stars out there. But she also had more character than that, able to appreciate music in her own right... XD though the way she ""butchered"" it made me laugh again.<br/><br/>There are a few problems though in this film... though its probably just nit picking. The plot itself, while sounds sound, the way it went there was rather quite jagged. Drew and Hugh's characters met because the former is hired to water the latter's plants... while I can say its plausible, there could have been a more impressive way for them to meet.<br/><br/>The second thing is that it was rather predictable as all love comedies. Guy meets girl, go out for a while, get to know each other better... then there will be problems... a slight break, and in the end, they get back together. I even enumerated, hoping it wasn't the case, but no dice.<br/><br/>It was an average movie... it just had some decent music, lyrics, funny moments, and decent plot. With decent chemistry, and everything that is decent... its just that. Decent.<br/><br/>7/10."
"aimforthehead","10","1","2","25 February 2007"," This is not a chick flick
","I loved this film and my husband did too. The opening scene which was a music video had me laughing. The songs were cute and so was the plot. Hugh Grant had some great lines. Drew Barrymore was quirky and witty. Grant gave a great performance. I thought this would be a chick flick and it was not the men in the audience were laughing. This combined humor and a love story. I really liked the musical scenes, the songs were cute and funny. I'm not sure if Hugh Grant actually sang though. Pop goes my heart captured the 1980's music video's the song and the dancing were rather funny. The scene where Hugh sings meaningless kiss is memorable due to his dancing. And the last song don't write me off was just too cute for words. I highly recommend this movie."

The story is simple and moves along quickly. <br/><br/>The music is catchy. I had seen Hugh Grant interviewed about his character. He said that he did his own singing, something new for him. I am impressed. He can sing. Of course the story is cute and even though I knew where it was going from the start, I still had to root for Drew and Hugh to get together. <br/><br/>Young Cora is a stunner.

I'll admit it, I liked it too, so when I saw the trailers for this new film Music and Lyrics I took her for a Valentines gift and even dragged along the 11 year old boy. <br/><br/>She really enjoyed it and so did I. The surprise was that even our little boy liked it too. He says that he liked the girls, especially Haley Bennett's character Cora Corman, but I know he liked the music because he was humming Way Back to Love on the ride home. (Maybe I'll get him to practice his piano a little more.)<br/><br/>I like Hugh Grant and love his humor. He seems to always come out with great lines and I wonder if they are actually written for him or if he comes up with them himself. I was also surprised that he can sing! <br/><br/>Bottom line is this is a great date movie."
"iluvmymom1987","10","1","2","20 February 2007"," Just Plain Musical
","I know that most people say this is the classic Hugh Grant movie, and I agree, but then again I don't. This movie was hilarious...and I definitely agree..the music is infectious. Even if you didn't live in the 80's or you were born in them and did miss a lot of the culture....take a listen to the big namers and then compare the Hugh Grant version. You'll find they run oddly similar. As if he was born for this role. As if he was born to dance and sing like a 80's pop star. Even though interviews blazing up the Internet say he did not like having to learn the moves and the songs...and more than that, to learn how to sing...he does a damn good job for what he says was a ""fraud and charlatan"" role. Barrymore and Grant's chemistry is pretty musical in and of itself."

It has it all - humor, music, good script, romance, great characters and casting and it is just a fun feel good movie. <br/><br/>You never know how movies will be until you see them. I walked out of the theatre and immediately wanted to walk back in. I can't say this about many movies. This movie is wickedly funny and I laughed myself silly at points. Highly recommended if you want a laugh - everyone in our theater loved it. I've seen it multiple times and it does not lose any magic at all. This movie is worth the money to see for those of any age who want to see a good movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is an 80s pop star still living on his past glories until unexpected career opportunity to write a new pop song for a huge star leads him back to success and into love with his female costar. Drew and Hugh make a great on screen couple. What I love about the characters are that they are all human - no one is perfect. They all complex and interesting characters that I'd love to meet. Writing is incredibly funny and the cast makes it come to life. I must admit I was curious how Hugh would pull this off but he did a fabulous job with this character and pulls off every scene including the dancing and singing too! I bought the soundtrack as it will keep me going until the DVD comes out. <br/><br/>Granted a younger audience who isn't familiar with the 80's music may wonder a bit about that but the movie again will win anyone over. If you want to see a funny film this is the one to choose. But do stay after the movie is over as they put some more funny stuff up after they start rolling the credits."

I actually found this to be one of Grant and Barrymore's better movies. Their on-screen chemistry was just amazing. Being one that's had an inappropriate relationship with an older male, I could identify with her situation and embarrassment, normally you don't see such a nice ending to such a sporadic meeting. It actually provided me with the hope of meeting someone one day that isn't such a pain and is genuine... someone to grow and learn with. Thanks!! :)"

It made me laugh and made me cry and made me even dance in my seat. The humor in the movie is something that is hard to find today, usually people laugh because someone gets hurt or someone says something stupid.

I will keep my lips sealed and not breath a further word because that scene surprised me and the rest of the audience, as far as I could tell.

I didn't think it was GREAT, but very good, and very sweet. This is the story of an aging pop star. (Having been a child of the 80's and having loved so many of those groups from a bygone era I can totally relate). He doesn't seem to mind being a has been and as long as the money keeps coming in he's pretty content to do small time gigs and sing the oldies to ""menapausal women"".<br/><br/>He does however need to keep making money so when he gets the rare opportunity to write a new song for ""Cora"", a famous pop singer he jumps at it, but he's more a music guy, and needs someone to write the song. Along comes Sophie (barrymore), who has a talent for writing and only by accident they both discover she has a knack for song lyrics. Anyone who's seen any movie ever in their lives can predict the rest, blah blah blah.

She is lacking in self- confidence and he cannot write his own songs without her assistance. The pair are adorable, especially seeing as they are not all over each other every minute or constantly flirting. The best part of the entire movie was the sincerity that shone through Barrymore and Grant, the adoration and chemistry that has more basis in emotions opposed to sexual. Brad Garrett, of the Everybody Loves Raymond fame, brings a certain 'oomph' to the story with his rapport with Grant with his integrity...an actually honest agent! How rare. The plot is simple to follow with few twists and turns, and the dialog sparkles. This film simply brings a smile to your face, and I wholeheartedly vouch that this is entirely worth the $9.50."

Drew Barrymore, sometimes sweet-unto-toxic, is actually delightful as a reluctant lyricist. <br/><br/>Could the editing have been crisper? Sure. Is the plot contrived? Definitely. But that's why it's a romantic comedy and not a documentary. Grant and Barrymore are incredibly likable individually, and reasonably believable as a romantic pairing.

","Alex (Hugh Grant) was a member of a popular eighties band called Pop. The group had a successful run but split when the man who wrote their songs' lyrics went solo. Now, Alex makes appearances at amusement parks and fairs, doing his old songs in front of fans that are growing older but are still adoring. Suddenly, his longtime agent gets a request from the hot-and-now girl of music, Cora; she wants Alex to write a new song, just for her. Seems Cora loved Pop and Alex when she was younger. The trouble is, Alex is a great composer but, by his own admission, a weak lyricist. When the new plant caretaker, Sophie (Drew Barrymore) arrives at his apartment, Alex is brainstorming with a gloomy lyrics writer, trying to get started on the new song called The Way Back Into Love. Sophie throws out a few possible verses, almost without realizing what she is doing. Alex immediately sees he has a chance to complete the song with her help. Will she do it? And, is there more a stir between the two of them than merely completing a song? This is a lovely, funny, and touching romantic comedy. Grant is a marvel as the aging star, not only because his humor is always charming but, also because he can sing well! Very well, as a matter of fact. Barrymore, who holds her own in the singing department, too, is likewise funny and sweet as the lady who finds the heart can open up again to possibilities. Campbell Scott, an always welcome performer, does a nice little turn as a dastardly former boyfriend of Sophie's. Then, too, newcomer Haley Bennett is a find as the young singer, Cora; she is lovely and sings like a lark. All of a movie's usual assets, such as nice costumes, good sets, and high production values, are present. On top of that, the music in the film is first rate. In fact, the main song, The Way Back Into Love, is beautiful and should be nominated for awards. Therefore, besides high tailing it to the movies to see this gem, stop at the music store on the way back home. You will really want the soundtrack resonating with you in the weeks and months ahead, too."

","It's a good twenty years since the Musical They'r Playing Our Song was produced on Broadway so most of the target audience for Music and Lyrics are unlikely to know it but Writer-Director Marc Lawrence would have been in his mid-twenties at the time and may well have seen the Show, a lightly-disguised story of the working and personal relationship between composer Marvin Hamlish and lyricist Careole Bayer Sager, kept it in the back of his mind until now and re-launched it as Music and Lyrics. They're Playing Our Song had a Book by Neil Simon, a tough act to follow and Lawreence's script doesn't even get close. On the other hand his two leads, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, know how to react when someone calls 'Action' so we wind up with a pleasant feel-good movie that's more than adequate if you only want to spend an hour or so being mildly amused.

Sorry, no dice.<br/><br/>They're bolstered by an excellent supporting cast - particular credits to Kristen Johnson as one of Grant's former fans who still carries a torch despite 20 years and 2.4 kids, Haley Bennett as a convincingly vapid pop superstar and plenty of well-worked bit-part players.<br/><br/>So - it's an unashamed rom-com, it is what it is, and it'll leave you feeling happy and unchallenged. There's nothing wrong with a good 80s tune and similarly with this flick - although, like the tunes, in 20 years time you won't remember it until someone brings it up."

","You can read others' reviews for details, but the bottom line is that I had low expectations of this film, and ended up enjoying it very much. My wife wanted to see this on Valentines Day, and we were not at all disappointed. <br/><br/>Far from a great film, it is nonetheless entertaining and the plot didn't irritate me as much as I thought. You just have to accept certain things, i.e., it takes days to produce a huge concert at Madison Square Garden. Don't think too much and you will have fun. Hugh Grant is typical, as is Drew. We have seen them both before, and there are no surprises. Some poor-acting characters also did not distract from an otherwise nice night out. Brad Garret played a serious role, and we did take him seriously. Nice job!"

It feels like a light-hearted love story set to music. Surprisingly, pretty good music.<br/><br/>We both loved it, want the soundtrack, and recommend it highly.

","Hugh Grant is finished. This movie killed his career. He should never have taken the part. His bump and grind was pathetic at the beginning of the two-hour agony, and it was desperate at the end. Drew Barrymore --- why is she an actress? Her chin needs hours of work by the cameraman to reduce it, and her voice is, well, very ordinary. Her role as the cleaning lady was utterly unconvincing and her role as a songwriter was even worse. The big hit that Hugh and she wrote together would have failed even the very early screening rounds of Pop Idol in Grand Rapids. The movie's plot was so formulaic that it gave formulae a bad name. The only person who shone out in this picture was Haley Bennett --- she was electric! Why wasn't the film about HER? When the two heroes walked out of her party, I felt I was being dragged away from the action by two losers: horribly to pay for a ticket for such a feeling! Hugh's blathering rubbish about how wonderful the ""music industry"" is was just the very worst speech I have ever seen such an actor deliver. To think he achieved an Oxford degree to appear in this trash. Sad, sad, sad."

","The previews made this movie look really funny & cute. I was really disappointed when I watched the movie, as it was neither funny nor was it cute. The music was highly enjoyable, especially the music video for ""Pop, goes my heart"" as it really captured the 80s MTV era. Drew Barrymore's character was just plain awful. She rambles stupid things about nothing, acts nutty in a way that seems to make her try too hard to be endearing when she's anything but, and I chuckled one time during the entire film. Hugh Grant was delightful, the chick from Third Rock from The Sun was also fun to watch, but the talented Brad Garrett had very little to do in the movie & his presence was a waste of talent. The dialogue involving Hugh & Drew was very grating on the nerves as it was just so rambling, unfunny, and annoying.<br/><br/>Your best bet is to download the music and skip the film unless you're a die-hard Hugh Grant fan."

Now the premise doesn't seem all that far fetched, after all. Hugh's and Drew's fine singing voices were a pleasant surprise, too. I advise everyone to see this movie at least twice.

","I personally quite like Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, so was looking forward to this film. Music and Lyrics is not a masterpiece I admit, having a predictable story, somewhat ho-hum middle act and an uneven pace(meandering a bit in the middle). However, it is a strikingly filmed movie, the scenery is lovely and the photography is good enough, and the soundtrack is sweet and beguiling. I quite liked the script, not award-worthy by all means, but funny in places poignant in others, and the acting which succeeds in being both corny and touching. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are quite good in their roles, Grant giving the better performance of the two, and their chemistry is believable while not entirely sizzling. All in all, a nice movie while not mind-blowing, then again the film never tries to be any more than it is. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Hugh Grant has and could quite easily make films like this for the rest of his career. And to be fair to the man he does them well and they appeal to a wide audience. <br/><br/>This is a sharp and funny romantic comedy in which Grant is allowed freedom to do everything that he does so well. He has great romantic support from Drew Barrymore and the always welcome sight that is Brad Garrett who steals many a scene.<br/><br/>The music in which the film is set around is fine and although this film will never win any big time awards it remains a decent film that can be enjoyed by a large amount of people all over the world. It has a good heart and a message behind it.

"andrew_arblaster-1","8","1","3","7 December 2010"," Clever version of 'Sense and Sensibility'
","This enjoyable film is a modern-day version of Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility'. Drew Barrymore plays the Elinor part, and also really the Marianne part , too. So in her past relationship she was fooled and abandoned (too much sensibility, like Marianne in S&S), now she avoids her gift of poetry and is reluctant to use her newly discovered (by Alex Fletcher) gift for lyrics (too much sense, Elinor). In fact, when Sophie explains the relationship between the melody (sensibility) and lyrics (sense) to Alex, that is the key to the whole film. This great modern adaptation is supported by very clever comedy in the '80s style pop and in Haley Bennet's fine comedic version of Cora, and by well-written songs."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","3","2 August 2009"," Not quite romantic, but funny as hell.
","I am a fan of Hugh Grant films. From Notting Hill to Bridget Jones, i'm always willing to see a Grant film. Music and Lyrics is probably his best besides Love Actually. Grant plays Alex Fletcher, an aging popstar who is still performing but can't make anything new. He used to be in a band called Pop. One day he is called down to a recording studio to meet with Cora(Haley Bennet). Cora is pretty stupid. In the film she says stuff like "" I want to show you the roof it's upstairs"". She wants him to write something new. She also needs it to be done within a week. So Alex goes looking for song writers and finds one named Sophie(Drew Barrymore). She is a plant waterer with a troubled past. Music and Lyrics is a very funny film. I've laughed every time i've seen it. I'm not sure if the film is very romantic but I think Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are brilliant together. The film makes my favorites list. I left out a couple of people who are in it. Brad Garret form Raymond stars as Chris Reilly, Alex's manager. Who has a few funny lines. Also Kristen Johnson from Third rock from the Sun stars as Ronda, Sophie's sister, who was a very big fan of Pop. Do you know what's sad? I've seen this film so many times that I actually remember the characters names. Music & Lyrics is a ton of fun."
"emihaesaerts","8","1","3","1 March 2009"," To fall in love with the music and lyrics:
","I really loved the movie Music and Lyrics. I have first seen him on DVD, because I have heard from a lot of people that the movie was very good. When I saw him , I had to admit that nobody told me a lie. The theme is very actual, because now a days, everybody tries to write and sing a song. But the love between Sophie and Alex(the most important people of the movie) makes the film as good as he is. These 2 people work together because Alex have to make a song for a young singer Cora. Sophie helps him with the writing of the lyrics. The song they made called 'Way back into love'. <br/><br/>The songs which are used in the movie are very good. They can be songs you hear on the radio. The song in the beginning of the movie: Pop, goes my heart, is very funny. It took my attention immediately, and it made me also very curious about the rest of the movie. My expectations were completely fulfilled. I have to admit that maybe the movie is a little bit girly, but there are also boys who loved him. Maybe that was because Drew Barrymore plays the roll of Sophie. Or maybe because there was also Haley Bennett who played the roll of Cora, a very sexy singer. This was also very realistic. Because in the film they named: Justin Timberlake, Shakira, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, . These are contemporary singers. But maybe Cora wouldn't be so successful in real life, because she always says chanti,chanti, even if she don't know what it means. In the film she is a very spiritual girl, and all her songs goes about this. I think this movie can be an example for other singers who are ""has-beens"" just like Alex ( Played by Hugh Grant) who was very popular in the 80's in the film and who is doing a comeback with the support of Sophie. A comeback is always possible, the music of the past is still very hip and cool. Even I love music of the 80's and I am just a girl of 16 years old. The fact that Hugh Grant sings in the movie was for me a little bit surprising, but it was pretty good. So he was the perfect man for this roll. Even he is a little bit older, he is still handsome. <br/><br/>The plot of the film is maybe a little bit easy. Alex and Sophie had just before the big show of Cora a fight, and like in all the films, it comes always good. The way they result this, is beautiful but not 'wauw!'.<br/><br/>A good thing about the end is, when the names of everybody who worked on the film disappeared, you still see things and they give information about the future. That is something I really liked. <br/><br/>The film hasn't won an award, but he had 5 nominations. The film and actors were nominated for the awards: Artois (Best future film casting-comedy) , Blimp Award (Favorite female movie star Drew Barrymore) , Teen choice award ( choice movie: Chick Flick, choice movie: Liplock for Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant) and Young artist award (best performance in a future film for Jeremy Karson)<br/><br/>If I have to give points to this film, I would give him an 8. Like a already said , it is a very good film, I really like to see him. But he is not perfect. <br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everybody who wants to see a happy, funny , romantic film. It is actually a family film, everybody could see him. So if you don't know what to do, are you just want to have fun, see Music and Lyrics!!"

","I enjoyed this movie. It was different, creative, and funny. Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant did a good job in playing their characters. It's a different type of romance, it's comical at many points, and it also offers some insight on song-writing and being a performer in the music industry. So many romance/comedy movies are the same in that two people meet, start falling in love, then they get into a huge fight and break it off. Then at the end, the guy says something touching to the girl, they get back together and live happily ever after. This was different in the way that High Grant's character gets the girl in the end. It's always fun to watch a movie that's not so predictable and demonstrates some original thought."
"glcrumpacker","9","1","3","20 September 2008"," Brilliant.
","I completely wasn't ready to like this movie. I've been in the business of steadfastly disliking Hugh Grant, despite his endearing turn in Notting Hill, and the plot synopsis sounded gimmicky and not very promising.<br/><br/>What a pleasant surprise. For anyone who grew up listening to '80s music and watching '80s MTV videos, Hugh Grant's band Pop! is every '80s music cliché on earth brought charmingly to life. They're clearly channeling Wham! and doing a very entertaining job of it. The '80s music and dancing alone are worth the price of admission. Dead-on dancing, music videos and songwriting.<br/><br/>Apart from that, Drew Barrymore is always likable, and Hugh Grant refreshingly refrained from his usual hair-flopping, nervous-tic hand-wringing mannerisms. The guy has to be one hell of a good sport to have made this movie, and he nailed this character.<br/><br/>Even my husband loved it, and he hates chick movies. Do give it a look if it comes up on cable. It was surprisingly good."

The song that Hugh sang to Drew's character at the end makes me cry with joy every time I watch this - which is a lot! Bravo to the writers and songwriters for creating a very clever script (Hugh's character has some really funny lines and of course he pulls them off perfectly)and for writing such fabulous songs.

"scorpiofrenz","7","1","3","17 January 2008"," Melodious Romantic Comedy
","'Music and Lyrics' is a feel-good film. It has a decent amount of music, and romance, with a touch of comedy. The movie begins with a recital of a 80's band named ""POP!"", and the opening credits show their journey, and subsequent break up. Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is the composer of that band, and life takes a drastic turn after the band members part ways. Alex is still living on his past success, but unable to come up with newer songs due to his abysmal skills in writing lyrics. Enter Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), a plant lady turned writer, who teams up with Alex to come up with a new song for a hot teenage sensation's (Cora's) new album. The character of Cora really makes you realize how superficial the music industry of today is! The rest of the movie is typical; boy meets girl, they fall in love, then comes some drama, and finally a happy ending. However, there is something about this movie that makes you fall in love with it.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant looks as cute as ever, and has some really good one-liners. He is very convincing as the washed out icon of the 80'sand it is hilarious to see him shaking his hips, imitating the pop stars of those days! Drew Barrymore is as natural as it could get. Among the other actors, I thought Kristen Johnston, who played Rhonda (Sophie's sister) was really good, and so was Haley Bennett as Cora. The songs that stood out include ""Pop! Goes My Heart"", ""Way Back Into Love"" and ""Don't Write Me Off"".<br/><br/>All in all a very enjoyable movie, and I definitely don't regret buying the DVD!"

But........I loved it! From the opening credits with that cheesy but catchy tune and hilarious video, I was hooked. Hugh grant's one-liners are genuinely funny and there is a lot of chemistry between him and drew Barrymore(which is half the battle). Hugh's manager is very funny too, but Kiersten Johanson is off the scale. Its a sweet, unoffensive, genuinely funny and warm film. Watch it and I guarantee you'll come out smiling. In short: its a feel good movie."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","3","11 March 2007"," Adequate Friday Night Fluff
","I like Hugh Grant. He's unapologetically British and exudes a self deprecating wit in his screen roles that makes it almost impossible to criticize him. Whatever you could think of to say against him, I'm sure he's thought of it already and probably said it too. He does what he does; like him or leave him alone. And in this movie, I liked what he did quite a lot. I presume the movie was written for him, because it would be absolutely nothing without him.<br/><br/>Music and Lyrics is a reasonable Friday Night Movie. Entertaining in a very accessible way but not actually brain dead. It is not terribly original, and is more than a little clichéd, but contains enough good one-liners to make the audience laugh aloud, and I certainly left the cinema feeling I'd had my money's worth - although I'd be the first to admit it wasn't an especially intellectual two hours. But, as I've said in these reviews several times before, what more do you really need after a tough week at work? Grant plays an aging rocker (Alex Fletcher) from a once fashionable 80's pop band. He now makes a modest but adequate living playing gigs at theme parks and high school reunions, while being mobbed by middle aged women. (Predictably the girl he hooks up with is much, much younger of course.) When the movie begins we see him being induced to take part in a new TV show, Battle of the 80's Has-Beens. Fletcher points out helpfully, that as his last hit was in 1990 he is, strictly speaking, a 90s Has-Been, thus setting the scene for a movie full of gentle self mockery. The problem is that the TV Exec takes the ""Battle"" part of the title literally and plans on pitting the now middle aged pop stars against each other in the boxing ring. Fletcher isn't quite that desperate yet, although the TV show is a running gag throughout the film. His agent Chris Riley (entertainingly played by Brad Garrett) wants him to take it.<br/><br/>Out of the blue he finds himself with an opportunity to write a song for a new star, a young, nubile popster Cora Corman played by Haley Bennett (who is simply drop dead gorgeous.) Our hero can write music but not lyrics. Enter stage left one Sophie Fisher (rather inadequately played by Drew Barrymore doing cute and fluffy yet again. I like Drew Barrymore, but I found her unconvincing here) posing as a plant waterer, who just happens to be a poet. A fairly predictable romance occurs, and after a few pitfalls, they all live happily ever after. Ever grateful for small mercies, I'm at least glad the script didn't call for Grant to hook up with the barely legal Corman. The running gag about hip replacements was slightly overdone. I mean this guy is supposed to be in his late 40's not his 80's.<br/><br/>What makes the movie worth watching are the cringe-inducing scenes of Grant, as an 80's hipster - with a dreadful hairstyle and matching wardrobe - prancing around with his band, and also the reasonably witty dialog. Those of us who were around and semi-adult in the 80's have a lot to answer for. Was it really as bad as this? Some of the jokes are passably funny, and both my 50-something husband and 16 year old son enjoyed it more than I thought they would. Sample dialog; Alex (humming song melody) ""I've been sleeping with a clown above my bed"". Sophie; ""Clown? Clown? It's CLOUD! Why would you sleep with a clown above your bed?"" Alex; ""It wouldn't be the first time, trust me."" And so on. All good clean fun, and you'd have to be a Spartan not to crack a smile. Which brings me onto this week's movie. But that's enough for here and now. Music and Lyrics works at a certain minimal level. Just don't expect too much."

","I wasn't expecting much when I went to the theaters to see this movie. The only reason I watched this was because I was bored to death, there were no other movies and because of Drew Barrymore's acting.(I loved her in her previous film 'Fever Pitch'.) Hugh Grant was a good actor, but every time I see him on screen, I keep thinking about Daniel Cleaver.(the character that he plays in Bridget Jones Diary) All my prejudices were blown away after I saw this movie.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a washed up singer Alex Fletcher(Hugh Grant),who was a legendary singer in the 80s,yet now makes his living by singing in amusement parks, reunions and so on. He is surprised when his manager Chris tells him that the hit teen idol Cora Corman(Haley Bennett)is a huge fan of his, and wants to do a song with him. There is only one catch. He must write the song himself and in three days! Alex, who is gifted in composing but not in writing lyrics, enlists the help of Sophie Fischer(Drew Barrymore), a gifted lyricist who comes to water his plants.............<br/><br/>People who disliked this movie attacked it by saying that it's a cliché movie and that somebody who looks like a grandpa(meaning Hugh Grant)is still doing lead roles while he should let the new generation rise. Well, I say, who cares? I mean sure Hugh may be a bit old and wrinkly, but it's not like he does a 30year old handsome virgin. He plays his age. And about the cliché thing, I mean, the story is a bit predictable,but does the story have to be new even if the old ones are still good? I mean, there are plenty of movies that have new topics that I found distasteful.(for example, Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's Babel and the controversial Korean military film, The Unforgiven.)<br/><br/>Overall, great acting,good story and splendid music. A must see so I'm giving it a 10."

If you are looking for a romance-comedy this is definitely the one to see.

"bopdog","6","1","3","12 February 2007"," Implausible fluff, mere candy floss, but sweet and enjoyable!
","This is a surprisingly average movie, with an implausible plot, and a dodgy set-up that would flop miserably in other hands. As it is, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are likable stars, and Haley Bennett, the young newcomer who plays the ""world's number one pop diva,"" the Cora Corman character, is very apt for the part. She's perky, wickedly innocent, and out-Britneys Britney herself. She's what Britney Spears USED to be, years ago. Overall, is was rather lame and kind of stupid, but enjoyable in a ""two-hours of escapist fluff"" kind of way. As nice as candy-floss (cotton candy), which has its place. Although I did not for one minute believe the pop-singer voice dubbed in for High Grant was really he!<br/><br/>(It remains to be seen if Miss Bennett's career ever goes anywhere, or if the pop star glam in this flick was just a veneer that wears off in the first wash.)<br/><br/>One of the things ""Music & Lyrics"" brings up is the weird real-world of pop stardom and 'celeb' status anyway. Here in the UK, entire TV series are devoted to endless tripe about nobodies who somehow got to be called 'celebrities' for a few weeks. And even with those with an ostensible 'talent', such as pop-singing, one must ask oneself: Why is one singer or act famous, and another yesterday's news?<br/><br/>That's a rhetorical question, of course. It certainly seems that the way the real-life Britney Spears and Madonnas get to be number one, famous, and so rich, is as much a result of pure luck and marketing as anything else. One likes to think there was a day, back in the 60s and 70s, perhaps, when true artistry was a prerequisite for celebrity. True, many real geniuses did not make it, and the coffee houses and Denny's (in the US) are filled with thousands of nice folks with real talent who have stories about how they 'almost' made it, but ended up ordinary, like the rest of us. Many great artists still can't make it today, too--- but blame the Fates, or karma, or Mega-Global-Com Inc.<br/><br/>But wasn't it that way, once? You know--- when the vast majority of those who made it big and got famous had real talent? Or is that merely my nostalgic imagination? Anyway--- 'Music & Lyrics' reminded me of all of that. And middle aged Hugh Grant was believable as a self-described ""80s has-been"", and Drew Barrymore was charming and sweet. Although, to be honest, her plant-nanny character's instant lyrics and song skills resembled the advertising jingles continually cooked up on the old 60s TV show, 'Bewitched'. Barrymore reminded me more than once of Bewitched's hapless Darren Stevens, at the phony and clichéd McMahon & Tate Advertising Agency. Oh well."

Yes, it was a v v nice theme park. Yes, yes, New York is such a nice town -- but, argh! -- enough of the ads, ya' know? Never mind. Not quite as neurotic as As Good As It Gets.

You have Hugh Grant as a washed up 80's pop star trying to make a comeback, and by happens chance he meets a NYC freelance plant waterer who's played by Drew Barrymore and slowly the two hit things off. The Barrymore character helps out by working with an upcoming teen pop princess, who has lyrics to help out as the Grant character just needs to supply the music to make a hit comeback. Mostly thru this movie isn't just really about the music business even though it ends with a produced hit, it's a movie of a relationship that grows into love and caring from two characters that were down on their luck.

I have to admit I was in complete and utter shock but it was probably one of the most exciting things that's happened to me in quite some time. After we were done dancing, he pushed me toward the back of the stage, and then he followed. Now, considering my biggest dream since I was even able to dream was to make it as an actress, little stunned me was thinking: This must be it, it has to be it, this is great, but did I make a fool outta myself, Did i dance good; I can implement Hugh into my 'thanks for the award' speech (that I practice almost ritually after every time I drink more than two glasses of wine) :-) Say something Rose, say anything, stop standing there awkwardly in front of him like a little girl; Dammit Speak Rose! Now, instead of saying something wonderfully clever like ""Isn't this the part where you kiss me??"" Something else just happens to come out of mouth.....REady.....Brilliant me....I say: ""Do you have any water back here"" Yea real nice. He just said something like no sorry only one thats half drunk...and than momentarily stupid me just walks away!!! I was mad at myself the whole rest of the day.<br/><br/>Now, I don't think the reports of him being drunk during this scene were true, though, because he didn't smell like alcohol, (but his goofy stand-in did), and there was no space between our bodies while we were dancing ;-) so i would've smelled it, but if I had even the slightest idea that the half drunk water bottle we so 'romantically' spoke about contained whiskey, than I would've honestly downed it in order to alleviate ruining the closest thing to a break I've ever had. Granted I am only 19, but I can act my way into and out of anything remarkably, but the industry is tough and I couldn't afford going all over the place to audition or anything. I was so bummed after the production was over, but it definitely was a good time; THe movie was filmed really close to where I grew up. I just wish I had been prepared for Hugh. You can see me in that scene for about 30 seconds all the way to the right. YOu can also see me at the coliseum in the end of the movie. I am sitting right next to where drew stops walking to turn around and see Hugh singing. Go see this movie, you'll be glad you did, and sad when it's over."

Sophie agrees to co-write with Alex and the two have problems with a final verse...until they fall in love. Predictable and pretty bland; I expect more of Miss Barrymore.

","I went to this movie with extremely high expectations. I'm a big romcom buff and I loved hugh's movies in general. I was expecting a really big comeback. This movie, I think is safe to say, one of the worst written movies in Hollywood history. What started out as an insanely clever idea of an 80's icon trying to make a return, suffered incredible horrid writing. Lots of weird things like, why she was acting weird at the beginning of the movie, her being a germ-o-phobe, why she didn't confront that guy she hated, in addition to many other problem and plot loopholes, completely destroyed what could've become a brilliant romcom. Drew Berrymore is a horrible actress who should stick to silly kung-fu movies. She was cute at the beginning of her career but is just getting progressively worse in each and every movie she does. Plus, I think that everybody's willing to give her second chances given her ET role and she's using that. I think hugh grant's performance was really good, but he needed a good supporting actress to complement his own acting. You cant build a movie around one single event except if you know how it'll progress, and in this movie, they don't know how it progress, they just fill it with lame jokes and sentences like...""that song was dinner""..oh god! what kind of writing is this? I personally was compelled to leave the movie after half an hour but stayed to watch how they'll completely ruin a movie that I really was hoping could cheer me up.<br/><br/>Finally, I just have to say that I thought the songs were really really good. This is the only upside of the movie...the soundtrack!"

","I'm surprised how many people really like this movie. I love Drew Barrymore and I still do. I think she gave her all in the part, as she usually does. However the rest of the movie was lacking. This girl who plays Cora was plain awful. I couldn't believe she was cast. She's supposed to play a teen pop star who is on par with Shakira and Britney, but she had absolutely no energy. No emotion. Her acting was just embarrassing and blase, like she was reciting lines. And her ""dancing"" was just moving her hips which I guess was supposed to look seductive and somewhat like Shakira? Didn't work for me. Not a bad singer though, and I was surprised at how good Hugh Grant's voice was. I did however like how it made fun of the industry and I guess that was the point with this girl. The plot was not too bad. The whole plant waterer thing is a little unbelievable, but not as unbelievable as the chemistry between Hugh and Drew. It worked for awhile, but as their relationship in the storyline was developing I didn't see it grow between the two of them. It was like Barrymore was trying, but Grant wasn't. They seemed like good friends who perhaps had a one night stand, but it would never develop into something more. Which according the scenes that play during the credits it was a romantic relationship. So if you're looking for a light fun movie and want to end up with a catchy tune in your head you may enjoy it. But if you like quality go see something else."

The only other movie that I enjoyed this much, this season was ""Volver"" with Penelope Cruz. Both movie were worth the money! It made me think that it is still possible to make good music, and watching Hugh Grant dance, and been able to see his botton is really a nice change. Who invented the fashion that no one can see men's figure anymore is just a person without a body sense, the same way a man likes to see women's figure, a woman like to see a man's silluete as well.

","What a cute movie. Unfortunately, that's the best I can come up with. The plot is contrived, the editing choppy, and the direction lackluster. While I love Hugh Grant, he's been playing the same character for some years now, and unfortunately is beginning to look his age. I couldn't help but being a little creeped out at the fact that he was smooching on Drew Barrymore, who is 15 years his junior. Ms. Barrymore is starting to fall into the same trap, playing the same character with the same quirks. I know that both of these actors are talented and capable of so much more. Haley Bennett, who plays the Shakira/Kylie Minogue wannabee is certainly beautiful to look at. Let's just hope she enrolls in some good acting classes and begins vocal coaching with someone who knows what they are doing. The true stand-outs in this film are Brad Garrett as Alex's (Mr. Grant) manager, and Kristen Johnston as Sophie's (Ms. Barrymore) older sister. Mr. Garrett, best known for his work in the long-running sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and Ms. Johnston, best known for her work in ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" were both delightful and brought much needed comic relief."

In 2 separate scenes the microphone was clearly visible in the top of the frame. People in the cinema were laughing because as Drew and Hugh walk down a Manhattan street there is a grey fluffy microphone between them pointing at whoever was speaking.<br/><br/>I think the editor realizing this was a bust gave up and could not be bothered to edit out the errors......what a pity that Hugh Grant didn't take a similar path and avoid this miserable excuse for a movie."

The presence of Kristen Johnston and Brad Garrett could not save this. Even they had no funny moments, which makes one wonder if the screenwriters went out of their way to make this boring. The screenwriters seemed to be in a competition with the songwriters for the worst writing. Both lacked any originality, both had nothing to grab you.

He has a very thin voice, absolutely no rhythm, and can't dance. He has all the funny lines, but he delivers them like he is phoning them in from the set of another movie. He is way past the moment when he last did something original on screen.<br/><br/>Same can be said for the talentless Ms. Barrett. You couldn't stack her up against the cheapest Brittney imitator and believe she is the biggest pop star in the world.<br/><br/>You can't name a movie ""Music and Lyrics"" without having some wonderful original songs, produced well, and sung by talented people (or at least people who know how to sell a song).

"lossowitz","5","0","1","25 August 2012"," Creativity and popularity
","""No pets or children"" sounds a guideline for filmmakers, and for screenwriters it should be: ""no creative problems or stage careers as a theme"". Only a biopic can portray stage scenes and popularity on a level that is believable, just because that is what the audience knows about the subject: yes, this star was popular.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is arguably a love story, but with the title Music and Lyrics, the creative process of writing is at the center of the tale. From the start the love affair of the ex-POP! singer Hugh Grant and the wannabe writer Drew Barrymore follows the road of the romantic comedy, albeit that they need to ""write the music and lyrics of their love themselves"". There we have the first problem: any depiction of a creative process becomes tiresome, regardless of the many dead pan jokes Hugh Grant gets to make. Watching people try to rhyme or look for a song idea is watching... people try to rhyme or look for a song idea. It is like watching people work.<br/><br/>Then we have the performances of the movies superstar Cora, which should be valued somewhere between Britney and Christina: but how on earth do you simulate a big, expensive, explosive pop concert without doing exactly that: staging a big, expensive, explosive concert? Well, you do it slightly cheaper, smaller and, not so explosive. And it shows. Yes, there is a large Buddha from where Cora emerges, but would Britney or Christina put up a whole show with just one large Buddha on stage? Ten different Buddhas maybe, and a pyramid, and a temple and a burning sky scraper. The audience knows what a superstar concert looks like, and is not easily convinced. <br/><br/>The actors give it their best shot, and some even succeed, but all in all this is a perfect example for how a screenwriter best avoids depicting fictional popular concerts, and showing the process of creativity. They're implausible and tiresome, and both traits are ill- fated for a commercial movie, which a rom-com, with all its rules and clichÃ©s, is."

","This is the fourth time I see the comedy romance movie Music and Lyrics, but this is the first time I actually see it to write about the movie. For me, it was a pleasure watching this movie all over again, since comedy romance films are my favorite and, I consider myself a big fan of Drew Barrymore. I have seen most of her movies I love the way she acts ""sweet and innocent"" when it comes to comedy romance films. This American actress has not only started in over 50 movies, including a commercial for puppy food at the age of 11 months in 1975, becoming one of Hollywood's most recognized child actors, but also in the 1980s hit movie ""ET"". She has directed, screen written, produced, and model on several occasions. What I most liked about this movie in particular is that destiny was the cause of joining ""Hugh Grant"" as Alex Fletcher and ""Drew Barrymore"" as Sophie Fisher. On the other hand, we have Hugh Grant, an English actor and film producer who had his first leading role in 1987 in the movie, ""Maurice"". His break through performance though was in the 1994 film ""Four Wedding's and a Funeral"". Since then, he has started in over 30 films including my favorite ""Nine Months"" from 1995.<br/><br/>The writer of this movie is Mark Lawrence, who himself directed the film in 2007. Marc Lawrence also composed a sound track for this movie titled ""Love Autopsy"". It's a short comic sound track, but it gives the film a very special touch. Lawrence has both written and produced movies like ""Two Weeks Notice"" (2002), and ""Did You Hear about the Morgan's?"" (2009) both in which ""Grant"" has started as the main character. Both these films are from the genre, comedy romance. This American screenwriter and film producer has also written films such as ""The Out-of-Towners"" (1999), ""Miss. Congeniality"" (2000) and ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous"" (2005). His most recent movie is ""Music and Lyrics"" (2007).<br/><br/>This film first came to the big screen on February 14, 2007. If I would've seen it on that date, I would've expected nothing less from this comedy romantic story. Like Tom Long from the Detroit News said, ""Every valentines day should be blessed with a confection as fluffy, light and satisfying as Music & Lyrics, a cute movie filled with laughs and tunes and nothing too terribly serious to say"". I couldn't agree with him more, these two characters, Grant as Alex Fletcher and Barrymore as Sophie Fisher live an adventure which at the end leads them to fall in love with each other. Even though it seems as just another love story, I perceived this love story very different from others that I have seen. I think this story was very original and not repetitions of other movies in which they only change the characters, but the story line is pretty much the same. This film brought back fond memories from my childhood in the 80's. I couldn't help but to go back in time and realize how much things have changed; from our cloths, music, and style of dancing. I must admit, it was a fun journey.<br/><br/>Stephen Hunter from the Washington Post says, ""I don't think the ending is up to the rest of the movie, but Grant and Barrymore are great together, and the movie has both, zing and song"". I agree with Hunter, when you have two very talented actors like Grant and Barrymore you can't help but have a great movie, but ending with the song that they both wrote was a must. The song played a crucial role but ending with this romantic melody titled ""Way Back in Love"" gave the movie the final twist. Like in any movies when you have a man, and a woman faced with a problem, falling in love is inevitable. What gives this movie the perfect ending is the song they wrote together because that's exactly what happens with Fletcher and Fisher; they fall in love all over again."

Competent at writing jingletunes,Mr Grant is at a loss for words,figuratively,when Miss Drew Barrymore comes into his life. Able to toss off a snappy lyric at will she helps him write a song for Miss Bennett that will make them rich and famous and kickstart his comeback. Miss Barrymore bears an unfortunate resemblance to a coy Stephen Fry - now that's an oxymoron for you - but that doesn't stop old Hugh from falling for her in his stammering ineffectual way. She has musical integrity but he has his snout deep in the trough. Rodgers and Hart they ain't. As usual in a Hugh Grant movie,nobody in it bears any resemblance to any real human being that ever drew breath,but if you accept that as a given and are feeling particularly uncritical you can let it all wash over you and come out the other side without having engaged either heart or brain.As usual in a Hugh Grant movie"

From the opening credits I was laughing so hard as it reminded me of the 80s English boy band Wham with George Micheal and Hugh Grant who is in this movie sings a parody called Pop goes my heart from a boy band that Hugh's character was in years ago.<br/><br/>The movie is about a washed singer/songwriter who is desperate to write a song for a young singer. Problem is he hasn't a clue what to write and with the help of a young woman who waters his plants the two begin to write music and (yes folks) love blossoms between the two.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this film is that Hugh Grant is without a doubt the worst actor of our time. He can hardly act or sing right and his chemistry with Drew was kinda dull. Every time I watch this film I feel like I'm reliving the 1998 Rom Com The Wedding Singer which starred Drew Barromore with Adam Sandler.

","I had a vague idea of what to expect with the plot, and I knew the two leads, so I had to give it a chance and ignore the two star rating by the critics. Basically Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is the washed up member of 80's pop boy band PoP! now living a comfortable life in New York performing his old hits in theme parks, state fairs and dinner parties to survive. But then he gets the chance to really get his career back when reigning teen idol (obvious inspired by Shakira) singer and dancer Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) wants him to write a new song titled ""A Way Back Into Love"". He can do the music and melodies no problem, but he is not an inspired lyricist, and then he happens on the inspiration of poet Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who comes round (temporarily) to water his plants. After eventually, the quick witted Sophie and Alex start to write what could be the perfect ballad, and in the process they also fall in love with each other. After Cora has approved the song, calling it the perfect song for her, she gives ideas for her interpretation of it, mixing an Indian style or something to it, which Sophie dislikes completely, and obviously Alex does as well, but he doesn't want to ruin the whole deal for business (and his career), so Sophie leaves him. So it comes to the big night when Cora is in concert, and Sophie's sister Rhonda (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me's Kristen Johnston) has insisted she come, as she did write the song, but instead of singing the song they wrote, Alex wins Sophie back with his own song he managed to write, and Cora does sing their song in the way intended. Also starring Brad Garrett as Chris Riley - Alex's agent, Campbell Scott as Sloan Cates and Scott Porter as Colin Thompson. I have to confess that quite a bit of me liked this film for its cheesiness, and I'm a sucker for pop songs like those featured in the film, their good and catchy fun. Anyway, Grant and Barrymore make quite a good couple, and there are some giggly moments, I can't see all the reasons why the film is two stars, but I can't say it's a brilliant romantic comedy. Okay!"

A washed-up '80s pop singer (Grant) is asked to write a song for a Britney-type pop star. Problem is, he only writes melodies, no lyrics. Along comes Drew B. as a cute-as-s-button fill-in greenskeeper who comes up with catchy lyrics on the spot. What a team they make!

","The film industry has become polarized in recent years. If you don't want a sweeping epic of a Titanic or a Legends of The Fall or even an Atonement you've got to settle for a very formulaic ""commonly popular male lead with the rising female(s) du jour"" and this film is exactly that. In much the same way the industry threw Sandra Bullock hastily into schlock fests with Leary, Connick Jr. and the elder Affleck, Hugh Grant is getting the same treatment. A man who once claimed to retire himself completely from movies instead of making more of these films is back at it like a former drug addict sprinting towards the nearest known dealer once out of rehab.<br/><br/>The bright and shining star of this movie is how well developed Grant's character actually is. Complete with a faux 80's band even Garth Brooks would envy, he sells his character well as a battered and tired 80s has-been from the first moments of the film. Any child of the 80s can envision him as a member of any number of hit and run synthesizer bands. It's no shocker that the architect of the music and style of The Wonders from Hanks' ""That Thing You Do!"" is also the designer of this 80's pop band. Sadly, despite a beautiful and believable construction, the band is just a setup and we never see the dynamics of The Wonders or the 80s 'metal'/'hairband' conglomerate, Steel Dragon, from the underrated and forgotten ""Rock Star"".<br/><br/>Sadly, the first half of the film with Grant is the lone shining star. Barrymore deliver a half-hearted performance whose character lacks depth, especially after a pointless and unamusing 'tragic' backstory is added. In an attempt to add a tragedy to her past to make her connect with Grant's has-been 80s failure, they reached too far and fell flat on their faces. Garrett is not believable as an agent but thankfully is not as terrible as his turn in ""The Pacifier"". But he can't even approach the role as well as Bryan Cranston did in Little Miss Sunshine. The real pain was Kristen Johnston. In every scene I wondered if they somehow couldn't book Jennifer Coolidge instead. Johnston's older, former 80s boyband obsessed sister was dreadful. One had to wonder if she even watched Bonnie Hunt's similar turn in Jerry Maguire beforehand.<br/><br/>The film sadly has a well designed and prepared backstory for its male lead but falls apart at the seams everywhere else. The romance is not dutifully sold or believable. The suppoirting cast does a terrible job filling roles, so much so that it seems like they must have been the last choices available to fill the spots(former sitcom supporting cast, are you kidding me?). The evolution, the flow, and the credibility fall apart as the film goes on. What this film really needed was to add even more depth to Grant's character, especially with regards to Scott Porter's barely used but oft-mentioned character, through some extra scenes. In the mean time dropping the 'tragic novelist plot line.<br/><br/>To put the movie in the perspective of its title, the melody is predictable, the hook and chorus swet but boring, and the composition falls apart a third of the way into the song."

","I know this was not a big commercial success, and perhaps the reason is because it was so light-hearted. It was just plain fun, not too over the top, a great way to spend a evening. So, maybe it didn't break any box office records, but in the rental market, this should do great.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is a great romcom actor. As he says, he can only do 3-4 expressions, but, he does them better than anybody else. He is the perfect age to play the character in this film, and the fact that he is actually singing makes it that much better.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore must be a born optimist, because that charming smile seems so real, and it never wears thin. <br/><br/>As others have detailed the plot on these pages, I'd just like to say that if you enjoy romcoms, and you want a sweet, lighthearted way to spend the evening, I just can't imagine that you'd be disappointed. Drew and Hugh seem like a perfectly logical combination and I really, truly wanted them to not only get married in the film, but in real life, too."

","This movie was mildly amusing. I like the way Hugh Grant delivers his dry satirical lines. But he and Drew Barrymore do not belong together on screen. They had no chemistry. First, he is much older than her and British. They just don't make a cute couple, which is number one priority of a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Grant, playing 80s pop star, Alex Fider, makes the most of his character. It is funny when he sings these simple pop songs in his tight pants and all the middle age women go wild.<br/><br/>I also liked Cora Corman, whom is a Britany Spears type of pop star, whom portrays her shows around Buddism and sticky and steamy dancing. Some of the lyrics to her songs were funny, ie toward the end when we here some of Slam and Entering Bootytown. And Cora's first performance of the song Alex and Sophie wrote for her was pretty outrageous.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Liked the music but the casting was off. So, I say watch it if you like movies involving lots of music and singing; otherwise skip it."

","This movie is only really worth six out of 10 but I'm giving it seven to make up for pre- judging it! I mean, what's not to pre-judge? Hugh Grant. Drew Barrymore. Dopey rom-com. Happy ending. But I guess it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it (the mantra on which Grant seems to have built his entire career). However, just as in Miss Congeniality, Marc Lawrence manages to take high-concept crap and turn it into a good night out at the movies. Hugh and Drew bounce off each other, with greater honours going to Hugh Grant for his total lack of ego in even considering a role where he's made to look so hilariously stupid. The plot is not important (which is lucky cos it's fluffy rubbish), but the leads - ably supported by Brad Garrett, Kristen Johnston and Hayley Bennett - just careen about having a great time with some very funny lines and scenes. The movie even manages to make a point by popping (no pun intended) the bubble of pretension that means some people look down on the creators of three-minute singles. Sure, you wouldn't want to be photographed coming out of this movie, but at least if you do it will probably be with a silly grin on your face."
"Ginger16","8","0","1","19 July 2007"," An enjoyable surprise
","I was surprised how much I enjoyed ""Music and Lyrics."" My daughter had rented it the night before and quite liked it, so I offered to return it for her which gave me the chance to see it too. Hugh Grant gets better and better, and although this movie at first seems a stretch for him, he's perfectly believable as a piano-playing composer, singer, and dancer on stage. He plays a has-been from the 1980s who can't write music anymore unless somebody else writes the lyrics first. This character is ideal for Grant's self-deprecating style that we recognize from earlier movies. It works well for him because anyone this handsome needs to be somewhat self-deprecating for the average moviegoer to give a hoot and identify! Drew Barrymore is the female lead and a good match for Grant; they obviously have chemistry and she shares his very special ability to be funny, sexy and vulnerable, all at the same time. (In fact, I'm sure the director of ""Music and Lyrics"" was thinking ""Cary Grant and Carole Lombard"" when he cast them together.) Also outstanding is the young woman who plays Corrie (sp?, the pop star who commissions Grant to write her a new song. (This is where Barrymore comes in, when he discovers her talent for writing lyrics.) The actors who play his agent and her sister deserve special mention also; their presence in this movie is a bonus.<br/><br/>So ""Music and Lyrics"" has an acceptable story and a well-chosen cast; what it needed in addition was good music--and here, IMHO, it really scores! I would see this movie again and enjoy it just as much, so I might even buy the DVD. War and Peace it ain't, but it's a feel-good movie with humor, style, likable characters and a tuneful soundtrack. It's also a great antidote to the evening news :) ."

The chemistry between the main characters was nice and it just seemed like everyone was having so much fun throughout the movie I couldn't help but share in their excitement. I was also impressed with all the hard work put into this film - you wouldn't have guessed that Hugh Grant wasn't musical before this movie, the 80s video looked hysterically authentic, and there was not just one new/old hit for PoP written for the movie.

Here's what I thought: It is romantic-""ish"", light, frothy, immensely funny and we DID end up humming the POP song.<br/><br/>But who cares about script depth or goofs?. It is a brilliant critique of today's over-sexed, new age type of artists, and of my generation's (I was born in 1970) and today's annoying and silly idolizing of goof-balls whose only merit is looking sexy and somewhat singing what merchandising has declared the latest ""music"" (for lack of a better word).<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed the ridiculous behavior and demeanor of CORA (Brilliantly brought to life by Haley Bennet) that has become the tell-tale sign of today's star singers (?) Hugh Grant's Character is very well put together, complete with that ""older-than-his-actual-age"" look that somebody who has burnt the candle form both ends one too many times would have. And his one liners are exactly on time and with the perfect intonation to make audiences roar with laughter.<br/><br/>More than a romantic comedy, I would classify this movie as social comment that just so happens to be tremendously hilarious, which can only mean that society today is tremendously hilarious.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it (I think that's the fourth time I say it) even without the pseudo-intellectual comment. The story in its own right is enough to make the watching of this movie a pleasure, but the authors did not leave it at that, they really went the whole way and ridiculed the whole industry in a very non-subtle yet charming way."

"mcsheehey","6","0","1","20 June 2007"," A Pleasant Surprise
","Let me begin by saying that ""Music and Lyrics"" is by no means an Oscar-caliber film in any way. However, it is a charming and rather humorous film that both girls and guys can find something to like in. Hugh Grant is (for once) perfectly cast as Alex Fletcher, an 80s ""has-been"" who is asked by a hot young pop star, Cora, to write a song for the two of them to sing. After having a failed meeting with a professional lyricist, Alex enlists the help of a young ""substitute plant lady,"" played by Drew Barrymore, who turns out to be a born lyricist. His music and her lyrics meld together, as the title implies, to create a great new hit. Of course, we also see a romance spring up between the two leading characters, and we get a few small sub-plots to fill up the rest of the film. The acting is very good overall, and the delivery of some of the more entertaining lines is very funny. We also get a hilarious music video at the start of the film from Fletcher's former pop duo group. <br/><br/>There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, but the film is not hilarious. It is, however, very enjoyable to watch and ranks very high amongst most modern romantic comedies. It's not fantastic, but it's very pleasant."

I also quite like Drew Barrymore, so this was a good film to sit back and just let it wash over you. I don't think I'd be giving the plot away if I said it follows the usual rom-com formula.

","Based around the rather flimsy premise that a musician falls into a state of creative desperation that a thesaurus couldn't fix whenever he has to come up with a new single, ""Music and Lyrics"" stars Hugh Grant as a has-been writer and Drew Barrymore as an aspiring writer who through happenstance circumstances, team up to write a song that could put them on the map.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays his witty self in Alex Fletcher, with the exception that his character is actually surprisingly convincing as a pop star. He delivers those one-liners that can single-handedly deliver a movie like ""Two Weeks Notice,"" with a little less frequency than what might have let this movie get by on humor alone. Drew Barrymore, as slogan-writer Sophie Fisher enters Alex's life as her plant lady (is there a such thing as a plant lady?). When he discovers her talents for rhyming, he recruits her to help write lyrics for a teen pop star who gives him a chance at a comeback. The pop star is played by Haley Bennett who as a parody of the empty spiritualism of Hollywood is one of the best parts of the movie. The film isn't funny enough to recommend as a pure comedy and while Grant mixes it up a little, Barrymore doesn't do anything she hasn't done before here. Still the script manages to stay intelligent and natural enough that it keeps the film afloat. Even before Alex and Sophie get romantically involved, their characters are interesting enough for us to want to know more about them and their interactions are too.<br/><br/>I ultimately gave this movie 2 1/2 stars (or 5 out of 10) because it dragged on a little long in the middle. I would categorize it as decent."

Sometimes the dialog seems very artificial and far from every day life, which really takes the fun away from the film. I really liked the performance by Haley Bennett, she is very impressive with her dance moves and her egoistic attitude which her character displays.

","My parents love Hugh Grant's acting. Though I have not seen any off his movies, I decided to see this one.<br/><br/>The movie started off with a song and my god, the song was so long that I felt that I made an error getting this film. Still, I decided to see it as in Hindi films, the songs are longer than this.<br/><br/>I felt that the songs of this movie weren't so good and special as I expected as from the name of the movie itself, I thought that the songs would be out of the world. But I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Let's first talk about the acting:<br/><br/>1) Hugh Grant: I did not find his performance even that good. Seeing his face made me doze off a bit as his eyes were so drooping all the time. I expected a lot more from him. It should have been more powerful and even his emotions should have been more deep. Making a sad face doesn't mean that the person is really sad. In acting, when you are supposed to be sad, you should feel the role and then only the performance would look real. Hugh Grant's performance was a bit loose.<br/><br/>2) Drew Berrymore: She acted terribly in the first part. She was expressionless and looked so clumsy. Her acting was better in the second half where she had to play a much challenging role.<br/><br/>3) Brad Garrett: I liked his acting as it was not too much over acting nor it looked stupid. He had not even that much of a role and whatever role he had, he played it fine.<br/><br/>4) Kristen Johnson: Her performance was good in the first half where she had to play a funny sister but in the second half, she looked so blank. She looked too bit to play Drew Berrymore's sister.<br/><br/>5) The world famous singer in the film whose name I don't know: She was wooden, expressionless and horrible in acting. She was not at all funny as she was supposed to be and comparing her with Britney Spears was silly.<br/><br/>The movie was stupid in the first half where there was nothing so much but it became better in the second half where there was a twist.

","Putting Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore together in a film seems odd. It's hard to see the potential spark that could ignite between these two and the movie ""Music and Lyrics"" (directed by Marc Lawrence, ""Two Weeks Notice"" and ""Miss Congeniality"") added nothing to change my mind.<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is an aging 80's musician living in the upscale New York area. His career has been reduced to mediocre shows at amusement parks and high school reunions. Needless to say this career path is barely satisfying. Fletcher gets a break when his agent Chris Riley (Brad Garrett, Everybody Loves Raymond,) tells him about a one time shot at writing a song for the new, young and hot pop sensation Cora Corman (newcomer Haley Bennett). The only problem is that Fletcher has never been good with writing lyrics and has a deadline.<br/><br/>Fletcher is in his apartment working on the song when Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) shyly stumbles into his life. She is the substitute plant waterer who's been assigned to Fletcher's apartment. Her awkwardness, self-muttering and standoffishness leads Fletcher and Riley to believe she's just a little off.<br/><br/>While watering the plants throughout the living room, Fisher can't help but overhear Fletcher and his lyricist Greg Antonsky (Jason Antoon) arguing over the lyrics for the unwritten love song: ""Way Back Into Love"". Fisher starts creating her own lyrics while watering and Fletcher can't help but overhear her. He encourages her to share her ideas and is impressed with what she comes up with. Fletcher and Fisher end up working together and falling for each other while writing the song. <br/><br/>While trying to inspire words for the song, Fletcher and Fisher end up making small talk. Here's a snip from one of those conversations that got a belly shake out of me: Fletcher: The best time I've had in the last fifteen years was sitting at that piano with you. <br/><br/>Fisher: That's wonderfully sensitive... especially from a man who wears such tight pants. <br/><br/>Fletcher: It forces all the blood to my heart. <br/><br/>Fletcher and Fisher decide to ask the guy working the front desk in his apartment what he thought of the lyrics to their new song. Fletcher is in the middle of reciting a line when he has to stop for clarification:<br/><br/>Fletcher: (singing) Sleeping with a clown above my bedclown is not right.<br/><br/>Fisher: That's cloud, not clown. Why would you put a clown in your bed?<br/><br/>Fletcher: It would not be the first time. It's little lines like this that caught me off guard and kept me entertained for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a slow start that made me wish I could turn it off like a dull love song on the radio. I found myself becoming antsy and waiting for the predictable story line to pick up. Half and hour into the movie, the plot began to pickup I began to enjoy and chuckle at Fletcher's witty lines.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore plays her typical role as the awkward girl who is unsure of herself. I was often reminded of her roles as Julia in ""The Wedding Singer"" and Lucy in ""50 First Dates"". It seems as though Drew is incapable of taking on more challenging roles.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant never seems to disappoint me with that boyish, British charm. Whether or not he's not playing a creep like he did in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" his character still shines through and it makes him that much more likable.<br/><br/>The song itself, ""Way Back Into Love"", written by Adam Schlesinger, is very catchy. From first hearing the melody I was intrigued to hear the rest of the song. There are bits and pieces of it played throughout the movie, but the whole thing is finally played at the end. The melody is soft, sweet and soulful and made me want to listen to what it had to say. I found myself humming the tune on the way home from the theater. An instant classic. I also caught a few bloopers that any script supervisor should have caught. I was surprised at how they caught my attention. There is a particular café scene where the camera is looking at Barrymore head one and she has a cup in her hand. The second camera angle shows her back and the cup is mysteriously sitting on the table in front of her. Every time the camera angle changes, so does the position of the cup. Another scene at an amusement park also caught my eye. When Grant is standing backstage, Barrymore is holding an unopened bottle of water and is getting ready to hand it to him. The next angle shows him with the bottle open and in his hand. Oops.<br/><br/>The story line was a bit cliché and predictable. The awkward pair end up together despite real life and things are going really well. All of the sudden, someone's past leads up to a huge blow out and neither characters are talking to one another. Cue the sad music and scenes of the two of them moping around thinking about the other person. It's a cute movie to see on girls' night out or if you want to catch a romantic comedy with your sweetie. It's not a movie that will be winning any awards, but it will win a few smiles and maybe even a few hearts."

","When I say this movie is inept and forgettable, it is not because I'm just too intellectual to appreciate a light romantic comedy, but because this one isn't good. This is not Notting Hill, or Thirteen Going on 30; it is not even 50 First Dates. It has some good bits, and then it fizzles. Even my 7th grader, who is a big fan of the chick-flick genre, thought it ran out of steam after the first 40 minutes.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud at the beginning: The flashbacks to the '80s boy band videos, Hugh Grant as the genial has-been rocker who is content to make his living from self-parody, Haley Bennett as the pop-tart diva with pretensions to spirituality, are all pretty funny. Gotta love the bit when he finds out the battle-of-the-'80s-bands TV show he's doing requires him actually to go a couple rounds in the ring with Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Debbie Gibson, not just play music and vie for applause. And Drew Barrymore looks really pretty. Now I'm out of nice things to say about this movie.<br/><br/>Drew's loopy character wavers between appealing and irritating, and she and Grant don't have that much chemistry. The predictable bits of sitcom shtick that pass for a plot (with sitcom veterans Brad Garrett and Kristen Johnson competently performing the roles of Grant's manager and Barrymore's sister) cannot sustain interest in the question of how the two leads, once they hit a snag, are going to find their way back to being together.<br/><br/>And while the main song, the one the principals are writing together, has a nice hummable hook, the rest of the music is unconvincing. The idea of Madison Square Garden filled with sixth graders, all psyched for teen queen Haley's concert, who sit quietly beaming and swaying in time while old fart Hugh sings an Elton-John-having-a-bad-day ballad for Barrymore, instead of booing him off the stage, is too implausible for words.<br/><br/>If I hadn't gone to the theater, but had just had it on TV in the background while folding laundry, maybe I wouldn't have found it so annoying."
"hemi-equals-fast","Null","0","1","2 April 2007"," Music and Lyrics Review
","I'll be the first to admit popular culture from the 1980's never sat right with me. To be honest, it scares me a little. You can imagine my dismay then at the cheesy 80's music video which opened ""Music and Lyrics."" It had all the tell-tale signs of a bad 1980's video. There were the synthesized sounds, the bubbly lyrics, and hairstyles that probably took longer to sculpt and mold then the 96 minutes this movie lasted. I had wondered what I had gotten myself into. Luckily, as it turned out, I had ended up taking in an enjoyable movie (after the music video had ended, of course).<br/><br/>Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) has grown to accept his role as a has-been in the music industry. A member of the group ""PoP!"" during the 1980's, Fletcher currently finds himself booking gigs at state fairs and high school reunions, instead of the sold out arenas and stadiums of years past. With the help of his agent Chris Riley (Brad Garrett), however, Fletcher finds himself an opportunity to get back into the limelight through the latest young vixen in music, Cora Corman (Haley Bennett). All he has to do is write an amazing song by the end of the week. Unfortunately for Alex, he's never been too keen with lyrics.<br/><br/>Fletcher ends up finding help, but from the person he least expected. Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) is filling in as Fletcher's plant caretaker. Fisher is someone who seems to try to fit into the background, despite the fact that she talks way too much. However, among all this talking, she exhibits an ability to put words together effortlessly. Alex takes notice, and after some convincing, gets Sophie on board to help him write the song.<br/><br/>Sophie's past includes being the subject of a best selling novel written by her ex-professor and love interest, Sloan Cates (Campbell Scott). She has a hard time escaping the personal shame brought on by the book. Fletcher encourages her, saying the best way to bounce back would be to write a hit song. Their collaboration not only pleases Cora, but ignites a new flame between Alex and Sophie. Cora's vision for the song, however, just may bring out the worst in both characters. Whether or not they can find that spark again lies in Alex's hands, and words. <br/><br/>Written and directed by Marc Lawrence, whose previous works include ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Two Weeks Notice"", ""Music and Lyrics"" certainly fits the bill of a romantic comedy. The movie is funny and heartwarming, but also predictable. Two completely different characters find love, almost lose it, only to regain it with even more emotion in the end. As a viewer, you can almost guess what is going to take place in the next scene. Lawrence also seems to add more then he needed to the story. I couldn't get past the fact that Sophie Fisher just happened to be the inspiration of a best selling novel. It seemed to be forced into the plot, as an unnecessary side story. The actual plot of the movie would not be affected in one way or another if this side story was taken out.<br/><br/>Original music for ""Music and Lyrics"" was put together by Adam Schlesinger, who was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for best original song in ""That Thing You Do."" The main song of the movie, which is written by Schlesinger, is Alex and Sophie's collaboration ""Way Back Into Love."" With lyrics such as ""All I want to do is find a way back into love / I can't make it through without a way back into love / And if I open my heart again / I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end,"" one can certainly expect Alex and Sophie to feel the same emotions.<br/><br/>Despite some predictable writing, both Grant and Barrymore make their characters work. Grant, who learned to sing, dance, and play piano for ""Music and Lyrics"", creates an extremely likable character with more then enough charm and wit. Barrymore is able to bring out the small details in Sophie Fisher's character that make her unique. She can turn a character who isn't supposed to stick out into an intriguing individual you can't wait to learn more about.<br/><br/>All and all, ""Music and Lyrics"" is an enjoyable movie experience. The rating for ""Music and Lyrics"" is PG-13 for sexual content (it is very mild, however). So go ahead and take the kids if you want, or enjoy with a significant other.

","Few actors have done as many romantic comedies, not to mention highly successful romantic comedies, as Hugh Grant. So he's on solid ground in this story of a faded 1980s Pop star, Alex Fletcher, who gets a chance to revive his fortunes by writing a special love song for teen sensation Cora Corman (Haley Bennett).<br/><br/>Alex, as a member of a Wham-like pop group named PoP, was Cora's childhood idol. Corathink of Britney Spears or Shakira with a Buddhism fetish has it in her head that Alex can write the perfect duet for the two of them to perform at Madison Square Garden. Problem is she wants it in a week, and Alex never wrote any lyrics.<br/><br/>Alex is also down and out. He's still making money from his royalties, but performances are now confined to county fairs and high school reunions, and even some of those cancel on him. But he's still content with himself, happy to be working, resigned to his pleasant, unambitious Southern California existence.<br/><br/>Loyal agent Chris, played by Brad Garret of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fame, encourages Alex to find a lyricist and come up with a song for Cora. It will be a big pay day and who knows, maybe Alex's career can be rekindled in a new direction. The two men are best of friends, and the dialog between them is rife with wit and wry.<br/><br/>Enter Sophie (Drew Barrymore), Alex's replacement plant lady who conveniently has a knack for writing lyrics. The story proceeds entertainingly from there, at least as far as I'm concerned. (A little more than half of the critics I read just rip the entire enterprise from director to third assistant gripper. They may need to manage their expectations better.) A romantic comedy is almost necessarily carried forward as a ""formula,"" because virtually every movie where 'boy meets girl and eventually they hook up' follows a set pattern. What you look for then as a moviegoer are the subtleties of behavior and chemistry among the characters, intelligent writing, and, well, good acting.<br/><br/>From a comic perspective, I think Hugh Grant has about the best timing out there. And Drew Barrymore as Sophie does a fine job getting into the rhythm. I'll give you two quotes from their dialog, which I assure you will give you a grin or a guffaw coming off the screen: ....<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2007"

","I thought Hugh Grant was actually kind of on a roll with ""About a Boy"" and ""Love Actually."" Granted, he was given able assists in both films by his fellow cast members, especially in the latter-named film, since that was such an ensemble piece, but his rolling ball comes to a grinding halt in this woefully undercooked little film. Maybe the smaller cast is part of the problem--Grant and Drew Barrymore carry most of the film by themselves--but the biggest problem seems to lie with the screenplay: neither of the two main characters, much less the secondary ones, feels fully fleshed out, fully believable, or fully engaging for the viewer. To the two stars' credit, I kept wanting to care deeply about their characters much more than I was ever actually able to. There are some amusing one-liners, particularly from Grant during the first twenty minutes or so, but mostly Grant and Barrymore are just left to haul out their individual reserves of stock mannerisms and their own patented styles of line delivery we've seen and heard a thousand times before. There's nothing new, nothing surprising, and nobody stretches even a little. At any point in the film, you can predict the next ten or fifteen plot developments, and, as long as you don't use any imagination or creativity but just stick to the totally obvious, you're guaranteed to be dead on.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, Brad Garrett as Grant's agent has virtually nothing to do of any interest, though, in the being-thankful-for-small-favors department, he's not as obnoxiously cartoonish as he was in ""The Pacifier."" Kristen Johnston struggles valiantly to make something interesting out of the role of Barrymore's sister--a noble effort, but one doomed from the start. Campbell Scott, in a brief cameo, offers yet another variation on the arrogant assholish character that seems to be his forte. And Haley Bennett--apparently intended to be a side-splitting parody of bubble-headed female pop-rock icons--is so vacuous she barely registers. You tend to forget about her even when she's the only person on screen.<br/><br/>The movie isn't unbearable, and I suppose it might be a reasonably amiable time waster for late-night or rainy afternoon cable TV viewing, but I'd recommend trying to think of something else to do first."

","Music and Lyrics I had low intention on seeing this movie, but because of this premier release in Netherlands, and because it had Hugh Grant  I got inclined.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays an aging pop star with middle aged women's fan following, and waiting for a big break, which is provided by Cora Corman (in silly characterization of a eastern spiritual music icon)  who asks Hugh to write lyrics for her new stage song; and Hugh Grant takes the help of her watering the plants lady  Drew Barrymore to inspire and write lyrics. In turn Hugh and Drew fall in love, as usual there is a misunderstanding that inspires Hugh to write his original lyrics (which was pathetic) for Drew, which he sings on the last stage performance to get Drew back.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is getting and looking haggard and middle aged, but still emits enough charm to act his way through the movie with his style. Drew Barrymore gives a good performance as an open, lively and messy young girl. The music and lyrics of the movie are a big let down, both do not have a touch of immortality in them, and would be forgotten with the movie  could have been better, especially when the name of the movie is ""Music and Lyrics"".<br/><br/>This is the second movie (first was Bobby) in recent time I have seen where the eastern spirituality angle is shown in poor light through weird characters who are interested in it. I being an Indian, it is a bit sad to see this depiction. May be it was because the director Marc Lawrence had some hangover of his ""Miss Congeniality"" series of comedy take on things.<br/><br/>It is an entertaining film  especially for those who like Hugh Grant type of romantic stuff.<br/><br/>(Stars 5 out of 10)"

","One of the better Hugh Grant films, this frothy romp entertains without hitting any great heights.The synopsis of the plot is ;fading Eighties pop star and tune smith chances upon a lyricist/assistant plant waterer,they write a hit song and fall in love. And ,err, that really is about it.<br/><br/>Grant and Barrymore never truly convince as a love match whilst offering solid performances. Grant does deliver a credible pastiche as a washed up fading pop star which teeters occasionally at parodying his own fragile status as an A list film star.<br/><br/>The opening ""Eighties"" video is great fun and well executed, and dare I say it, nostalgic! The music throughout is true to the vintage - and pretty passable. Grant and Barrymore are credited with singing their own songs. But the huge giveaway is that Martin fry , of eighties ""ABC"" fame is credited with ""additional vocals"". I strongly suspect that he multi-tracked Grants vocals. Although Schlessinger, whose credentials I am unaware of, is credited with the music, i detect a strong Fry input into the end result.<br/><br/>At 104 minutes the film is probably 15 to 20 minutes overlong. A scene where Barrymore meets her ex lover in a restaurant fails badly and smacks of ""filler"". Speaking of which her make up in the same scene looks as though it has been done by a thirteen year old further damaging a flawed set piece.<br/><br/>Two supporting characters, those of Barrymore's film sister, and Cora, the Britney/Christina clone who commissions the song, excel and do much to assist a good, but limited , concept."

","""Music and Lyrics"" is a feel-good, boy-meets-girl, romantic-comedy with a good dash of dry British wit to hold everything together.<br/><br/>This isn't the kind of movie I like. It does not have important ideas ensconced in complex thinking. It doesn't have great actors saying important things. It doesn't have exciting drama and complex thought provoking plot twists. But, God bless the people who have a good time watching this movie and capture some happiness in its 96 minutes. On some levels, they'll probably get more out of life than I will.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are good choices for this film. Their personalities are perfect for their characters. The other characters in the movie are fun to watch and make the film more interesting. And, I'll admit, the social commentary about popular music and the arts  well, it made me think for about a minute."

","Hugh Grant. Ah, Hugh. The closeups are not kind. As an 80's pop singer now crooning to fairs and minor festivals, he's not for one minute believable. But as Hugh portraying another rather quirky, self-effacing and well-rehearsed character, he's fine. Few of us look to Mr. Grant to expand his film repertoire. We're perfectly happy to see him gingerly step into film after film with the same delivery, same expressions and same good comic timing. He is himself an art form. Lately I've seen comparisons to Cary Grant (by other published writers). Hmm.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore. Again, more of the same. But this time she's showing uncomfortable lapses of charm. Or is it that I'm growing weary of her roles more quickly than with Mr. Grant? She has lapses into annoying stretches that may continue an amazing 5-10 minutes. And that's uncomfortable indeed in a film. Writer? Director? Or boredom on the part of the actor? But as for plot, this is one film for which a spoiler is not possible. We all know going in what will happen. How it happens is irrelevant. One look at a poster and one scan of the title - we know it all. Haley Bennett as Cora, the pop mega-star, nearly pulls the rug out from under our stars in several scenes. She, anyway, has some modicum of unrecycled life.<br/><br/>I will acknowledge that many fans of these two actors might be tempted to rate this higher, perhaps 6 or 7. So if you're incorrigible, go for it. The ending may make you forget tedious moments in between. Enjoy."

","I you expect remotely anything like a Four Weddings/Nottinghill quality film, don't go an see this as you will be sadly disappointed. I was not expecting much (what can you expect from a romantic comedy with these two actors in it). Worth watching on TV on a Sunday afternoon but thats about as good as it gets. There are a few laughs but plot line is more predicable that you could possibly imagine. Whoever said this is Hugh Grant in a different role to his normal typecasting was having a laugh, I have not seen him be more 'Hugh grant like'in ages. One piece of advise through if you are enjoying the film do not leave the cinema too early as you will miss some of the gags at the very end."

","Well he needs a pat on the back for taking on such a roll. Mr. Grant is not M. Jackson, but he does do a lot for the film. This movie is different to say the least, but it is a good movie. Yes every one here is a little OFF BASE, but the movie has a good point, and brings it straight to the viewer. I do believe that the movie could have been shot better, but that's another review, this one is only about you going to see the film. This movie moves along well and just that scores a lot of points with me. Everyone in this film does a good job, and especially the young lady singer. She I'm sure is headed for better and bigger parts. Hugh is just the Man when it comes to putting on the Dog. He's is by far Tops in just about everyone's book. Go see this movie. You will leave the place feeling better than when you walked in, and that my friends is what a movie should do for you. Regards, HK"

","What if a comically washed-up 80's pop star and an aimless, flaky 30-something hooked up and tried to make something of the rest of their lives? I know, I had my doubts, too.<br/><br/>Somehow 'Music and Lyrics,' is just engaging enough a chick-flick to keep you conscious assuming you've brought a date.<br/><br/>In fairness, a couple scenes are downright inspired -- particularly the opening in which we see a supposedly younger Hugh Grant bopping around an oversaturated 80's-style music video with fellow ""musicians"" in a fictional 1980's hair-band which seems a cross between 'Wham!' and 'Duran Duran.'<br/><br/>Dang amusing. Especially for those of us who were teen-aged fans of similar silliness way back when.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant as Alex Fletcher again plays himself as the boyish big-shot Brit with silver tongue, impeccable manner, but appallingly nihilist behavior. Women are never more pleased to be screwed over entirely than when it's Grant turning the screw.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore's our 30-something aimless girl, Sophie Fisher, who appears out of nowhere shortly into the film to water Fletcher's plants. Fletcher's got a shot at avoiding further humiliation by writing a hit song for a Brittney-Spears-like pop star, but he's having trouble writing the lyrics -- he's a melody man. Fisher's got a small talent for rhyming phrases, so of course Fletcher hires her on the spot.<br/><br/>In a series of scenes veering from the contrived to the almost- amusing, they learn about each other's sordid past, make love, write sophomoric lyrics, sing unmemorable melodies and end up selling their tune to the Spears-like pop-queen who proceeds to ruin it with heavy bass and writhing dance numbers.<br/><br/>In one plot turn that constituted this film's one shot for substantive character interplay, we learn Fisher was the inspiration for a fictional character her college professor wrote about in his best-selling novel and it's not a flattering portrayal. She promises Fletcher the story's unfair and that the professor was a lecherous cretin who used her and demolished her sense of self worth.<br/><br/>Of course within 48 hours they all happen to be dining at the same restaurant and Fletcher encourages her to confront him and reclaim her dignity. Campbell Scott plays the professor-turned-author. Scott's contribution to David Mamet's 'The Spanish Prisoner' is near legendary in sophistication and understatement so he is perfectly cast. In the face of Scott's imposing gravitas, Barrymore's Fisher is utterly helpless and we learn later the professor's characterization of Fisher's flaws may not have been entirely off-base.<br/><br/>But is this explored? Of course not! We've got way too much chick-flick tear-jerking to do! That whole plot-line is dropped and what a disappointment. No just-desserts for the professor. No unveiling of a darker side to Fisher. Just prat-falls and dippy dialogue.<br/><br/>Naturally, Fisher wants Fletcher to stand up to the pop-queen for ruining their tune and Fletcher wants to cash out and sides with the professor by way of forcing the issue. The rest is the standard chorus-line of absurdly unlikely happenstance and motivations that only occur in the movies. They dance us inevitably toward the standard predictable ending.<br/><br/>So why was I smiling at the end? Grants' laser-sharp one-liners and the few scenes that worked.<br/><br/>Plus my date was happy and I was happy she was happy.<br/><br/>I guess chick-flicks are good for something.<br/><br/>This review by Erik Gloor"

","MUSIC AND LYRICS (2007) **1/2 Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Brad Garrett, Kristen Johnston, Haley Bennett. Frequently amusing rom-com with Grant as a has-been '80s pop music star attempting a comeback by penning a hit song for a current sensation (Bennett) who enlists the unlikely help of his plant caretaker (!) Barrymore, whose way with words prove to be magical. Fine chemistry between the comedic leads with fine throw-away lines delivered by Grant and Barrymore's adeptness at physical comedy make a good combo but ultimately the third act of writer-director Marc Lawrence falters into predictability. Fun for a while at any rate."
"freebird-64","5","0","1","18 February 2007"," No real sparks between Hugh and Drew
","At the early part of the film I thought I would be able to rate it as entertaining but disposable. But then as the film went on it just got more and more dull, with only a few sporadic laughs to keep it watchable.<br/><br/>The basic problem with this film is that a comedy like this, which does not have an inherently comedic premise, needs well-defined characters and good plotting, neither of which the film has. Both Hugh Grant (Alex) and Drew Barrymore (Sophie) are thus forced to fall back on their default personas: Hugh with his self-depreciating humor laced with the caddishness he developed for the Bridget Jones movies while Drew once again plays the flaky girlfriend.<br/><br/>Since there's no real tension between the two, particularly when they're struggling to write the song that will possibly resurrect Alex's career, there's no real comedy. If these scenes are watchable at all, its only because the two actors playing them are so charming.<br/><br/>As a side note, is it supposed to be a bad joke that Kirsten Johnson, who looks on the heavy side in this film, is supposed to be running a company that sells weight loss products?"

","I wouldn't say that the movie was bad by any means, but I don't think that I would watch it again. It felt long and a little awkward. Most of the jokes were funny, but they all seemed to be one liners and didn't really contribute to the film as a whole. While Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were certainly interesting to watch on screen, I felt that they lacked any real chemistry. Perhaps it was merely the awkwardness of the characters, but I failed to see any believable passion between the two . Kristen Johnston's character was not utilized fully. They only scratched the surface of the comedic potential that both Johnston and her character offered the movie. She still managed to get some laughs, but it felt like she was cut off before she really hit her stride. My recommendation would be to wait until the movie comes out on DVD and then rent it."

Though Hugh's character is a bit more subdued than we often see from him,, with no hint of the lovable jerk he has done so well in other films, understatement suits both the character and the older, more seasoned actor. Younger viewers will find the film engaging, but those old enough to really remember the 80's will really appreciate it. You have to have ""been there"" to appreciate how well the film captures the sound, look, and feel of the VH1 era Pop Band and early music videos. And who knew that Hugh could sing?"

Well this movie gives us incite into the highly competitive music business. Hugh and Drew are delightful together and seem to bounce back and forth on each others energy.

Drew Barrimore is the usual Drew too, slightly wacky, an unsuspected genius, in true Hollywood style.<br/><br/>The plot is utterly, utterly, utterly predictable, boy meets girl, loses girl etc., but so what? What makes this work is the machine gun rate of one liners. Probably a film that works best with those who lived and loved the '80s music scene, as some of the fun is the attention to detail. The songs work well, the pastiche opening blend of Ahah!, Duran Duran, Wham! Spandau Ballet videos sets the whole thing up. The whole thing reeks of cheddar, but it is so knowing that this can be forgiven: it was such a pleasure to be in a cinema full of laughing people, a genuine feel good movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast works well, the gorgeous Halley Bennett plays a spaced out pop star, Kristen Johnston (Third Rock from the Sun) the sassy sister with a crush on Hugh - and her own personal supply of put downs being the most notable.<br/><br/>So, go with low expectations, a relaxed attitude and you will be hard put not to enjoy it.
